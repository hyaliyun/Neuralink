Write some highlights for the following article: By. Harry Mount. PUBLISHED:. 19:15 EST, 17 November 2013. |. UPDATED:. 04:29 EST, 18 November 2013. Doris Lessing, the grand old lady of letters who has died at 94, lived long enough to turn against practically all the strongly held convictions of her youth. An avid Communist in her younger days, she later rejected not just communism but feminism and political correctness, too. Still, though, she retained some shocking political thoughts. Days after the attack on the World Trade Centre in 2001, she was belittling the act of terrorism, saying: ‘It was neither as terrible nor as extraordinary as the Americans think.’ Some years earlier, Englishmen were in her sights. In her 1962 feminist classic novel, The Golden Notebook, she attacked their uselessness, particularly their inability to satisfy their wives sexually. But, despite her scorn, it was to England that she came, from colonial Rhodesia — now Zimbabwe — more than 60 years ago, settling into a gloriously ramshackle, tall, slim house in London’s West Hampstead. Titan: Writer Doris Lessing, pictured in 2006, has died peacefully aged 94 at her home in London. She derided literary prizes, but scooped them all including, in 2007, the Nobel Prize. At 88, she was the oldest woman ever to win it and only the 11th woman to receive the award. Her triumph came as no surprise to a woman formidably confident in her own intellectual abilities. While the Swedish Academy praised Lessing for her ‘scepticism, fire and visionary power,’ when informed about winning the prize, the writer responded: ‘Oh Christ! . . . I couldn’t care less.’ But she later said: ‘I’ve won all the prizes in Europe, every bloody one. So I’m delighted to win them all. It’s a royal flush.’ Born Doris Tayler in 1919 in Persia (now Iran), she moved as a child with her British family to Southern Rhodesia. Her father, who lost a leg in World War I, ran a rundown maize farm, where he was looked after by an increasingly desperate wife, a former nurse, whom the young Doris was at odds with from earliest childhood. Her mother was refined, cold and unemotional, always beautifully dressed and more interested in perfectly polished silver and whether the piano was in tune than in Doris and her brother. ‘I have sacrificed myself to my children,’ she would complain in their hearing. Still, it was her mother who helped to forge Lessing’s extraordinary literary career, shipping huge parcels of books from England for her daughter. Recognition: Lessing who was born in Persia - now Iran - was awarded the Nobel Prize aged 88 in 2007. She was the oldest woman ever to win it. ‘I was never educated, you see,’ said Lessing, who left convent school at 14. ‘Without the books, I would have come to grief.’ Determined to escape what she described as a stifling, provincial, expat world, she entered a doomed marriage to Frank Wisdom, a civil servant ten years her senior. She was only 19 and it was the eve of World War II. ‘Everyone got married,’ she explained. A fter less than five years and with two children, John and Jean, the marriage came to an end. Rather than subject the boy and girl to the cool neglect she had suffered from her own mother, she decided it would be preferable if she abandoned them, leaving their father to bring them up. In due course, in 1944, she married a German internee, Gottfried Lessing, and had another child. That marriage, too, failed after five years. In 1949, she fled to London with her youngest son. Honor: Lessing shows off her Nobel Prize. She responded to the accolade by saying 'I couldn't care less' Lessing later said: ‘I’m very proud of myself that I had the guts to do it. I’ve always said that if I hadn’t left that life, the intolerable boredom of colonial circles, I’d have cracked up and become an alcoholic or had a mental breakdown.’ Such callousness was hard to forgive. Her older son, John, later told her: ‘I understand why you left, but it doesn’t mean I forgive you for it.’ Just as the Cold War began, Lessing joined the Communist Party, but later came to see that it had been a mistake. ‘We believed this rubbish, absolutely. But I think there is something about politics that makes people mad, really.’ Whatever the shortcomings of her political and private life, she was undeniably a literary titan. Controversial: Doris Lessing's novel The Golden Notebook has been hailed as a classic feminist text. The Grass Is Singing, her 1950 debut novel about the racism of white colonials in Forties Rhodesia, was a sensation. A tide of novels, poems, operas, autobiographies and short stories followed. Over 60 years she published almost 60 books. They were not all rapturously received. After she won the Nobel Prize, the acerbic American literary critic Harold Bloom said: ‘Although Ms Lessing at the beginning of her writing career had a few admirable qualities, I find her work for the past 15 years quite unreadable . . . fourth-rate science fiction.’ Those early, admirable qualities were most in evidence in her controversial novel The Golden Notebook. Explaining its genesis, she said: ‘I had been listening to women talk about women’s issues and about men. Suddenly when I wrote down these private conversations, people were astounded. It was as though what women said didn’t exist until it was written.’ The sexually graphic book tells the story of Anna Wulf, a deeply frustrated woman at the dawn of the sexual revolution and women’s liberation movement. It is unremitting in its detail. It deals candidly with menstruation, the female orgasm and men’s sexual shortcomings. Lessing called England a country ‘full of men who are little boys and homosexuals and half-homosexuals’. She made it clear that she thought that public boarding schools had a lot to answer for. The Golden Notebook was widely venerated by feminists and declared ‘the Bible of the women’s movement’, though Lessing refused to become a feminist poster girl. She said: ‘What I really can’t stand about the feminist revolution is that it produced some of the smuggest, most unself-critical people the world has ever seen. They are horrible.’ Indeed, in the introduction for a 1993 reissue of The Golden Notebook, she said it was not a ‘trumpet for women’s liberation’. ‘I think a lot of romanticising has gone on with the women’s movement,’ she said a few years ago. ‘Whatever type of behaviour women are coming up with, it’s claimed as a victory for feminism — doesn’t matter how bad it is. We don’t seem to go in very much for self-criticism.’ And she told the Edinburgh book festival that modern men were ‘cowed’ by women. ‘They can’t fight back,’ she said. ‘And it’s time they did.’ Return: Lessing's novel was reissued in 1993 - a move called a 'trumpet for women's liberation' Lessing wrote her later works from a messy, chaotic home in Hampstead, North London, with worn-out carpets — more student digs than elegant literary salon. Her black and white cat Yum Yum (named after a character in Gilbert and Sullivan’s light opera The Mikado) would keep her company. So fond was she of her various cats that she wrote three books about them. She was desperate to escape categorisation as a particular kind of writer. Lessing noted that over the years she had been given ‘every conceivable label’ — starting off as a writer about the colour bar, then a Communist, then a feminist, then a mystic. The mystic label came about because of her interest in later life in Sufism, a form of Islamic mysticism. She saw herself as none of these things, but as a storyteller. ‘Just being a writer was the thing,’ she told this newspaper when she was in her 70s. ‘For me, it still is.’","completion":"1.

Plot title: Thank You for Smoking Movie plot: Nick Naylor is a handsome, smooth-talking tobacco lobbyist and the vice-president of a tobacco lobby called the \\"Academy of Tobacco Studies\\", which for 15 years has been \\"researching\\" the link between tobacco smoking and lung cancer. They claim that their researchâfunded primarily by tobacco companiesâhas found no definitive evidence of any linkage. Naylor's job consists mainly of reporting the questionable research of the \\"Academy\\" to the public and defending Big Tobacco on television programs by questioning opposing health claims and advocating personal choice. Naylor and his friends, firearm lobbyist Bobby Jay Bliss and alcohol lobbyist Polly Bailey, meet every week and jokingly call themselves the \\"Merchants of Death\\" or \\"The MOD Squad\\". As anti-tobacco campaigns mount and numbers of young smokers decline, Naylor suggests that product placement of cigarettes could once again boost cigarette sales. Naylor's boss, BR, sends Naylor to Los Angeles to bargain for cigarette placement in upcoming movies. Naylor takes along his young son Joey in hopes of bonding with him. The next day, Naylor is sent to meet with Lorne Lutch, the cancer-stricken man who once played the Marlboro Man in cigarette ads and is now campaigning against cigarettes. As his son watches, Naylor successfully offers Lutch a suitcase of money for his silence. During the drive back, Nick and Joey discuss the beauty of argument. Senator Finistirre, one of Naylor's most vehement critics, is the promoter of a bill to add a skull and crossbones POISON warning to cigarette packaging. During a televised debate with Finistirre, Naylor receives a death threat from a caller. Despite the threat, Naylor still plans to appear before a U.S. Senate committee to fight Finistirre's bill.

Background: In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops. Paragraph: Dan studied genetic engineering. He was applying his knowledge of genetic engineering to develop better crops. Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which crop would be more beneficial to farmers, crop A or crop B? Answer:","completion":"Crop A would be more beneficial to farmers, as it has been genetically engineered to be herbicide tolerant. This means that it can better withstand the effects of herbicides, allowing for improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops. The introduction of herbicide-tolerant crops like crop A has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, ultimately increasing crop yield. In contrast, crop B is not tolerant of herbicides, and may suffer damage and reduced yield when herbicides are used for weed control. Therefore, crop A is the better option for farmers looking to optimize weed management and boost their crop production."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Input: BACKGROUND Population-based estimates of prevalence, risk distribution, and intervention uptake inform delivery of control programmes for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). We undertook the third National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal-3) after implementation of national sexual health strategies, and describe the epidemiology of four STIs in Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales) and the uptake of interventions. METHODS Between Sept 6, 2010 and Aug 31, 2012 , we did a probability sample survey of 15,162 women and men aged 16-74 years in Britain. Participants were interviewed with computer-assisted face-to-face and self-completion questionnaires. Urine from a sample of participants aged 16-44 years who reported at least one sexual partner over the lifetime was tested for the presence of Chlamydia trachomatis, type-specific human papillomavirus (HPV), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and HIV antibody. We describe age-specific and sex-specific prevalences of infection and intervention uptake, in relation to demographic and behavioural factors, and explore changes since Natsal-1 (1990-91) and Natsal-2 (1999-2001). FINDINGS Of 8047 eligible participants invited to provide a urine sample, 4828 (60%) agreed. We excluded 278 samples, leaving 4550 (94%) participants with STI test results. Chlamydia prevalence was 1·5% (95% CI 1·1-2·0) in women and 1·1% (0·7-1·6) in men. Prevalences in individuals aged 16-24 years were 3·1% (2·2-4·3) in women and 2·3% (1·5-3·4) in men. Area-level deprivation and higher numbers of partners, especially without use of condoms, were risk factors. However, 60·4% (45·5-73·7) of chlamydia in women and 43·3% (25·9-62·5) in men was in individuals who had had one partner in the past year. Among sexually active 16-24-year-olds, 54·2% (51·4-56·9) of women and 34·6% (31·8-37·4) of men reported testing for chlamydia in the past year, with testing higher in those with more partners. High-risk HPV was detected in 15·9% (14·4-17·5) of women, similar to in Natsal-2. Coverage of HPV catch-up vaccination was 61·5% (58·2-64·7). Prevalence of HPV types 16 and 18 in women aged 18-20 years was lower in Natsal-3 than Natsal-2 (5·8% [3·9-8·6] vs 11·3% [6·8-18·2]; age-adjusted odds ratio 0·44 [0·21-0·94]). Gonorrhoea (<0·1% prevalence in women and men) and HIV (0·1% prevalence in women and 0·2% in men) were uncommon and restricted to participants with recognised high-risk factors. Since Natsal-2, substantial increases were noted in attendance at sexual health clinics (from 6·7% to 21·4% in women and from 7·7% to 19·6% in men) and HIV testing (from 8·7% to 27·6% in women and from 9·2% to 16·9% in men) in the past 5 years. INTERPRETATION STIs were distributed heterogeneously, requiring general and infection-specific interventions. Increases in testing and attendance at sexual health clinics, especially in people at highest risk, are encouraging. However, STIs persist both in individuals accessing and those not accessing services. Our findings provide empirical evidence to inform future sexual health interventions and services.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Al Sharpton and the George Zimmerman Controversy: A Call for Justice Introduction: The tragic shooting of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman in 2012 shook the city of Sanford, Florida. The case quickly became a touchstone in the nation's ongoing conversation about race, gun control, and self-defense. The incident has drawn extensive media attention, public demonstrations, and even the intervention of high-profile figures such as civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton. Al Sharpton Leads the Charge: Reverend Al Sharpton, a renowned civil rights activist and television personality, led the charge for justice by calling for the arrest of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who shot and killed Martin. He organized a series of rallies demanding the arrest and trial of Zimmerman, accusing the police of racial bias in their handling of the case. Police Chief Resignation: Sharpton's activism and the national outcry over the handling of the case resulted in the resignation of Sanford Police Chief, Bill Lee Jr. Lee faced widespread criticism for his department's initial handling of the case, which included not arresting Zimmerman immediately after the shooting. Following public protests and calls for his firing, the Police Chief temporary stepped down from his position in March 2012, before ultimately resigning in June later that year. Investigating Officer's Controversial Past: The investigation of the Trayvon Martin shooting was led by Officer Anthony Raimondo, who was also at the center of a separate racially charged incident where a white teenager, Justin Collison, was caught on video assaulting a black homeless man. Despite the video evidence, Collison did not face any immediate criminal charges, leading to accusations of racism and preferential treatment by the police department. The lack of action in both cases fueled public distrust in the Sanford Police Department's ability to fairly investigate cases, particularly those involving racial tensions. Public Reaction: The killing of Trayvon Martin and initial lack of legal consequences for Zimmerman ignited a firestorm of controversy and national media attention. Many saw the case as emblematic of racial bias in the American criminal justice system. The Justice for Trayvon Martin movement, joined by Al Sharpton and thousands of people across the country, demanded that Zimmerman be held accountable for his actions. Conclusion: The Trayvon Martin case exposed deep-seated racial tensions in the United States and raised critical questions about the fairness of our legal system. Through the efforts of Al Sharpton and countless other activists, the case sparked a massive outcry that led to changes in Sanford's police leadership, the eventual trial of George Zimmerman, and a renewed focus on the pervasive issue of racial profiling. Despite the progress, we must continue to address these issues to ensure that justice is served for all citizens, regardless of their race or background."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Cannibal Holocaust Movie plot: In 1979, an American film crew disappears in the Amazon rainforest while on an expedition to film a documentary about indigenous cannibal tribes. The team consists of Alan Yates, the director; Faye Daniels, his girlfriend and script girl; and two cameramen, Jack Anders and Mark Tomaso. Harold Monroe, an anthropologist at New York University, agrees to lead a rescue team in hopes of finding the missing filmmakers alive. In anticipation of his arrival, the military conducts a raid on a local tribe known as the Yacumo and takes a young Yacumo male hostage in order to help negotiate with the natives. Monroe flies in via floatplane and is introduced to his guides, Chaco and his assistant, Miguel. After several days of trekking through the jungle, the group encounters the Yacumo tribe. They arrange the release of their hostage in exchange for being taken to the Yacumo village. Once there, the group initially meets hostility and learns that the film team had caused great unrest among the people. The next day, Monroe and his guides head deeper into the rainforest to locate two warring cannibal tribes, the YaÌ§nomamÃ¶ and the Shamatari. They encounter a group of Shamatari warriors and follow them to a riverbank where they save a smaller group of YaÌ§nomamÃ¶ from certain death. Grateful, the YaÌ§nomamÃ¶ invite Monroe and his team back to their village, yet they treat the outsiders with suspicion. To gain their trust, Monroe bathes naked in a river. A group of friendly YaÌ§nomamÃ¶ women emerge to join him and playfully bathe with him. After, they take him to a shrine where he discovers the rotting remains of the missing American filmmakers. Upset and angered, Monroe decides it is of utmost importance to recover the films. He confronts the YaÌ§nomamÃ¶, during which time he plays a tape recorder of tribal music for them.

Former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis will forever have a presence at Grand Central Terminal in New York City following the opening of an entrance named in her honor on Monday. The entrance at Park Avenue and East 42nd Street is a tribute to Kennedy’s important role in fighting to save the station in the 1970s when plans were at an advanced stage to build a 53-story tower built atop the iconic structure. The newly renovated entrance has being named the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Foyer and features a large plaque bronze relief of Onassis and a description of her role in saving the terminal. Jackie Onassis, pictured in 1977, stands beside a huge photo of Grand Central Station during a news conference by the Committee To Save Grand Central, to plead that the terminal be spared demolition. People walk past a plaque of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis after a ceremony on Monday to dedicate Grand Central Terminal's renovated main entry vestibule in memory of the former first lady. Her efforts led to the U.S. Supreme Court upholding the city's Landmark Law in 1978 and saving the station from having its facade and Man Waiting Room destroyed. The Beaux-Arts train terminal first opened in 1913 and by 1947, over 65 million people - the equivalent of 40 percent of the population of the United States - were traveling through it each year. Soon after the railroads fell into a major decline with competition from government subsidized highways and intercity airline traffic. In 1954, a plan was floated - then quickly abandoned - to replace the station with an 80-story structure taller than the Empire State Building. Kennedy's efforts led to the U.S. Supreme Court upholding the city's Landmark Law in 1978 and saving the station from having its facade and Man Waiting Room destroyed. 'Is it not cruel to let our city die by. degrees, stripped of all her proud monuments, until there will be. nothing left of all her history and beauty to inspire our children?'- Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, 1975. The New York Central Railroad continued to dramatically decline and in 1968, plans were unveiled for a Marcel Breuer-designed tower to be built over Grand Central. The terminal had originally been designed to support a tower above it and Breuer’s design would have utilized the existing tower support structure but wouldn’t have preserved the facade or the Main Waiting Room. The plans drew huge opposition, particularly as the orate Pennsylvania Station had been demolished in 1964 despite pleas to preserve it. One of the most prominent supporters of the campaign to save Grand Central was Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Her efforts included a handwritten letter in 1975 urging then Mayor Abe Beame not to give up in a court battle to defeat the development plan. The newly renovated entrance has being named the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Foyer and features a large plaque bronze relief of Onassis and a description of her role in saving the terminal. The Beaux-Arts train terminal first opened in 1913 and by 1947, over 65 million people - the equivalent of 40 percent of the population of the United States - were traveling through it each year. ‘Is it not cruel to let our city die by degrees, stripped of all her proud monuments, until there will be nothing left of all her history and beauty to inspire our children? If they are not inspired by the past of our city, where will they find the strength to fight for her future?,’ she wrote. ‘Americans care about their past, but for short term gain they ignore it and tear down everything that matters. Maybe… this is the time to take a stand, to reverse the tide, so that we won't all end up in a uniform world of steel and glass boxes.’ Beame announced that the city would fight to save Grand Central and six months prior to the unveiling of the. Breuer plans, the New York City Landmarks Preservation. Commission designated the station a 'landmark.' In 1978, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the city Landmarks Law, which had been challenged by developers. Former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis will forever have a presence at Grand Central Terminal in New York City following the opening of an entrance named in her honor on Monday. In 2011, travel magazine Travel + Leisure rated Grand Central the sixth-most-visited tourist attraction for its roughly 21.6 million annual visitors. The landmark case was the first time that the Supreme Court ruled on a matter of historic preservation. 'Mrs. Onassis is one of America's most cherished historical figures and she is considered by many a renowned savior of Grand Central,' Metro-North Railroad President Joseph Giulietti said. 'This landmark building, universally acclaimed as one of the world's great public spaces, is still here today because of her leadership.'

Your task is to classify whether the given title is suitable or not for the research paper based on the given paragraph. Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\". Paragraph: Polioviruses with a G64S mutation in the 3D polymerase have enhanced replication fidelity and are attenuated in animal models. Here we describe the mouse virulence properties of high replication fidelity 3D polymerase variants of human enterovirus 71 (HEV71), with mutations at positions 3D-S264L, 3D-G64R or at 3D-S264L plus 3D-G64R. Mouse-adapted strains (MP-G64R, MP-S264L and MP-S264L-G64R) were constructed in order to compare the virulence of the 3D polymerase variants with that of mouse-adapted parental virus (MP-26M). MP-S264L and MP-S264L-G64R were attenuated in mice (mean survival time 7.0 and 7.5 days p.i., respectively) compared to MP-G64R and MP-26M (mean survival time 6.5 and 6.0 days p.i., respectively). MP-26M and MP-G64R infection induced early onset, severe generalised necrotising myositis, whereas MP-S264L and MP-S264L-G64R infection induced a later onset, mild and focal skeletal muscle myositis. Our findings demonstrate that only the 3D-S264L mutation attenuates HEV71 in mice, suggesting that the high replication fidelity phenotype is not essential for virulence attenuation in this model. Title: A study of the virulence in mice of high copying fidelity variants of human enterovirus 71","completion":"To come up with the answer, I carefully analyzed the given paragraph and compared it with the provided title. The paragraph discusses the virulence properties of 3D polymerase variants of human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) in mice. It involves comparing the survival times of mice infected with different strains of HEV71 and the type of muscle inflammation induced by the infections. The title, \\"A study of the virulence in mice of high copying fidelity variants of human enterovirus 71,\\" accurately represents the content of the paragraph, as it clearly mentions studying virulence in mice of high replication fidelity 3D polymerase variants of HEV71.

Q:This article: George Frederic Watts was born in 1817, the son of a London musical instrument manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.In 1843 Watts travelled to Italy where he remained for four years. On his return to London he suffered from melancholia, and painted many notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded, and in 1867 he was elected to the Royal Academy, at the time the highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with its culture. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world. In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at Little Holland House, which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who decided to devote themselves to portrait painting in 1856?, what is it ?

Options: - race track - new jersey - usa - england - city Answer:","completion":"Based on the context provided, the most likely answer in line with common sense is that they were in New Jersey, USA. The mention of a motorway, a turnpike, and MTV's famous shore, all point towards New Jersey being the most appropriate choice among the options provided. New Jersey is home to the Garden State Parkway, a notable motorway in the United States, as well as the New Jersey Turnpike, which are both major highways in the state. Additionally, MTV's reality television show \\"Jersey Shore\\" was primarily filmed along the coast of New Jersey. The show, which premiered in 2009, gained significant national and international popularity, making \\"Jersey Shore\\" synonymous with New Jersey's coastal region. While the USA option is also a correct choice geographically since New Jersey is located within this country, the New Jersey option is more specific and accurately portrays the location of the motorway, famous turnpike, and the even MTV-made famous shore mentioned in the question. The other three options (race track, England, and city) do not fit the context or characteristics stated in the question: - Race track: A race track is a specialized venue or facility for racing events, such as automobile or horse racing. In this scenario, \\"race track\\" cannot be determined as the location described by the question. - England: While also located in a first-world country with similar infrastructure, England is an entirely separate nation across the Atlantic Ocean from the United States and has no direct connection to MTV's famous shore. - City: This option is too vague and does not provide the level of specificity required to accurately identify the location mentioned in the question. In conclusion, considering all the given options and analyzing the context of the question, the best answer is that they were in New Jersey, USA."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

NPR recently published a piece for the 40th anniversary of the modern sports bra, a clever piece of sportswear innovation produced by Hinda Miller and Lisa Lindahl, which made it way more comfortable for women with breasts to participate in sports and up their exercise game. While it’s a seemingly small thing, and while government interventions like Title IX make far more difference in women’s athletics, it was undoubtedly a game-changer. At least, I definitely appreciate the difference when I’m running. Thinking about the effects of this invention, I got to thinking: what else do we need from women’s athletic wear? Of course, there have been a number of innovations in women’s sportswear since the sports bra. Sports bras themselves are now available in plus sizes (you know, for the women who arguably need them the most?) at many outlets, though certainly not enough of them. Athletic hijabs, which have been around for a while now, are finally getting big-name promotion from brands like Nike. Leggings are less see-through. At the Rio Olympics, the South Korean team even wore jackets meant to protect them from mosquito bites (and therefore Zika). These things may seem small, but they lower the barrier for women’s participation in sports, and they make it less uncomfortable and more enjoyable for us to exercise – particularly when we want to exercise in public. The sports bra is also a great example of how some necessary innovations will only get made when women are involved in the process, and can speak to their own needs and discomforts. Thinking about what a difference a sports bra makes, I was curious what other innovations we might be missing. For example, how can athletic wear better serve trans women? I know from my own friend group that it can often be damn-near impossible for trans women to find a women’s swimsuit that fits them. Or how could sportswear better serve religiously observant women, or women with disabilities? How can small clothing changes make it a little bit easier for women in rural areas, or women without access to athletic facilities, to exercise safely and comfortably? Clothes obviously aren’t the end-all or be-all, but they’re a start – and they’re a way to address the ways that athletic wear is often made, first and foremost, with men in mind, and the ways that women’s athletic gear is often designed to fit a narrow, prescriptive body type. What do you, personally, most need from your sportswear that you’re not getting? Let’s invent! (Via NPR; image via Shutterstock) Want more stories like this?

In 1977, Hinda Miller had just started working at the University of Vermont and had taken up jogging. But she found she had a problem: What to do with her breasts? \\"I used two bras,\\" she says. \\"You know, everyone has their stories of what they did.\\" Across campus, Lisa Lindahl was in the same predicament. She reached out to a friend — Polly Smith, who made costumes for the university's theater department, where Miller also worked — and the three of them got together to build a better bra. \\"We bought some bras, tore them apart,\\" Miller remembers. \\"I was taking notes; Lisa was running. 'Does that feel good? Does that feel good?' \\" None of it felt good. See, breasts move — a lot. Up and down, side to side, even back to front. And they can be really heavy. Try as they might, the women couldn't figure out how to make a bra that could stop the painful bounce. At one point, Lindahl's then-husband came downstairs with two jockstraps slung over his chest. He was teasing them, but it led to an idea. Miller remembers thinking, \\"That's what we want to do — we want to pull everything close to the body.\\" Enlarge this image toggle caption Jane Lindholm/VPR Jane Lindholm/VPR She ran to the store, bought two jockstraps and brought them back to the costume shop. \\"The waist band became our rib band,\\" Miller says. \\"We crossed the straps in the back because we didn't want them to fall, and it went over our head. And that was it.\\" They thought about calling their creation the Jockbra, but decided Jogbra was a better fit. The design caught on, and Miller and Lindahl made Jogbra into a national brand. Two decades later, at the 1999 World Cup, the sports bra got its moment in the sun. U.S. women's national team star Brandi Chastain scored the winning penalty kick of the championship game. Then, filled with emotion, Chastain pulled off her shirt in celebration, revealing a simple black sports bra. Images of that moment were featured on the covers of Newsweek and Sports Illustrated, and on the front pages of countless newspapers. These days, women have all kinds of options when it comes to their sports bras: There are sports bras as outerwear and sports bras that are glittery, patterned or have crisscrossing straps that peek out prettily when you're doing yoga. They're big business: Global sales topped 7 billion in 2014. But the foundational truth remains: The best sports bra is the kind that allows girls and women to move the way they want to move, without worrying about their anatomy. Chastain says sports bras are more than clothing — they're an essential piece of equipment. \\"I couldn't play without my cleats, and I wouldn't and couldn't play without my sports bra.\\" The sports bra may be the unsung hero in the rise of women in sports, quietly claiming its place under a T-shirt. And it all comes back to two jockstraps sewn together in 1977.

The answer to the question: What is the full name of the Reserve that was renamed the Cascade National Forest in 1907? is inside the article: The Three Sisters area was occupied by Amerindians since the end of the last glaciation, mainly the Northern Paiute to the east and Molala to the west. They harvested berries, made baskets, hunted, and made obsidian arrowheads and spears. Traces of rock art can be seen at Devils Hill, south of South Sister. The first Westerner to discover the Three Sisters was the explorer Peter Skene Ogden of the Hudson Bay Company in 1825. He describes \\"a number of high mountains\\" south of Mount Hood. Ten months later in 1826, the botanist David Douglas reported snow-covered peaks visible from the Willamette Valley. As the Willamette Valley was gradually colonized in the 1840s, Euro-Americans approached the summits from the west and probably named them individually at that time. Explorers, such as Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth in 1839 and John Frémont in 1843, used the Three Sisters as a landmark from the east. The area was further explored by John Strong Newberry in 1855 as part of the Pacific Railroad Surveys.In 1862, to connect the Willamette Valley to the ranches of Central Oregon and the gold mines of eastern Oregon and Idaho, Felix and Marion Scott traced a route over Scott Pass. This route was known as the Scott Trail, but was superseded in the early 20th century by the McKenzie Pass Road further north. Around 1866, there were reports that one of the Three Sisters emitted some fire and smoke.In the late 19th century, there was extensive wool production in eastern Oregon. Shepherds led their herds of 1,500 to 2,500 sheep to the Three Sisters. They arrived in eastern foothills near Whychus Creek by May or June, and then climbed to higher pastures in August and September. By the 1890s, the area was getting overgrazed. Despite regulatory measures, sheep grazing peaked in 1910 before being banned in the 1930s at North and Middle Sister, and in 1940 at South Sister.In 1892, President Grover Cleveland decided to create the Cascades Forest Reserve, based on the authority of the Forest Reserve Act of 1891.

Context: The Indian Massacre of 1622 took place in the English Colony of Virginia, in what is now the United States, on Friday, 22 March 1622. John Smith, though he had not been in Virginia since 1609 and was not a first hand eyewitness, related in his History of Virginia that braves of the Powhatan \\"came unarmed into our houses with deer, turkeys, fish, fruits, and other provisions to sell us\\". The Powhatan grabbed any tools or weapons available and killed all English settlers they found, including men, women, and children of all ages. Chief Opechancanough led a coordinated series of surprise attacks by the Powhatan Confederacy that killed 347 people, a quarter of the English population of the Virginia colony. Jamestown, founded in 1607, was the site of the first successful English settlement in North America, and was then the capital of the Colony of Virginia. Its tobacco economy led to constant expansion and seizure of Powhatan lands, which ultimately provoked a violent reaction. Question: How many people in percent of the English population was Chief Opechancanough responsible for killing. Answer:","completion":"Chief Opechancanough was responsible for killing 347 people, which was a quarter of the English population in the Virginia colony at that time. To convert this to a percentage, we will perform the following calculation: Percentage = (Number of people killed / Total English population) * 100 First, we need to determine the total English population by using the information that a quarter of the population was killed: Total English population = 347 people killed * 4 (since it is a quarter) = 1388 Now, we shall calculate the percentage: Percentage = (347 people killed / 1388 total English population) * 100 ≈ 25% Chief Opechancanough was responsible for killing approximately 25% of the English population in the Virginia colony during the Indian Massacre of 1622."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

An FDA advisory panel has cleared a treatment from Kythera Pharmaceuticals called ATX-101, reports the Wall Street Journal. If the FDA goes along with the recommendation, as it usually does, the injections could win final approval in May and be available from dermatologists a month or two later. Reuters offers this explanation of how it works: The drug \\"is a formulation of synthetically derived deoxycholic acid, which destroys fat under the chin, leaving surrounding tissue largely unaffected.\\" It would be the first such treatment designed to remove specific fat deposits, and the company's stock has tripled since it went public in 2012. Kythera hasn't released pricing, but the treatment—actually a series of shots that would be given in a doctor's office—would presumably be cheaper than than below-the-chin liposuction, which can cost more than 5,000. “My biggest concern is once it is approved, people will start to use it for other areas of the face or for larger volumes (of fat) in other areas,” the president of the Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery tells NBC News. In the wrong hands, it could make things worse, he adds. The FDA panel gave the green light after 19 clinical trials involving 2,600 patients.

Question: when did the constitution of india came into force?? Answer:","completion":"The Constitution of India came into force on January 26, 1950. This date marks the culmination of a long and challenging process of drafting, discussion, amendments, and ultimate adoption of India's foundational legal document. The day itself is celebrated as Republic Day, a national holiday across India, in honor of this historic occasion. India gained independence from British colonial rule on August 15, 1947. Thereafter, the Constituent Assembly of India was formed to draft and adopt a constitution for the newly independent nation. The Constituent Assembly, consisting of 299 members, most of whom were elected, was charged with creating a constitution that would embody the aspirations and ideals of all Indians. The task of drafting the constitution was a monumental effort. Members grappled with various challenges, including how to accommodate the diverse social, linguistic, and religious groups within the country's vast population. The drafting committee, headed by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, undertook extensive research and study of constitutions from around the world to inform their work. They carefully analyzed the structure, provisions, and effectiveness of these documents in order to create a constitution that would best serve India's unique needs. After almost three years of deliberation, the Constituent Assembly completed the final draft of the constitution on November 26, 1949. The constitution was then adopted by the Constituent Assembly and signed by its members on January 24, 1950. Two days later, the Constitution of India became the principal guiding document for the country's governance, paving the way for India to be officially declared as a sovereign, democratic, federal, and secular republic. The Constitution of India is the longest-written constitution for any sovereign country in the world. It contains 395 original articles, divided into 22 parts and 8 schedules. The document outlines the fundamental rights of Indian citizens, provides guidelines to be followed by the central and state governments, and establishes the separation of powers among the legislative, executive, and judiciary branches. Since its adoption, the Constitution of India has undergone multiple amendments, with the most recent amendment enacted in 2019. The constitution remains a living document that has evolved over time to address changing social and political dynamics and continue to guide India as a nation that values diversity, democracy, and the rule of law."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"The question \\"Where did the name Daniel originate?\\" is asking about the origin of a specific name, in this case, Daniel. In order to provide a detailed and long answer, let's explore the different categories you have suggested and determine which one the question fits into best. 1. Description: This category typically involves descriptive information about objects, events, or concepts. The question is not asking for a description, but rather the origin of a name. So, it does not fit into this category. 2. Entity: Entity-based questions refer to specific objects, people, or events that are tangible and factual. The question is asking about the origin, which could be an event or concept, and it involves the name Daniel, which is a proper noun used for humans. In this sense, the question can be classified as an entity-based question. 3. Abbreviation: Abbreviation questions focus on understanding shortened or abbreviated forms of words or phrases. Since the question is about the origin of a name and not an abbreviation, it does not fit into this category. 4. Human: Human-based questions deal with people, their roles, actions, ideas, and creations. The name Daniel is a human name, and its origin is connected to human culture and history. Therefore, the question fits well into this category. 5. Numeric: Numeric questions involve numbers, quantities, and measurements. The question is about the origin of a name and does not involve any numerical information, so it does not fit into this category. 6. Location: Location-based questions usually ask about geographical places, coordinates, or details about specific locations. Although the question asks \\"where\\" the name originated, it refers to the cultural or historical origin of the name rather than a specific geographical location. Considering all the categories, the best fit for the question \\"Where did the name Daniel originate?\\" is the \\"human\\" category because it involves the name of a human, and the answer would include information about this name's cultural and historical origins. To provide a further understanding, the name Daniel originates from the Hebrew name דָּנִיֵּאל (Daniyyel), which means \\"God is my judge\\". It is found in the Hebrew Bible and Christian Old Testament and has been a popular name in many cultures and time periods throughout history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You may wonder if there are other examples of static discharge. The answer is yes. Lightning is a form of static discharge. It is much more dramatic than what happens between you and the door knocker, but it is the same principle. You can see how it occurs in the following diagram and animation. You have no doubt seen lightning in a rainstorm. What does lighting have to do with static electricity? As it turns out, everything! During a rainstorm, clouds develop regions of different charges. This happens due to the movement of air molecules, water drops, and ice particles. The negative charges are concentrated at the base of the clouds. The positive charges are concentrated at the top. The negative charges repel electrons on the ground below. The ground then becomes positively charged. Over time the differences increase. Eventually the electrons are discharged. This is what we see as lightning. You can watch an awesome slow-motion lightning strike below. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What are two examples of static discharge?\\" is \\"Lightning, and what happens between you and a door knocker\\"?","completion":"Yes, that is correct. According to the paragraph provided, two examples of static discharge are lightning and the discharge that occurs between you and a door knocker. Both phenomena involve the buildup and sudden release of electrical energy due to differences in charge. Lightning is a more dramatic and large-scale occurrence of static discharge. It happens during a rainstorm, when clouds develop differently charged regions due to the movement of air molecules, water drops, and ice particles. The negative charges accumulate at the base of the clouds, while the positive charges accumulate at the top. As these charge differences increase over time, the negatively charged base of the cloud repels electrons in the ground below, causing the ground to become positively charged. Eventually, the electrons are discharged, creating a lightning bolt. On a smaller scale, the static discharge that happens between a person and a door knocker is also due to the buildup of charge difference. When a person walks across a carpet, for example, they can accumulate an excess of electrons, resulting in a negative charge on their body. When they then touch a metallic door knocker, which could be a good conductor of electricity, the excess electrons on their body are quickly released, leading to a small electric shock. This is static discharge on a much smaller and less dramatic scale compared to lightning, but the underlying mechanism is the same: the difference in charge is the driving force that causes the static discharge to occur."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Short movie review: me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"Based on the short movie review provided, it can be inferred that the critic had a negative experience while watching the movie. The phrase \\"me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch\\" suggests that the film may have contained content that was nauseating, disturbing, or difficult to watch, leading the reviewer to feel ill or unsettled. This is not a positive reaction and indicates that the movie was not enjoyable for the critic. Furthermore, it conveys a sense of discomfort that may be consistent with disappointment or dissatisfaction with the film's content or execution. Negative reactions like these often come from movies that involve excessive gore, unsettling themes, or poor execution of the plot or storyline. The reviewer might feel that the movie offered little in terms of aesthetic or emotional satisfaction and that the negative aspects outweighed any possible positive attributes. The discomfort experienced might have stemmed from various factors like an inappropriate use of violence, crude humor, or unwarranted shock value. It's also possible that the critic found the pacing, cinematography, or storytelling to be disorienting or confusing, leading to a less-than-ideal viewing experience. In summary, the critic's short review of the movie evokes a sense of negativity and dissatisfaction. By mentioning their extreme discomfort and the prospect of almost \\"losing their lunch,\\" the reviewer warns potential viewers that the film may be overwhelming and unpalatable. This assessment does not shed a favorable light on the movie and would not be considered a positive review."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: World Headed into the holiday season this week, you’re bound to start hearing about people doing good deeds for those in need. Some of these are quiet, anonymous acts and some are more flashy. Others are just plain odd. Take a Scottish man named Armstrong Baillie who isn’t just committing random acts of kindness this week and through the holidays but has been doing so for the past six months … in a giraffe suit. In fact, he is calling this his “year of the giraffe tour.” The Courier in Scotland reported that the 32-year-old unemployed man from Dundee got the idea while “on the loo.” “[...] I wondered ‘what would happen if I dressed up as a giraffe and went around doing good deeds?’” The Courier reported Baillie saying. Going by the moniker Good Giraffe, Baillie has handed out water and bananas at a local marathon, cleaned beaches, passed out free coffee and more recently, according to the Courier, watched a black Labrador retriever for the day. They were a happy pair. Here are some answers questions you might have about the Good Giraffe: Where did the costume come from? His mother made it. His mother made it. How does he get around/fund some of his endeavors? He hitchhikes and receives donations through what The Courier calls “busking,” which is defined as street performing. He hitchhikes and receives donations through what The Courier calls “busking,” which is defined as street performing. What is his favorite good deed to date? Cleaning up the beaches at Oban and Stonehaven. Watch the Good Giraffe share some more about himself in this YouTube video while he was on a local beach: Baillie said although he spends some of his time in costume doing good works, he is still looking for a full time job and writing an adventure novel. ”I am looking for work but I would like to think the Good Giraffe would be part of that one day. Even if it’s not, I would still want to do this at least once a week,” Baillie said according to to The Courier. Read more about the Good Giraffe here. Keep up with the Good Giraffe’s thoughts and doings on Baillie’s blog here. (H/T: NPR) ||||| Scotland is growing to love the Good Giraffe's high ideals A Dundee man who carries out random acts of kindness while dressed as a giraffe admits the bizarre wheeze came to him during a trip to the toilet. For the past six months, Armstrong Baillie has been spotted across Scotland in his eye-catching animal suit, performing good deeds such as handing out bananas and water to runners at the Edinburgh Half Marathon. He has also completed beach cleans and even given free coffee to chilly strangers. Dubbed the Good Giraffe, the unemployed 32-year-old was spotted in Dundee on Thursday, where he lives with his girlfriend, fulfilling his latest selfless act — looking after an energetic black labrador for the day. When asked why the giraffe was his animal of choice, Mr Baillie replied: ''I was on the loo and I wondered 'what would happen if I dressed up as a giraffe and went around doing good deeds?' ''That is the truth — that was where it started.'' Despite being unemployed, Mr Baillie, who is originally from Glasgow, funds his kind-hearted trips through busking. He hitchhikes to cities and towns in the long-necked outfit, made by his mother. Mr Baillie continues to look for employment but says he has no plans to hang up his homemade hide even if he secures a full-time job. ''I feel good when I do it,'' he continued. ''When I carry out these acts it seems to have a knock-on effect and people seem to have a positive response. That's my whole thing — what comes around goes around. ''There have been happy and sad moments from my life that have led to the creation of the Good Giraffe.'' He added: ''I am looking for work but I would like to think the Good Giraffe would be part of that one day. Even if it's not, I would still want to do this at least once a week.'' The Good Giraffe has become a much-loved figure in many communities and attracted widespread media coverage. He has also been given the celebrity seal of approval by comedian Greg McHugh, of Gary Tank Commander fame, who bumped into the giraffe while in a Glasgow pub. Despite the attention he now receives, Mr Baillie remains focused on continuing his novel venture. He spoke of his favourite selfless act to date. ''I really enjoyed tidying the beach at Oban and Stonehaven,'' said Mr Baillie. ''I liked the smells of the sea. I remember things in my life from smells of different places and tastes of food in those places.'' cmcmanamon@thecourier.co.uk |||||","completion":"The Good Giraffe is a persona created by Armstrong Baillie, a 32-year-old Scottish man from Dundee.

Question: Given the below context: Despite the grandeur of Florence, Etty was severely depressed, writing to his brother on 5 October that \\"I feel so lonely, it is impossible for me to be happy\\" and complaining of \\"the vermin in the bed, the dirt and the filth\\" which he considered \\"such as no Englishman can have any idea of, who has not witnessed it\\". His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26 October 1816. There he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.Notwithstanding his unhappiness, Etty appears to have developed as a painter during his travels. For the first time, his two paintings exhibited at the 1817 Summer Exhibition (Bacchanalians: a Sketch and Cupid and Euphrosyne) attracted a favourable review in the press, in this case from William Paulet Carey writing in the Literary Gazette who considered Bacchanalians \\"a fine classical invention\\" and Cupid as showing \\"splendid promise\\". Carey was later to take great pride in being the first critic to recognise Etty's potential, and continued to champion him throughout his career. In 1818 Etty entered a copy of Damiano Mazza's The Rape of Ganymede—at the time thought to be by Titian—in one of the Royal Academy's painting competitions. Easily the most accomplished entry in the competition, Etty was due to win until two of the other contestants complained that he had technically breached RA rules by briefly removing the painting from Academy premises to work on it at home; they further complained that Etty was technically a professional artist and thus ineligible for the contest despite his still being a student. Etty was disqualified from the competition, but the high quality of his... Guess a valid title for it!

However, the book also deals with or alludes to a number of secondary political and social issues existing in Odessa, all of which share ties to the Permian Panthers football team. These include socioeconomic disparity; racism; segregation (and desegregation); and poverty.The coach, Gary Gaines, is constantly on the hot seat. After a loss, he comes back to see \\"For Sale\\" signs on his lawn. Tied into the successes and failure of the coach and the team in general are the conflicts the players struggle with on and off the gridiron. The coach overuses his star player, running back James \\"Boobie\\" Miles, who gets seriously injured (Miles tore his ACL, missed the playoffs, and had a limp for the rest of his life). When this happens, sports radios are flooded with calls for his resignation. Miles' once-arrogant attitude vanishes as he sees his once promising chance of playing big-time college football disappear and starts to question his future after he notices his not-so promising academic standing. Quarterback Mike Winchell struggles with being able to play consistently, and his inability to make decisions for himself. Fullback Don Billingsley has a rocky relationship with his father, who won a state championship at Permian and carries on a feud with his son for not performing on the level he'd like to see, despite the fact that Don doesn't do anything to light his father's temper. Third-string running back Chris Comer, who takes the spot of Miles after his injury, attempts to get rid of his fear of being hit and getting injured, especially when the player who last occupied his spot suffered a season ending injury.

The move south came when, in 1934, the Land Settlement Association established 20 sites where jobless families were given smallholdings. Families of 120 men relocated to the largest of the farms at Sidlesham. Their story is being retold at Chichester's Novium museum. The creation of the smallholdings was to alleviate mass unemployment which had hit the North East. Each tenant was given a house, piggery, chicken battery, access to a glasshouse and four acres of land, with the smallholdings run as a cooperative. Norman Dixon, now 86, was just 10 when he arrived with his family from Gateshead. Mr Dixon, who left Tyneside with his family in 1939, said: \\"I was a little boy when we came down here with the whole family. \\"My father had been down the coal mines looking after the old pit ponies, but he ended up on the dole for about 13 years. \\"He put his name down for the scheme and was given a place here at Sidlesham. \\"When we left home it was the only time I saw my mother cry.\\" The family eventually established a successful agricultural business, producing vegetables and keeping pigs and hens. Mr Dixon worked for his father for 13 years and later took over the smallholding when he retired in the late 1950s. He still lives in the same house his family took over as a tenant. He added: \\"We fitted in all right. In fact there were four new classrooms built at the school to take the LSA children.\\" Bill Martin, who carried out the research for the exhibition, compared the success of the LSA scheme to the disappointment of the Jarrow marchers of 1936, who walked to London to lobby for help for the unemployed but returned empty handed. Mr Martin said: \\"The 200 who marched from Jarrow returned with nothing. The 120 [at Sidlesham] were to begin a multi-million pound horticultural industry which still exists today, The families who moved to Sidlesham have remained in the area, with many of the smallholdings being passed down through generations. Chichester District Council said the LSA officially closed in 1983 and a group of tenants formed their own company which traded until the late 1990s. Most of the properties are now privately owned, but independent growers remain there, the local authority added. Museum experts have described the development of Sidlesham's LSA as a significant historical event. Other LSA schemes were established at Dunstable in Bedfordshire, Fen Drayton in Cambridgeshire and Harrowby in Lincolnshire. Manager of the Novium, Cathy Hakes, said: \\"It's a story that is living history and in living memory. She added that to be able to tell the story was \\"just fantastic\\".

Sex after illness, loss and infidelity Life changes such as illness, aging and infidelity can tax a couple's intimacy. Editor's note: Iris Krasnow's book \\"Sex After ... Women Share How Intimacy Changes as Life Changes\\" was recently released by Gotham Books. She is a professor at American University, where she teaches journalism and women's studies courses. (CNN) -- During the past two years, I have been digging into the intimate relationships of 150 women, ages 20 through 90, for my new book, \\"Sex After ... Women Share How Intimacy Changes as Life Changes.\\" I take readers from the honeymoon hots through tepid midlife to some surprisingly steamy senior sex. Many of my subjects describe easy and sexy romances; others are pushing through emotional and physical roadblocks. Here are snapshots of some of those stories of tough love. Between 10-15% of women suffer from postpartum depression that affects sexual desire and can cause serious rifts in a young marriage. Texas psychologist Christine Hall's struggle through the blues after childbirth led her to create a specialty practice in treating clients with postpartum mood disorders. Hall's own depression was so severe that for a flash she considered taking her own life. With the help of a supportive husband, therapy and anti-depressants, she fought her way back. Here is a snippet of our interview that appears in the \\"Sex After Baby\\" chapter: I see in my practice that sex can really cause a lot of distance between the couple. The spouse is thinking, \\"All right, the OB said we could have sex after six weeks. Let's go to it, honey.\\" And the new mom is telling me, \\"Oh my God, I can't do this yet. I am still fat and sad and I am not ready to have anyone close to me -- other than the baby!\\" I tell them my own story, that there is hope -- I'm at a really good place now. You go from not feeling sexy at all and trying to get across to your partner, \\"Hey these are not your boobs right now' to feeling 'hey I'm ready, let's do it'. Richaela's husband, Derek, was deployed to Afghanistan three weeks after their wedding. She was 20, and he was 22. Six months later, Derek stepped on an improvised explosive device and lost part of his right leg. To add to the bedlam of this tragedy, Richaela gave birth to their daughter, Madeline, early on in Derek's treatment at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. After excruciating hard work to become intimate again, emotionally and physically, they are now enjoying \\"full-on sex,\\" Richaela told me, and a very sturdy marriage. Here is a portion of her story: When this first happened to Derek, I just felt helpless, like I would never get my husband back. He was so depressed and angry, and he also had post traumatic stress disorder. I felt like leaving the marriage, and it was hard to become intimate again. He'd want to have sex, but with the pain in his leg, he couldn't bear weight. Once we figured out how to finally do it, every time we'd finish with an orgasm, his leg would jolt with pain. It made me feel really bad because he would say \\"I want to have sex with you,\\" but it would hurt him afterward. Honestly, we don't have sex in long sessions any more like we used to because he just gets tired more quickly. I don't really mind. At least I have my husband! You come to realize that love in marriage comes from so many other things than what our bodies can do. It's only a leg; I've seen far worse when we were at Walter Reed. There were many men with two and three limbs missing, plus genital injuries. Five years ago, Sophia was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer at 37. She had her left breast removed and reconstructed, then endured months of chemotherapy and radiation that left her weak and bald and frightened that she would not live to see her two young kids enter kindergarten. Tanned in a low-cut sundress, today Sophia is cancer-free, and she offers a hopeful message to the one in eight American women who will be struck with breast cancer in their lifetimes. Here is a swatch of our conversation: Don't miss out on the conversation we're having at CNN Living. for the latest stories and tell us what's influencing your life. My husband was surprisingly turned on by my new look. It was like he got to sleep with another woman. Though I am not thrilled with the way my chest looks. I prefer to have sex with my shirt on now, because it makes me think less about how my breasts used to be. Recovering from cancer, while the physical intimacy was good, I would often feel like I needed more emotional support from him. And I should have asked for it; this is a lesson I can pass on to other women in my situation. I created the problem really, because in my efforts to be strong in front of the kids and to just keep going forward, I let my husband assume I was invincible. And he was so turned on by how tough I was, this Warrior Woman, I didn't let myself be weak with him. In retrospect, I should have told him the truth, that I was often tired. That I was scared the cancer would come back. That I was vulnerable and just needed him to hold me. Let's talk about sex ... and cancer The 15-year mark in a marriage is a popular juncture for divorce and infidelity. Affairs that are outed can either wreck a marriage or open communication lines, as remorse leads to forgiveness and potentially a more honest union. Increasingly, though, I found in composing this book that many people who take on lovers do so in secret, so as not to rock the boat. Pamela, 53, is a married mother of five who last year reconnected with the \\"soul mate who got away.\\" They are now lovers, and she is determined to keep both men in her life. Here is part of her story in the \\"Sex After Infidelity\\" chapter: This previous boyfriend was my first love and my greatest lover. And he still is. Yet I do not want to leave my husband and hurt him. My marriage is a good one. I love both men, and I have chosen to keep both men. A secret life can be very sexually affirming if it stays a secret. If I went to a therapist, she would say \\"choose.\\" I can't choose. I get the best of both worlds: I have the stability and security of my husband, an intact family for my children, and I have the passion that I want and need in my life. While researching \\"Sex After ...,\\" I looked for older women whose husbands had died recently and had been their only lovers. Those wives who had nursed husbands through long illnesses were clearly grieving, yet they admitted to some relief. Patricia was married for 55 years in what she described as a \\"wonderful love affair.\\" Her husband suffered from a chronic heart condition for most of those years and finally succumbed to leukemia. At 80, she has found solace with an old friend her age who had also lost his wife. I love Patricia's story, a portion of which she tells below, and the hopeful stories like hers in the \\"Giddy Golden Girls\\" chapter that shatter myths of the little old lady as fragile and dried up. I never thought I would ever want to get involved with another man. Our friend Steven would ask me out, and I would say, \\"I'm not ready.\\" He was very romantic and persistent, though. He would send me long-stemmed white roses every two weeks. I finally went on a date with him on New Year's Eve. But I was still afraid to touch another man. At midnight, I wouldn't go near him. Then about a year after my husband died, Steven asked me to go to Paris with him. I said, \\"OK, I guess it's time to try you out.\\" My husband was the only man I'd ever slept with, so being intimate with another man was very scary. Without giving you details, let me just say things are going well. I feel wonderful, like a teenager. The love, the making love -- it's so romantic it's almost electrifying. After taking care of someone so ill for so many years, this is fantastic. Finding love in my 80s is like opening another world I never knew could exist. Not only do I have a golf partner and a life partner, but the sex part is very, very good. It is not \\"Fifty Shades of Grey,\\" but it is definitely erotic and warm and beautiful.

Question: What does Lazarus do to keep Rae from running away ? Title: Black Snake Moan Movie plot: The film centers on two main characters: Lazarus Redd (Samuel L. Jackson), a deeply religious farmer and former blues guitarist, and Rae Doole (Christina Ricci), a young sex addict. Lazarus' wife and his brother were having an affair, which has left him bitter and angry. Rae's boyfriend Ronnie Morgan (Justin Timberlake) leaves for deployment with the 196th Field Artillery Brigade, Tennessee National Guard, and in his absence, she indulges in bouts of promiscuity and drug use. During one of Rae's binges, Ronnie's friend Gill Morton (Michael Raymond-James) tries to take advantage of her. She laughs at his advances, comparing him unfavorably with another man, and he severely beats her. Believing she's dead, Gill dumps Rae and leaves her for dead in only a shirt and panties by the side of the road and drives away. Lazarus discovers Rae unconscious in the road the next morning and brings her home to nurse her back to health. Lazarus goes to see Tehronne (David Banner) - the man who Lazarus thought had beaten her - and learns of her promiscuity. Over the course of several days, Rae, delirious with fever, occasionally wakes up and tries to flee from Lazarus. He chains her to the radiator to keep her from running away. After Rae regains her wits, Lazarus announces that it is his spiritual duty to heal her of her sinful ways and refuses to release her until he does so. Rae makes several attempts to escape, and even briefly has sex with a teenage boy who helps out on Lazarus' farm. She eventually comes to tolerate her position. Lazarus buys her a conservative dress to wear, plays the guitar for her, and feeds her home-cooked meals. Lazarus' pastor and close friend, R.L. (John Cothran, Jr.), visits Lazarus at his house and discovers that Lazarus is imprisoning Rae. The pastor tries to reason with Lazarus and the group shares a meal.

Expansion quickly peaked however, and the European powers who had carved up the New World set about testing each other in dynastic conflicts and colonial rivalry. The English were the main rivals of the Dutch on the high seas, and there were several wars between the two in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1665–1667 the Dutch sailed up the River Medway and sank the British fleet moored there. The 18th century saw Amsterdam grow into the foremost financial center in the world, but the seeds of decline had already been planted. When the English colonies in New England rose up in revolt against the British, they found ready Ailies in the Dutch. From their colonies in the Caribbean they sent caches of arms and ammunition. The British were furious and went to war in 1780, destroying the Dutch navy and signaling a sudden decline in power and influence from which the Netherlands never recovered. Trade suffered to such an extent that in 1791 the VOC went into liquidation. In the latter part of the century there were anti-Orange demonstrations by pro-French factions in the country, and in 1795 Napoleon Bonaparte took the Netherlands in his epic march across Europe. Under the yoke of another foreign power, and with trade at an all time low, the Golden Age was truly dead. The Return of the House of Orange Napoleon installed his brother Louis as King of Holland and he chose to take the fine Town Hall on Dam Square as his palace — now the Koninklijk Palace. But only four years later he fled the city after civil disturbances broke out when he raised taxes. When Napoleon's bubble burst and French power began to wane, William of Orange emerged from exile and was proclaimed king in 1813. Amsterdam had to work its way out of economic decline, but throughout the 19th century the city grew steadily. Industrialization changed the city. With the building of the Central Station at the end of the century, Amsterdam turned its back on its seafaring past and looked towards the mechanical age for its future. The station was built over the old harbor wall and some of the oldest canals in the city center were filled in to allow better access to motorized vehicles. Dam Square was landlocked for the first time in its history.

After having an affair with the deceased Professor Edward Wilson, Dot is now technically his common-law wife and heiress to 77 million. She has to go to Egypt to claim the money, and sets off with Louie in hopes of getting the cash. Former assistant to Edward Wilson, Gerald Lane, informs the law offices of Benton, Loring, and Slade of Professor Wilson's death and the fact that Edward's son, Eddie Wilson, Jr, is the rightful heir to the money. Mr. Slade, the lawyer, goes to a barge in Brooklyn where Eddie is living with his adopted father, Pops, an old stevedore, and his three sons, Oscar, Adolph, and Herman, who roughhouse Eddie. However, Eddie is managing to live a nice life nonetheless, with his girlfriend, Nora 'Toots', and his care for all the kids on the barge. He dreams of the day when he will have enough money to live his own life outside of the dirty barge (\\"When My Ship Comes In\\"). Moments later, Eddie is informed that he has inherited the 77 million and boards a ship bound for Egypt to claim the money. Aboard the ship is Colonel Henry Larrabee, a gentleman from Virginia who sponsored Eddie, Sr's exploration endeavors and wants a share of the money, as well. Eddie befriends his beautiful niece, Joan, and Dot and Louie realize that they are not the only ones traveling to Egypt. In an elaborate scheme to trick Eddie into signing over the inheritance, Dot disguises herself as Eddie's mother and almost succeeds in duping him, but Louie ruins the plan at the last minute. Meanwhile, Gerald Lane has boarded the ship and he is revealed to be in love with Joan Larrabee.

Question: Given the following context: Pavement was formed in 1989 in Stockton, California, by Stephen Malkmus and Scott Kannberg. Malkmus and Kannberg had previously performed together in the band Bag O' Bones. Pavement had its start playing at open mike nights at clubs and bars. The songs the band played during this time were mostly covers, although they also performed many original songs that would later be released on Slay Tracks. Malkmus recalls, \\"It was pretty reasonable to be able to make a single for 1,000, so we decided to go for it. We didn't have any real plans because we weren't a real band.\\" Two local studios existed in Stockton, the cheaper and less professionally minded of which was Gary Young's Louder Than You Think Studio. The band decided to record at Young's studio due to their admiration of other local punk bands who had recorded there, including The Young Pioneers and The Authorities. Kannberg reportedly borrowed 800 from his father to record Slay Tracks.Slay Tracks was recorded during a four-hour session on January 17, 1989, at Young's studio. Kannberg, describing the studio and the recording process, said, \\"You go into his house and it's stuff everywhere, old dogs lying around, big pot plants everywhere, and Gary tells us that he got all his equipment by selling pot! It was us going in and pretty much just laying down the songs with a guide guitar and a detuned guitar through a bass amp and then we'd play drums over the top.\\" Young, though bewildered by the band's sound, contributed by playing drums. He recalled, \\"[Malkmus and Kannberg] come in and they play this weird guitar noise and it just sounds like noise, with no background. My drums were in there so I said, 'Should I drum?' and they said 'Okay.'\\" Kannberg said, \\"We did it really fast. We probably spent one day tracking and one day mixing it.\\" The title of the EP had been decided prior to its recording, and the pseudonyms S.M. and Spiral Stairs were used to credit Malkmus and Kannberg respectively. answer the following question: What is the full name of the person that claimed they weren't a real band?

Carolingian art was produced for a small group of figures around the court, and the monasteries and churches they supported. It was dominated by efforts to regain the dignity and classicism of imperial Roman and Byzantine art, but was also influenced by the Insular art of the British Isles. Insular art integrated the energy of Irish Celtic and Anglo-Saxon Germanic styles of ornament with Mediterranean forms such as the book, and established many characteristics of art for the rest of the medieval period. Surviving religious works from the Early Middle Ages are mostly illuminated manuscripts and carved ivories, originally made for metalwork that has since been melted down. Objects in precious metals were the most prestigious form of art, but almost all are lost except for a few crosses such as the Cross of Lothair, several reliquaries, and finds such as the Anglo-Saxon burial at Sutton Hoo and the hoards of Gourdon from Merovingian France, Guarrazar from Visigothic Spain and Nagyszentmiklós near Byzantine territory. There are survivals from the large brooches in fibula or penannular form that were a key piece of personal adornment for elites, including the Irish Tara Brooch. Highly decorated books were mostly Gospel Books and these have survived in larger numbers, including the Insular Book of Kells, the Book of Lindisfarne, and the imperial Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram, which is one of the few to retain its \\"treasure binding\\" of gold encrusted with jewels.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: Running only seventy-two minutes, this small, overlooked 2006 dramedy is really just a two-character sketch piece but one that works very well within its limitations. Taking place almost entirely in various, non-descript spots in southern Los Angeles, the story itself is inconsequential, but like Sofia Coppola's \\"Lost in Translation\\", the film is far more about two strangers who meet unexpectedly, find a common bond and go back to their lives enlightened for the momentous encounter. It also helps considerably that Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are playing the characters. Finally freed of the wise sages and authority figures beyond reproach that have become his big-screen specialty, Freeman seems comparatively liberated as a somewhat self-indulgent movie star. His character is driven to a low-rent grocery store in Carson, where he will be able to research a role he is considering in an indie film. Out of work for a few years, he is embarrassed when he sees DVDs of his films in the bargain bin, but his ego is such that he does not lack the temerity to watch and even mimic the enervated store staff. Of particular fascination to him is Scarlet, an embittered worker from Spain and relegated to the express line where she is the unsung model of efficiency. She has an interview for a secretarial job at a construction company, but her deep-seeded insecurity seems to defeat her chances already. Still looking like Penelope Cruz's Amazonian sister, the beautiful Vega (one of the few redeemable aspects of James L. Brooks' execrable \\"Spanglish\\") brings a stinging edge and realistic vulnerability to Scarlet. She and Freeman interplay very well throughout the story, which includes stops not only at the grocery store but also at Target, Arby's and a full-service carwash. Nothing earth-shattering happens except to show how two people realize the resonating transience of chance encounters. Silberling keeps the proceedings simple, but the production also reflects expert craftsmanship in Phedon Papamichael's vibrant cinematography (he lensed Alexander Payne's \\"Sideways\\") and the infectious score by Brazilian composer Antonio Pinto (\\"City of God\\"). There are fast cameos by Bobby Cannavale (as Scarlet's soon-to-be-ex-husband) and as themselves, Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman, as well as a funny bits with Jonah Hill (\\"Knocked Up\\") as the clueless driver and Jim Parsons (the \\"knight\\" in \\"Garden State\\") as a worshipful receptionist. The 2007 DVD is overstuffed with extras, including a making-of documentary, \\"15 Days or Less\\", aimed at film students and running a marathon 103 minutes; six extended scenes; a light-hearted but insightful three-way conversation between Silberling, Freeman and Vega in the middle of Target; and a couple of snippets that specifically advertise the DVD.","completion":"This review has a positive sentiment.

Mrs Mujuru, once seen as a possible future leader of Zimbabwe, has denied plotting against the president. State media and Mr Mugabe's wife, Grace, have conducted a campaign against her for months. \\"President RG Mugabe has exercised his executive powers to release the Honourable Joice Mujuruâ€¦ with immediate effect,\\" said a statement issued by chief secretary to the cabinet Misheck Sibanda. Mrs Mujuru's conduct had been \\"inconsistent with the expected standard\\", it said. The ministers whose sacking was announced on Tuesday included State Security Minister Didymus Mutasa - another long-time ally of Mr Mugabe - and Energy Minister Dzikamai Mavhaire, who was seen as close to Mrs Mujuru. There was no immediate word on replacements. The sackings come a week after Mr Mugabe denounced his vice-president at a party congress and removed her from her post in the ruling party, Zanu-PF. Mrs Mujuru responded on Tuesday by saying her loyalty to Mr Mugabe was \\"unquestionable\\" and it was \\"repugnant\\" and \\"ridiculous\\" to suggest she had plotted to kill him or wanted to remove him from office. She said Zimbabwe's state media had \\"continued to publish malicious untruths\\" about her and that she had \\"become the fly in a web of lies whose final objective is the destruction of Zanu-PF\\". Her accusers, she said, had produced \\"not a single iota of evidence\\" against her. Mr Mugabe, 90, has been in power since Zimbabwe's independence in 1980. He is due to stand for election again in 2018. Mrs Mujuru fought alongside him in the 1970s guerrilla war against white-minority rule and had been thought a possible successor as president. But correspondents say her career ran into trouble when Mr Mugabe's wife entered politics earlier this year. Analysis - By Brian Hungwe, BBC News, Harare Mrs Mujuru's sacking was not a huge surprise. She has been under siege for the past three months and her relationship with Mr Mugabe had broken down. Grace Mugabe has been spewing vitriol at public rallies, telling the vice-president to resign or apologise. Mrs Mujuru has dug in despite the gravity of the allegations. Now her sacking is official, the public eagerly await her next move. She appears ready to face the consequences of the situation - but her options are limited. She is damned if she leaves the party, damned if she stays. Her supporters may press her to join the opposition trenches. That could be dangerous, given the threats by Mr Mugabe of imminent arrest. The intelligence services are known to keep files of \\"dirt\\" for use against those who defect. If she stays, she will be a diminished and disparaged figure, likely to demoralise those allies who would be prepared to leave with her. Mrs Mugabe repeatedly accused Mrs Mujuru of plotting against her husband and Mr Mugabe told delegates at the party congress that he welcomed his wife's action to expose the alleged treachery. Grace Mugabe, 49, once her husband's secretary, is now a senior party figure, having been appointed leader of Zanu-PF's women's wing last week. Speculation is building that she may seek to succeed Mr Mugabe when he retires or dies. Correspondents say another prominent figure expected to benefit from the political demise of Mrs Mujuru is the veteran Justice Minister, Emmerson Mnangagwa. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"In a country called Zimbabwe, there was a president named Mr. Mugabe.

Here is a news article: NEW YORK — Hold the pickles, onions and special sauce. The Big Mac is becoming a victim of finicky tastes. As sales continue to slide in the U.S., McDonald’s plans to expand a test that lets people build their own burgers by tapping on a touchscreen to pick the bread, cheese and toppings they want. The company says it will bring the option to 2,000 of its 14,000 U.S. locations next year. The “Create Your Taste” program is a departure for McDonald’s, which was built to deliver food consistently, quickly and affordably. That model has come under pressure as people gravitate toward places like Chipotle, which lets people pick what goes on their bowls and burritos as they walk down a line. According to industry executives and analysts, the ability to customize food orders is becoming more important, particularly among people in their 20s and 30s. McDonald’s has already been trying to adjust by installing new kitchen prep tables that can hold more toppings and sauces. The plans to offer greater customization come as McDonald’s fights to boost declining sales and customer traffic. On Monday, it said U.S. sales fell 4.6 per cent in November at established locations. The figure fell 4 per cent in the unit that includes the Asia-Pacific region, where the company is fighting to recover from a food supplier scandal. Overall, global sales declined 2.2 per cent for the month. Related Back in the U.S., CEO Don Thompson has conceded the company hasn’t done enough to keep up with shifting habits and that changes are in store. “We haven’t been changing at the same rate as our customers’ eating-out expectations,” Thompson said in October. Offering greater customization could be a challenge for McDonald’s, however. For “complicated” orders, burgers might take as long as five to seven minutes to prepare, Greg Watson, senior vice-president of menu innovation, said in a phone interview. That’s more than the couple of minutes it should take for regular orders, he said. The customized burgers are also more expensive than core items like Big Macs, Watson said. But it’s not clear whether people will be willing to wait longer or shell out more money for a burger from McDonald’s. Watson said McDonald’s hasn’t yet decided on expansion of “Create Your Taste” beyond the 2,000 locations next year. In Australia, McDonald’s said earlier this year a customized burger option would be expanded nationally. The locations that have the “Create Your Taste” option still offer the regular menu as well. As for the regular menu, McDonald’s plans to remove some items “with slower movement” from the national menu in the U.S. The Bacon Clubhouse burger, which McDonald’s introduced this year as a premium offering, could become a regional offering, Watson said. In the meantime, McDonald’s is also trying to address long-held perceptions about the quality of its food. It recently launched a campaign that answers questions about its food, such as, “Does McDonald’s beef contain worms?” and is planning new marketing for the year ahead. McDonald’s troubles aren’t isolated to the U.S. In Asia, the company has been trying to bounce back since the summer, when a TV report in China showed workers at one of its suppliers repackaging meat that was alleged to be expired. The claim has not been publicly confirmed by the supplier or the government. The Oak Brook, Illinois, company said comparable sales for Europe fell 2 per cent in November with a strong performance in the U.K. more than offset by weakness in Russia, France and Germany. McDonald’s has more than 35,000 locations in more than 100 countries. Its stock fell US2.81, or 2.9 per cent, to US93.50 before the market opened Monday. The Associated Press ||||| December 8, 2014 4 min read After months and months of depressing earnings reports, one question must be on every McDonald's exec's mind: How on earth can we turn things around? Same-store sales fell 2.2 percent globally and 4.6 percent in the U.S. in November, McDonald's reported on Monday. The chain hasn't seen any growth in U.S. sales for over a year. How can the fast-food chain pull itself out of the rapidly deepening rut? Here are four possible ways to turn things around. Go fast-casual. As the fast-casual business increasingly cuts into the market for fast food, it may be time for McDonald's to try and ditch its cheap but low-quality reputation. It seems the chain may be heading that way. \\"Today's consumers increasingly demand more choice, convenience and value in their dining-out experience,\\" McDonald's CEO Don Thompson said in a statement. Related: Pizza + Doritos? Pizza Hut Says Yes. At least some McDonald's locations are focusing on boosting the choice aspect, with a customizable menu that offers more options – and pricier burgers. McDonald's \\"Create Your Taste\\" test platform is now expanding from four California stores to 30 locations in five more states, reports USA Today. By 2015, 2,000 U.S. locations will offer the menu platform, which allows customers to order more high-end burgers with toppings like eggs, smoked bacon and grilled mushrooms via tablet-like kiosks. The higher-quality burgers cost substantially more, with a customer burger with a drink and fries coming in at around 8.29, according to USA Today. The option is additionally expanding nationally in Australia, where the platform has also been widely tested. Incidentally, Australia was the only bright spot in McDonald's Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) same-store sales, which dropped 4 percent despite Australia's positive performance. Serve more chicken. With the expansion of the \\"Create Your Taste\\" platform, McDonald's is adding a second meat to the menu: Chicken. Now customers will be able to build their own chicken sandwiches at the kiosks. Chicken was the surprise MVP of the quick service industry in 2014, with chicken chains like Chick-fil-A and Bojangles thriving and restaurants across the industry adding more chicken to the menu. Servings of breaded chicken sandwiches have grown an average of 3 percent over the last four years. Chicken is seen as a healthier option than burgers, whether or not the sandwiches actually have a higher calorie count, helping the trendy fowl to fit in with the fast-casual trend. Additionally, with increased beef and pork prices, chicken is an economically sound options for restaurants interested in expanding their menu. Maybe it's time for the biggest burger chain in the world to downplay the hamburger and focus on chicken instead. Related: Taco Bell Is Hungry for Global Expansion Simplify the menu. While the \\"Create Your Taste\\" menu sounds awesome in theory, it seems to run counter one of McDonald's plans: simplifying the overstuffed menu. McDonald's maintains that to restore momentum in the U.S., it is \\"diligently working\\" to simplify the menu. However, in an October survey, the vast majority of franchisees stated that McDonald's had failed so far to fulfill its promise to streamline the menu, something that has been on the company's to-do list for about a year. Regain China's trust. McDonald's U.S. same-store sales slump is disturbing for the chain in large part because there is no one problem the brand can focus on. At least in Asia, McDonald's knows what the issue is. The scandal surrounding a McDonald's supplier selling expired meat has continued to damage McDonald's performance in Japan and China. Currently, the chain hopes to fix the problem by leveraging menu options and deals, but ultimately the only fix is to wait it out. Yum Brands, who was also affected by the meat supplier scandal, estimated in October that recovery in the region would take at least six to nine months. So, internationally at least, it’s a waiting game for McDonald's.

Question: What mindset is more abstract? Context: In the late 19th and early 20th century several forms of pragmatic philosophy arose. The ideas of pragmatism, in its various forms, developed mainly from discussions between Charles Sanders Peirce and William James when both men were at Harvard in the 1870s. James popularized the term \\"pragmatism\\", giving Peirce full credit for its patrimony, but Peirce later demurred from the tangents that the movement was taking, and redubbed what he regarded as the original idea with the name of \\"pragmaticism\\". Along with its pragmatic theory of truth, this perspective integrates the basic insights of empirical (experience-based) and rational (concept-based) thinking.

Michael Gledhill, the driver involved in the accident, was found guilty of dangerous driving in October, subsequent to Mr. Radford's death. He was later charged with causing death by dangerous driving. Gledhill, 24, from Bramble Bank, Holmfirth, was informed of his sentencing date, set for 12th January, by Leeds Crown Court. The court had been informed of the events leading up to the accident, stating that an exchange of words had occurred between Mr. Radford and Gledhill through Gledhill's driver's side window while they were both traveling on the A616 road on the 31st of July, 2013. This altercation resulted in contact between Gledhill's car and Radford's bike, causing the latter to fall into the road and suffer extensive brain damage. After the incident, Radford's friend and fellow cyclist, Martyn Bolt, expressed his sorrow at the untimely passing of John Radford, who was an expert in cycling. According to Bolt, Radford had been at the right place in the road while cycling, but was merely caught at the wrong time, which ultimately led to this unfortunate event. Overall, the article highlights the dangers of road disputes and the catastrophic consequences that can result from aggressive driving behavior. Given that John Radford was an active participant in a campaign calling for improved investigation of road accidents, his tragic death serves as a reminder of the urgent need to address road safety issues and ensure that both drivers and cyclists alike can travel safely and responsibly."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Advances in technology, events, places, first contacts with new beings, names, dates, etc. ENTERPRISE pretty much disregards much of ST canon. An unfortunate fact for long time serious fans. As one, I assumed that the producers would at least take a look at the first few episodes of TOS and retro back from there -- but no. The phase pistols, like much of the technology, look much more modern than found in TOS. An old style Starfleet laser gun, a slow gold speckle transporter effect -- that's what I expected to see. Also, I did not expect to hear pure beep-based sound effects similar to TNG but far apart from TOS sound effects. In the earliest view of TOS (the original pilot: THE CAGE), we see a Starfleet with a more formal military aspect -- a bit of old earth Navy. With ENTERPRISE, we see a shocking disregard for rank. There is more military code in the cartoon STAR BLAZERS than in ENTERPRISE. It is fine that Captain Archer is unsure about the needs of the Universe (quite unlike Kirk who never lacked confidence in his application of human justice), but inside ENTERPRISE everyone seems like an equal. Unprofessional, unsure, more distant from the feel of formal military service than found in any ST series -- and that says a lot! The casual country music opening theme song heralds the journeys of a family rather than the adventures of an important large military vessel. ENTERPRISE looks to show us a mostly fun, warm-fuzzy exploration of human relationships rather than take us on a historic, bold, gritty, high-rick exploration of space. I would have selected Adrian Paul to play the Captain and an older human to be the doctor. Still, I liked the actors for the most part.

When a car salesman says they got to go talk to their boss about an offer, are they in the back doing that or is it just a negotiation tactic? Do those questions have the same meaning? Select from the following. - no; - yes;","completion":"I will first answer both questions separately and then determine whether they have the same meaning or not. Question 1: What is the difference between a sales engineer and a salesman? Step 1: Understand the terms \\"sales engineer\\" and \\"salesman\\". Step 2: Compare the duties, responsibilities, and required skills of both roles. Step 3: Provide the key differences between the two roles. Sales engineers are professionals who specialize in selling complex products or services, usually in the technology or industrial sectors. They possess strong technical expertise and understanding of the product and its features. This allows them to explain the benefits clearly to customers and help them make informed decisions. Salesmen do not necessarily have in-depth technical knowledge about the products they sell and might focus on promoting the product's highlights or benefits to customers. They rely on communication, negotiation, and persuasion skills. Key differences between the two roles include responsibilities, technical knowledge, and the scope of the products they sell. Question 2: When a car salesman says they got to go talk to their boss about an offer, are they in the back doing that, or is it just a negotiation tactic? Step 1: Understand the context of the question. Step 2: Consider the possible reasons behind the statement. Step 3: Explain whether it is a genuine action or a negotiation tactic. When a car salesman says they need to talk to their boss about an offer, it can be either a genuine action or a negotiation tactic. In some cases, they may consult their manager to get approval for a lower price or special deal to close the sale. However, it can also be a negotiation tactic where the salesman creates a sense of authority for their manager, giving them time to assess the customer's limits and expectations before returning with a counteroffer. Now, I will determine if the two questions have the same meaning. Step 1: Analyze the subject matter of both questions. Step 2: Compare the context and themes in both questions. Step 3: Determine if the questions share a common meaning. The first question focuses on the differences between two professional roles, while the second question relates to a specific scenario involving a car salesman and their negotiation tactics. The two questions do not have the same meaning, as they discuss different subject matters.

As emergency personnel work to reach some victims trapped underground, one rescuer tries to keep the victims calm by telling the story of how he came to have five fathers, all killed during the Great Patriotic War (World War II). The trapped victims are young German students and the rescuers are Russian. In 1942, after the initial attack on Stalingrad, a small group of Russian soldiers take cover in a large five story residential building that happens to provide cover for a Russian crossing point on the Volga river. Five of these soldiers become the five fathers in the story: Polyakov (\\"Angel\\") who had become embittered when his wife and daughter were killed in an air raid; Chvanov, whose hatred of the Germans comes from their cruel treatment and methodical murder of his family; Nikiforov, a talented tenor singer before the war, who had become a cruel and vicious fighter; Sergey, drafted into the war as a spotter; and Captain Gromov, a veteran and hero who leads the group after finding them. The soldiers encounter a young girl named Katya, living alone in the building after her family had been killed. As they spend the next few days together, the soldiers grow fond of her, and she of them. Germans encamped near the crossing are led by Hauptmann Kahn; a highly decorated, but disillusioned soldier who falls in love with a Russian woman named Masha, who resembles his late wife. She at first detests him, but soon begins to reciprocate his love, although they cannot speak each other's language. Oberstleutnant Henze arrives to take command of the Germans.

Kun ihmiset voivat esittää mielipiteitään ja vastaanottaa tietoa vapaasti, se auttaa heitä muodostamaan omia mielipiteitään ja osallistumaan yhteiskuntaan ja päätöksentekoon aktiivisesti ja vastuullisesti. Sananvapaus ja mielipiteen vapaus ovat erityisen tärkeitä ihmisoikeuksien kannalta. Ne mahdollistavat käsitysten, ajatusten ja tietojen jakamisen ja vaihdon, mikä edistää yhteiskunnallista ja kulttuurista kehitystä sekä demokraattista ymmärtämystä ja yhteenkuuluvuutta. Vapaissa ja demokraattisissa yhteiskunnissa kansalaisilla on oikeus ilmaista mielipiteensä vapaasti, ilman pelkoa siitä, että heitä rajoitetaan tai rangaistaan laittomasti. Tämä ei kuitenkaan tarkoita, että sananvapaus olisi ehdoton oikeus. Sen sijaan on olemassa tiettyjä rajoituksia, kuten laki määrää, esimerkiksi silloin, kun on tarpeen suojella muiden oikeuksia ja mainetta tai puolustaa kansallista turvallisuutta, yleistä järjestystä ja moraalia. Lopuksi, jos haluamme varmistaa, että mielipiteen- ja sananvapaus todella toteutuu demokraattisessa yhteiskunnassa, meidän on myös huolehdittava siitä, että vahvistamme tiedotusvälineiden moniarvoisuutta ja riippumattomuutta sekä taistelemme väärää tietoa ja sensuuria vastaan. Näin voimme rakentaa avoimempaa, vapaampaa ja demokraattisempaa yhteiskuntaa, jossa ihmisoikeuksien ja perusvapauksien kunnioittaminen on keskeinen periaate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The loquacious Texas Republican, with a penchant for memorable speeches, criticized President Barack Obama's executive orders on immigration Thursday by adapting an address from the orator Cicero, warning of the demise of the Roman Republic. \\"The words of Cicero, powerfully relevant 2077 years later,\\" the conservative said on the Senate floor. \\"When President Obama do you mean to cease abusing our patience. How long is that madness of yours still to mock us. When is there to be an end to that unbridled audacity of yours, swaggering about as it does now,\\" Cruz intoned. She said the speech, which ran about four minutes, is \\"almost verbatim\\" to how","completion":"Cicero delivered it in 63 BC in the Roman Senate, passionately addressing the threat posed by the radical leader Catiline, who he believed was subverting the republic, undermining the rule of law, and ultimately leading to its downfall. Cruz's reference to the ancient orator serves as a stark reminder of the dangers that political leaders face when they attempt to overstep their bounds and undermine the foundations of democracy, as he clearly insinuates President Obama has done with his executive orders. Drawing on the historical significance and impact of Cicero's speech, the Senator from Texas uses it as a powerful tool in underlining the importance of preserving America's democratic values and upholding the Constitution. In a deeply polarized political environment, Cruz's choice of rhetoric might be seen as an attempt to bridge the gap between parties and unite them under a common cause – the protection of the American Republic. Cruz's decision to invoke Cicero can be interpreted in several ways. On one hand, he might be seen as paying homage to the classical roots of American democracy, with an intent to assert the continuity between ancient Rome and contemporary America, both being powerful republics with strong political institutions. On the other hand, the reference to Cicero highlights a prevalent issue in the American political debate: the challenge of balancing executive power and respecting the principle of separation of powers. As the debate on immigration policy continues to divide the Senate, Cruz's speech emphasizes the need for legislators to address the issue carefully and with respect for the constitutional limits placed upon their authority. In this respect, the comparison between Obama's actions and the threats posed by Catiline can be seen as a cautionary tale – a reminder of the dangerous consequences that may result from reckless political decisions. Whether one agrees or disagrees with Cruz's perspective on immigration, it is clear that his use of Cicero's words highlights the ongoing relevance of ancient political wisdom in the contemporary context. While some may criticize Cruz as being overly dramatic in his apparent equating of Obama's actions with the collapse of the Roman Republic, others may see it as a fitting tribute to the ongoing battle for the soul of America and the importance of maintaining a careful balance of power. Regardless of personal opinions, the Senator's speech, steeped in historical resonance and eloquent rhetoric, serves as a poignant reminder of the longstanding American tradition of building upon the rich intellectual legacy of ancient philosophers and statesmen in the pursuit of democratic ideals. It reflects the fragile nature of republics and the dangers of undermining their foundational principles. In sum, Senator Ted Cruz's adaptation of Cicero's address on the Senate floor underscores the enduring power of classical rhetoric in American politics and serves as a cautionary tale about the potential dangers of executive overreach. The historical and symbolic weight of the speech, delivered \\"almost verbatim\\" to the original, offers a timely reminder of the significance of preserving the core principles that underpin American democracy – in the face of divisive issues such as immigration policy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The road to late president Hugo Chavez's final resting place in Caracas showed just how impoverished ordinary Venezuelans are, as parade pictures showed some of the most dangerous slums on the planet. While tens of thousands of mourners lined the streets to mourn former President Chavez's passage to the museum where he will be displayed indefinitely, it highlighted how severe problems in Venezuela are for who ever will lead the country next. Mr Chavez, who ruled for 14 years, died of cancer last week. Chavez's legacy: The funeral route of Venezuela's late President Hugo Chavez revealed the horrifying conditions in which many Venezuelans live. Tens of thousands of Venezuelans. gathered along that route today to watch the late president's body. cross the city in another choreographed show designed to keep Chavez. supporters in thrall, at least until an April 14 election scheduled to. replace him. All along the funeral route were. unmistakable signs that this 28 million-person country is not only. unsafe, but that its basic services no longer work. The parade showed bridges in dire need of repair and food shops looking sparse and understocked. Vying for power: Venezuela's acting President Nicolas Maduro drives a military vehicle while his Foreign Minister Elias Jaua (top centre), president of Congress Diosdado Cabello (top left) and other members of his government lead the funeral parade. Crumbling apartment towers and food lines often shared the pavement with cheering crowds eager to greet their departed Comandante. 'More than anything, the government continues fighting with everyone, and does everything badly,' said Francisco Olivero, a 54-year-old carpenter who lives with his wife and five children in the poor neighborhood of Catia, a few streets from the funeral route. Like many Venezuelans, Olivero said wartime-levels of street violence all over the city were his top worry. 'They kill people here every day,' he said. 'I've lost friends, relatives.' Elaborate mourning: Onlookers throw confetti as his body was being transferred from a military academy, where it has been lying in state, to the military museum. As thousands of bused-in police academy cadets gathered along the route, Olivero and his wife Yelitza Acuna were waiting in line to buy flour, coffee, butter and other food staples that they said have been hard to come by for about two years. The shop, which sat along the most trafficked part of the route, drew a crowd of people desperate for a few bags of flour. 'The word spread in the street, and we all came running here,' said Oliver's wife, Yelitza Acuna, a cook's assistant. Economists say government-imposed price controls designed to dampen inflation topping 20 percent have made it impossible for shop owners to sell basic foods at a profit, sparking widespread shortages. Pomp and ceremony: The presidential guard soldiers carry the coffin at the start of a procession in which Venezuelans lined up to bid their last farewell to Hugo Chavez. In the background a portrait of independence hero Simon Bolivar. Officials have accused suppliers of hoarding the goods and have invaded warehouses looking for sugar, flour and other food items in short supply. 'You can't find anything,' said 27-year-old lawyer Anglys Bericote, who rode a bus for four hours from the town of Cajigal to view the funeral cortege. Wearing a heart-shaped 'I am Chavez' badge, she said she was taking the opportunity to also stock up on basic goods. People in her town have even had to go without toothpaste and toilet paper, she said. 'It's all the plan of the private businesses,' she said, repeating the government's line of attack. 'They want to hold onto everything so that it riles up people.' A few blocks from the military museum, Jonathan Rodriguez watched government supporters pass by in red T-shirts bearing Chavez's image. Raw sewage trickled from a broken pipe down the street, and the 37-year-old insurance agent scolded his two sons for playing nearby. Lying in state: Religious and political ceremonies were held at the military museum, attended by Mr Chavez's chosen successor Nicolas Maduro. 'The majority of them don't complain about the problems here,' Rodriguez whispered about the passing Chavez supporters. 'It's as if they didn't exist.' Rodriguez said he doesn't have that luxury. Violent crime is so bad in his part of town that he and his family shut themselves inside their home every night by 6 p.m., only opening the iron gate covering his front door the next morning. Yet for Rodriguez, staying indoors might not be enough to protect him and his family from the war outside. Several weeks ago, a stray bullet penetrated the zinc roof of a neighbor's house. Almost all of Caracas' streets empty of people by dusk as residents with a homicide rate 20 times that of the United States. On Thursday, the U.N. Development Programme issued a study finding Venezuela had the world's fifth highest homicide rate, behind Honduras, El Salvador, the Ivory Coast and Jamaica. Many believe the police are a big part of the problem. Death of a strong leader: Chavez's brothers Adam Chavez, left, and Anibal Chavez, right carried his coffin, while thousands of people lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the hearse. In an astounding revelation, former Justice Minister Tareck El Aissami said in 2009 that police were responsible for up to 20 per cent of the country's crimes. 'I just stay inside now,' Rodriguez said. 'Outside, it's not safe.' The hills around the military academy are covered with bare-brick slums. More Venezuelans have moved into such slums during Chavez's government, casualties of a housing deficit that the human rights group Provea estimates at 2 million units. Official figures show the number of houses deemed \\"inadequate\\" in the country grew from 295,000 in 1999 to more than 404,000 in 2011. The growth of such neighborhoods has contributed to other problems. Due to crumbling or inexistent infrastructure, sewage all over the city goes mainly to one place: the once-pristine Guaire River, which runs along most of Chavez's funeral route. In 2005, Chavez had famously promised that Venezuelans would one day be able to swim in its waters. Trying to do that today would be nothing less than life-threatening. Military might: Hugo Chavez was keen to show off his army credentials at parades in Caracas. Retired truck driver Miguel Mosquera said he remembered the idyllic scene there decades ago, when the river was a perfect place to spend a sunny day. He lives in the neighborhood of San Antonio, close to the river and within sight of the funeral route. 'The city grew too much,' the 67-year-old said. 'In the 30s and in the 40s, people bathed in this river. ... Here, when it rains, it's chaos, you see that the river sometimes spills over when it rains.' Jose Leal, who had stopped by a bakery near the route, said he had given up on any change under the current government, led by Chavez's hand-picked successor Nicolas Maduro. 'It isn't easy, brother,' Leal said as Chavez supporters headed to the river to watch the cortege pass. 'It's worrying. It creates stress, stress in the family, stress at work.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"The funeral procession route of late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in 2013 revealed the impoverished and dangerous living conditions faced by many Venezuelans.

Government-imposed price controls aimed at curbing its soaring inflation rate have made it challenging for businesses to sell essential goods at a profit, resulting in widespread shortages. Furthermore, violent crime rates in the country have skyrocketed, with a homicide rate twenty times higher than the United States.

Given the two facts above, what can feed at more than one trophic level? A:","completion":"Given the two statements, we can understand that both consumers and plants have the potential to feed at more than one trophic level. It's important to understand the concepts of trophic levels and the roles of organisms in an ecosystem to provide a detailed analysis. Trophic levels refer to the position an organism occupies in a food chain or a food web. In an ecosystem, there are mainly four trophic levels: 1. Producers (or autotrophs) 2. Primary consumers (or herbivores) 3. Secondary consumers (or carnivores) 4. Tertiary consumers (or top carnivores) Now, let's discuss the given facts and their implications in detail: Fact 1: Many consumers feed at more than one trophic level. This fact suggests that certain consumers in an ecosystem have diverse feeding habits or preferences. Such organisms are usually omnivores. Omnivores, like humans, bears, and some birds, can consume both plant and animal matter. They play a vital role in controlling the populations of both primary consumers (herbivores) and secondary consumers (carnivores) and contributing to nutrient cycling and energy flow in an ecosystem. Fact 2: Plants are producers, and consumers are omnivores. This statement needs a slight correction to make it more coherent. Plants are indeed producers, as they use photosynthesis to produce their own food from sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. On the other hand, consumers can be classified as herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores. Herbivores consume plant matter, carnivores feed on other animals, and omnivores consume both plants and animals. Given these facts, the answer to the question \\"what can feed at more than one trophic level?\\" can be elaborated as follows: 1. Omnivorous consumers: As they eat both plants and animals, omnivores feed at more than one trophic level. They often occupy the second and third trophic levels as primary and secondary (or even tertiary) consumers, depending on their feeding habits. Examples of omnivores include humans, pigs, and certain species of fish and birds. 2. Detritivores and decomposers: A special mention should be made to detritivores and decomposers like earthworms, fungi, and bacteria. Although they do not necessarily fit into the conventional trophic levels, these organisms feed on dead plants and animals, breaking them down and returning nutrients to the ecosystem. This process of nutrient recycling blurs the lines between trophic levels, as these decomposers can feed on the remains of organisms from multiple trophic levels. In summary, organisms that can feed at more than one trophic level mainly include omnivores, as well as detritivores and decomposers. Their ability to consume a wide range of food sources offers them a flexible and adaptive advantage, which helps maintain balance and stability in the ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information: - A light-year is a unit of length used to express astronomical distances. It is about 9 trillion kilometres or 6 trillion miles. As defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), a light-year is the distance that light travels in vacuum in one Julian year (365.25 days). Because it includes the word \\"year\\", the term light-year is sometimes misinterpreted as a unit of time. - Amazing Stories is an American science fiction magazine launched in April 1926 by Hugo Gernsback's Experimenter Publishing. It was the first magazine devoted solely to science fiction. Science fiction stories had made regular appearances in other magazines, including some published by Gernsback, but \\"Amazing\\" helped define and launch a new genre of pulp fiction. - A planetary system is a set of gravitationally bound non-stellar objects in orbit around a star or star system. Generally speaking, systems with one or more planets constitute a planetary system, although such systems may also consist of bodies such as dwarf planets, asteroids, natural satellites, meteoroids, comets, planetesimals and circumstellar disks. The Sun together with its planetary system, which includes Earth, is known as the Solar System. The term exoplanetary system is sometimes used in reference to other planetary systems. - The Skylark of Space by Edward E. \`\` Doc '' Smith was written between 1915 and 1921 while Smith was working on his doctorate . Though the original idea for the novel was Smith 's , he co-wrote the first part of the novel with Lee Hawkins Garby , the wife of his college classmate and later neighbor Carl Garby . The Skylark of Space is considered to be one of the earliest novels of interstellar travel and the first example of space opera . Originally serialized in 1928 in the magazine Amazing Stories , it was first published in book form in 1946 by the Buffalo Book Co. - Lee Hawkins Garby (18921953) was the co-author with Edward Elmer Smith of the 1928 serial novel \\"The Skylark of Space\\", the first science fiction story in which humans left the solar system. She was the wife of Dr. Carl DeWitt Garby, a friend of Dr. Smith's from college at the University of Idaho. - Hugo Gernsback (August 16, 1884 August 19, 1967), born Hugo Gernsbacher, was a Luxembourgish-American inventor, writer, editor, and magazine publisher, best known for publications including the first science fiction magazine. His contributions to the genre as publisher were so significant that, along with the novelists H. G. Wells and Jules Verne, he is sometimes called \\"The Father of Science Fiction\\". In his honour, annual awards presented at the World Science Fiction Convention are named the \\"Hugos\\". - Experimenter Publishing was an American media company founded by Hugo Gernsback in 1915. The first magazine was \\"The Electrical Experimenter\\" (19131931) and the most notable magazines were \\"Radio News\\" (19191985) and \\"Amazing Stories\\" (19262005). Their radio station, WRNY, began broadcasting experimental television in 1928. In early 1929 the company was forced into bankruptcy and the Gernsback brothers lost control of Experimenter Publishing. The magazines did not miss an issue and were quickly sold to another publisher. The Gernsbacks promptly started new magazines to compete with their former ones. - Interstellar travel is the term used for hypothetical piloted or unpiloted travel between stars or planetary systems. Interstellar travel will be much more difficult than interplanetary spaceflight; the distances between the planets in the Solar System are less than 30 astronomical units (AU)whereas the distances between stars are typically hundreds of thousands of AU, and usually expressed in light-years. Because of the vastness of those distances, interstellar travel would require a high percentage of the speed of light, huge travel time, lasting from decades to millennia or longer, or a combination of both.

He also refused to sell Wadiya's oil fields, a promise he made to his father on his deathbed. After the United Nations Security Council resolves to intervene militarily, Aladeen travels to the UN Headquarters in New York to address the council. Shortly after arriving, Aladeen is kidnapped by Clayton (John C.

Tamir then replaces Aladeen with a dimwitted political decoy named Efawadh (Baron Cohen), whom he intends to manipulate into signing a document nominally democratizing Wadiya while opening the country's oil fields to Chinese and other foreign vested interests.

It was printed by Kids Can Press in 1985 and published by Everbest in Hong Kong .","completion":"These two sentences do not have the same meaning, as they convey different information about which company performed what function in the publication process. Here's a breakdown of their differences: 1. In the first sentence, the meaning is: - Publisher: Kids Can Press - Printing Company: Everbest - Location: Hong Kong - Year: 1985 The first sentence tells us that the book was published by Kids Can Press in 1985 while the printing process was carried out by Everbest in Hong Kong. This sentence emphasizes that Kids Can Press is responsible for the publication and copyright acquisition for the book, which consists of functions like deciding on the content, working with the author(s), editing, and designing the cover. Everbest, on the other hand, is responsible for the actual production—physically printing and binding the book. 2. In the second sentence, the meaning is: - Publisher: Everbest - Printing Company: Kids Can Press - Location: Hong Kong - Year: 1985 The second sentence reverses the roles of the two companies: it states that Kids Can Press printed the book in 1985, while Everbest published it in Hong Kong. In this case, Everbest is responsible for the publication tasks, whereas Kids Can Press is responsible for the book's physical production. In summary, the two sentences are not synonymous because they convey different information regarding the roles of the companies involved in the process.

Movie title: Murder by Death Movie plot: A group of detectives, each accompanied by a relative or associate, is invited to \\"dinner and a murder\\" by the mysterious Lionel Twain (Truman Capote). Having lured his guests to his mansion (the address of which is shown early on as \\"22 Lola Lane\\" and spoken later as \\"Two-Two Twain\\") managed by a blind butler and a deaf-mute cook, named Yvetta (Nancy Walker), Twain announces that it is in fact he who is the greatest detective in the world. In order to prove his claim, he challenges the guests to solve a murder which will take place in the house at midnight that very night; a reward of 1 million will be presented to the winner.Before midnight, the butler is found dead, and at midnight Twain himself appears, also dead; the cook is discovered to have been an animated mannequin, now packed in a storage crate. The party spends the rest of the evening investigating, dining and bickering. They are manipulated by a mysterious behind-the-scenes force, confused by red herrings, baffled by the \\"mechanical marvel\\" that is Twain's house and ultimately find their own lives threatened. The ending piles on twist after twist as each sleuth presents his or her theory on the case.After a brutal night during which one pair is almost killed by a snake, another by a scorpion, another by a falling ceiling, a fourth by poison gas and the fifth by a bomb, they all collect in the office where the butler... believed to have been murdered earlier... is sitting behind the desk very much alive and not at all blind: \\"The butler did it\\". However, each detective then claims that the butler is in fact various incarnations of Twain's associates (such as Irving Goldman or Marvin Metzger) or even his daughter. At first the butler plays the part of each of the persons with whom he's identified, but then pulls off a mask to reveal Lionel Twain himself, very much alive.

Context: Hoping to rebound from their divisional road loss to the Texans, the Titans went home for a crucial Week 16 battle with the Pittsburgh Steelers, with the AFC's top seed on the line. After a scoreless first quarter, the Titans got the second quarter lead as kicker Rob Bironas got a 42-yard field goal, along with quarterback Kerry Collins completing a 34-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Justin Gage. The Steelers would respond with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger completing a 31-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Santonio Holmes. In the third quarter, Pittsburgh took the lead as Roethlisberger completed a 21-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Hines Ward, yet Tennessee struck back with rookie running back Chris Johnson getting a 21-yard touchdown run. The Titans would then pull away in the fourth quarter with running back LenDale White's 1-yard touchdown run and safety Michael Griffin's 83-yard interception return for a touchdown. This was the first game of the year where the league-leading Steelers defense allowed more than 300 yards of total offense (allowing 332 yards). With the win, not only did Tennessee improve to 13-2, but they also locked up the AFC's #1 seed. This would be the Titans last win until Week 8 of the 2009 season.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Pitchford was born in Honolulu, where he attended Catholic schools, graduating in 1968 from Saint Louis High School. He began his performance career as an actor and a singer with the Honolulu Community Theatre (now Diamond Head Theatre), the Honolulu Symphony Orchestra and the Honolulu Theatre for Youth, among others. While studying at Yale University, Pitchford performed with numerous campus drama groups, but his focus gradually turned off-campus, where he worked with the Wooster Square Revival, an experimental theatre company that offered acting opportunities to recovering addicts and alcoholics. In 1969, Pitchford returned to Honolulu as an assistant to authors Faye Hammel and Sylvan Levey in updating the popular guidebook Hawai'i on 5 and 10 A Day, and researching Trans World Airlines' Budget Guide to Hawai'i, the first of a series of guidebooks that would eventually turn into the popular series TWA Getaway Guides. Inspired by a 1979 news story about Elmore City, Oklahoma, a town which had finally lifted an 80-year-old ban on dancing, Pitchford wrote the screenplay for the motion picture Footloose (1984). He collaborated on the nine-song score with Kenny Loggins, Eric Carmen, Jim Steinman, Sammy Hagar and others. The film, directed by Herbert Ross, opened at #1 and was, at the time, the highest-grossing February release in film history. When the soundtrack album hit #1 on the Billboard album charts, it deposed Michael Jackson's Thriller and held that position for 10 weeks. It went on top charts all over the world, eventually selling more than 17 million albums. Kenny Loggins's single of the title song hit #1 on March 31, 1984, and stayed there for three weeks. Five weeks later (May 26, 1984) Deniece Williams's \\"Let's Hear It for the Boy\\" went to #1, as well. Four more songs from the soundtrack charted in the Top 40; \\"Almost Paradise,\\" which reached #7, was co-written with Eric Carmen, and was performed by Mike Reno of Loverboy and Ann Wilson of Heart; \\"Dancing in the Sheets,\\" which reached #17, was co-written with Bill Wolfer, and was performed by Shalamar; \\"I'm Free (Heaven Helps the Man),\\" which reached #22 and, like the film's title track, was co-written with, and performed by, Kenny Loggins; and \\"Holding Out for a Hero,\\" which reached #34, was co-written with Jim Steinman, and was performed by Bonnie Tyler. \\"Footloose\\" was nominated for a Golden Globe as Best Song; and \\"Footloose\\" and \\"Let's Hear It for the Boy\\" (co-written with Tom Snow) both received Academy Awards nominations (1985). Pitchford received two Grammy nominations: Best Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media, and Best R&B Song \\"Dancing in the Sheets.\\" Paramount Pictures's remake of Footloose, which was again based on Pitchford's original screenplay and featured six of his songs, was released in October 2011. Blake Shelton had a hit with his re-recording of the title song. Next Pitchford wrote the screenplay of, and collaborated on the authorship and composition of all the songs for, the 1989 musical film Sing. whose soundtrack did Footloose overthrow?","completion":"When the soundtrack album for Footloose hit #1 on the Billboard album charts, it deposed Michael Jackson's Thriller."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Quinn was the pastor at their church, so Quinn gave glory to god. Given the context: Why did Quinn do this? Possible answers: be blasphemous, give a sermon, praise the lord The answer is:","completion":"Quinn did this to praise the Lord. As the pastor at their church, Quinn plays a significant role in guiding the congregation and fostering a sense of community among its members. This is done primarily through the sharing of religious teachings, values, and beliefs, which revolve around giving glory to God. By offering praises and acknowledging the greatness of the Lord, a pastor aims to inspire the congregation to strengthen their faith and live according to the principles of their religion. In Christianity, giving glory to God is considered an act of worship and gratitude, acknowledging His sovereignty, grace, and power over all aspects of life. This act is performed not just by pastors, but also by the entire Christian community. However, as a spiritual leader, Quinn has a special duty and influence in helping others deepen their faith and establish a relationship with God. The other possible answers provided, \\"be blasphemous\\" and \\"give a sermon,\\" are not accurate in this context. To be blasphemous would mean to show a lack of reverence for God or sacred things, which contradicts the role and intention of a pastor like Quinn. While it is true that giving a sermon is an essential part of a pastor's duties, it does not answer the question of why Quinn gave glory to God specifically. A sermon can have various topics and purposes, not exclusively devoted to praising God. However, offering praise to the Lord is an integral aspect of Christian worship that reflects one's devotion and faith in God's goodness and mercy. In summary, the main reason why Quinn, being the pastor at their church, gave glory to God is to praise the Lord. This act of worship allows the congregation to connect with their spirituality and the core beliefs of their faith, while also strengthening their bond as a community. By fulfilling this role, Quinn serves as a guide and support system for others in their spiritual journey, encouraging the congregation to live in accordance with the teachings of their religion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

At the time of the transfer of power, the state of Jammu and Kashmir (widely called \\"Kashmir\\") was ruled by Maharaja Hari Singh, a Hindu, although the state itself had a Muslim majority. Hari Singh was equally hesitant about acceding to either India or Pakistan, as either would have provoked adverse reactions in parts of his kingdom. He signed a Standstill Agreement with Pakistan and proposed one with India as well, but announced that Kashmir intended to remain independent. However, his rule was opposed by Sheikh Abdullah, the popular leader of Kashmir's largest political party, the National Conference, who demanded his abdication.Pakistan, attempting to force the issue of Kashmir's accession, cut off supplies and transport links. The chaos in Punjab resulting from Partition had also severed transport links with India, meaning that Kashmir's only links with the two dominions was by air. Rumours about atrocities against the Muslim population of Poonch by the Maharajah's forces caused the outbreak of civil unrest. Shortly thereafter, Pathan tribesmen from the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan crossed the border and entered Kashmir. The invaders made rapid progress towards Srinagar. The Maharaja of Kashmir wrote to India, asking for military assistance. India required the signing of an Instrument of Accession and setting up an interim government headed by Sheikh Abdullah in return. The Maharaja complied, but Nehru declared that it would have to be confirmed by a plebiscite, although there was no legal requirement to seek such confirmation.Indian troops secured Jammu, Srinagar and the valley itself during the First Kashmir War, but the intense fighting flagged with the onset of winter, which made much of the state impassable.

He puts a bottle in the freezer but leaves it in too long so it freezes. Being impatient he then takes the bottle and runs it under soe hot water for a few minutes. But I can use this background: Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table below compares melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds. What is an answer for this question: Will the energy of the water molecules in the bottle increase or decrease when Andrew runs hot water on the bottle? A:","completion":"The energy of the water molecules in the bottle will increase when Andrew runs hot water on the bottle. This is because the hot water adds energy to the frozen water in the bottle, causing the molecules to gain energy and break the hydrogen bonds. This leads to a change of state from solid to liquid as the ice melts."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Which of these two canals was built first: Junction Canal or Duluth Ship Canal? Answer:","completion":"After conducting extensive research, it is determined that among the two canals you mentioned – the Junction Canal and the Duluth Ship Canal – the first canal to be built was the Junction Canal. The Junction Canal, whose construction began around the early 1800s, predates the establishment of the Duluth Ship Canal. Initially, construction on the Junction Canal began in order to improve transportation, trade, and communication networks in the area. By connecting waterways of entire regions, building these canals created valuable and efficient navigational paths for transporting resources throughout the country. On the other hand, the Duluth Ship Canal was built much later in the 19th century, beginning in 1870 and completed in 1871. It was mainly constructed to ease water transportation in and out of Duluth, Minnesota. Located at the very western end of Lake Superior, the Duluth Ship Canal allows ships to access the adjacent natural harbor, which eventually spurred rapid growth in the local economy, trade, and commerce. The construction of the Duluth Ship Canal was spearheaded by some of Duluth's prominent citizens when they were denied funds by the federal government for dredging the St. Louis River. The canal was initially a narrow passage measuring just 30 feet wide and six feet deep. However, it was eventually funded and maintained by the federal government, who acknowledged its strategic importance. Over the years, the canal has been widened and deepened to accommodate the ever-increasing ship sizes and traffic. Today, the Duluth Ship Canal features the Aerial Lift Bridge, an iconic symbol of the city, built in 1905. In summary, the Junction Canal was built before the Duluth Ship Canal, and it played a crucial role in improving transportation and trade networks in the early nineteenth century. On the other hand, the Duluth Ship Canal had a significant impact in shaping the city of Duluth, Minnesota, and promoting commerce and economic growth in the area. Both canals hold historical significance for their respective regions and have contributed to the development of the United States' broader transportation and trade sectors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

People often give up something they enjoy or a bad habit to demonstrate self-discipline and focus on their spiritual growth. Some common examples of what people give up for Lent include: 1. Sweets and sugary foods 2. Fast food or junk food 3. Alcohol 4. Caffeine 5. Social media or excessive screen time 6. Smoking 7. Negative thinking or complaining 8. Gossiping 9. Procrastination 10.

The verdict is about to be given on the accused killer from Series 1 when the inevitable happens... Cue title music.

Tokugawa Takes All: When Hideyoshi died in 1598, he hoped to have his five-year-old son continue his \\"dynasty,\\" initially under the tutelage of five regents. But one of the regents was Ieyasu Tokugawa, who had been biding his time at Edo for 12 years, nurturing dynastic ambitions of his own. Of the cunning, ruthless triumvirate that came out on top at the end of the country's century of civil war, Tokugawa was without doubt the most patient, the most prudent — and most treacherous. He moved quickly to eliminate his strongest rivals, crushing them in 1600 at the great Battle of Sekigahara (near modern Nagoya). During its subsequent two and a half centuries of rule from the new capital established at Edo, the Tokugawa organized a tightly controlled coalition of some 260 daimyo in strategic strongholds throughout the country. The allegiance of this highly privileged and prestigious group was ensured by cementing their ethical principles in the code of bushido, \\"The way of the warrior\\": loyalty to one's master, defense of one's status and honor, and fulfillment of all obligations. Loyalty was further enforced by holding the vassals' wives and children hostage in Edo. All roads into Edo, the most famous being the Tokaido Highway, had checkpoints for guns coming in and for wives going out. One of the most effective ways of keeping a tight rein on the country was to cut it off from the outside world, to keep Japan Japanese. At first, Ieyasu Tokugawa was eager to promote foreign trade. He wanted silk and encouraged the Dutch and British as good, nonproselytizing Protestants just interested in trade. But he didn't like the Portuguese and Spanish Catholic missionaries, who he felt were undermining traditional Japanese values. He banned their activities in 1612 and two years later ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts. Executions and torture followed. Converts were forced to renounce their faith by trampling crucifixes and effigies of Jesus and Mary. The Catholic Church has counted 3,125 martyrs in Japan from 1597 (beginning under Hideyoshi) to 1660. In 1635 the Japanese were forbidden, on pain of death, to attempt to travel abroad, and Japanese citizens already overseas were prevented from returning, in case they brought back subversive Christian doctrines. Western books were banned, as were Chinese books that mentioned Christianity. After reading the above, is \\"Portugese\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Who wanted silk and also encouraged the Dutch and British as good, non-proselytizing Protestants just interested in trade?\\"?","completion":"No, \\"Portugese\\" would not be the correct answer.

Write an article based on this \\"The Decision Review System (DRS) could be introduced in Twenty20 internationals under new proposals from the International Cricket Council.\\"","completion":"Title: \\"Revolutionizing Twenty20 Cricket: The Potential Introduction of the Decision Review System\\" Introduction The landscape of international cricket is set to witness a potentially significant change with the International Cricket Council (ICC) considering the introduction of the Decision Review System (DRS) in Twenty20 internationals. The DRS, hitherto reserved for Test cricket and One-Day Internationals (ODIs), aims to correct errors in on-field umpiring decisions by allowing teams to challenge specific rulings. With the infusion of technology improving the overall quality and fairness of the sport, the potential inclusion of the DRS in Twenty20 internationals stands to revolutionize the shortest format of the game. Background of the Decision Review System (DRS) The DRS was introduced in 2008 to minimize errors in on-field umpiring decisions by using advanced technology. By incorporating tools such as ball-tracking technology, infra-red imaging, audio sensors, and ultra-motion video analysis (among others), the DRS plays a critical role in ensuring a level playing field. Each team involved in a match is permitted a limited number of reviews, subject to successful challenges. The system is designed to aid umpires in adjudicating controversial or difficult decisions accurately, reducing the influence of human error in determining the outcome of matches. Benefits of introducing DRS in Twenty20 internationals 1. Improved Accuracy and Fairness: With the introduction of the DRS in Twenty20 internationals, the chances of incorrect decisions impacting the outcome of matches would be significantly reduced. This can increase the level of fairness in these high-stakes games, which often hinge on key moments or close decisions. 2. Enhanced Fan Experience: With the dramatic and high-tempo nature of Twenty20 internationals already appealing to cricket enthusiasts, the addition of the DRS could further enhance the viewing experience. The use of technology to scrutinize umpiring decisions often adds a layer of suspense and intrigue, making it more engaging for spectators both at the stadium and watching on television. 3. Increased Credibility: The DRS has been credited with improving overall confidence in the adjudication process and reducing the influence of human error. By introducing the DRS in Twenty20 internationals, the ICC sends a strong message about ensuring the highest level of accuracy and professionalism in the sport, emphasizing the importance of fairness and credibility. Potential Challenges in Implementing the DRS in Twenty20 Internationals While there are apparent benefits to introducing the DRS to Twenty20 cricket, there are potential challenges that must be taken into consideration. 1. Financial Implications: Using advanced technology to facilitate the DRS can be an expensive proposition. While wealthier cricket boards have readily adopted the DRS in Test and ODI cricket, the financial burden of implementing this system for Twenty20 internationals could be prohibitive for some host nations. 2. Time Constraints: Introducing the DRS in Twenty20 internationals may result in a slight extension of match duration. Given that the main attraction of T20 cricket is its fast-paced, time-efficient nature, any delay in reviewing decisions could potentially hinder the flow of the game. Conclusion The potential introduction of the Decision Review System (DRS) in Twenty20 internationals is a move that can bring a new dimension to the shortest format of cricket, bolstering the reputation of the sport while ensuring a more accurate and fair adjudication process for all participating teams. While challenges like financial constraints and time management need to be addressed, the possibility of engendering a more equitable and engaging experience for fans, players, and administrators alike makes the proposal an exciting prospect for the future of cricket."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: It’s October, which means it’s that time of the year again: flu vaccination time! Back when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.) Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren’t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don’t like needles. Or maybe they aren’t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer “stronger” versions, designed for older adults? I’m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it’s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC’s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I’m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I’m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza. This month, you’ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I’ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns. Here’s what I’ll cover: * The basics of influenza and vaccination against the flu * What to know about flu shots for older adults * What’s new and resources for the 2017-2018 flu...

The SIS II is composed of a central system Central SIS II a Please fix the punctuation.","completion":"The Schengen Information System II (SIS II) is composed of a central system, known as Central SIS II, and multiple national systems that connect to it. SIS II is a sophisticated and secure database that serves as a vital tool for cross-border cooperation among the Schengen member countries. Primarily, it is designed for managing and sharing information related to border security, law enforcement, and visa administration. The Central SIS II, which is the heart of the system, processes, stores, and disseminates information to national systems that are comprised of terminals, workstations, and servers in each member country's competent authorities. Examples of these authorities include border control agencies, police stations, customs offices, and consular posts abroad. Data exchange in SIS II occurs in real-time, enabling prompt action to be taken by the authorities when a match is found between the inserted data and an existing record. To ensure a high level of security, advanced cryptographic techniques are used in the communication between the central system and the national systems. The information stored in SIS II includes categories such as alerts on persons, vehicles, stolen property, and documents. These alerts can be related to criminal investigations, monitoring of suspicious individuals, or missing persons. Additionally, data concerning entry bans, extradition requests, and visa applications are included in the database. The legal framework for the functioning of SIS II comprises of multiple legislative instruments: 1. The Schengen Convention - It sets the foundation for cooperation on border control and law enforcement among its signatory countries. 2. Council Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006 - This regulation establishes the operational features of SIS II while focusing on the exchange of data for monitoring the external borders and coordinating the issuance of short-stay visas. 3.

Fact: a bicycle contains screws Question: Two wheeled conveyances are held together by What's the answer?","completion":"The answer is that two-wheeled conveyances, such as bicycles, are held together by a combination of screws, bolts, and other mechanical fasteners. In detail, bicycles consist of different parts and components that are assembled and connected to create a functional and efficient mode of transportation. These components include the frame, wheels, tires, suspension, gears, brakes, and handlebars, among others. To ensure a strong and reliable bond between these parts, manufacturers make use of various types of screws and bolts, as well as other mechanical fasteners like nuts, washers, and clips. Screws and bolts are primarily used to hold the various components securely in place and to adjust or fine-tune their functioning. For example, screws are used to attach the various parts of the bicycle's frame, like the head tube, top tube, down tube, seat tube, chainstays and seatstays. They also play a crucial role in attaching components like the derailleur, brake calipers, chainring, and pedals to the frame. Different types of screws and bolts are used, depending on the size, material, and function of the particular component to which they are attached. Some common types of screws and bolts on a bicycle include hex bolts, Allen bolts or screws, socket-head screws, flat-head screws, and Phillips head screws. These screws and bolts are typically made from steel, aluminum, or titanium, which provides the necessary strength and durability while still being lightweight. Apart from screws and bolts, other mechanical fasteners, such as nuts, washers, and clips, also play a vital role in maintaining the integrity and performance of a bicycle. Nuts and washers are used with bolts to distribute pressure evenly when tightened, preventing damage to surfaces and improving the fastener's overall performance. Clips, on the other hand, can be used for attaching or securing cables or hoses related to the braking and shifting systems of a bicycle. In summary, two-wheeled conveyances, like bicycles, are held together through the strategic use of screws, bolts, and other mechanical fasteners. These fasteners provide the necessary structural integrity, ensure the smooth functioning of various components, and enable the efficient operation of the vehicle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I consider both Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer to be good at what they do and was interested to see what Dan Reed could come up with but unfortunately it just didn't work for me. The problem lies in the fact that the film doesn't really seem to understand which genre it's falling into and as such it fails to impress on drama, horror and thriller elements because rather than focusing on one of them and doing it well it's a bit of a jack of all trades and master of none. The premise (as with most revenge films) is simple, couple meet and go out, something bad happens and they get their revenge it's a simple formula and one that many directors have handled expertly over the years. Unfotunately in this case it's as if Dan Reed thought, \\"It'd be great to do one of those revenge films that goes a little deeper by showing a more human side to all the characters and delving into their mental state in more detail....\\" Wrong! There are also a few key elements missing, in this type of movie there's generally some kind of warning. A don't do this or this might happen element which adds to the tension but there's nothing of the sort here. It just simply happens, then nothing happens for an hour, then something interesting happens and then it ends. There's a lot of really stiff competition in this genre and hats of to Dan Reed for trying, I have no issue with his directing abilities but in term of writing... I'd say next time he should stick to the formula for the type of film he's making instead of trying to be too clever and he'll have a quality movie on his hands. Choose your answer.

Premise: \\"and um then you put it on a flour like you know you make your meat real um thin you know bite size pieces\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"It's easier to chew the meat when it's cut this way.\\"?","completion":"If the premise \\"and um then you put it on a flour like you know you make your meat real um thin, you know bite size pieces\\" is true, then it suggests that the person speaking has a preference for preparing meat in this specific way. The speaker has mentioned the process of making the meat thin and cutting it into bite-sized portions, which can be analyzed in relation to the hypothesis \\"It's easier to chew the meat when it's cut this way.\\" First, let's consider the fact that the speaker is using the term \\"thin\\" to describe the meat. When meat is prepared in a thin manner, it generally refers to the process of pounding or slicing it to reduce its thickness. This can be accomplished through various methods, such as using a meat tenderizer or a sharp knife, which results in a more delicate texture. Furthermore, thinner meat requires less force to chew and takes less time to break down in one's mouth. Moreover, when it comes to digestion, smaller particles of food are easier for the digestive system to process compared to larger chunks. Second, the reference to \\"bite-size pieces\\" suggests that the person speaking finds this method of cutting meat more convenient for consumption. By cutting the meat into smaller, more manageable portions, it potentially reduces the need for additional cutting during the meal and makes it easier for the person eating to enjoy their food without any hassle. Bite-sized pieces are more comfortable to handle, especially when using utensils such as forks or chopsticks. Now, let's examine the hypothesis, \\"It's easier to chew the meat when it's cut this way.\\" Based on the premise provided, it can be inferred that the preparation process for the mentioned meat (i.e., cutting it thin and into bite-size pieces) results in a more tender and manageable texture. The use of the term \\"easier\\" denotes that there is a comparison being made between different methods or ways of preparing and cutting meat. Since thin, bite-sized pieces require less force to chew and are more comfortable to handle, it is reasonable to assume that this method promotes enhanced ease in consumption, particularly when chewing. In conclusion, the premise provided by the person speaking does seem to entail the hypothesis that cutting meat into thin, bite-sized pieces makes it easier to chew. The preparation process results in tender and manageable portions, which can be more enjoyable and convenient for the person consuming the meat. Hence, it can be reasonably asserted that the premise supports the hypothesis, indicating that cutting meat this way indeed makes it easier to chew."},{"prompt":"Given the question: It was a Saturday in May.

Given the question: Information: - A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet. Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS). Any name registered in the DNS is a domain name. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a domain name represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the Internet, a server computer hosting a web site, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via the Internet. In 2015, 294 million domain names had been registered. - The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is a department of ICANN, a nonprofit private American corporation that oversees global IP address allocation, autonomous system number allocation, root zone management in the Domain Name System (DNS), media types, and other Internet Protocol-related symbols and Internet numbers. - The DNS root zone is the top-level DNS zone in the hierarchical namespace of the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet. - The European Commission (EC) is an institution of the European Union, responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, upholding the EU treaties and managing the day-to-day business of the EU. Commissioners swear an oath at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, pledging to respect the treaties and to be completely independent in carrying out their duties during their mandate. - Cybersquatting (also known as domain squatting), according to the United States federal law known as the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, is registering, trafficking in, or using an Internet domain name with bad faith intent to profit from the goodwill of a trademark belonging to someone else. The cybersquatter then offers to sell the domain to the person or company who owns a trademark contained within the name at an inflated price. - The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for the purpose of locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By providing a worldwide, distributed directory service, the Domain Name System is an essential component of the functionality of the Internet, and has been in use since the 1980s. - EURid vzw / asbl ( European Registry for Internet Domains ) is a non-profit organisation appointed by the European Commission on 8 April 2003 as the domain name registry to operate the new . eu top - level domain . EURid is a consortium of three European ccTLD operators : DNS Belgium ( . be ) , IIT - CNR ( . it ) and NIC - SE ( . se ) . It has been established in Belgium , having its headquarters in Brussels . In October 2006 , they opened their first branch office in Stockholm . Two further branch offices have been opened in Italy and the Czech Republic . There are four associate members : the Academic and Research Network of Slovenia ( ARNES ) , the registry for . si , the national top - level domain for Slovenia , CZ.NIC , the registry for . cz , the national top - level domain for the Czech Republic , ISOC - ECC , the European chapter of the Internet Society , and BUSINESSEUROPE , a confederation of 39 industry - related federations from 33 countries . EURid uses the Extensible Provisioning Protocol ( EPP ) which enables registrars to perform operations on . eu domain names directly . The web site is available in all the official languages of the European Union : Bulgarian , Croatian , Danish , German , Czech , Estonian , English , Spanish , French , Italian , Latvian , Lithuanian , Hungarian , Dutch , Polish , Portuguese , Romanian , Slovak , Finnish , Swedish , Greek , Maltese , Irish and Slovenian . - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. - The Internet Protocol (IP) is the principal communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying datagrams across network boundaries. Its routing function enables internetworking, and essentially establishes the Internet. - A fully qualified domain name (FQDN), sometimes also referred to as an \\"absolute domain name\\", is a domain name that specifies its exact location in the tree hierarchy of the Domain Name System (DNS). It specifies all domain levels, including the top-level domain and the root zone. A fully qualified domain name is distinguished by its lack of ambiguity: it can be interpreted only in one way. - The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a nonprofit organization that is responsible for coordinating the maintenance and procedures of several databases related to the namespaces of the Internet, ensuring the network's stable and secure operation. ICANN performs the actual technical maintenance work of the central Internet address pools and DNS root zone registries pursuant to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) function contract. The contract regarding the IANA stewardship functions between ICANN and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the United States Department of Commerce ended on October 1, 2016, formally transitioning the functions to the global multi-stakeholder community. - A country code top-level domain (ccTLD) is an Internet top-level domain generally used or reserved for a country, sovereign state, or dependent territory identified with a country code. - .eu is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the European Union (EU). Launched on 7 December 2005, the domain is available for organisations in and residents of EU member states. The TLD is administered by EURid, a consortium originally consisting of the national ccTLD registry operators of Belgium, Sweden, and Italy, joined later by the national registry operator of the Czech Republic. Trademark owners were able to submit registrations through a sunrise period, in an effort to prevent cybersquatting. Full registration started on 7 April 2006. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - A top-level domain (TLD) is one of the domains at the highest level in the hierarchical Domain Name System of the Internet. The top-level domain names are installed in the root zone of the name space. For all domains in lower levels, it is the last part of the domain name, that is, the last label of a fully qualified domain name. For example, in the domain name www.example.com, the top-level domain is com. Responsibility for management of most top-level domains is delegated to specific organizations by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which operates the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), and is in charge of maintaining the DNS root zone. - A domain name registry is a database of all domain names and the associated registrant information in the top level domains of the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet that allow third party entities to request administrative control of a domain name. Most registries operate on the top-level and second-level of the DNS. - The European Court of Justice (ECJ), officially just the Court of Justice, is the highest court in the European Union in matters of European Union law. As a part of the Court of Justice of the European Union it is tasked with interpreting EU law and ensuring its equal application across all EU member states. The Court was established in 1952 and is based in Luxembourg. It is composed of one judge per member state currently 28 although it normally hears cases in panels of three, five or 15 judges.

Choices: 1). No; 2). Yes; Answer:","completion":"2). Yes; A PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) port is used for connecting and communicating with various peripheral devices and components within a computer system. The statement \\"Typical PCI cards used in PCs include: network cards, sound cards, modems, extra ports such as USB or serial, TV tuner cards, and disk controllers\\" is indeed a reasonable answer to describe a PCI port's primary function. To provide a more detailed and long answer: A PCI port is a type of hardware interface, designed by Intel, which allows the motherboard to connect and communicate with peripheral devices and components, thereby enhancing the computer system's overall capabilities and performance. The PCI port is often found on the motherboard of most desktop and server computers, enabling the attachment of various peripheral cards known as expansion cards. These cards expand the functionality of a computer system by adding features or capabilities that are not provided by the motherboard. Each PCI port consists of a series of parallel data lines that transmit data between the expansion cards and the operating system (OS) for processing and integration. This enables the OS to manage multiple devices simultaneously and more efficiently, compared to earlier connection methods. Some of the typical PCI cards used in PCs are: 1. Network Cards: Also known as Ethernet cards or network interface cards (NICs), these allow a computer to connect to other computers or devices in a network, either via wired or wireless connections. 2. Sound Cards: These enable a computer to produce and process sound, input audio from external sources, and output audio to speakers, headphones, or other output devices. 3. Modems: Modem cards enable a computer to connect to the internet or transmit data over phone lines, cable lines, or other types of communication lines. 4. Extra Ports: Some PCI cards can provide additional USB or serial ports, enabling a computer to support more peripheral devices or facilitate quicker data transfer between devices. 5. TV Tuner Cards: These cards allow a computer to receive television broadcasts, enabling the user to watch TV shows, record live television, and schedule recordings. 6. Disk Controllers: Disk controller cards enhance data transfer rates, provide support for more advanced storage devices, and increase the number of drives that a computer can support. Thus, a PCI port plays a vital role in expanding a computer system's capabilities and customizability, giving users the freedom to tailor their systems to their unique needs and requirements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The tobacco which is used to make cigarettes was first grown in what is now part of the United States. Christopher Columbus, who discovered America, saw the Indians smoking. Soon the dried leaves were transported to Europe. In the late 1800s, the Turks made cigarettes popular. Cigarette smoke contains at least two harmful substances, tar and nicotine. Tar, which forms as the tobacco burns, damages the lungs and therefore affects breathing. Nicotine, which is found in the leaves, causes the heart to beat faster and increases the breathing rate. Nicotine in large can kill a person by stopping a person's breathing muscles. Smokers usually take in small amounts that the body can quickly break down. Nicotine can make new smokers feel dizzy or sick to their stomachs. The heart rate for young smokers increases 2 to 3 beats per minute. Nicotine also lowers skin temperature and reduces blood flow in the legs and feet. It plays an important role in increasing smokers' risk of heart disease and stroke. Smoking cigarettes is dangerous. Cigarette smoking was the cause of lung cancer and several other deadly diseases. Question: What's the main idea of this passage? Options: A: Where did cigarettes come from?

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: As more and more books become movie adaptations , I can't help but think how this will affect English classes in America. Thinking back to my years in middle and high school -- ten years ago, I would be rewarded if I had read a number of classics. Today, a majority of those books are now also movies Life of Pi, The Great Gatsby, Much Ado About Nothing and Anna Karenina, to name a few. Even modern books such as The Hunger Games and Harry Potter have been adapted for the big screen. In discussion with my students, I often hear them say they are not going to read books because movies will come out soon, which makes me wonder what effect movie adaptations have on modern-day students. Will the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) encourage them to read books more carefully or to use movies to improve their understanding of the text? The CCSS requires students to provide text-based evidence when reading and discussing a book. By focusing on such evidence, teachers can pull specific details from a book that may have not made the final cut when the book was adapted for the big screen. For instance, after reading and watching The Hunger Games, there were a number of details from the book that were missing from the film -- many people were disappointed with Rue's meek movie role. A student who failed to read The Hunger Games would not quite understand Rue's impact on the games in the same way as someone who had read the book and remembered all the details that went into her death. I am not saying the CCSS will stop students from cutting corners, but I believe if teachers use the support the CCSS provides, it can be a great roadway to ensure all students are digging deep into texts and not just hitting the play button.

What's the most logical way to complete this passage? England began this summer wanting pace, bounce and carry in their Test pitches but have instead been confronted with surfaces more akin to Colombo and Kolkata than Lord’s, Headingley and Trent Bridge. The result on Wednesday was that India felt very much at home on the first day of a pivotal series for Alastair Cook. Certainly there was no home advantage in Nottingham for England on a low, slow batting paradise of a pitch that was prepared more to ensure that the first Investec Test will last into the weekend rather than produce compelling cricket. Duncan Fletcher never gives much away but the India coach would have been inwardly grinning like a Cheshire cat behind his inscrutable façade at the warm hospitality offered to his side here by his old employers at the ECB. Prize wicket: Stuart Broad celebrates his dismissal of","completion":"India's top-order stalwart, Virat Kohli, on a pitch that barely offered any assistance to the English seamers. England's fast bowlers, who were keen to exploit any lateral movement, found it challenging to make early inroads against the Indian batting lineup. The rationale behind this approach is focused on the conditions offered at the wicket. Besides aiming for a longer Test match, the pitch conditions inadvertently benefitted India, as their batsmen have grown accustomed to playing on slow, low turners back home. Whereas England's bowlers typically excel on pitches that offer pace, bounce, and carry, the surface at Nottingham neutralized their primary weapons and failed to provide the much-needed advantage for the home side.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Witchcraft (also called witchery or \\"spellcraft\\") broadly means the practice of, and belief in, magical skills and abilities that are able to be exercised by individuals and certain social groups. Witchcraft is a complex concept that varies culturally and societally; therefore, it is difficult to define with precision and cross-cultural assumptions about the meaning or significance of the term should be applied with caution. Witchcraft often occupies a religious, divinatory or medicinal role, and is often present within societies and groups whose cultural framework includes a magical world view. Although witchcraft can often share common ground with related concepts such as sorcery, the paranormal, magic, superstition, necromancy, possession, shamanism, healing, spiritualism, nature worship and the occult, it is usually seen as distinct from these when examined by sociologists and anthropologists. It is said to have been an ancient religion. - The Bricket Wood coven, or Hertfordshire coven was a coven of Gardnerian witches founded in the 1940s by Gerald Gardner. It was notable for being the first coven in the Gardnerian line, though having its supposed origins in the pre-Gardnerian New Forest coven. The coven formed after Gardner bought the Fiveacres Country Club, a naturist club in the village of Bricket Wood, Hertfordshire, southern England, and met within the club's grounds. It played a significant part in the history of the neopagan religion of Wicca. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - Initiation is a rite of passage marking entrance or acceptance into a group or society. It could also be a formal admission to adulthood in a community or one of its formal components. In an extended sense it can also signify a transformation in which the initiate is 'reborn' into a new role. Examples of initiation ceremonies might include Hindu diksha, Christian baptism or confirmation, Jewish bar or bat mitzvah, acceptance into a fraternal organization, secret society or religious order, or graduation from school or recruit training. A person taking the initiation ceremony in traditional rites, such as those depicted in these pictures, is called an \\"initiate\\". - The Fellowship of Isis (FOI) is an international spiritual organization devoted to promoting awareness of the Goddess. It is dedicated specifically to the Egyptian goddess Isis because the FOI co-founders believed Isis best represented the energies of the dawning Aquarian Age. The FOI is a multi-faith, multi-racial, and multi-cultural organization, and despite worshipping pagan deities, does not consider itself to be a Neopagan faith. - The New Forest coven were an alleged group of Neopagan witches or Wiccans who met around the area of the New Forest in southern England during the 1930s and 1940s. According to his own claims, in September 1939, a British occultist named Gerald Gardner was initiated into the coven, and subsequently used its beliefs and practices as a basis from which he formed the tradition of Gardnerian Wicca. Gardner described some of his experiences with the coven in his published books \\"Witchcraft Today\\" (1954) and \\"The Meaning of Witchcraft\\" (1959), although on the whole revealed little about it, saying he was respecting the privacy of its members. Meanwhile, another occultist, Louis Wilkinson, corroborated Gardner's claims by revealing in an interview with the writer Francis X. King that he too had encountered the coven, and expanded on some of the information that Gardner had provided about them. - Wicca, also termed Pagan Witchcraft, is a contemporary Pagan new religious movement. It was developed in England during the first half of the 20th century and was introduced to the public in 1954 by Gerald Gardner, a retired British civil servant. Wicca draws upon a diverse set of ancient pagan and 20th century hermetic motifs for its theological structure and ritual practices. - A Craft name, also known as a magical (or \\"magickal\\") name is a secondary religious name often adopted by practitioners of Wicca and other forms of Neopagan witchcraft or magic. Craft names may be adopted as a means of protecting one's privacy (especially for those who are \\"in the broom closet\\"), as an expression of religious devotion, or as a part of an initiation ritual. It may also be used as a protective method, as it is believed by some that one's \\"true name\\" can be used as a taglock, to identify that person for the purpose of magical activities (predominantly curses). - Frederic Lamond ( born 1931 ) who also goes under the craft name Robert , is a prominent English Wiccan . He was an early member of the Gardnerian tradition having been initiated into the Bricket Wood coven in 1957 . He has since become involved in a number of Pagan organisations , including the Fellowship of Isis , and has participated in the interfaith movement . He has written a number of books on the subject of Wiccan theology and history . - Isis (original Egyptian pronunciation more likely \\"Aset\\" or \\"Iset\\") is a goddess from the polytheistic pantheon of Egypt. She was first worshiped in ancient Egyptian religion, and later her worship spread throughout the Roman Empire and the greater Greco-Roman world. Isis is still widely worshiped by many pagans today in diverse religious contexts; including a number of distinct pagan religions, the modern Goddess movement, and interfaith organizations such as the Fellowship of Isis.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I can use this background: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth: Now, I have a new situation: Gary and Joe are two farmers. Joe's farm has a depleted soil, while Gary started agroforestry a few years back, and grows cover crops. Answer this question please: Which farmer increased infiltration to prevent erosion? Answer:","completion":"Gary, the farmer who started agroforestry a few years back and grows cover crops, is the one who increased infiltration to prevent erosion. This is because agroforestry systems, like the one Gary has implemented, make use of groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses, which help stabilize the soil and provides more cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems used by Joe. By integrating agroforestry into his farming practice, Gary has effectively increased infiltration into the soil by slowing down runoff velocity, thus allowing more water to penetrate and get absorbed by the soil. This process helps to keep the soil structure intact, preventing soil erosion that typically occurs in depleted soils like Joe's farm. In addition to preventing erosion, agroforestry systems offer several other advantages. For instance, they lead to improved water quality by reducing soil surface runoff and the resulting nutrient loss into streams. This is achieved through higher nutrient uptake rates by the diverse plant mix that characterizes agroforestry systems, compared to row-cropped fields where nutrient uptake can be less efficient. Moreover, agroforestry systems contribute to healthier and more diverse ecosystems that promote increased biodiversity. The various plants that make up the system can support different insect and animal species, leading to a more balanced and resilient agricultural system. In summary, Gary – the farmer who adopted agroforestry and grows cover crops – has effectively increased infiltration to prevent erosion on his farm, as well as enjoying other benefits associated with this sustainable practice. On the other hand, Joe's farm, with its depleted soil, remains susceptible to soil erosion due to the absence of groundcover plants and lack of an agroforestry system."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given those answer options, answer the question: SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on. In fact it is probably the nicest one I’ve been on because everything is new,” said Bob McElroy, a Camp Humphreys public affairs officer.

Article: Nobody is sure where and when the expression \\"apple-pie order\\" began. Some say that Scottish and English writers used the expression a long time ago. Others say it was first used in the northeastern American states known as New England. The housewives of New England cut their apples in even slices. Then they filled pie pans with them in an organized way, row upon row. As one writer said, the women of New England loved to have everything in its place. This perhaps explains why it generally is believed that the expression \\"apple-pie order\\" began in New England. Another old expression, \\"apple of discord\\", comes from ancient mythology ,however. The myth says that all the gods and goddesses were sitting around the table tocelebrate the marriage of Thetis and Peleus. One of the goddesses-Discord-was a troublemaker. She threw away a golden apple on the table to be given as a prize to the most beautiful goddess. At one time, the tomato was called a love apple. That was a mistake. This is how the mistake happened: In the sixteenth century, Spain brought the tomato from South America after Spanish explorers had landed there. Spain then sold the tomato to Morocco. Italian traders carried it on to Italy. The Italian name for the tomato was \\"pomo di Moro\\"-apple of the Moors. When French growers brought it in from Italy, they thought \\"di Moro\\" meant\\"d'amour\\"-the French word for love. And so \\"pomo di Moro\\" became the apple of love. People believe many things about the apple. One belief is that it has great power of keeping people healthy. A very common expression is \\"an apple a day keeps the doctor away. \\" Another belief is based on fact. The expression is \\"one rotten apple spoils the barrel. \\"When an apple begins to go bad, it ruins all the other apples around it in the container. The expression has come to mean that one bad person in a group can cause everyone to act bad. Question: Which of the following expressions is about health?

The Brooks family, which had amassed a fortune in the shipping insurance business and had been investing in Chicago real estate since 1863, had retained Chicago property manager Owen F. Aldis to manage the construction of the seven-story Grannis Block on Dearborn Street in 1880. It was Aldis, one of two men Louis Sullivan credited with being \\"responsible for the modern office building\\", who convinced investors such as the Brooks brothers to build new skyscrapers in Chicago. By the end of the century, Aldis would create over 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m2) of new office space and manage nearly one fifth of the office space in the Loop.Daniel Burnham and John Wellborn Root met as young draftsmen in the Chicago firm of Carter, Drake, and Wight in 1872 and left to form Burnham & Root the following year. At Aldis's urging, the Brooks brothers had retained the then-fledgling firm to design the Grannis Block, which was their first major commission. Burnham and Root would become the architects of choice for the Brooks family, for whom they would complete the first high-rise building in Chicago, the 10-story Montauk Building, in 1883, and the 11-story Rookery Building in 1888. The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 had destroyed a 4-mile (6.4 km) by 0.5-mile (0.80 km) swath of the city between the Chicago River and Lake Michigan, and subsequent commercial development expanded into the area far south of the main business district along the river that would come to be known as \\"the Loop\\".

What is the answer: Square, Irish and Line all are types of which activity?","completion":"Square, Irish, and Line are all types of traditional social dance activities, each originating from different cultures and often involving group participation. These dance forms have their own unique characteristics, making them an integral part of cultural heritage and festivities while also enabling social interaction and fun. 1. Square Dance: Originating from England in the 17th century, square dance is a folk dance form typically performed by four couples who are arranged in a square or rectangular formation, with one couple on each side facing the middle of the square. The dance consists of multiple figures, including various moves like promenades, do-si-dos, and swings. Square dance is particularly popular in the United States, where it is often associated with rural communities and Western culture, though modern square dance clubs exist all around the world. In square dancing, a caller is responsible for guiding the dancers through the movements by providing verbal instructions. These instructions can be memorized or improvised during the dance, making each session unique. Square dance music is typically lively and upbeat, often featuring instruments like the fiddle, banjo, guitar, and piano. 2. Irish Dance: Irish dance has its roots in traditional Gaelic culture and is an important part of Irish heritage. There are several types of Irish dances, including ceili dances (group dances) and set dances (social dances typically performed by four couples). Irish dance can be characterized by its quick, intricate footwork, which often involves dancers keeping their upper body and arms relatively still while their legs and feet execute precise movements. Irish dance gained worldwide recognition and popularity partly due to the success of shows like Riverdance and Lord of the Dance. These theatrical performances showcased the stunning athleticism and grace of Irish dance, drawing in audiences through the combination of traditional Irish music and innovative choreography. Today, competitive Irish dancing is a popular activity for children and teenagers across numerous countries, with competitions held at local, regional, national, and international levels. 3. Line Dance: Line dance is a type of choreographed dance that consists of a group of people standing in one or more lines and performing a sequence of steps, often facing the same direction. The dance can be performed individually or in groups, without the need for partners. Line dances are usually associated with country and western music, but can also be performed to pop or other genres of music. Line dances often have repeating sequences and range in their level of complexity, making them accessible to dancers with varying abilities. Popular line dances include the Electric Slide, the Macarena, and the Wobble, which feature unique steps and movements that make them recognizable and enjoyable for dancers. Line dancing is a common activity at social events like weddings and parties, where group participation and fun are the main goals. In conclusion, Square, Irish, and Line dances are all notable types of social dance activities that bring people together for fun, entertainment, and cultural expression. Each of these dances has a distinct history, style, and appeal - demonstrating the diversity and depth of traditional dance forms found around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

GALVESTON, Tex. — Inside a bungalow under renovation, Jonathan Scott, one half of the squeaky-clean Property Brothers, was yanking a toilet out from the floor. “Let’s do it one more time,” said a producer, watching from a nearby monitor. Mr. Scott walked into the small bathroom again, acting surprised as he spied the toilet. Then he pulled it from the floor. The scene was being shot for the fifth season of “Brother vs. Brother,” the HGTV program in which the highly competitive Scott brothers use equal sums of their own money (in this case 600,000) to buy, renovate and then sell houses in the same town. All proceeds go to charities like Habitat for Humanity. This Galveston season will make its premiere on May 31. Mr. Scott, who is a perfect mix of rugged and well coifed, a man who gets his work boots dirty even as his hair stays untousled, went for a house that could be considered a major fixer-upper. His identical twin brother, Drew, who is as handsome if not quite as hair-sprayed, and favors suits and ties over Timberlands, opted for a ramshackle heap that was larger and had better access to some of the island’s canals. ||||| Property Brothers franchise Property Brothers The promotional poster to the program Owner Cineflix Scott Brothers Entertainment Films and television Television series Property Brothers Buying and Selling Brother Vs. Brother Property Brothers: At Home Brothers Take New Orleans Audio Radio program(s) Off Topic with the Scott Brothers Miscellaneous Apps Property Brothers Handbook Books Dream Home: The Property Brother's Ultimate Guide to Finding & Fixing Your Perfect House The Property Brothers franchise is a media franchise that stars Canadian twins Jonathan and Drew Scott and centers around the selling, purchasing, and renovation of real estate property. The shows also often guest star their older brother J.D. Their first program is Property Brothers—produced by Cineflix Media—and airs on the W Network in Canada, HGTV in the US, as well as various networks in over 130 countries. The success of this show led to spin-off series, including Buying and Selling, Brother Vs. Brother, Property Brothers: At Home, Property Brothers: At Home on the Ranch, and Brothers Take New Orleans. Television [ edit ] The brothers create upwards of 60 hours of broadcast content each year, and have as many at 17 projects going on at a time.[1] Kathleen Finch, the president of the DIY Network and HGTV, has planned to have a new episode of original content each week of the year.[2] Because of their filming schedule, they no longer take personal clients.[3] However, they hire local design, real estate, and construction companies in the cities where they film.[3] Property Brothers [ edit ] Property Brothers is a Canadian reality television series that is produced by Cineflix. Its history begins when Drew was living in Vancouver and auditioning for acting roles.[4] He was offered the chance to host a show called Realtor Idol, based on the American Idol format.[4] The show never materialized, but producers wanted him for a show tentatively called My Dream Home, with the intention of having a male and female host.[5] When they learned he had a brother who was also in real estate, they developed a show around the pair; that company would later film their pilot for Property Brothers.[6][4] The show first aired on the W Network in Canada,[citation needed] and was later picked up by HGTV.[6] The series features Drew, a real estate expert who scouts neglected houses and negotiates the purchases. Jonathan is a licensed contractor who renovates houses. Together, they help families find, buy, and transform \\"fixer-uppers\\" into dream homes on a strict timeline and budget.[7][8] It airs on W Network in Canada and HGTV in the United States. The series received and Emmy nomination in 2015 for Best Structured Reality Program.[9] Buying and Selling [ edit ] On Buying and Selling , the twins help couples sell their home and buy a new property based on their changing needs.[10] Jonathan renovates the family's current home for a successful sale, while Drew checks out the best options for the family's new property.[10] Drew then oversees the selling of the renovated home and the buying of a new house.[10] The first season had a rating of 8 million viewers in the 25 – 54 age group, and it ranked as a top 10 HGTV primetime program among the same viewers.[10] The second season began on December 4, 2013.[10] The fifth season started on July 13, 2016.[11] The sixth season debuted on April 19, 2017.[12] Brother Vs. Brother [ edit ] In November 2012, HGTV greenlit production on the Scotts' third program, Brother Vs. Brother.[13] In the show's original premise, each brother was assigned properties of similar value and structure, and headed a team of home improvement experts, including renovators, builders, and designers.[13] Given an identical timeline and a budget of 500,000,[14] each brother mentored his respective team as they made improvements on the home, and each week, the poorest performing member was eliminated from the competition.[13] The last remaining team member won a 50,000 cash prize.[13] At the conclusion of the renovations, an appraiser and a real estate expert would judge the overall renovation and re-assess the values of each property.[13] The brother who had the house with the highest resale value won.[15][13] The show is edited to six episodes.[15] The show debuted on July 21, 2013.[14] David Font—a landscape professional and business owner from Miami, Florida—won the 500,000 cash prize.[16] Team Drew took the season, with 15,000 more in final property value for his home.[16] The third season premiered on June 3, 2015,[17] and unlike in past years, eliminated the teams.[18] With their older brother J.D. as the referee, the twins purchased and renovated two houses using their own money with the goal of increasing the property value of each home.[17] Also, the twins faced weekly challenges before a panel of HGTV and DIY Network guest judges (including Jen and Brandon Hatmaker, David Bromstad, Josh Temple, Hilary Farr, and David Visentin), and the losing brother would have to complete dares, like dancing in an all-male revue.[17] The season had an audience of over 13 million viewers.[15] Jonathan won.[15] Proceeds from the sale of the homes were donated to Rebuilding Together,[19] a charity that benefits low-income homeowners. The fourth season premiered on June 1, 2016.[15] Each twin bought, renovated, and sold a Vegas home.[15] The season's judges included Lex and Alana LeBlanc, Anthony Carrino, John Colaneri, Egypt Sherrod, David Bromstad, Tiffany Brooks, and Vanilla Ice.[15] The season brought in 14 million viewers.[20] The next season of Brother Vs. Brother was filmed in Galveston, Texas,[21] and premiered on May 31.[22] Penalties for losing challenges included \\"be[ing] forced to endure miserable outings such as riding a terrifying amusement park attraction, climbing an 81-foot obstacle ropes course or heading out to sea to catch shrimp for the winner’s dinner.\\"[22] Celebrity guest judges included David Bromstad and Egypt Sherrod, as well as other personalities from HGTV and the DIY Network.[22] They sought to collaborate with fellow HGTV stars Chip and Joanna Gaines of Fixer Upper, which is filmed in nearby Waco, Texas, but the couple was busy.[20] Proceeds from sale of the homes went to Rebuilding Together—a national U.S. non-profit organization for low-income homeowners.[22] Drew won the season, selling his home for 690,000. Property Brothers: At Home [ edit ] The twins decided to sell their individual homes and purchase a joint property in 2011,[23] with the goal of establishing a hub for their extended family and friends.[24] Jonathan began the search for a place that met all of their criteria (e.g. within 20 minutes of the airport),[2] and they ultimately purchased a foreclosed, 5400 square-foot house for 400,000.[2][25] With a renovation budget of 2 million,[2] the project became the basis of a fourth television series, with working titles that included The Brothers Big Reno Project and Property Brothers: Behind Our Build.[27][28] Eventually renamed Property Brothers: At Home, it was the first production under the umbrella of Scott Brothers Entertainment.[29] The show premiered on November 26, 2014 on HGTV in the United States, as well as in 2015 on the W Network in Canada.[30] Property Brothers: At Home on the Ranch [ edit ] After the success of Property Brothers at Home, Scott Brothers Entertainment went on to create another spin-off series called Property Brothers: At Home on the Ranch.

He is sent to China by his guru, who requests him to stop the spread of a pandemic disease existing there from spreading to India. Initially the people in China treated him as an inferior but later when he cures a little girl from the deadly disease and fights against some people who ill treated villagers there, the people of China began to respect and worship him. He begins to teach them how to cure many diseases, the skills of hypnotism and the physical training of the Shaolin monks that led to the creation of Shaolinquan. However after several years, when he expresses his desire to return to India, the villagers plot to poison him and bury him near the temple, believing that their place would be disease free if he is buried there. Bodhidharma agrees to die and subsequently becomes a fundamental figure in Chinese history, affectionately being dubbed as \\"Damo\\". The film switches to modern-day China, where Dong Lee (Johnny Tri Nguyen) is given the task of starting a government planned biological war against India, known as Operation Red. Dong Lee arrives in Chennai starts this operation by injecting a virus into a street dog. This disease was the one which occurred during the time of Bodhidharma in China.

His father was a heroin addict, and Odom's mother died of colon cancer when he was twelve years old. At her deathbed, Odom's mom told him: \\"Be nice to everybody\\". Afterwards, he was raised by his maternal grandmother, Mildred Mercer. Odom contemplated entering the NBA directly out of high school, and consulted with Bryant, who had made the jump a year earlier. He decided he was not ready, and decided to attend the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. However, after a Sports Illustrated report questioned his unexpectedly high score of 22 out of 36 in the ACT, the school released him in July 1997 before he ever played a game for them. That same summer, he received a citation for soliciting prostitution following an undercover operation by the Las Vegas police. Later, an NCAA inquiry found Odom received payments amounting to 5,600 from booster David Chapman. Coach Bill Bayno was fired and UNLV was placed on probation for four years. Odom transferred to the University of Rhode Island but was forced to sit out the 1997-98 season. He was admitted as a non-matriculating student, and was not allowed to play intramural basketball. His room and board was paid for by his father, who was covered by the G.I. Bill. After two semesters and a summer session, Odom earned his eligibility to play basketball. His career at Rhode Island had been in jeopardy after the first semester, when he vanished before finals. However, Rhode Island coach Jim Harrick persuaded three of his four instructors to allow him to make up his work. The coach also had Odom work with DeGregorio, who had become a Rams assistant and was the player's closest friend in college. Odom was also inspired by his maternal grandmother, a nurse who had raised five children and returned to school to earn her degree in 1980 at age 56. Odom played one season for the Rams in the Atlantic 10 Conference, where he averaged 17.6 points per game and led the Rams to the conference championship in 1999. He earned first-team all-conference honors and was named the Atlantic 10 Rookie of the Year.

Summarize this article: Earlier this month, Mr Hoare apologised after calling the Isle of Wight a \\"ghetto\\" where there had been \\"inbreeding\\". On Tuesday, Ofsted issued a statement saying he was resigning with immediate effect. Isle of Wight MP Andrew Turner said Mr Hoare's comments had been \\"inaccurate, insulting and extremely unhelpful\\". Mr Hoare said in his resignation statement: \\"It has been a great privilege to chair the Ofsted board for the past two years.\\" He had chaired the board of England's education watchdog - setting the strategic direction for the more high-profile role of chief inspector, currently held by Sir Michael Wilshaw. Mr Hoare's comments about the underachievement of poor white pupils on the Isle of Wight, made at a teaching conference, had prompted calls for his resignation. \\"Most people go there for sailing for two weeks a year. There's a sailing club that is one of the best in the world, where there's champagne,\\" he had said. \\"But just within inches, there are people who live in a ghetto ... They think of it as holiday land. But it is shocking. It's a ghetto; there has been inbreeding.\\" Mr Hoare spoke of educational underachievement and social problems. \\"Seven state schools were all less than good. \\"There is a mass of crime, drug problems, huge unemployment.\\" Mr Hoare later said: \\"My intention was to highlight how concerned I am about the unacceptably poor performance of schools on the Isle of Wight over many years and how this is damaging the prospects of young people who live on the island. \\"Those who know me will realise that I am passionate about improving outcomes for children from our most disadvantaged communities and my comments were made in this context.\\" Education Secretary Justine Greening, accepting his resignation, said: \\"I would like to thank David for his hard work in this role over the past two years.\\" Labour's shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: \\"His position became increasingly untenable after he made those shockingly offensive comments. He demonised the entire population of the Isle of Wight.\\" James Kempton, a member of the Ofsted board, will take over as Ofsted chairman on an interim basis. Isle of Wight MP Andrew Turner said: \\"The role of Ofsted is to help improve education, not demoralise teachers, insult parents and pupils and those involved in raising education standards. \\"His resignation, albeit somewhat delayed was probably inevitable and clearly for the best. \\"I said at the time that he would never have dared make such remarks about an area with a high ethnic population, and I stand by that view.\\" Jonathan Bacon, leader of the Isle of Wight Council, said that standards were improving in the island's schools. He invited Mr Hoare's successor to visit the Isle of Wight \\"in order to learn more about the challenges we face and ensure that Ofsted is playing the fullest possible part, working alongside the other agencies, to support the further improvement of educational outcomes\\". Kevin Courtney, leader of the National Union of Teachers, said it was \\"correct\\" that Mr Hoare had resigned, saying that his comments had been \\"insulting and ill-judged\\". \\"Schools and teachers in areas facing challenges need constructive support and fair evaluation not denigration.

The old vaulted church was stripped down: there was no cloth on the altar, just a DJ's toolkit and his beer. Through the dark, I could see three bolts left in the wall from where they'd taken down the crucifix. A confessional too beaten-up to have been sold was shaking in a way that suggested activity inside, and where the pews had been taken out, a couple hundred people were testifying to the DJ's moving sermon. Rachel stepped forward into the crowd while I took a moment to drink in the ceiling's blue-lit, shadowed vault and the light-catching haze from who-knows-what rising between the DJ and the crowd. There was a terrific echo, each beat reverberating inside of the next, and the old stained-glass windows rattled in their frames. On the dance floor, people moved with their eyes closed and their hands in the air. I danced with Rachel for a while, but then something by the bar seemed to be pulling her eyes. She told me that she was heading for a drink and slipped out of the crowd. When she hadn't come back halfway through the next song, I glanced over at the bar. It was just a little set-up where someone had stacked a few crates and brought something alcoholic to share, mostly beer. Rachel was standing with a plastic cup, looking like she was having a conversation, but I couldn't see anyone else there. The next time the crowd split, I saw him. He stood in front of a blue light, so I couldn't see him clearly, but what I saw was memorable. He wore a jacket of what might have been blue velvet, and his hair gleamed black against his white skin. The blue haze seemed to stop just shy of his pallor, setting off his striking face without illuminating its details, and his wrists flashed white in the darkness. He didn't move, just stared and held his drink. The next time I saw them, his mouth was moving. She nodded and he took her arm. I watched them through the crush of dancers as they squeezed along the wall, and the feeling came to me that something was very wrong. Saturday morning, I woke up and saw that she still hadn't come home.

Ultimately, Rachel leaves with him, and the narrator is left to worry about her when she does not come home by the next day. Based on the passage, I have several questions: 1.

What are the narrator's feelings about the party before he notices Rachel's interaction with the mysterious man? Do they feel comfortable and engaged, or do they sense that something is amiss from the start? 4. Can the narrator provide any further description of the man who approaches Rachel? Do they recall any specific features, beyond the fact that he is dressed distinctively and appears quite pale? 5. What sort of conversation does the narrator believe is unfolding between Rachel and the man? Does the narrator suspect that the man is simply flirting with Rachel, or do they feel that he poses a more significant threat? 6. Does the narrator attempt to intervene or stop Rachel from leaving with the man, or do they simply observe the situation unfold from a distance? If they do not act, what prevents them from doing so? 7. How well does the narrator know Rachel? Is her subsequent disappearance highly uncharacteristic and cause for alarm, or has she shown a tendency to vanish without notice in the past? 8. What steps will the narrator take in the aftermath of Rachel's disappearance? Will they actively search for her and investigate the mysterious man, or will they wait for her to return? 9.

At the conference room table was White House Deputy Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten. Bolten watched the exchanges and, after what he called \\"a quiet moment,\\"suggested that the Vice President get in touch with the President and confirm the engage order. Bolten told us he wanted to make sure the President was told that the Vice President had executed the order. He said he had not heard any prior discussion on the subject with the President. The Vice President was logged calling the President at 10:18 for a twominute conversation that obtained the confirmation. On Air Force One, the President's press secretary was taking notes; Ari Fleischer recorded that at 10:20, the President told him that he had authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary. Minutes went by and word arrived of an aircraft down in Pennsylvania. Those in the shelter wondered if the aircraft had been shot down pursuant to this authorization. At approximately 10:30, the shelter started receiving reports of another hijacked plane, this time only 5 to 10 miles out. Believing they had only a minute or two, the Vice President again communicated the authorization to \\"engage or \\"take out\\" the aircraft. At 10:33, Hadley told the air threat conference call: \\"I need to get word to Dick Myers that our reports are there's an inbound aircraft flying low 5 miles out. The Vice President's guidance was we need to take them out.\\" Once again, there was no immediate information about the fate of the inbound aircraft. In the apt description of one witness, \\"It drops below the radar screen and it's just continually hovering in your imagination; you don't know where it is or what happens to it.\\" Eventually, the shelter received word that the alleged hijacker 5 miles away had been a medevac helicopter. Transmission of the Authorization from the White House to the Pilots The NMCC learned of United 93's hijacking at about 10:03. At this time the FAA had no contact with the military at the level of national command. The NMCC learned about United 93 from the White House.

Write an article with the title: \\"Walmart braces for Black Friday labor protests\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Walmart Braces for Black Friday Labor Protests Introduction As the holiday shopping season approaches, Walmart faces increased pressure from labor protests demanding fair wages, better working conditions, and respect for workers' rights. The retail giant, which has generated billions of dollars in sales around pivotal shopping days like Black Friday, has been a symbolic ground for protests over workers' rights and the future of retail work in the United States. For years, employees, labor groups, and advocacy organizations have orchestrated walkouts, protests, and campaigns on Black Friday to draw attention to injustices at Walmart and promote change within the retail industry. Walmart's Controversial Labor Practices At the heart of these protests are concerns over Walmart's treatment of its employees. As the nation's largest employer, the company has been under scrutiny for its labor practices, including low wages, part-time scheduling, unsafe working conditions, and worker mistreatment. According to protesters, these issues are systemic and widespread, affecting thousands of employees across the retail giant's vast network of stores and distribution centers. Walmart has made headlines in recent years for its practice of keeping hourly wages just above the federal minimum wage, while simultaneously offering barely sufficient benefits packages. Many employees rely on government assistance to supplement their meager incomes, which has placed a spotlight on Walmart's role in perpetuating economic inequality in the United States. Another contributing factor to frustration among Walmart's workforce is the company's heavy reliance on part-time and temporary workers, which is common in the retail industry. This employment model offers limited opportunities for advancement and restricts access to crucial benefits, such as health insurance and paid time off. Moreover, workers claim that the company's scheduling practices, which often change with little notice, make it difficult to balance work and personal life. The Role of Black Friday Protests In recent years, frustration with Walmart's labor practices has coalesced around the frenzied shopping event that is Black Friday. For workers and advocates alike, the day signifies corporate greed, with massive profits generated from low-priced, mass-produced items often made by underpaid, mistreated workers. The anti-Walmart protests on Black Friday are not just about a single retailer, but rather a larger movement challenging the entire retail sector's exploitative labor practices. Labor unions, worker centers, and advocacy organizations have joined efforts to support workers' rights to unionize, bargain collectively, and demand fair wages and better working conditions. Black Friday protests offer an opportunity to generate public awareness and put pressure on one of the most powerful and influential corporations in the world to implement meaningful labor reforms. Walmart's Response to Protests In response to labor protests and mounting criticism, Walmart has taken steps to improve conditions for its workforce. The company has raised its starting wage for US workers to 11 per hour and expanded benefits, such as paid parental leave and adoption assistance. Additionally, the retailer has pledged to promote more than 150,000 employees to higher-paying positions and invest in employee training and development programs. While these actions may be seen as steps in the right direction, critics argue that Walmart's efforts still fall short of addressing the deep-rooted problems affecting its workforce. As a result, Black Friday protests and advocacy campaigns will continue until workers' demands for fair treatment, a living wage, and respect for their rights are met. Conclusion The annual Black Friday labor protests at Walmart serve as a powerful reminder of the treatment of workers in the retail industry. As a retail giant and the largest employer in the United States, Walmart has the power to set industry-wide standards and positively impact working conditions for millions of people. However, until meaningful change is delivered, these protests will remain a significant part of the holiday shopping narrative, shining a light on the urgent need for reshaping the retail landscape and prioritizing workers' rights over profit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the full name of the person whose competent performance persuaded others their problems were in the past? ? In selecting his crew, De Long's priority was men with Arctic experience. For his second-in-command he chose lieutenant Charles W. Chipp, who had served with him on the Little Juniata adventure. Another veteran of the Polaris rescue mission, George W. Melville, was appointed as ship's engineer. Other experienced Arctic hands were William F. C. Nindemann, a Polaris survivor, and the ice pilot William Dunbar, who had many years' experience in whalers.The appointment of the expedition's navigating officer was problematic; John W. Danenhower, a young naval officer from a well-connected Washington family, was recommended to Bennett by the former president Ulysses S. Grant. Such sponsorship won Danenhower his place, despite a history of depression that had seen him briefly incarcerated at the Government Hospital for the Insane. On Bennett's request, Danenhower accompanied De Long on the voyage from Le Havre to San Francisco, during which he confided details of his medical history. The navigator's competent performance persuaded De Long that such troubles were in the past.The ship's surgeon, James Ambler, was assigned to the expedition by the Navy's Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, only because he was next on the list of medical officers available for sea duty. Ambler deduced from Danenhower's medical records that a probable cause of the navigator's medical lapses was syphilis, but Danenhower's influential connections ensured that he kept his place on the expedition.Two others from Jeannette's voyage from Le Havre, carpenter Albert Sweetman and boatswain John Cole, were enlisted, as was the Herald's meteorologist, Jerome Collins. Dubbed \\"chief scientist,\\" he was in charge of the Edison apparatus and of a rudimentary telephone system that De Long hoped to utilize. The remaining places were filled from a long list of applicants; the cook and steward were recruited by Danenhower from San Francisco's Chinatown. Answer:","completion":"The full name of the person whose competent performance persuaded others that their problems were in the past is John W. Danenhower.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Nowadays more and more people care about the exploitation of the natural _ , such as oil. Though there're many kinds of resources, with the fast increase of population and the increase of many more factories, the more we use, the fewer there will be left for the future. Oil is getting less and less year after year. It's said that oil can last for only 50 years. Natural gas perhaps will last about 38 years. Oil can be used in many ways and it's difficult to imagine what the modern world will be like without oil. But oil isn't easy to find and get out of the earth. Men must study the rocks. When they think the rocks in a certain place may have oil, a metal tower is built. A machine in the tower cuts a hole down into the ground. At the same time, a steel pipe is pushed down to stop the sides from falling in and to keep out water. At last if the men are right, usually the oil rushes up the sides with great force by the pressure of the gas in the top of the rock, and it rushes high into the air. If the oil catches a light, there will be a terrible fire. So a kind of cover is fixed on the top of the pipe, and the oil can run out through taps . If we are near the middle of the oil field, we can also get gas. Such gas is sent through pipes to towns far away and used in houses and factories like coal gas. Today oil is under pressure as never before. The price of oil keeps rising all the time. In many countries, the governments encourage people to save oil as much as possible. Question: Which of the following can be true according to the passage? Answer: Options are: + Coal gas can't be used in houses and factories.; + Oil is very important in the modern world.; + Many governments encourage people to waste oil as much as possible.; + It's very easy to get the oil.; Answer:","completion":"+ Oil is very important in the modern world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Toutefois, il importe de remarquer que les investissements étrangers directs se caractérisent par une stabilité beaucoup plus grande que celle des autres investissements, notamment en période de grave crise financière. Which language is this?","completion":"The language used in the given text is French. Here is the translation of the text into English: \\"However, it should be noted that foreign direct investments are characterized by much greater stability than other investments, particularly during serious financial crises.\\" Now, allow me to provide a detailed and long answer addressing the stability of foreign direct investments compared to other investments during financial crises. Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) refer to the acquisitions of assets or the establishment of companies in a foreign country, providing the investor ownership or a significant management interest. It is characterized by a long-term commitment from investors. On the other hand, other investments like portfolio investments and speculative investments are often more short term and can involve buying and selling stocks, bonds, or other financial instruments, aiming to capitalize on short-term market fluctuations. The stability of foreign direct investments compared to other investments, especially during financial crises, can be attributed to the following factors: 1. Long-term perspective: Investors engaged in FDI focus on the long-term growth and profitability of their foreign companies. Consequently, they are less likely to withdraw their investments or exit during short-term financial crises, unlike investors in stocks and bonds who may sell off their holdings due to short-term market volatility. 2. Diversification: FDIs often serve as a diversification tool for investors, reducing exposure to risks in their home countries or specific industries. During financial crises, such diversification strategies help maintain stability in investors' overall portfolios. 3. Real sector investments: FDI is usually associated with real sector investments, such as manufacturing, infrastructure, and services. These sectors can be more resilient to financial crises, as they are based on tangible assets with long-term value. In contrast, other investments tend to be more dependent on market sentiment and can be heavily impacted by crises. 4. Control and management: In FDI, investors typically have a significant degree of control and management influence over the companies they invest in. This control allows them to adapt business strategies during crises, safeguarding the companies from the worst effects of the downturn. However, for other investments such as stocks or bonds, investors usually have limited control over the invested companies' operations, making it more challenging to navigate financial crises. 5. Government policies: FDIs can be more stable during crises due to favorable government policies that aim to attract and retain foreign investors. Governments might offer tax incentives, subsidies, or other benefits to encourage long-term investments in their economy. In contrast, governments may impose capital controls on other investment types during crises, which can lead to instability. In conclusion, foreign direct investments are generally more stable than other investments due to their long-term orientation, diversification benefits, focus on real-sector assets, management control, and supportive government policies. This stability is particularly relevant during financial crises when investors in stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments may be more prone to panic selling and short-term market fluctuations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Its capital and largest city is Podgorica, while Cetinje is designated as the Old Royal Capital (\\"prijestonica\\"). - Serbia, officially the Republic of Serbia, is a sovereign state situated at the crossroads of Central and Southeast Europe, covering the southern part of the Pannonian Plain and the central Balkans. Relative to its small territory, it is a diverse country distinguished by a \\"transitional\\" character, situated along cultural, geographic, climatic and other boundaries. Serbia is landlocked and borders Hungary to the north; Romania and Bulgaria to the east; Macedonia to the south; and Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Montenegro to the southwest; it also claims a border with Albania through the disputed territory of Kosovo. Serbia numbers around 7 million residents, and its capital, Belgrade, ranks among the largest cities in Southeast Europe. - Music theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of music. - \\"Onamo, 'namo!\\" (Serbian Cyrillic: , '!) also known as the Serbian Marseillaise ( ) was a popular anthem in Montenegro in the late 19th to early 20th century. The royal state anthem of Montenegro at the time was To Our Beautiful Montenegro, while the education anthem was the Hymn to Saint Sava. - Ubavoj nam Crnoj Gori ( Serbian : , English : To Our Beautiful Montenegro ) was the national and state anthem of the Kingdom of Montenegro in the late 19th - early 20th century . A popular song called Onamo , ' namo ! ( There , o'er There ! ) also existed . The educational system had an honorific song , the Hymn to Saint Sava , which was sung in the Saint 's honour . The lyrics were made in 1865 by the Serb poet and a priest named Jovan Sundei , who was the secretary of Prince Nikola I of Montenegro . The music was composed by Jovo Ivaniševi , drawing from \`\` Uskliknimo s ljubavlju '' , hymn to Saint Sava and later adapted by Anton Schulz . The anthem was first performed on October 17 , 1870 , after which Prince Nikola declared it as the state anthem . In 1993 , the anthem was one of the proposals during the unsuccessful negotiations to adopt an Anthem of the Republic of Montenegro . The main problem was its monarchist lyrics . - A national anthem (also state anthem, national hymn, national song etc.) is generally a patriotic musical composition that evokes and eulogizes the history, traditions and struggles of its people, recognized either by a nation's government as the official national song, or by convention through use by the people. The majority of national anthems are either marches or hymns in style. The countries of Latin America tend towards more operatic pieces, while a handful of countries use a simple fanfare. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - The Kingdom of Serbia, often rendered as \\"Servia\\" in English sources during the time of its existence, was created when Prince Milan I of Serbia, ruler of the Principality of Serbia, was crowned king in 1882. - An anthem is a musical composition of celebration, usually used as a symbol for a distinct group, particularly the national anthems of countries. Originally, and in music theory and religious contexts, it also refers more particularly to short sacred choral work and still more particularly to a specific form of Anglican church music. - Musical composition can refer to an original piece of music, either a song or an instrumental music piece, the structure of a musical piece, or the process of creating or writing a new song or piece of music. People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music. In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist. \\"Composition\\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \\"score\\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers. In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression. In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music. - A constitutional monarchy (also known as a parliamentary monarchy) is a form of monarchy in which the sovereign exercises their authorities in accordance with a written or unwritten constitution. Constitutional monarchy differs from absolute monarchy (in which a monarch holds absolute power), in that constitutional monarchs are bound to exercise their powers and authorities within the limits prescribed within an established legal framework. Constitutional monarchies range from countries such as Morocco, where the constitution grants substantial discretionary powers to the sovereign, to countries such as Sweden or Denmark where the monarch retains very few formal authorities. - The Great National Assembly of the Serb People in Montenegro, known as the Podgorica Assembly ( /Podgorika skupština), was an assembly of the representative body of the Montenegrin people (the Kingdom of Montenegro) in November 1918, after World War I, that was to decide whether Montenegro was to unite with the Kingdom of Serbia. It was organized by a Serbian government committee. The two sides were known as the \\"Greens\\" and the \\"Whites\\", in favour of a confederation (independence) and unification (annexation), respectively. The assembly concluded the decision to merge Montenegro with Serbia. The creation of Yugoslavia followed. - The Kingdom of Montenegro (Serbian: a a / \\"Kraljevina Crna Gora\\"), was a monarchy in southeastern Europe, present day Montenegro, during the tumultuous years on the Balkan Peninsula leading up to and during World War I. Legally it was a constitutional monarchy, but absolutist in practice. On 28 November 1918, following the end of World War I, with its government still in exile, the unconstitutional Podgorica Assembly proclaimed union with the Kingdom of Serbia, and was merged into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes three days later, on 1 December 1918. - Anglican church music is music that is written for liturgical worship in Anglican church services.

It depicts the adventures of various characters \\"a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away\\". - Extraterrestrial life, also called alien life (or, if it is a sentient or relatively complex individual, an \\"extraterrestrial\\" or \\"alien\\"), is life that does not originate from Earth. These as-yet-hypothetical life forms may range from simple single-celled organisms to beings with civilizations far more advanced than humanity. Although many scientists expect extraterrestrial life to exist, there is no unambiguous evidence for its existence so far. The science of extraterrestrial life is known as exobiology. - Elizabeth Hand (born March 29, 1957) is an American writer. - Jabba Desilijic Tiure, commonly known as Jabba the Hutt (from a Slovak phrase, \\"Žaba a had\\", meaning \\"frog and snake\\") is a fictional character in the \\"Star Wars\\" franchise created by George Lucas. He is depicted as a large, slug-like alien. His appearance has been described by film critic Roger Ebert as a cross between a toad and the Cheshire Cat. - The Empire Strikes Back (also known as Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back) is a 1980 American epic space opera film directed by Irvin Kershner. Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan wrote the screenplay, with George Lucas writing the film's story and serving as executive producer. The second installment in the original \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy, it was produced by Gary Kurtz for Lucasfilm Ltd. and stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, David Prowse, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew and Frank Oz. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. - Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction. - Technology (\\"science of craft\\", from Greek , \\"techne\\", \\"art, skill, cunning of hand\\"; and , \\"-logia\\") is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings. - A cult following is a group of fans who are highly dedicated to a work of culture. A film, book, musical artist, television series or video game, among other things, will be said to have a cult following when it has a small but very passionate fanbase. A common component of cult followings is the emotional attachment the fans have to the object of the cult following, often identifying themselves and other fans as members of a community. Cult followings are also commonly associated with niche markets. Cult media are often associated with underground culture, and are considered too eccentric or subversive to be appreciated by the general public or to be a commercial success. Many cult fans express a certain irony about their devotion. Sometimes, these cult followings cross the border to camp followings. Fans may become involved in a subculture of fandom, either via conventions, online communities or through activities such as writing series-related fiction, costume creation, replica prop and model building, or creating their own audio or video productions from the formats and characters. - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature. - Hard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by an emphasis on scientific accuracy. The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s \\"Islands of Space\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the \\"hard\\" (natural) and \\"soft\\" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful. - Innovation can be defined simply as a \\"new idea, device, or method\\". However, innovation is often also viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs. This is accomplished through more-effective products, processes, services, technologies, or business models that are readily available to markets, governments and society. The term \\"innovation\\" can be defined as something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that \\"breaks into\\" the market or society. It is related to, but not the same as, invention. Innovation is often manifested via the engineering process. The exnovation is the opposite of innovation. - Boba Fett : Maze of Deception is a 2003 children 's science fiction book by Elizabeth Hand set in the Star Wars galaxy at the beginning of the Clone Wars . This 2003 sequel to Boba Fett : Hunted was published by Scholastic Press . The book takes place a month and a half after Star Wars Episode II : Attack of the Clones , and 22 years before Episode IV : A New Hope . In August 2008 , the first three books in this series were repackaged as a Borders exclusive hardcover edition . The book is listed as \`\` Part I '' and it is expected that the second three books will receive similar treatment . - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.

Hill farm took immediate action to address this problem by installing windbreaks, whereas Valley farm, due to financial constraints, had to postpone the implementation of a similar project. Windbreaks are known to have a significant positive impact on crop yields by reducing the wind velocity over and around crops. This leads to a decrease in the drying effect of the wind on the crops and prevents them from toppling as a result of strong wind gusts. Since Hill farm has already installed windbreaks, it can be inferred that they have successfully managed to reduce wind velocity around their crops. However, Valley farm has not yet implemented any windbreak systems, which means they have not taken action to reduce the wind velocity over their crops.

We can combine them by adding their coefficients: -26776 + 26794 = 18 This simplifies the equation to: 18*p - 197 = -53 Step 2: Isolate the variable p. We want to get p on one side of the equation. To do this, we'll add 197 to both sides: 18*p - 197 + 197 = -53 + 197 This simplifies to: 18*p = 144 Step 3: Solve for p.

Write an article based on this summary: – Kristen Stewart's personal life is in shambles, but so far her professional life does not appear to be affected: Vulture reports that the Twilight actress has scored the lead in Lie Down In Darkness, the film adaptation of a 1951 William Styron novel, a part that Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence had also hoped to land. Stewart will play Peyton Loftis in the film directed by Scott Cooper, who also directed Crazy Heart. But it's not all rosy: The fate of the planned Snow White and the Huntsman sequel is still not clear, since director Rupert Sanders—Stewart's cheating partner—is slated to return. But Radar reports that his wife is putting the kibosh on that. The gossip site also reports more bad news for Kristen: She's been banned from the premiere of Robert Pattinson's new film, Cosmopolis. \\"Robert just doesn’t want to see her,\\" says a source. Article:","completion":"Title: Kristen Stewart Overcomes Personal Struggles and Lands Lead Role in \\"Lie Down in Darkness\\" In the midst of personal strife, it seems Kristen Stewart can still count on her incredible acting skills to carry her through, as Vulture reports that the Twilight star has secured the lead role in the upcoming film adaptation of William Styron's 1951 novel, Lie Down In Darkness. This news may come as a disappointment for Hunger Games actress Jennifer Lawrence, who had also hoped to snag the coveted part. Stewart will bring the character of Peyton Loftis to life on the big screen, under the direction of Scott Cooper. Cooper is known for his work on Crazy Heart, which further highlights the prestigious nature of Stewart's recent achievement. This casting goes on to prove that despite setbacks in her personal life, Kristen Stewart continues to push forward in advancing her career. However, the future of another anticipated sequel remains uncertain. As fans eagerly await news on the Snow White and the Huntsman sequel, no concrete information about its production has been shared. The main concern rests on whether Kristen's cheating partner, director Rupert Sanders, will be part of the project. Radar reports that Sander's wife, Liberty Ross, has put her foot down and is refusing to let her husband work with his former mistress again. Adding further turmoil to an already tumultuous situation, Kristen Stewart has allegedly been banned from the premiere of Robert Pattinson's new film, Cosmopolis. According to a source, \\"Robert just doesn’t want to see her.\\" This could very well signify that there's still lingering tension between the two stars following their high-profile breakup. While there is no doubt that Kristen Stewart's personal life has seen better days, her professional achievements should not be overshadowed as a result. The actress has worked hard to hone her craft, and landing the lead role in Lie Down In Darkness is a testament to her unwavering commitment and skill. As fans and the entertainment world continue to focus on romantic entanglements and hurt feelings, Kristen Stewart remains steadfast in proving her worth as a talented actress. It remains to be seen what the Snow White and the Huntsman sequel holds for Stewart's future career trajectory, but in the meantime, her acting chops have secured a prominent job in the highly anticipated film adaptation of a classic American novel. As for now, it's crucial for Stewart to maintain her focus on her professional endeavors and hope that her personal life will eventually find stability. In conclusion, Kristen Stewart's personal struggles have undoubtedly played out publicly, throwing her under relentless scrutiny and judgment. However, by landing the lead role in Lie Down In Darkness, she displays fortitude and perseverance in an industry that can be both cruel and forgiving. Regardless of further developments in her personal life, Kristen Stewart is an actress with undeniable talent and a continued drive to succeed in her career, which is something both her fans and critics should respect and admire."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is usually a white, crystalline, odorless powder, that decomposes at 250270 °C. - Oxalate (IUPAC: ethanedioate) is the dianion with the formula , also written . Either name is often used for derivatives, such as salts of oxalic acid, for example sodium oxalate NaCO, or dimethyl oxalate ((CH)CO). Oxalate also forms coordination compounds where it is sometimes abbreviated as ox. - A symptom (from Greek , \\"accident, misfortune, that which befalls\\", from , \\"I befall\\", from - \\"together, with\\" and , \\"I fall\\") is a departure from normal function or feeling which is noticed by a patient, reflecting the presence of an unusual state, or of a disease. A symptom is subjective, observed by the patient, and cannot be measured directly, whereas a sign is objectively observable by others. For example, paresthesia is a symptom (only the person experiencing it can directly observe their own tingling feeling), whereas erythema is a sign (anyone can confirm that the skin is redder than usual). Symptoms and signs are often nonspecific, but often combinations of them are at least suggestive of certain diagnoses, helping to narrow down what may be wrong. In other cases they are specific even to the point of being pathognomonic. - Intermittent claudication (Latin: \\"claudicatio intermittens\\") is a symptom that describes muscle pain (ache, cramp, numbness or sense of fatigue), classically in the calf muscle, which occurs during exercise, such as walking, and is relieved by a short period of rest. It is classically associated with early-stage peripheral artery disease, and can progress to critical limb ischemia unless treated or risk factors are modified. - Oxalic acid is an organic compound with the formula CHO. It is a colorless crystalline solid that forms a colorless solution in water. Its condensed formula is HOOCCOOH, reflecting its classification as the simplest dicarboxylic acid. Its acid strength is much greater than that of acetic acid. Oxalic acid is a reducing agent and its conjugate base, known as oxalate, is a chelating agent for metal cations. Typically, oxalic acid occurs as the dihydrate with the formula CHO·2HO. Excessive ingestion of oxalic acid or prolonged skin contact can be dangerous. - Naftidrofuryl ( INN , also known as nafronyl or as the oxalate salt naftidrofuryl oxalate or nafronyl oxalate ) is a drug used in the management of peripheral and cerebral vascular disorders as a vasodilator . It is also claimed to enhance cellular oxidative capacity , and may also be a 5 - HT2 receptor antagonist . It is also licensed for the treatment of intermittent claudication due to peripheral arterial disease . Naftidrofuryl is marketed under the trade names Artocoron ; Azunaftil ; Di - Actane ; Dusodril ; Enelbin ; Frilix ; Gevatran ; Iridus ; Iridux ; Luctor ; Nafti ; Naftoling ; Naftodril ; Nafoxal ; Praxilene ; Sodipryl retard ; Vascuprax . Historically , it has been used to treat sudden idiopathic hearing loss and acute tinnitus . Naftidrofuryl may be effective for relieving the pain of muscle cramps . - Dimethyl oxalate is a chemical compound from the group of oxalates (specifically, the dimethyl ester of oxalic acid). - Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a narrowing of the arteries other than those that supply the heart or the brain. When narrowing occurs in the heart it is called coronary artery disease while in the brain it is called cerebrovascular disease. Peripheral artery disease most commonly affects the legs, but other arteries may also be involved. The classic symptom is leg pain when walking which resolves with rest, known as intermittent claudication. Other symptoms including skin ulcers, bluish skin, cold skin, or poor nail and hair growth may occur in the affected leg. Complications may include an infection or tissue death which may require amputation; coronary artery disease, or stroke. Up to 50% of cases of PAD are without symptoms. The main risk factor is cigarette smoking. Other risk factors include diabetes, high blood pressure, and high blood cholesterol. The underlying mechanism is usually atherosclerosis. Other causes include artery spasm. PAD is typically diagnosed by finding an ankle-brachial index (ABI) less than 0.90, which is the systolic blood pressure at the ankle divided by the systolic blood pressure of the arm. Duplex ultrasonography and angiography may also be used. Angiography is more accurate and allows for treatment at the same time; however, it is associated with greater risks. It is unclear if screening for disease is useful as it has not been properly studied. In those with intermittent claudication from PAD, stopping smoking and supervised exercise therapy improves outcomes. Medications, including statins, ACE inhibitors, and cilostazol also may help. Aspirin does not appear to help those with mild disease but is usually recommended in those with more significant disease. Anticoagulants such as warfarin are not typically of benefit. Procedures used to treat the disease include bypass grafting, angioplasty, and atherectomy. In 2010 about 202 million people had PAD worldwide. In the developed world it affects about 5.3% of 45 to 50 years olds and 18.6% of 85- to 90-year-olds. In the...

Movie plot title: The Pink Panther Strikes Again Movie plot: At a psychiatric hospital, former Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) is largely recovered from his obsession to kill the new Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Peter Sellers) and is about to be released when Clouseau, arriving to speak on Dreyfus' behalf, drives Dreyfus insane again. Dreyfus promptly escapes from the asylum and once again tries to kill Clouseau by planting a bomb while the Inspector (by periodic arrangement) duels with his manservant Cato (Burt Kwouk). The bomb destroys Clouseau's apartment and injures Cato, but Clouseau himself is unharmed, being lifted from the room by an inflatable disguise. Deciding that a more elaborate plan is needed, Dreyfus enlists an army of criminals to his cause and kidnaps nuclear physicist Professor Hugo Fassbender (Richard Vernon) and the Professor's daughter Margo (Briony McRoberts), forcing the professor to build a \\"doomsday weapon\\" in return for his daughter's freedom. Clouseau travels to England to investigate Fassbender's disappearance, where he wrecks their family home and ineptly interrogates Jarvis (Michael Robbins), Fassbender's cross-dressing butler. Although Jarvis is killed by the kidnappers, to whom he had become a dangerous witness, Clouseau discovers a clue that leads him to the Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany. Meanwhile, Dreyfus, using Fassbender's invention, dissolves the United Nations headquarters in New York City and blackmails the leaders of the world, including the President of the United States and his adviser (based on Gerald Ford and Henry Kissinger), into assassinating Clouseau. However, many of the nations instruct their operatives to kill the other assassins to gain Dreyfus's favor and possibly the Doomsday Machine. As a result of their orders and Clouseau's habitual clumsiness, the assassins all end up killing each other until only the agents of Egypt and Russia remain. The Egyptian assassin (an uncredited cameo by Omar Sharif) shoots one of Dreyfus' henchmen, mistaking him for Clouseau, but is seduced by the Russian...

The scientists are then shown working on the electronic surveillance installation and encountering problems with rats chewing the insulation on their power cables. Some 'false' readings are seen before the system fails. The antagonists are introduced at this point and the scientists and their colonels are depicted meeting various untimely and gruesome ends.Next the film cuts to an apparent military operation in Kandahar, Afghanistan in which the troops are depicted as not being cohesive as a group and show individual weaknesses. The operation ends when a 'civilian' woman approaches the group and reveals multiple grenades under her garment, at this point the operation is revealed to be a training exercise for rookie troops on US soil. The sergeant lambastes the troops for their failure then tells them they are going on a mission to bring supplies to scientists working on a surveillance system in a top secret area. By this time many of the troops have their individual characters established, namely that Napoleon is actually anti-war and that Crank is particularly gung-ho and violent.On arriving at the secret base there is no sign of the scientists.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it. Now, I have a new situation: Kathy and Jacob are two coworkers out having a drink at a bar after a day at the office. They both wear glasses and Kathy comments that she hates that she is so farsighted and wishes there was a surgery to fix it. Jacob says that he finds it amusing she is farsighted because he himself is nearsighted. They both laugh at the opposite nature of their eye condition, and then both look at the menu on the other side of the room to decide what drinks to order next.

Congress MUST ACT NOW! ||||| US president Donald Trump tweeted at length about immigration today, following up on yesterday’s references to “caravans” of people heading toward the US border with Mexico. Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch & Release. Getting more dangerous. “Caravans” coming.

They must stop them at their Northern Border, which they can do because their border laws work, not allow them to pass through into our country, which has no effective border laws….. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2018 There is little connection between the approaching “caravan” and the US program Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) cited by the US president. DACA only applies to immigrants who entered the US illegally as minors more then 10 years ago. The caravan is a group of Central American men, women and children. They number up to 1,000, according to organizers, and are currently traveling through Mexico with the goal of eventually crossing into the US. Their hope, as Buzzfeed’s Adolfo Flores reports, is that strength in numbers will protect them from the violent cartels that migrants sometimes encounter on the journey north, as well present a logistical challenge for immigration authorities hoping to turn them away.

(Reuters/Jose Jesus Cortes) ||||| President Donald Trump railed against immigrants, Mexico, and Democrats in a series of tweets on Sunday and Monday that suggested a caravan of immigrants reportedly traveling toward the U.S. are trying to take advantage of a program they would not qualify for. At the White House Easter Egg roll on Monday, Trump told reporters: “The Democrats have really let them down. They really let them down. It’s a shame. A lot of people have taken advantage of DACA. It’s a shame,” according to a pool report. Trump’s statements appear to have come after Fox News reported on a caravan of over 1,000 Central American migrants that is currently traveling through Mexico. The migrants’ trek was first reported by BuzzFeed News. The 2018 caravan is being organized by a humanitarian volunteer group called Pueblos Sin Fronteras, or People Without Borders. The group organized two similar caravans in 2017 and has aided migrants and refugees on the move for over 15 years, according to its website. The group hopes that by traveling in such a large group they will be able to avoid some of the dangers that befell travelers who take the often perilous route through Mexico to the southern border of the United States. Alex Mensing of Pueblos Sin Fronteras told ABC News that many of the caravan travelers are fleeing violence and that they are hoping to reach U.S. ports of entry in Arizona, California, or New Mexico where they will claim asylum and likely be detained. But starting on Sunday morning, Trump unleashed a flurry of tweets about the caravans – and seemed to conflate the group with DACA. Here are the facts. Trump blames “Catch & Release” Trump first tweeted that “caravans” are heading toward the Southern U.S. border, but patrol agents “are not allowed to properly do their jobs.” Trump blamed that inability to work on “ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch & Release.” The majority of migrants traveling in the 2018 caravan are originally from Honduras, according to BuzzFeed, and many are fleeing the political unrest that followed the 2017 elections there. Some two-thirds of the migrants reportedly hoping to seek asylum when they reach the U.S. During an appearance on Fox and Friends, the union chief of the National Border Patrol Council, Brandon Judd, suggested the “catch and release” policy was partly to blame. Under the policy, unlawful immigrants are released from detention while they await hearings in immigration court. Judd also said that immigrants can also be released if they claim asylum. “Once they enter the country, even if we are standing at the border with our hands out saying, ‘Don’t enter, don’t enter,’ all they have to do is cross one foot into the border and we have to take them into custody,” he said. “If they ask for asylum or say I fear to go back to my country, then we have to process them under ‘credible fear’ which allows them to be released into our country.” In a February 2017 memo, then Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said the administration was ending “catch and release,” but a Reuters report from last June showed that it was easier said than done. The Trump Administration’s attempt to end “Catch & Release” has been hampered by the reality that immigration authorities don’t have the space to hold every immigrant who is detained at the border, according to Reuters. Mexico denies it “is doing very little” to stop illegal immigration In tweets on Monday Trump blamed Mexico for allowing people to travel to the U.S., suggesting he would end the North American Free Trade Agreement in an effort to stem the flow of migrants. The BuzzFeed report notes that “no one has made any effort to stop” the migrants as they travel through Mexico without authorization. About one third of the migrants traveling plan to stay in the country rather than continue on to the U.S. Luis Videgaray Caso, Mexico’s Secretary of Foreign Affairs, responded in a tweet on Sunday, saying that Mexican authorities work with their American counterparts on migration “every day.” Caravan of immigrants not eligible for DACA In his tweets, Trump also declared the end of a deal on DACA, a program that has protected young immigrants who were brought to the U.S. by their parents from deportation. Trump suggested that the immigrants who made up the caravan were coming to America in hopes of taking advantage of the program, which he effectively ended in September 2017. Efforts to offer DACA recipients permanent protections have stymied in Congress, in part due the to strict provisions Trump wants included in any deal. Trump has tried to shift the blame to Democrats, but it is not that simple. It should be noted that the migrants who are traveling in the caravan, no matter their age, would not qualify for DACA. The Trump administration stopped accepting new applications for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, on Sept. 5, 2017. Under the president’s orders, renewal applications for people who already benefitted from the program needed to have been turned in by Oct. 5, 2017. Legal challenges have kept the program alive, to an extent. The administration is still not accepting new applications, but people who have already benefitted from the program can reapply. According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, all renewal requests will be adjudicated under the guidelines that were set forth when the program was first established. |||||Summary:","completion":"The United States President Donald Trump tweeted extensively about an incoming “caravan” of migrants moving from Central America, through Mexico, and aiming for the U.S. border. Trump attributed this situation to “Weak Laws” at the U.S Border, and linked it to the NAFTA negotiations and foreign aid to Honduras. He argued that both Mexico and the U.S. Congress must take action to address this situation. He called for Border Patrol Agents to be allowed to do their jobs properly without being constrained by \\"ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch & Release\\". The tweets also tied the situation to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) program, despite the fact that the approaching migrants and DACA recipients have little connection. The “caravan” is made up of about 1,000 Central American individuals. Their aim is to reach the U.S., moving in large groups for protection against violent cartels and as a strategy to challenge immigration authorities. Trump's comments seem to have been sparked by reports about a caravan of over 1,000 Central American migrants traveling through Mexico, a trek principally covered by BuzzFeed News. The 2018 caravan is organized by a humanitarian volunteer group, Pueblos Sin Fronteras, or People Without Borders. They aim to offer safety in numbers, to help avoid the dangers faced by smaller groups making the treacherous journey through Mexico. The majority of the migrants are from Honduras and many are fleeing political instability following controversial elections in 2017. Their aim is to reach U.S. ports of entry where they will seek asylum, despite the fact that they might be detained. The influx of migrants has sparked heated debate about immigration policies like the “catch and release” policy that allows illegal immigrants to be released from detention while they await hearings in immigration court. Trump has been critical of Mexico, saying the country is performing little to prevent illegal immigration. He suggested ending NAFTA as an effort to stop migrant flows. However, Mexico’s Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Luis Videgaray Caso, responded by asserting that migration issues are addressed by Mexican authorities along with their U.S. counterparts on a daily basis. Finally, it’s important to note that the migrants within the caravans would not qualify for DACA as construed by Trump in his tweets. DACA, which is currently not accepting new applicants, only applies to immigrants who entered the United States illegally as minors more than 10 years ago. Those who previously benefited from the program can reapply following certain guidelines."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Background: Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation. Paragraph: Jason recently learned that he has cancer. After hearing this news, he convinced his wife, Charlotte, to get checked out. After running several tests, the doctors determined Charlotte has no cancer, but she does have high blood pressure.

Write a text based on this summary: senior political analyst deported from united states after visa revoked Text:","completion":"In a sensational event that brought the issue of immigration laws into the spotlight, a highly respected senior political analyst was forcefully deported from the United States after his visa was abruptly revoked. This event has stirred controversies and debates about the rationality of immigration policies, free speech, and the freedom of press in America. The political analyst, whose identity has been kept confidential due to security concerns, had been residing in the United States for several years. He had procured his visa through legal channels and had been providing invaluable insights backed with acute analysis on a wide range of political issues. His perspective had gained much attention and respect in both political and academic circles, contributing significantly to intellectual debates and discussions across various platforms. However, the sudden revocation of his visa and subsequent deportation has shocked many across the country. The analyst had been living in the US under a valid visa which was suddenly devoid of its validity by immigration officials without any advance notice or explicit reasoning. This unexpected move led to his immediate deportation, leaving the analyst with little time to grasp the reality of his situation. This situation has raised several questions regarding the state of the country's immigration policies, with many critics citing the event as an example of the arbitrary and disorderly nature of American immigration systems. Many have questioned whether the unusual process of revocation was a genuine administrative measure or a strategic move that veils deeper political motives. Furthermore, the deportation has sparked concerns about the role of free speech and the freedom of the press in America. As the deported individual was a prominent figure in the public discourse, some speculate that his analysis and outspoken opinions may have attracted undue attention from authorities. Critics argue that this could potentially be an attempt to suppress dissent and control debate, thereby infringing upon the principles of free speech and free press. Amidst this chaos and controversy, there has been an outpouring of support for the deported analyst. Various political figures, academicians, journalists and public figures have expressed concern and disappointment over the incident. They all stand unified in advocating for a clearer, more rational approach to immigration policies. It's clear that the deportation of the senior political analyst will have far-reaching implications. The situation has raised questions on the essence of democratic values such as the freedom of speech and press. It also underscores the urgent need for a humanized, transparent, and accountable approach to immigration law and policy. As it stands, this event has served as a startling reminder of the intersectionality between politics, immigration policies, and the values of freedom and justice in the United States. It is a critical juncture that calls for collective introspection, discussion, and reform in order to uphold the principles that are benchmarked as foundational to the democracy of the country."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize: Uganda had planned to send the pipeline through Kenya, which wanted a joint facility for oil from its own fields that are under development. The pipeline will now be routed further south, with concerns about possible attacks by Somalia's al-Shabab Islamists said to be a factor. The group has attacked targets close to where the pipeline would have passed. Uganda announced its decision in Kampala at a summit of the East African Community bloc, which groups Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda and South Sudan. The 1,400km (800 miles) pipeline will connect Uganda's western region near Hoima, where big oil reserves have been discovered, with Tanzania's port of Tanga. The project is expected to cost about 4bn (Â£2.8bn) and create 15,000 jobs. The discovered oil reserves in Uganda are estimated at some 6.5bn barrels, and the country expects to start production in 2018. France's Total, China's CNOOC and Britain's Tullow hold most of the licences. Kenya, which has also struck oil, had wanted the pipeline to pass through its territory. Uganda had initially signed such a deal, but Total later questioned the plan over security concerns, the BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga in Kampala reports. Ugandan Foreign Minister Sam Kutesa said on Saturday that the cost was also a factor in choosing the project. \\"We considered Tanga oil pipeline route based on a number of aspects - among them it is the least cost,\\" he told the AFP news agency. Reports also suggest that Uganda backed the Tanzanian route because the country's port of Tanga is already fully operational, while Kenya's Lamu port is still being built. When completed, it will be East Africa's first major oil pipeline. Meanwhile, Kenya said it would build its own pipeline from Lokichar, in the north-east, to Lamu.

Please answer the following question: Our family was going to go fishing on Saturday. A few years ago we went fishing down the hill from a mushroom farm called Happy Pond. Since that time, there has been a lot of rain and we noticed Happy Pond had a green coating across the top of it. We also thought about going to a new pond in center of the park called Ridge Pond. We are hoping to catch a lot of fish to serve at our family reunion. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Does Happy Pond have more nitrogen or oxygen? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it is not possible to provide an exact measurement of the nitrogen and oxygen levels in Happy Pond. However, we can make an educated guess based on the given context. When you mentioned that there has been a lot of rain since your last visit and that the pond now has a green coating across the top of it, this suggests the presence of an algal bloom. Algal blooms typically occur when there is an excess of nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, entering the water. These nutrients can come from various sources, such as agricultural runoff, sewage, or even natural processes like decomposing plants and fish waste. Algal blooms can reduce the oxygen levels in the water, as algae consume oxygen at night when they are not photosynthesizing, and also when they die and decompose. In some cases, the reduced oxygen levels can lead to fish kills, as there is not enough dissolved oxygen in the water to support aquatic life. Given the green coating across the top of Happy Pond and the occurrence of an algal bloom, it is likely that the pond has a higher concentration of nitrogen compared to oxygen. The excess nitrogen contributes to the algal bloom, which in turn reduces the oxygen levels in the water. However, please note that this analysis is based on the information provided and the typical conditions that encourage algal blooms. To properly determine the nutrient and oxygen levels in Happy Pond, water tests would need to be conducted. Considering the conditions of Happy Pond, it may be a better option for your family to try fishing at Ridge Pond in the center of the park. Not only does it provide a new experience, but it could potentially have better water quality and a healthier fish population to support your family reunion needs."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - The even-toed ungulates (order Artiodactyla) are ungulates (hoofed animals) whose weight is borne equally by the third and fourth toes. By contrast, odd-toed ungulates, such as horses, bear their weight primarily on their third toe. The aquatic Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) evolved from even-toed ungulate ancestors, and therefore modern taxonomic classification combines Artiodactyla and Cetacea into Cetartiodactyla. - Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago. The whales comprise eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the gray whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales). - The common dolphin is the name given to two species ( and possibly a third ) of dolphin making up the genus Delphinus . Prior to the mid- 1990s , most taxonomists only recognised one species in this genus , the common dolphin Delphinus delphis . Modern cetologists usually recognise two species -- the short - beaked common dolphin , which retains the systematic name Delphinus delphis , and the long - beaked common dolphin Delphinus capensis . The common dolphin is not the dolphin of popular imagination despite its name ; that distinction belongs to the bottlenose dolphin due to its widespread use in marine parks and its appearance in the television series Flipper .

All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Oceanic dolphins or Delphinidae are a widely distributed family of dolphins that live in the sea. Thirty extant species are described. They include several big species whose common names contain \\"whale\\" rather than \\"dolphin\\", such as the killer whale and the pilot whales. Delphinidae is a family within the superfamily Delphinoidea, which also includes the porpoises (Phocoenidae) and the Monodontidae (beluga whale and narwhal). River dolphins are relatives of the Delphinoidea. - River dolphins are a widely distributed group of fully aquatic mammals that reside exclusively in freshwater or brackish water. They are an informal grouping of dolphins, which is a paraphyletic group within the infraorder Cetacea. The river dolphins comprise the extant families Platanistidae (the Indian dolphins), Iniidae (the Amazonian dolphins), and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins). There are five extant species of river dolphins, and two subspecies. River dolphins, alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla, with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. - Iniidae is a family of river dolphins containing one living and four extinct genera. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Porpoises are a group of fully aquatic marine mammals that are sometimes referred to as mereswine, all of which are classified under the family Phocoenidae, parvorder Odontoceti (toothed whales). There are six extant species of porpoise. They are small toothed whales that are very closely related to oceanic dolphins. The most obvious visible difference between the two groups is that porpoises have shorter beaks and flattened, spade-shaped teeth distinct from the conical teeth of dolphins. Porpoises, and other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged from them about 40 million years ago. - Cetacea are a widely distributed and diverse clade of aquatic mammals that today consists of the whales, dolphins, and porpoises. Cetaceans are carnivorous and finned. Most species live in the sea, some in rivers. The name is derived from the Latin \\"cetus\\" \\"whale\\" and Greek \\"ketos\\" \\"huge fish\\". - Dolphins are a widely distributed and diverse group of aquatic mammals. They are an informal grouping within the order Cetacea, excluding whales and porpoises, so to zoologists the grouping is paraphyletic. The dolphins comprise the extant families Delphinidae (the oceanic dolphins), Platanistidae (the Indian river dolphins), Iniidae (the new world river dolphins), and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins), and the extinct Lipotidae (baiji or Chinese river dolphin). There are 40 extant species of dolphins. Dolphins, alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates. Their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago.

Leah was passionate about design and had always aspired to become a successful graphic designer. She poured her heart and soul into her work, tirelessly honing her skills while working at a local café to make ends meet. After years of dedication and countless freelance projects, she believed she was finally ready to take on the competitive world of graphic design. On a warm summer day, Leah came across a job listing for a graphic designer in a renowned advertising agency. The company insisted that they were looking for the best talent in town, not just for someone with the right qualifications but also with true creativity. Leah, both nervous and excited, saw this as the perfect opportunity to take her career to the next level. She set to work, crafting the most impressive resume and portfolio she could muster and submitted her application. Leah anxiously awaited the response from the agency. Days felt like weeks, and weeks like months as she waited, her hope dwindling. To her surprise, a month later, she received an email inviting her for an interview with the agency. Leah couldn't contain her joy, yet she knew that getting an interview was just the first step. She prepared tirelessly, studying every inch of the company's history and their creative output. On the day of the interview, Leah arrived early, dressed in her best outfit and armed with a professionally curated portfolio. As she entered the lobby of the building, she realized that the competition was stiff; it seemed like everyone in town had heard about the open position, and there were a dozen similarly skilled designers vying for the job. Despite her nervousness, Leah felt that she had a unique perspective on design that would separate her from the rest. Leah's turn came, and she was ushered into the interview room. The interviewing panel consisted of the company's top executives, and their presence intimidated Leah.

Depending on your age, overall health, and the type and stage of your lymphoma, your doctor can tell you which chemo drugs are best for your treatment. Get chemotherapy intravenously for widespread, treatable lymphoma.","completion":"Treating lymphoma involves a comprehensive, personalized approach that is determined by several factors such as the specific type of lymphoma, its stage, the patient's age, and overall health. After discussing the appropriate chemotherapy drugs with your doctor, several other steps and strategies can be considered in the treatment process to ensure the most effective and holistic care for the individual. Here is an outline of the steps and strategies that most naturally follow: 1. Establish a treatment plan: Once the doctor has recommended appropriate chemotherapy drugs, a detailed treatment plan should be developed considering the patient's specific needs and preferences. This plan will outline the frequency and duration of chemotherapy sessions, the dosage of each drug, and any additional therapies that may be incorporated into the treatment. 2. Receive chemotherapy: Chemotherapy can be administered intravenously or orally, depending on the specific drugs and the patient's condition. Intravenous chemotherapy is often preferred for widespread, treatable lymphoma, as it provides a quicker and more direct route for the medication to reach the affected areas. During chemotherapy sessions, patients may receive additional medications to counteract side effects, such as anti-nausea drugs or steroid medications. 3. Consider additional therapies: Often, a combination of therapies is used to treat lymphoma. In addition to chemotherapy, other common treatment approaches include radiation therapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and stem cell transplantation. The treatment plan should be regularly reviewed and adjusted as needed. 4. Regular monitoring and evaluation: Throughout the treatment process, the patient's condition and response to therapy should be closely monitored. This includes regular blood tests, imaging tests (such as CT scans or PET scans), and biopsies when necessary. Evaluations will help the healthcare team adjust the treatment plan accordingly and ensure the patient receives optimal care. 5. Follow a healthy lifestyle: Adopting a healthy lifestyle can contribute positively to the recovery process. Patients should maintain a balanced diet, engage in regular physical activity, and manage stress. They should also abstain from smoking and limit alcohol consumption. 6. Manage side effects of treatment: Chemotherapy and other lymphoma treatments can have various side effects on the patient, including fatigue, nausea, hair loss, and an increased risk of infection. It is essential to work with the healthcare team to manage and alleviate side effects, improve the patient’s quality of life, and ensure treatment adherence. 7. Access support services: There are various physical, emotional, and financial challenges that patients with lymphoma may face during treatment. It is essential to seek support from specialized support groups, counselors, or social workers to cope with the emotional impact of the illness and treatment. Additionally, family members and friends can play a significant role in supporting the patient during this time. 8. Follow-up care and surveillance: Once the lymphoma treatment is completed, and the cancer goes into remission, it is crucial to continue with regular follow-up appointments and monitoring. This allows healthcare professionals to detect any signs of relapse as early as possible and initiate additional treatment if needed. In conclusion, treating lymphoma typically consists of a multifaceted approach involving chemotherapy, possibly combined with other therapies, and continuous monitoring of the patient's response. Additionally, adopting a healthy lifestyle, managing side effects, and accessing support services can improve the overall treatment experience and outcome. Regular follow-up care and surveillance are essential to ensure timely detection of any disease recurrence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Unfortunately, I am left with no choice but to give this app a 1-star rating due to its poor performance, lack of functionality, and continuous crashes. First off, the app's user interface is confusing and not at all user-friendly. I had to struggle to find the settings and options that I needed to manage the night mode feature. The lack of clear instructions or a help section further exasperates the situation. Secondly, the app's core functionality, enabling night mode, barely works as intended. On the off chance that it does manage to activate night mode, it does so with massive inconsistencies, sometimes turning itself off without warning or going back to normal mode. This inconsistency is frustrating and defeats the whole purpose of using the app in the first place. Moreover, the app is highly unstable, causing my phone to crash on multiple occasions. I even tried reinstalling it, but the same issues persist. It's evident that the developers didn't put enough effort into optimizing it for a variety of devices.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? draggy","completion":"The sentiment of the word \\"draggy\\" cannot be determined without proper context as it is a single word and not a complete sentence. However, in general, the word \\"draggy\\" tends to have a negative connotation. The term is typically used to describe situations, events or activities that are slow-moving, boring, or tiresome. It implies a sense of sluggishness, weariness or lack of excitement and enthusiasm. For instance, when used in a complete sentence, examination of the sentiment would be clearer: 1) \\"The movie was so draggy that I couldn't wait for it to end.\\" (negative sentiment) 2) \\"I had a draggy day at work because it was slow and I didn't have much to do.\\" (negative sentiment) In both examples, the context surrounding the usage of the word \\"draggy\\" indicates that it is a negative emotion, as it is being used to describe situations which are monotonous, slow or dull. However, there could be instances where \\"draggy\\" might be used in an ironic or humorous tone, emphasizing the tedious nature of a situation in a light-hearted manner. Example: \\"Our road trip was so draggy that we ended up bonding over our shared boredom.\\" (mixed sentiment - while still negative, there is a hint of humor and bonding that emerged from the situation) In conclusion, while the word \\"draggy\\" in isolation does not allow for a definitive assessment of sentiment, it predominantly expresses a negative connotation.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"The supposed perturbation in the power plant extending its customer base would be indirectly impacting a step of the process. This is because increasing the customer base suggests a higher demand for electricity. To meet this increased demand, the power plant would need to produce more electricity. As a result, more coal would be required to fuel the power generation process. This increased demand for coal would not directly impact any particular step in the process but would indirectly affect the entire system. The need for more coal would lead to a higher rate of coal being fed into the pulverizer, which would then require the following steps to be adjusted accordingly: 1. The coal-air mixture would need to be increased to ensure efficient burning of a higher amount of coal in the furnace. 2. As more coal is burned, more water would need to be heated in the boiler to produce the increased amount of steam necessary to power the turbine. 3. The turbine would have to handle higher levels of steam, generating more mechanical energy to spin the generator. 4. The generator would have to produce more electricity to meet customer demand, which could require additional or more efficient generators. 5. The condenser would need to cool a greater volume of steam, and more water would need to be returned to the boiler, ensuring sufficient supply for the next cycle. Although the perturbation is not directly impacting a specific step, it indirectly influences the entire coal power generation process. The power plant would need to scale up and optimize its operations to accommodate the increased demand for electricity brought about by the expanding customer base. This, in turn, would necessitate more coal to arrive at the power station, affecting the overall process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What group of people were the most abundant in Brazil in 1872? from the following article ? White Brazilians descended from the original Portuguese settlers. From the 1870s onwards this ethnic group also included other European immigrants: mainly Italians, Spaniards and Germans. Although whites could be found throughout the country, they were the majority group in the southern region and in São Paulo province. Whites also comprised a significant proportion (40%) of the population in the northeastern provinces of Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or brown. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piauí, Maranhão, Pará and Amazonas.Because of the existence of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872.

After earning success in the Western TV series \\"Rawhide\\", he rose to international fame with his role as the Man with No Name in Sergio Leone's \\"Dollars\\" trilogy of spaghetti Westerns during the 1960s, and as antihero cop Harry Callahan in the five \\"Dirty Harry\\" films throughout the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, among others, have made Eastwood an enduring cultural icon of masculinity. - Rhodesia, commonly known from 1970 onwards as the Republic of Rhodesia, was an unrecognised state in southern Africa from 1965 to 1979, equivalent in territorial terms to modern Zimbabwe. With its capital in Salisbury (now Harare), Rhodesia was considered a \\"de facto\\" successor state to the former British colony of Southern Rhodesia (which had achieved responsible government in 1923). - Spaghetti Western, also known as Italian Western or Macaroni Western (primarily in Japan), is a broad subgenre of Western films that emerged in the mid-1960s in the wake of Sergio Leone's film-making style and international box-office success. The term was used by American critics and other countries because most of these Westerns were produced and directed by Italians. - The Man with No Name is the protagonist portrayed by Clint Eastwood in Sergio Leone's \\"Dollars Trilogy\\" of Spaghetti Western films: \\"A Fistful of Dollars\\" (1964), \\"For a Few Dollars More\\" (1965) and \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\" (1966). He is easily recognizable due to his iconic brown hat, green poncho, tan cowboy boots, fondness for cigarillos and the fact that he rarely talks. Since he never received a name in any of the films, he is conventionally known as \\"the man with no name\\". When Clint Eastwood was honored with the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996 Jim Carrey held the introductory speech and said: \\"'The Man With No Name' had no name, so we could fill in our own.\\" In 2008, \\"Empire\\" chose the Man With No Name as the 33rd greatest movie character of all time. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - An antihero, or antiheroine, is a protagonist who lacks conventional heroic qualities such as idealism, courage, or morality.

As a side note, I met her several years later and found out we were a major help putting her daughter through school. We had one kid in our group who was a perpetual problem, a wannabe at everything. He just tried too freaking hard to be the center of attention. Well, he joined us ONCE in a trip to Denny's. I mean we pulled up in six cars, all packed to the gills at 3a.m. and took up almost half of the restaurant. We get done, our favorite waitress drops the check, and this goofball says something about “dine and dash.” We all just looked at him like he had grown a penis in the middle of his forehead and was trying to screw anyone within spitting distance with it. This kid wasn't driving, it would be a ten mile walk through neighborhoods that were questionable during the daytime, and he is talking about not just stiffing our favorite waitress on a tip, but walking out without paying? Are you kidding me? “Ryan. If you do that, you will be left beaten and bloody in the parking lot and EVERY ONE of us will participate.” He hanged his head and coughed up his share of the bill, but he still didn't leave a tip. She made over five bucks a head in tips every time we walked in the door. Several of us were servers, bartenders, bouncers, and a couple strippers. Tips were how a lot of us put food on the table, and chemicals in our system. We shared when we had a good night. Needless to say, Ryan never joined us on a run to Denny's again.

High-quality lean proteins help stabilize your blood sugar and fill you up, keeping you from feeling the urge to snack on unhealthy foods later. Eating plenty of lean proteins can also help regulate your insulin and cortisol levels, both of which help get rid of your muffin top. Wild salmon is a particularly good source of lean protein that also contains belly fat-fighting omega-3 fatty acids. Eggs are also a great source of lean protein that contain relatively few calories. Eggs are also generally inexpensive, making them a great option for fighting belly fat on a budget. Like lean proteins, eating more fiber is essential for getting rid of your muffin top. Fibrous foods help you stay full and satisfied longer, decreasing your desire to snack and your caloric intake. Apples, bananas, raspberries, pears, and strawberries are all high fiber fruits that can help fill you up and fight belly fat. Broccoli, brussels sprouts, turnip greens, and green peas all contain several grams of fiber per serving. Antioxidant-rich foods, such as kale and spinach, can reduce inflammation that contributes to belly fat. In addition, these foods contain several of the vitamins your body needs to stay healthy and keep on track with your fat-burning plan. Green tea is also a great fat-burning option that is high in antioxidants. While it may seem counter-intuitive to increase your intake of fat, healthy unsaturated fats can actually fight belly fat rather than add to it. Avocados, olive oil, raw nuts, and fish are all great sources of monounsaturated fats that will fill you up and give you more energy without increasing unwanted body fat. In contrast to unsaturated fats, which can fight belly fat, saturated and trans fats, such as those found in processed cheese, can contribute to belly fat and easily derail your progress. Sugar is likely one of the biggest contributors to the development of your muffin top. Foods that are high in processed sugar tend to be very high in calories, which can be difficult to burn off. Processed sugar can also be addictive, causing you to overindulge and increase the amount of fat stored in your belly. Therefore, to get rid of your muffin top, it’s crucial that you avoid consuming too much sugar and instead, focus on filling up on healthier options. While it’s important to cut back on sugar, you don’t need to give it up entirely to get rid of your muffin top. Try to eat sugar only occasionally and practice portion control when you do. When you’re craving something sweet, try eating fruit instead of anything made with processed sugar. While fruits are still high in sugar, the natural sugar found in fruits is much less likely to contribute to belly fat. To help get rid of your muffin top, avoid eating highly processed carbohydrates, including white bread, pastries, cookies, cake, white rice, and potato products. While eating some healthy carbohydrates helps fuel your body for workouts, processed carbohydrates can increase your insulin levels and, in turn, increase or maintain the amount of fat stored in your belly. Insulin keeps fat where it’s currently stored. Therefore, if you have a muffin top, increasing your insulin levels can keep your belly fat where it is. Instead of processed carbohydrates, focus on eating healthy, whole grain carbohydrates, such as quinoa and oats. Skipping meals can increase your cortisol levels, which can contribute to belly fat. Therefore, it’s important that you make an effort to eat regularly to help manage your body’s stress hormones. Eating healthy snacks and regular meals will also help keep you from overeating or snacking late at night. Eating regularly also keeps your metabolism from lagging, which is essential for getting rid of your muffin top. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article focuses on the importance of consuming lean proteins, fiber, antioxidant-rich foods, healthy unsaturated fats, and whole grain carbohydrates in order to get rid of belly fat or a \\"muffin top.\\" It emphasizes the need to avoid processed sugars, unhealthy carbohydrates, saturated and trans fats, and to not skip meals in order to maintain a stable blood sugar, manage stress hormones, and prevent overeating.

The fungus also thrives in warm, moist environments and may enter your body through cuts or openings between the nail and skin. Don’t share shoes, socks, or towels with anyone. Avoid walking barefoot in locker rooms, public swimming pools, communal showers, or gyms. Discard old shoes that may still be infected with the fungus. Wash your hands with soap after touching the infected toenail(s) to keep it from spreading to uninfected nails. Keep your infected foot dry by wearing open-toed shoes or wearing dry, clean socks. This infection can begin mildly, but spread into a more uncomfortable condition. The fungus may cause your nail to change color, disintegrate at the edge, or become abnormally thick. If it becomes bothersome, the condition should be treated. Try a prescription medicated antifungal cream that’s rubbed into the nail after it’s soaked in warm water.

Which cousin has a higher chance of developing body-cavity lymphoma? Hint: Hepatitis viruses can develop into a chronic viral infection that leads to liver cancer. Infection by human T-lymphotropic virus can lead to tropical spastic paraparesis and adult T-cell leukaemia. Human papillomaviruses are an established cause of cancers of cervix, skin, anus, and penis. Within the Herpesviridae, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus causes Kaposi's sarcoma and body-cavity lymphoma, and Epstein–Barr virus causes Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, B lymphoproliferative disorder, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Merkel cell polyomavirus closely related to SV40 and mouse polyomaviruses that have been used as animal models for cancer viruses for over 50 years. A:","completion":"Both Tim and Nate are dealing with different types of chronic viral infections, and it is crucial to understand the links between these specific viruses and the development of body-cavity lymphoma to determine which cousin has a higher chance of developing this type of cancer. Tim has Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), also known as human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). This virus is a member of the Herpesviridae family and is associated with the development of Kaposi's sarcoma, which is a cancer that originates from the cells lining the blood vessels or lymphatic vessels. Apart from causing Kaposi's sarcoma, KSHV is also responsible for primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), also known as body-cavity-based lymphomas (BCBL), which are a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma typically found in the pleural, peritoneal, and pericardial cavities. On the other hand, Nate is infected with the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), also known as human herpesvirus 4 (HHV-4), which is another member of the Herpesviridae family. EBV is commonly associated with infectious mononucleosis (\\"mono\\" or the \\"kissing disease\\") and is also implicated in several types of cancers, including Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Although EBV is linked to various malignancies, it is not directly associated with body-cavity lymphomas. Given the information provided, Tim, who is infected with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, has a higher chance of developing body-cavity lymphoma compared to Nate. This conclusion is drawn based on the fact that KSHV is directly linked to primary effusion lymphoma (body-cavity lymphoma), while EBV, which infects Nate, is not associated with these types of malignancies. However, it's important to note that although the presence of these viruses increases cancer risk, not everyone infected with KSHV or EBV necessarily develops cancer. In addition to viral infection, a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors also contribute to an individual's likelihood of developing malignancies. Early detection, effective management of the chronic infections, and monitoring for potential symptoms or risk factors can significantly reduce the likelihood of cancer development in both Tim and Nate."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Thirty-four children were referred to the Young People's Gender Service in 2013, rising to 150 last year. Gender equality group Scottish Trans Alliance said the increase was down to increased awareness of trans issues. But the group has warned the service was under-resourced and waiting times were too long. The Young People's Gender Service at Sandyford offers a \\"comprehensive gender identity service\\" to children concerned about their gender. It is run by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, but receives referrals from across Scotland. The figures were revealed by The Times Scotland. Source: Scottish government James Morton, manager at the Scottish Trans Alliance, said: \\"I think back in 2013 if you were a young person struggling with gender, they did not know where to turn to. \\"And if they went to see their GP, often their GP would not know where to turn to either. But over the last few years, the referral pathways have become much clearer. \\"It's also only in the last few years that many children have become aware of a word to describe what they're going through.\\" The clinic sees people with \\"gender dysphoria\\" - when someone experiences discomfort or distress because there is a mismatch between their biological sex and gender identity. Mr Morton said waiting times at Sandyford were often several months and could be more than a year. \\"The staff there are excellent, but the hours they have available to see people are too small,\\" he said. \\"NHS Scotland have been trying to expand capacity, but it's a struggle to catch up with demand\\" He told the BBC he believed waiting times should be 18 weeks in common with other outpatient clinics, but said that could be achieved with just one more full-time post at the centre. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said the team at Sandyford had been increased after a \\"rapid increase\\" in referrals in 2015 and 2016. Currently a consultant child psychiatrist, consultant child psychologist, a principal child psychologist, an occupational therapist and a counsellor work at the centre. The health board said in a statement: \\"We anticipate that referrals will continue to rise.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? bray is completely at sea ; with nothing but a savage garden music video on his resume , he has no clue about making a movie","completion":"The sentiment of the given movie review sentence appears to be negative overall. This statement references a director's (presumably bray) lack of experience and inability to successfully craft a movie. Here's a detailed analysis of the negative elements found in the sentence. 1. \\"Bray is completely at sea\\": This phrase is used to indicate that someone is bewildered or lacks understanding in a certain situation. In this case, it's being used to criticize the director's capabilities or knowledge about making a movie. The phrase has a negative connotation as it highlights incompetence or disorientation. 2. \\"With nothing but a savage garden music video on his resume\\": This part of the sentence suggests that the director has minimal experience or a constricted scope of work. Savage Garden is a pop band, and directing a music video for them does not necessarily showcase expertise or competence in making a feature film. This observation aims to devalue the director's work and further emphasizes the negative sentiment. 3. \\"He has no clue about making a movie\\": This phrase strongly conveys that the director does not have the required knowledge, vision, or skills to create a cinematic piece. The word \\"clue\\" in this context implies that the reviewer believes that the director has not demonstrated any aptitude in filmmaking. This statement embodies a disapproving tone and reinforces the negative sentiment of the movie review sentence. To sum up, the sentiment analysis of the given movie review sentence reveals strong negative emotions regarding the director's experience and abilities in filmmaking. The reviewer's choice of language and phrases strongly conveys dissatisfaction and disapproval of the director's work.

Write highlights for this article: He was barely a teenager, while on the other side of the net stood his country's most famous face. A towering figure who had won Wimbledon just one year earlier. Despite the pressure, budding tennis star Marin Cilic handled both his nerves and his racquet well enough to impress Goran Ivanisevic. \\"It was an extremely huge experience for me,\\" Cilic, now 26, told CNN of his date with destiny in the Croatian capital Zagreb. \\"He had been my idol, like for most of the kids in Croatia. He'd just won Wimbledon and there I was -- a 14-year-old kid playing tennis with him. \\"It was a dream come true.\\" It was an experience that also launched Cilic's career. Ivanisevic was so struck by the youngster's potential he recommended that his old coach, Bob Brett, oversee his development. The Australian duly did so and shortly after, Cilic served a more formal notice of his talents when winning the French Open boys' title in 2005 -- beating top seed Andy Murray in the semifinals. The pair would work together until May 2013, separating just weeks before the former would learn he had failed a doping test in April. That seismic news was broken to the big server in June, prompting Cilic to immediately quit the ongoing Wimbledon championships, albeit citing a knee injury as he did so. As he awaited the fallout for what he has always claimed was an innocent mistake -- saying he inadvertently ingested a banned substance while in France, as he didn't realize that his regular glucose tablets were manufactured differently there -- Cilic turned to his boyhood hero. \\"It was the obvious decision,\\" he says. \\"Goran was around me and my team before, and he was a close friend. When I stopped with Bob, Goran and I talked about whether he could help me or not. He felt I could improve a lot.\\" He was spot on. Despite previously stating he has three personalities -- 'Good Goran', 'Bad Goran' and 'Emergency Goran' for when things go wrong -- Ivanisevic's expertise has resulted in Cilic's most successful season. He has improved his protÃ©gÃ©'s serve and mental strength, and Cilic credits him with the sense of enjoyment he is largely having on court. Checkered Start. Yet they came together at a time when Cilic's career was looking as checkered as Croatia's famous red-and-white flag. He was serving his nine-month doping ban, an act that often proves toxic for fans, media and sponsors, yet the duo were able to start to wrestle back credibility when the suspension was cut on appeal in October 2013. By then, Cilic's ranking had dropped from 12th to 47th. Exactly one year later, Cilic had achieved his highest ever rating -- number 8 -- and also had a grand slam success to look back on. In September, he beat Japan's Kei Nishikori to win the U.S. Open, a success made all the sweeter by not losing a single set in the final, semifinal -- when he trounced Roger Federer -- or the quarterfinal against Tomas Berdych. His combination with Ivanisevic has been alchemical at times. \\"Belief,\\" the 6ft 6in right-hander replies simply to the question as to what is the biggest thing the colorful Croat has given his compatriot. . \\"I think I am capable of making it to the top and being able to win big events.\\" By a quirk of serendipity, Cilic also feels the four months he was out of the game in 2013 contributed to his fantastic 2014, which delivered four titles -- double his previous best for any season. \\"Those four months were very tough, it was a difficult time but I learned a lot of things,\\" explained the world no. 9. \\"I matured as a person and I became more specific with the priorities in my life and what I wanted to achieve in my career. \\"I feel I pushed myself much more this year and I was a little bit more motivated -- that always gives you a bit extra and when you are at the top of tennis, even 1% makes a big difference. \\"I feel that the things I did last year, where I was working and preparing for the season, helped me to achieve what I achieved this year. \\"When I started this season, I felt really good -- maybe the best ever.\\" While his period in the wilderness helped recharge his batteries and contributed to his memorable year, the extent of his success may also have led to his only real blemish for 2014. Last week, Cilic made his debut at the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals but he struggled in London, losing all his matches in a challenging group involving eventual champion Novak Djokovic, Berdych and Stan Wawrinka. \\"It's a little bit disappointing to play like this. I was not expecting it,\\" he said after winning just six games in his opening two matches. \\"But I feel a little bit tired, and the body feels a little bit tired on the court.\\" Tears of Joy. His fatigued body may receive a timely boost next week if a long-awaited parcel from New York pitches up in the post. It will revive memories of a month when he played the 'greatest tennis' of his life, even if he says he's watched a DVD of the Flushing Meadows final at least 10 times already. \\"\\"The replica trophy still hasn't come, believe it or not. It's still being made in New York so hopefully it will arrive next week,\\" he said. \\"It's going to be at my apartment in Zagreb and I'm going to have to polish it -- every day!\\" His U.S. Open triumph made Cilic one of only three men outside the Big Four to have won a grand slam since 2005, with Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro and Switzerland's Wawrinka being the others. Like the man he befriended as a 14-year-old, Cilic's success has also turned him into a standout star in his homeland. \\"I didn't think it was going to mean that much but when I came back, I realized the extent of its effect on people,\\" said the man nicknamed 'Chila' by his friends. \\"It was one of the best moments of Croatian sports ever but I didn't think it was going to change people's lives for that week or month -- because everybody I saw was extremely happy. \\"They were unbelievably proud and whoever I saw on the street was congratulating me. That was the satisfaction for me that I could -- with my job and this achievement -- make people so happy.\\" On the day itself, even his boyhood idol shed a tear. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Answer:","completion":"The mentioned review would likely decrease the chances of buying the product for the following reasons: 1. The reviewer didn't buy the book, which suggests that the review is not based on a comprehensive understanding of the content. This makes it difficult to determine the validity of their observations. 2. The reviewer mentions a potentially inappropriate photograph of the author in the book, which may not have relevance to the book's topic. This could be seen as unprofessional and may raise questions about the credibility of the author. 3. The reviewer accuses the author of engaging in narcissistic behavior, which could indicate a potentially biased or self-promotional tone in the book. This may decrease the trust in the author's objectivity and comprehensive portrayal of the subject matter.

Those are great songs to have!! The rest of this CD was a big disappointment. It is unusual for me to prefer \\"radio\\" songs over the rest of an artist's offerings since the latter is typically more creative, in-depth, and genuine. However, for the rest of the album it appears that the Sneaker Pimps focused more on producing a sleazy, hiply dark image rather than making music. I was expecting a darkly sensual album when I bought this but the actual musical content leaves me hungry. In terms of a truly full album in this kind of popular music, Garbage easily performs better. If I could do it over again, I'd find the album and radio versions of 6 Underground and Spin Spin Sugar on singles or compilations instead.

New York (CNN) -- Criminal charges will not be filed against the owner of a chimpanzee that mauled and blinded a Connecticut woman earlier this year, according to Connecticut State's Attorney David Cohen. At a news conference Monday, Cohen explained that criminal prosecution against Sandra Herold, 77, was not warranted because she was not aware of the risk her pet posed. On February 16, Herold had called her friend Charla Nash, 55, for help in getting her pet chimpanzee Travis back inside her house after he used a key to escape. When Nash arrived at the Stamford home of her friend, the chimp, who had been featured in TV commercials for Coca-Cola and Old Navy, jumped on her and began biting and mauling her, causing serious injuries to her face, neck and hands. Police shot Travis to halt the attack and he later died of gunshot wounds.

Telekom Srbija ihalesi şaibesini sürdürüyor Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"The phrase \\"Telekom Srbija ihalesi şaibesini sürdürüyor\\" is in Turkish and translates to \\"Telekom Srbija tender continues its controversy\\" in English. Here is a detailed, long explanation of this statement: Telekom Srbija is the Serbian telecommunications company responsible for providing a wide range of services, including landline, mobile, and internet services. The statement addresses an ongoing issue related to a tender process, which is a competitive procurement procedure through which companies or organizations submit their proposals to offer particular goods, works, or services in response to a purchasing authority's requirements. In this case, it seems that Telekom Srbija's tender process has been surrounded by controversy that continues despite efforts to publish transparent procedures and results. The controversy might stem from various factors, including alleged irregularities in the bidding process, conflicts of interest, non-compliance with legal procedures, or other elements that might have undermined the competitiveness and integrity of this Telekom Srbija procurement. It's essential for public companies like Telekom Srbija to maintain transparency and fairness in their procurement procedures to ensure that they operate according to best practices and in the public interest. Continuing controversies surrounding the tender process erode the trust of the customers, shareholders, potential suppliers, and stakeholders in the company and, more broadly, in the overall integrity of the public procurement processes. To mitigate the controversy, Telekom Srbija may need to conduct a thorough investigation into the tender process, identify any irregularities, and make the necessary corrections to comply with relevant procurement laws and guidelines. Increasing the transparency of the tender process, ensuring open and fair competition, and communicating the reasons behind decision-making will be crucial steps in regaining stakeholder trust and moving forward from the controversy. Additionally, it might be beneficial for Telekom Srbija to engage with stakeholders, including suppliers and customers, to assure them of the company's commitment to ethical practices and open procurement procedures. Communicating improvements and actions taken to resolve the controversy will help in regaining the trust that may have been lost as a result of the ongoing tender issue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: I married young, at 19, bright-eyed and hopeful, and in a few months, we will celebrate our 29th anniversary. Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways. My husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable. My husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me. And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer. At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he’d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would “cure” him. Feeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken. I felt betrayed, confused, angry, sad, and yet, miraculously relieved. There was nothing wrong with me — I was just not his type. The emotions flew through me leaving my head and heart confused. What now? I loved this man with every fibre of my being. We had a good life together, sex aside, and had built a family. We were happy. I did not want a divorce and neither did he.

Before Christmas, Buddy's father had managed to get legal custody of him for this Christmas. So, he had a new suit, with a card pinned with his name and address and made the trip alone, by bus, to New Orleans. Several things occurred that kept me awake the whole night. First, the footfalls, the noise of my father running up and down the stairs, breathing heavily, I had to see what he was up to. So I hid and watched. There was a Christmas tree and the fireplace downstairs. Moreover, I could see my father. He was crawling around under the tree arranging a pyramid of packages. I felt dizzy, for what I saw forced me to reconsider everything. If these were presents intended for me, then obviously they had not been ordered by the Lord and delivered by Santa Claus; no, they were gifts bought and wrapped by my father. Which meant that my rotten little cousin Billy Bob and other rotten kids like him weren't lying when they laughed at me and told me there was no Santa Claus. The worst thought was: Had Sook known the truth, and lied to me? No, Sook would never lie to me. She believed. It was just that--well, though she was sixty-something, in some ways she was at least as much of a child as I was. I waited until I was sure he was in bed and sound asleep.

Incandescent light bulb While inert gas reduces filament evaporation, it also conducts heat from the filament, thereby cooling the filament and reducing efficiency. At constant pressure and temperature, the thermal conductivity of a gas depends upon the molecular weight of the gas and the cross sectional area of the gas molecules. Higher molecular weight gasses have lower thermal conductivity, because both the molecular weight is higher and also the cross sectional area is higher. Xenon gas improves efficiency because of its high molecular weight, but is also more expensive, so its use is limited to smaller lamps. Q: What affects the thermal conductivity of a gas?","completion":"Okay, imagine you have a balloon filled with tiny invisible balls called gas molecules. Thermal conductivity is how well these tiny balls can pass heat to each other, like playing hot potato. The thermal conductivity of a gas is affected by two main things: 1. The weight of the tiny balls (molecular weight): Heavier balls have a harder time playing hot potato, so they don't pass heat very well. 2. The size of the tiny balls (cross-sectional area): Bigger balls take up more space, so it's also harder for them to pass heat quickly. So, if the gas has heavier and bigger balls (like in xenon gas), it has lower thermal conductivity and doesn't pass heat very well. This can make some lights work better, but it can also make them more expensive."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

That's an average of one misstatement, exaggeration or falsehood for every three minutes, 15 seconds worth of remarks on the campaign trail, according to an analysis by Politico. The news site also analyzed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's remarks during the same period â€” and found that she made only eight erroneous statements, or one every 12 minutes. \\"The conclusion is inescapable: Trump's mishandling of facts and propensity for exaggeration so greatly exceed Clinton's as to make the comparison almost ludicrous,\\" Politico reports. \\"Though few statements match the audacity of his statement about his role in questioning Obama's citizenship, Trump has built a cottage industry around stretching the truth.\\" Trump's lies included whoppers like falsely accusing Clinton of starting the birther movement and claiming he opposed the Iraq war. The Politico analysis helps explain why Trump's campaign doesn't want moderator Lester Holt to fact-check him during Monday's debate. But the analysis also reveals that Trump faces a different standard among voters than Clinton.

A series of flashbacks is then shown with Rahul &amp; Tina's marriage, their honeymoon, Tina pregnant with her baby girl and, in a year of marriage, Tina gives birth to the baby girl. Tina was told that she would have complications in her pregnancy earlier but decided not to tell Rahul as she knew how much he wanted the child. Tina, who also loved the baby more than her life, has little time left, so she had previously written eight letters to her daughter (one for each of her first eight birthdays) and gives them to Rahul's mother (Farida Jalal) so that she will know her mother. Before dying, Tina asks Rahul to promise her to name their daughter Anjali. Eight years pass, and Rahul is a single parent living with his daughter Anjali Khanna (Sana Saeed) and loving mother.

Article: A lot of management training each year for Circle K Corporation, a national chain of convenience stores. Among the topics we address in our course is the retention of quality employees-a real challenge to managers when you consider the pay scale in the service industry. During these discussions, I ask the participants , \\"What has caused you to stay long enough to become a manager?\\" Some time back a new manager took the question and slowly, with her voice almost breaking, said, \\"It was a 19 baseball glove.\\" Cynthia told the group that she originally took a Circle K clerk job as an interim position while she looked for something better. On her second or third day behind the counter, she received a phone call from her nine-year-old son, Jessie. He needed a baseball glove for Little League. She explained that as a single mother, money was very tight, and her first check would have to go for paying bills. Perhaps she could buy his baseball glove with her second or third check. When Cynthia arrived for work the next morning, Patricia, the store manager, asked her to come to the small room in the back of the store that served as an office. Cynthia wondered if she had done something wrong or left some part of her job incomplete from the day before. She was concerned and confused. Patricia handed her a box. \\"I overheard you talking to your son yesterday,\\" she said, \\"and I know that it is hard to explain things to kids. This is a baseball glove for Jessie because he may not understand how important he is, even though you have to pay bills before you can buy gloves.

Worrying about your social life won't change anything, so try to relax. Think positively instead of punishing yourself with. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Positive thinking is easier than punishing yourself.\\"?","completion":"Yes, the paragraph suggests that adopting a positive mindset is better than engaging in self-punishment, particularly when it comes to accepting difficulties in making friends. However, the paragraph does not necessarily claim that positive thinking is easier than punishing oneself. In fact, shifting from negative to positive thinking can sometimes be challenging, but it is a more productive and healthier approach. Here's a more detailed explanation: 1. Recognize your thought patterns: The first step in accepting that you don't make friends easily is to become aware of your own thought patterns. Are you constantly berating yourself for your perceived social shortcomings? Do you unfairly compare yourself to others? By identifying these counterproductive thoughts, you can begin to challenge and change them. 2. Cultivate self-compassion: Instead of focusing on your perceived failures, remind yourself that everybody has their unique strengths and challenges. It is essential to be kind to yourself and recognize that nobody is perfect. Self-compassion also encourages you to be gentle and understanding with yourself as you navigate the complexities of social interactions. 3. Focus on your strengths: Rather than dwelling on the fact that you might struggle to make friends, consider your other qualities and abilities. By concentrating on your strengths and building confidence in other areas of your life, you'll likely feel more equipped and self-assured in social situations. 4. Be patient: Making genuine connections with people takes time, and it is important to remember that friendships cannot be rushed or forced. Give yourself permission to take the time you need to build strong, meaningful relationships, and remember that even developing just a few deep friendships is just as valuable as having numerous acquaintances. 5. Seek support: It's not uncommon to struggle with making friends, and seeking advice or guidance from trusted individuals like family members, therapists, or support groups can be helpful. They can offer insights, strategies, and encouragement to help you build meaningful connections with others. 6. Embrace self-improvement: It's never too late to develop your social skills. Consider joining clubs, volunteering, or taking workshops on communication or active listening. These experiences will not only enhance your interpersonal skills but also provide opportunities to meet new people and practice forming connections. 7. Practice gratitude: Make a conscious effort to be thankful for the friends and relationships you do have. Cherishing these connections can help you feel more content with your social life, while also reinforcing the importance of quality over quantity when it comes to friendships. In conclusion, while the paragraph suggests that positive thinking is a more beneficial approach than self-punishment, it doesn't directly imply that it is easier. Changing one's mindset may be challenging, but it is worth the effort because it fosters self-compassion, growth, and resilience in social situations."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. BERLIN, Germany -- Germany, stripped of two equestrian golds in Athens, will almost certainly lose a third title after two of its show jumping horses failed dope tests. What is this text about?","completion":"This text is about a scandal that occurred in the world of competitive equestrian sports in Germany, tightly focusing on a doping issue that potentially led to the loss of multiple coveted titles for the country. Specifically, it occurred during or after an athletics event in Athens, where the German equestrian team had already been stripped of two gold medals. The first part of the text mentions that Germany had already faced the loss of two gold medals in equestrian events. This would imply that there were violations of rules or regulations that led to the revision of results—usually because it is found that the winners gained an unfair advantage through foul means. The text then foretells the high probability of the loss of another, a third title because two of Germany's show-jumping horses reportedly failed the crucial doping tests. In equestrian sports, doping tests are not only performed on the athletes but also on the horses to ensure fair competition. In this case, the tests determine if drugs have been used to enhance the performance of the horses. In this context, failing a dope test usually would mean the horses were found with drugs in their systems that are identified to be performance-enhancing or otherwise illegal in the sport. This result typically is a serious issue, given that it directly contravenes the established rules and principles for fair play in the sport. Thus, it's a predicament for the German equestrian team because the assumed failure of these doping tests will likely lead to a third title being stripped from the team. The loss of these titles places a dark mark on the reputation of their equestrian program and raises concerns about the methods and practices used by the team in their preparation and participation in such competitions. Overall, the text tells a story of how the norms of fair competition were potentially breached, impacting the German equestrian team's success rate, tarnishing their moment of victory, and stirring controversy in the world of equestrian sports."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Since it was a Saturday night, everything else was empty for miles. The parking lot was filled with sports cars, hybrids, and shiny suburban tanks. The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance. The first thing I noticed as I approached was the beefy refrigerator in a rented tux blocking the doorway. The second thing was the surveillance camera perched on the wall above his head. I had stopped home and changed first, so I was sure I was dressed mostly appropriately for some rich faux-hipster art party - charcoal gray pinstripe jacket over a TV on the Radio t-shirt, skinny cuffed jeans, Docs, and a black fedora.

Let's examine each sentence to understand the difference: 1. \\"It is located on the east side of Yonge Street at Crescent Road.\\" In this sentence, the phrase \\"at Crescent Road\\" indicates that the location being discussed is situated at the junction or intersection where Yonge Street and Crescent Road meet. The primary point of reference is the east side of Yonge Street, and the secondary point of reference is the point where Crescent Road intersects with Yonge Street. 2. \\"It is located on the east side of Yonge Street in Crescent Road.\\" The use of \\"in\\" instead of \\"at\\" in this sentence changes the meaning slightly. Here, \\"in Crescent Road\\" suggests that the location being referred to is within the boundaries or area of Crescent Road itself. This could mean that the specific location is on the east side of Yonge Street and also part of the stretch of Crescent Road that runs parallel to Yonge Street. In summary, the difference between the meanings of the two sentences is the way they describe the relationship between Yonge Street and Crescent Road.

The given premise and hypothesis are not directly related; in fact, they address two different aspects of the situation presented. The premise discusses the contribution of leaders to the quality and value of the information that the members received, as well as the success of their information-sharing organizations. This implies that the leaders have played a significant role in providing useful information and managing successful organizations. Here, the focus is on the leaders' expertise, skills, and possibly their management abilities. On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests that most leaders used a microphone to communicate with members. This statement primarily concerns the method of communication chosen by the leaders (in this case, the use of a microphone). It doesn't necessarily imply a direct impact on the quality or value of the information received by members or the success of the information-sharing organizations. To establish a logical connection between the premise and hypothesis, further information is needed. For example, if it were proven that the use of microphones significantly enhanced the clarity or effectiveness of the leaders' communication, and thus directly contributed to the improved quality and value of the information received by the members, then a valid link could be drawn between the premise and the hypothesis. However, with the available information, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, the hypothesis is true as well. In summary, while the leaders' good management and provision of valuable information might be a crucial factor in the success of the organizations, the specific communication method employed (microphone usage) is not necessarily the direct cause of such success.

Spencer and Jessica Christiansen were soaking wet and fighting hypothermia when rescue workers pulled them out of the total darkness of an unmapped ice cave in Wyoming on Sunday night 30 hours after they entered and lost their way. “You know you're headed down to your death and they found us just right before we had to burn the last of what we had left to survive a few more hours,” Jessica Christiansen told “Good Morning America” in an exclusive interview on Wednesday. “We knew we only had about an hour or two before we would've died.” Spencer and Jessica Christiansen After getting drenched in a waterfall, the Christiansens said they burned their backpacks, some of their gear and even clumps of her hair in an effort to stay warm. But they eventually ran out of things to burn. “We were so cold, shivering and our fingers were numb because our gloves were soaked from going through river canals so we decided for a moment to slow down, make a fire, get some energy and food,” Spencer Christiansen told “GMA.” “We were clammed up, we were miserable, we were wet, so we had to think of what we were going to do next.” The Idaho couple spent three weeks researching the cave and took all the necessary precautions before they entered, but “incorrect information” caused them to lose their way, he said. “I was excited! I just wanted a quick adventure. I wanted to have a good adventure for a day,” Spencer Christiansen said. “I spent three weeks, nonstop, to try and gather as much info as possible. ... We came up with very little.” The husband and wife, both experienced climbers, said they entered the Darby Canyon Ice Cave early Saturday morning with plans to explore for a few hours. The trip was a birthday celebration for Spencer, whose birthday came on Aug. 12, the day they were rescued. They left their 1-year-old daughter, Aurora, with her grandmother and told the family to notify the police if they didn’t return the next day. Spencer and Jessica Christiansen The families' decision to call for help Sunday morning may have saved the couple’s lives, according to Teton County Undersheriff Matt Carr. “They did have a plan. They told [their family] if they weren't back by a certain time to give us a call,” Carr told “GMA.” At least that triggered us to get going in the right direction because it does sound like the condition we found them in was pretty important that we get moving in the direction as soon as possible.” Carr said the cave is like a maze and only expert spelunkers are encouraged to explore it. Jessica fell 20 feet while climbing a frozen waterfall at one point, but Spencer thankfully caught her to avoid even further disaster. “The cave is a series of large caverns and tight crawls and there are areas where you are literally on your hands and toes trying to squeeze through and then that connects to some larger caverns as well,” Carr said. “There is a lot of running water, ice cold water, running throughout there that you have to cross to get in.” Rescuers found the pair shivering and unable to move when they arrived. Both are doing well now, though they were treated for frostbite on their hands. Search and rescue volunteer K.C. Bess said it took the team between five and six hours to locate the couple. “Where we found them they were 25 feet up in a small hole or cavern and one of our team members had to ascend up a rope to get to them, do an assessment on them, [and] build an anchor to help them repel out of that spot,” Bess told “GMA.” “They were starting to really shiver a lot, shaking, and showing some signs of hypothermia.” Spencer and Jessica Christiansen The couple believes they were rescued just in time. “It's really scary to think you're leaving a child with no parents and no way out. It's really cold and it's really scary to face your death for sure,” Jessica Christiansen said. “The scariest part it got to was when Spencer was scared. I had total faith in him the whole time to get me out of there, but when I saw how scared he was I knew it was the end for us.” She says the “terrifying” experience has changed her and her husband for the better. “Things that were important before, definitely aren't anymore. ... I can't watch regular TV or look at Instagram or Facebook because selfies aren't important anymore, I don't care,” Jessica Christiansen said. Her husband echoed her sentiments, calling the exploration an adventure that he’ll never forget. “You kinda get to the point where you say you kinda realize what's important and what's not,” he said. “That comes after you escape but when you get to that point, the things that you stressed about so much are usually tiny pathetic things that don't even actually matter in the big scale.” ||||| Teton County Search and Rescue personnel rescued a couple from Darby Canyon’s Ice Cave and hauled them out on horses. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"So, a young couple named Spencer and Jessica were exploring an ice cave in Wyoming for a fun adventure.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Jane Austen was born in the English countryside more than 200 years ago. She lived a simple life. She seldom travelled. She never married and she died from illness when she was only 41. However, people all over the world remember her. Why? It is because Jane Austen is the author of some of the best-loved novels in the English language. These novels include Emma, Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion. Jane completed her last novel Persuasion in 1816, but it was not published until after her death. Persuasion is partly based on Jane's naval brother. Anne, the daughter of Sir Walter Elliot, falls in love with Captain Wentworth, a person of a lower social position. But she breaks off the engagement when persuaded by her friend Lady Russell that such a match is unworthy. The breakup produces in Anne a deep and long-lasting regret. Eight years later, Wentworth returns from sea a rich and successful captain. He finds Anne's family on the edge of financial ruin. Anne and the captain rediscover their love and get married. Jane Austen once compared her writing to painting on a little bit of ivory , two inches square. Readers of Persuasion will see that neither her skill of delicate, ironic observations on social custom, love, and marriage nor her ability to apply a sharp focus to English manners and morals has abandoned her in her final finished work. Persuasion has produced three film adaptations: a 1995 version starring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, a 2007 TV miniseries with Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry-Jones, and a 1971 miniseries with Ann Firbank and Bryan Marshall. People who are interested in Jane Austen can still visit many of the places she visited and lived. These places include the village of Steventon, although her family house is now gone. Many of the places Jane visited in Bath are still there. You can visit Jane Austen's home in Chawton, where she did her best writing, and Winchester, where she died. 1. When did Jane Austen live? 2.

Q:Question: \\"What are some examples of basic emotions?\\" Context: \\"A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels (e.g., anger, pride, fear, happiness), physiological changes (e.g., increased perspiration, changes in pulse rate), expressive facial and body movements (e.g., smiling, frowning, baring teeth), and appraisals of situational cues. One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009). Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science, and neuroscience. Based on this analysis, he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness. These four categories are called primary emotions and there is some agreement amongst researchers that these primary emotions become combined to produce more elaborate and complex emotional experiences. These more elaborate emotions are called first-order elaborations in Turner's theory and they include sentiments such as pride, triumph, and awe. Emotions can also be experienced at different levels of intensity so that feelings of concern are a low-intensity variation of the primary emotion aversion-fear whereas depression is a higher intensity variant.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"In the context of multidimensional characteristics of emotions, which include cultural or emotional labels, physiological changes, expressive facial and body movements, and appraisals of situational cues, Jonathan Turner's comprehensive theory of emotional arousal identifies four basic or primary emotions based on human neurology. These primary emotions are: 1. Assertive-Anger: This emotion arises when a person's expectations, needs, or boundaries are not met, leading to feelings of frustration and aggression. It is often accompanied by a strong desire to correct the situation or confront the source of the problem. 2. Aversion-Fear: Aversion-fear is experienced when an individual perceives potential harm or danger. This emotion can range from mild anxiety or worry to intense dread, and it stimulates a person to either avoid the threat or prepare to face it (e.g., the fight or flight response). 3. Satisfaction-Happiness: When a person's expectations, needs, or desires are met, they experience satisfaction-happiness. This emotion is characterized by feelings of contentment, joy, and pleasure. It reinforces positive experiences and encourages individuals to seek similar experiences in the future. 4. Disappointment-Sadness: This emotion occurs when a person's expectations, needs, or desires are not met or are lost. Disappointment-sadness can range from mild regret to deep sorrow and is characterized by feelings of loss, helplessness, and despair. Turner's theory also explains how these primary emotions combine to create more complex and elaborate emotional experiences, known as first-order elaborations. Examples of first-order elaborations include pride, triumph, and awe. Additionally, emotions can be experienced at different levels of intensity, such as low-intensity concern being a variation of aversion-fear, and high-intensity depression as a variant of disappointment-sadness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

And the answer is?","completion":"The first World Championships in Alpine Skiing were held in 1931. The event took place from February 4th to February 8th in Mürren, Switzerland. This championship marked the beginning of a long history of competitive skiing events and featured both men's and women's categories in the competitions. The 1931 Alpine Skiing World Championships were organized by Fédération Internationale de Ski (FIS) which is the world's highest governing body for international winter sports. At that time, Alpine Skiing was a relatively new discipline and was making its way to becoming an important international sporting event. The competition was comprised of two main events: the Downhill and the Slalom races. There were six different categories of competition at the inaugural Alpine Skiing World Championships, three for men and three for women, in which the competitors raced for gold, silver, and bronze medals. The men's categories included the Downhill, the Slalom, and the Combined (which was determined based on the skier's results in both Downhill and Slalom races). Similarly, the women's categories also consisted of the Downhill, the Slalom, and the Combined. This first edition of the Alpine Skiing World Championships drew participants from various countries which demonstrated the growing popularity of the sport. The races were held on varying terrains, with the Downhill event taking place on steep slopes featuring high speeds and the Slalom event consisting of skiing on a more controlled course while navigating tightly-spaced gates. The 1931 Alpine Skiing World Championships crowned the first-ever world champions in the sport. Swiss skier Walter Prager took the gold medal in both the men's Downhill and Combined events, and David Zogg of Switzerland won the gold in the men's Slalom category. In the women's events, Esme Mackinnon from Great Britain emerged as the gold medalist in both the Downhill and Combined categories, while Germany's Paula Wiesinger was victorious in the women's Slalom event. Since that inaugural championship in 1931, the Alpine Skiing World Championships have evolved and expanded, with more nations participating and the addition of new disciplines such as Giant Slalom, Super-G, and Team events. Alpine Skiing has also become a well-established sport in the Winter Olympic Games since its debut in the 1936 Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. Today, the Alpine Skiing World Championships are held every two years, and the sport continues to captivate audiences around the world as skiers showcase their skill, speed, and finesse on the snow-covered slopes."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

A desperate Leah Fuller hires the three men and local Vicente Madariaga, to rescue her husband, John, who is pinned under debris from a gold mine cave-in in hostile Apache territory. During the harrowing journey, Luke tries to force himself on Leah late one night, forcing Hooker to intervene.

Q:Answer this question: what is bourbon made of? A:","completion":"Bourbon is a type of American whiskey that is primarily made from corn and other grains, along with water and typically aged in charred oak barrels. The production process, ingredients, and aging methods lend bourbon its distinct flavor profile. Let's explore the elements that make up bourbon in greater detail. 1. Primary ingredient: Corn The main ingredient in bourbon is corn, which must make up at least 51% of the grain mixture used in production, known as the mash bill. Corn is a versatile grain that imparts a natural sweetness to the whiskey. Some bourbon recipes may use even higher percentages of corn, often ranging from 60% to 80% to enhance the characteristic sweetness and produce a smoother finished product. 2. Secondary grains: Rye, wheat, and barley Besides corn, other grains are used to make bourbon, most commonly rye, wheat, and malted barley. These secondary grains make up the remainder of the mash bill and are chosen to attain specific flavor profiles: - Rye: adds a spicy, robust, and fruity character to the whiskey. - Wheat: imparts a softer, rounder, and more delicate flavor to the bourbon. - Malted barley: contributes enzymes that break down starches in the grains into fermentable sugars and adds subtle toasted, nutty, and biscuity flavors. 3. Limestone-filtered water Water is an essential component in the distillation and aging process of bourbon production. Many distilleries source their water from natural limestone springs or filter their water through limestone. This type of water is rich in minerals and free of impurities, which helps in fermentation and enhances the taste of the bourbon. Limestone-filtered water also provides a slightly sweet and soft mouthfeel to the whiskey. 4. Fermentation The milled grains are mixed with water and cooked to create a mash. This process breaks down the grains' starches into sugars, which eventually become the basis for alcohol production. Yeast is then added to the cooled mash to kickstart fermentation, converting the sugars into alcohol over several days. The yeast variety and fermentation time can affect the flavor profile, aroma, and complexity of the resulting bourbon. 5. Distillation Following fermentation, the alcohol-laden liquid (known as the wash) is heated in a still, which separates the alcohol from the water and residual solids. Bourbon is typically distilled twice – first in a column still, and then in a pot still – to achieve the desired alcohol volume and flavor concentration. By law, bourbon must not exceed 80% alcohol by volume (160 proof) during distillation. 6. Aging Bourbon must be aged in new, charred American oak barrels. The charring of the barrel's interior caramelizes the wood sugars, contributing color, flavors, and aromas to the whiskey. Common flavors derived from wood aging include vanilla, caramel, smoky, and toasted notes. Barrels are stored in large warehouses called rickhouses, where they are subject to temperature fluctuations and humidity levels. The whiskey matures as it interacts with the barrel and the surrounding environment. While there is no minimum aging requirement for bourbon, \\"straight\\" bourbon must be aged for at least two years. 7. Bottling and proofing After aging, the bourbon is removed from the barrels, filtered, and diluted with water to reach its bottling proof. Federal regulations stipulate that bourbon must be bottled at no less than 80 proof (40% alcohol by volume). Some distilleries may bottle their bourbon at higher proofs, like \\"Barrel Proof\\" or \\"Cask Strength,\\" depending on their desired flavor profiles and target consumer preferences. In summary, bourbon is made from corn and a combination of other grains, limestone-filtered water, yeast, and aged in charred American oak barrels. The precise choice of grains, fermentation method, distillation process, aging duration, and environmental conditions come together to define the specific characteristics and flavors of each bourbon variety."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Paragraph: “Puzzling,” says the May 2018 exchange between William Happer, now a member of President Donald Trump’s National Security Council, and Thomas Wysmuller of the Heartland Institute, which disavows manmade climate change. Their exchange calls scientifically established rises in sea levels and temperatures under climate change “part of the nonsense” and urges the NASA head — who was copied in — to “systematically sidestep it.” It cannot be discerned whether it was Happer or Wysmuller who put that pressure on the new NASA chief. Their exchange is included in emails from 2018 and 2019 that were obtained by the Environmental Defense Fund under the federal Freedom of Information Act and provided to The Associated Press. But the emails show that Happer, who was then advising Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency, kept up the pressure after he joined the National Security Council late last year. In February, he emailed NASA deputy administrator James Morhard, relaying a complaint about NASA’s websites from an unidentified rejecter of man-made climate change. “I’m concerned that many children are being indoctrinated by this bad science,” said the email that Happer relayed. (Happer’s own message was redacted from the records obtained by the environmental group.) NASA does not appear to have buckled under such heat. Specific statements targeted in the email still appear on the space agency’s website. A NASA spokesman on Thursday upheld the space agency’s public statements on climate change. “We provide the data that informs policymakers around the world,” spokesman Bob Jacobs said. “Our science information continues to be published publicly as it always has.” Heartland Institute spokesman Jim Lakely said in an email that NASA’s public characterization of climate change as man-made and a global threat “is a disservice to taxpayers and science that it is still pushed by NASA.” The institute is one of the most vocal challengers of mainstream scientific findings that emissions from burning coal, oil and gas are damaging the Earth’s atmosphere. Since joining the National Security Council, Happer tapped two analysts with the institute to help him frame challenges to widely accepted scientific findings on global warming, the emails show. In a March 3 email exchange, Happer and Hal Doiron, another policy adviser to Heartland, discuss Happer’s scientific arguments in a paper attempting to knock down the contributions of fossil fuel emissions in climate disruption, as well as ideas to make the work “more useful to a wider readership.” Happer writes he had already discussed the work with another Heartland adviser, Wysmuller. Academic experts denounced the administration official’s continued involvement with groups and scientists who reject what numerous federal agencies say is the fact of man-made climate change. “These people are endangering all of us by promoting anti-science in service of fossil fuel interests over the American interests,” said Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann. “It’s the equivalent to formulating anti-terrorism policy by consulting with groups that deny terrorism exists,” said Northeastern University’s Matthew Nisbet, a professor of environmental communication and public policy. The National Security Council declined to make Happer available to discuss the emails. The AP and others reported this year that Happer was coordinating a proposed White House panel to challenge the findings from scientists in and out of government that carbon emissions are altering the Earth’s atmosphere and climate. Trump in November rejected the warnings of a national climate change assessment by more than a dozen government agencies. “I don’t believe it,” he said. Happer, a physicist who previously taught at Princeton University, has claimed that carbon dioxide, the main heat-trapping gas from the burning of coal, oil and gas, is good for humans and that carbon emissions have been demonized like “the poor Jews under Hitler.” The emails show Happer expressing surprise that Bridenstine, a former Oklahoma congressman, had put his skepticism of global-warming science behind him before becoming NASA chief in April 2018. Bridenstine a year ago told reporters that after reading Defense Department briefings on global warming, he became convinced it is a serious national security problem: “We’re defending territory in the Arctic that we never had to defend. The Russians are doing things in the Arctic that they never used to be able to do.” He said no other agency has NASA’s credibility when it comes to studying climate change and helping policymakers form decisions about it. Two major U.S. science organizations took issue with Happer’s emails. “We have concerns that there appear to be attempts by a member of the National Security Council to influence and interfere with the ability of NASA, a federal science agency, to communicate accurately about research findings on climate science,” said Rush Holt, chief executive officer of the American Association for the Advance of Science, the world’s largest general scientific society. Hundreds of scientific assessments by leading researchers and institutions the last few decades have looked at all the evidence and been “extremely credible and routinely withstand intense scrutiny,” said Keith Seitter, executive director of the American Meteorological Society. He said efforts to dismiss or discredit such assessments are “an incredible disservice to the public.” Claim: Emails: Trump official pressed NASA on climate science. A:","completion":"The claim states that a Trump official pressed NASA on climate science. Evidence supporting this claim can be found in the paragraph, which mentions an email exchange between William Happer, a member of President Donald Trump's National Security Council, and Thomas Wysmuller, who belongs to the Heartland Institute, an organization that disavows manmade climate change. This exchange called scientifically established facts about sea levels and temperatures \\"nonsense\\" and even urged the NASA head to sidestep it. Furthermore, the paragraph states that Happer kept up the pressure after joining the National Security Council and relayed complaints about NASA's websites, expressing concerns about children being indoctrinated by \\"bad science.\\" Although NASA did not appear to have buckled under the pressure, and their spokesman upheld the agency's public statements, this demonstrates a clear attempt by a Trump official to influence NASA's stance on climate science."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It becomes apparent that Bruce is regularly attacked by other inmates who brawl with him 6 to 1 at breakfast. Having beaten the majority of them, Bruce is punished with solitary confinement by the prison guards. In solitary, Bruce is approached by a man called Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson). Ducard displays a great deal of knowledge and authority by getting an audience with Bruce from the prison and by stating that he knows who Bruce is. Ducard then offers Bruce a place in the League of Shadows -- a collective of vigilantes and assassins.

Article: Can you smell two things at once? This experiment comes from the research of two scientists from Rice University. Denise Chen and Wen Zhou have been experimenting with the science of smell, and have made some very interesting discoveries. To explore that, you will need two things with strong, characteristic smells and, of course, your nose. The idea is to smell a different smell with each nostril . Hold one smell very close to your right nostril, and the other smell very close to your left nostril. Then breathe in and pay close attention to what you smell. What you should find is that one smell will be very strong. After another sniff or two, the first smell will go away, and you will smell the other smell. Keep sniffing, and the first smell will come back. Instead of smelling the two smells evenly mixed, they will work in turns, one after the other. Why? Chen and Zhou found that your sense of smell acts much like your sense of sight. Hold a book in front of your nose, so that your left eye sees things on the left side of the book, and your right eye sees things on the right side of the book. You will find that your sight works in turns, first on the left side of the book and then on the right side. Notice that you can't focus your left eye on one object while focusing your right eye on another object. Your brain jumps back and forth , paying attention to one and then the other. The same thing happens with your nostrils. If they are smelling different smells, your brain pays attention to one and then the other. Question: The main purpose of the text is to _ .

In Vermont, the leaves turn early. In this sentence, \\"turn\\" refers to the process of leaves changing their color during the autumn season. This is a natural process that occurs as the chlorophyll within the leaves breaks down, revealing other pigments. Here, \\"turn\\" means to change color or transform. 2. Ivory turns well. In this sentence, \\"turn\\" is referring to the process of shaping a material (in this case, ivory) using a lathe or other tool to rotate it and apply cutting instruments to the object. \\"Turns well\\" implies that ivory is a material that is easily manipulated or shaped using this technique. In this context, \\"turn\\" means to shape or form. Conclusion: \\"Turn\\" is not used to mean the same thing in both sentences. In the first sentence, it refers to the color change in leaves, while in the second sentence, it refers to the process of shaping a material.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose father was of Polish Roman Catholic descent? , can you please find it? Born at Podolskaya Street in Saint Petersburg, Russia, Shostakovich was the second of three children of Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich and Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina. Shostakovich's paternal grandfather, originally surnamed Szostakowicz, was of Polish Roman Catholic descent (his family roots trace to the region of the town of Vileyka in today's Belarus), but his immediate forebears came from Siberia. A Polish revolutionary in the January Uprising of 1863–4, Bolesław Szostakowicz would be exiled to Narym (near Tomsk) in 1866 in the crackdown that followed Dmitri Karakozov's assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II. When his term of exile ended, Szostakowicz decided to remain in Siberia. He eventually became a successful banker in Irkutsk and raised a large family. His son Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich, the composer's father, was born in exile in Narim in 1875 and studied physics and mathematics in Saint Petersburg University, graduating in 1899. He then went to work as an engineer under Dmitri Mendeleev at the Bureau of Weights and Measures in Saint Petersburg. In 1903 he married another Siberian transplant to the capital, Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina, one of six children born to a Russian Siberian native.Their son, Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich, displayed significant musical talent after he began piano lessons with his mother at the age of nine.

A: make good money B: hate her job C: make bad money Answer:","completion":"Based on the context provided, it can be inferred that Quinn deliberately chose a job where she could work nights due to her preference for being active during night hours. The context does not explicitly tell us about Quinn's financial benefits or her job satisfaction, so it would be problematic to definitively claim any of the specific answers A, B, or C as the best answer. However, we can provide a more detailed and reasoned response based on the information given: When Quinn chose a job that allowed her to work nights, it is likely that she took into account her personal needs and preferences, which could lead to higher job satisfaction. By working during her preferred hours, Quinn may be more productive, engaged, and contribute positively to her workplace. While we have no information about the pay scale or financial benefits offered by her job, the fact that Quinn chose a job suited to her needs suggests that it could, at least, provide her with a satisfactory income. It is important to consider that even if the job isn't highly paid, the fact that it caters to Quinn's night preferences can have a positive impact on her overall well-being.

Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\". Q: Paragraph: Background. The clinical significance of viruses detected in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is often unclear. Methods. We conducted a prospective study to identify the prevalence of 13 viruses in the upper respiratory tract of patients with CAP and concurrently enrolled asymptomatic controls with real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. We compared age-stratified prevalence of each virus between patients with CAP and controls and used multivariable logistic regression to calculate attributable fractions (AFs). Results. We enrolled 1024 patients with CAP and 759 controls. Detections of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus were substantially more common in patients with CAP of all ages than in controls (AFs near 1.0). Parainfluenza and coronaviruses were also more common among patients with CAP (AF, 0.5-0.75). Rhinovirus was associated with CAP among adults (AF, 0.93) but not children (AF, 0.02). Adenovirus was associated with CAP only among children <2 years old (AF, 0.77). Conclusions. The probability that a virus detected with real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in patients with CAP contributed to symptomatic disease varied by age group and specific virus. Detections of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus among patients with CAP of all ages probably indicate an etiologic role, whereas detections of parainfluenza, coronaviruses, rhinovirus, and adenovirus, especially in children, require further scrutiny.

I Capture the Castle is a well-acted and perfectly realized English drama about the crash course in emotions experienced by a sensitive and imaginative seventeen-year old girl. Movie:","completion":"The movie being reviewed here is \\"I Capture the Castle\\" (2003), based on the novel of the same name by British author Dodie Smith, which was published in 1948. This coming-of-age drama directed by Tim Fywell follows the story of the Mortmain family, who live in a decaying castle in the English countryside. The central character is Cassandra Mortmain, a 17-year-old girl played by Romola Garai, who narrates the story through her journal entries. The story unfolds as the family faces various personal and emotional challenges. Through her writing, it is revealed that Cassandra is sensitive, imaginative, and attempting to make sense of the complex feelings and emotions that come with growing up and familial changes. The Mortmain family comprises Cassandra's father, James Mortmain, a once-successful writer who is now struggling with a case of writer's block; her stepmother, Topaz, a free-spirited artist; her elder sister, Rose, who is desperate to escape their impoverished existence; and her younger brother, Thomas, who is also finding his place in the world. The film explores themes of love, self-discovery, and identity through the eyes of the young protagonist. As the story unfolds, Cassandra and her family must navigate various challenges, including romantic entanglements, financial instability, and the pressure to find a suitable husband for Rose. The performances in the film are widely praised, especially that of Romola Garai as Cassandra. Bill Nighy delivers a strong performance as her father, and Tara Fitzgerald portrays the eccentric Topaz. Other key actors include Rose Byrne as Rose, and Henry Thomas and Marc Blucas as the Cotton brothers, Simon and Neil, who become entangled in the lives of the Mortmain sisters. \\"I Capture the Castle\\" is known for its detailed period setting and stunning cinematography that brings the English countryside to life, adding to the overall atmosphere of the film.

(Associated Press) In this Thursday, June 15, 2017, photo, a construction worker continues work on a condominium project in Coral Gables, Fla. On Friday, July 7, 2017, the Labor Department will release the U.S. jobs report... (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. employers added a robust 222,000 jobs in June, the most in four months, a reassuring sign that businesses are confident enough to keep hiring despite a slow-growing economy. The Labor Department says the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4 percent from 4.3 percent in May, which was a 16-year low. The rate rose because more Americans began looking for work, but not all found jobs. Job gains for April and May were revised higher by 47,000. In the first six months of this year, hiring has averaged nearly 180,000 jobs a month. That's only slightly below last year's pace. Yet even with the robust hiring, average hourly pay rose by just 2.5 percent from a year earlier. That's below the 3.5 percent pace typical of a healthy economy. ||||| Here's the critical number to watch in the latest jobs report 4:44 PM ET Thu, 6 July 2017 | 01:18 The Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release its monthly employment report on Friday morning, and some strategists and economists are looking beyond the unemployment and monthly job gains numbers. Wages will take center stage in Friday's report, as the market is looking to see if the U.S. consumer can pick up slack into the second half of the year, said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management. Hourly wages in recent monthly reports have not picked up as impressively as other areas of the economy. Should wages beat economists' expectations, the U.S. dollar and consumer stocks would likely benefit, as that would suggest the consumer is going to have enough discretionary income to \\"really begin spending,\\" Schlossberg said. \\"Wages are much more important to the market right now than jobs, because we're essentially at full employment. The market now is looking for this economy to grow its income, rather than to grow jobs,\\" he said Thursday on CNBC's \\"Trading Nation.\\" Furthermore, a wage-growth figure that surpasses the consensus view and contributes to a healthy economic backdrop would confirm to the market that the Federal Reserve is increasingly likely to raise its federal funds target rate, Schlossberg pointed out. Hourly earnings are expected to rise by 2.6 percent year over year; the unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 4.3 percent year over year, according to economists' estimates compiled by FactSet. The prior report showed a decline in unemployment. However, nonfarm payrolls and wage growth both missed economists' expectations, with the latter coming in at 2.5 percent. That brought the average hourly wage up to 26.22. Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank, anticipates wages will rise 2.6 percent year over year, which would mark an acceleration month over month from 2.5 percent. \\"Anything higher than 2.6% tomorrow will have a big impact on the rates market because it will confirm the Fed view that they need to continue to raise rates,\\" he wrote Thursday in an email to CNBC. Erin Gibbs, S&P Global portfolio manager, said hourly wage growth in the prior report was a \\"real concern.\\" In a recent \\"Trading Nation\\" interview, Gibbs said she expected the unemployment rate to remain relatively stable, around 4.3 percent. \\"What I'm really looking for is the wage growth. That's where we want to see some inflation and some healthy growth within the U.S. consumer,\\" she said. Subsequently, higher wage growth may translate to growth within the consumer discretionary sector and across the retail landscape that's recently faced headwinds, Gibbs added. ||||| If you got burned by the headline beat this morning, don't feel too bad. It would've been hard for anybody to really nail this one - unless you had a bead on hiring at your local county offices. The 222,000 headline numbers looks heady, but it was boosted by an unusual source: the public sector, which added 35,000 jobs. That's the highest number in a year, and a number that has pushed public payrolls to their highest level since 2010, according to BMO Capital Markets' Ian Lyngen. The big jump - for a sector that had been adding an average of 4,000 jobs the past six months - \\"looks a little suspicious,\\" Capital Economics' Paul Ashworth wrote. Now, before you wonder what happened to all that \\"drain the swamp,\\" small-government talk coming out of the new administration, there is something even odder about the numbers. The federal government added only 4,000 jobs, and state governments shed 4,000 jobs. So, those numbers net out to zero. All the net new jobs, therefore, came from the local level. Local governments added 35,000 jobs in June: 13,600 of that came in education, and 22,200 came from outside the schools. You can find these figures at the very bottom of table B-1. \\"June 30th is end of fiscal year for most states,\\" noted SouthBay Research's Andrew Zatlin, \\"Use-it-or-lose-it budgets bump up hiring.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"U.S. employers added 222,000 jobs in June 2017, marking the largest increase in employment in four months and signaling that businesses are continuing to hire despite a slow-growing economy.

A increase or decrease in the population cold lead to less food availability? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, a significant increase in population may lead to a decrease in food availability or the supply of other necessary resources. However, this is a complex issue that depends on various factors, such as agricultural productivity, distribution networks, advances in technology, governmental policies, and environmental conditions. The relationship between population growth and food availability can be understood through the following aspects: 1. Agricultural Productivity: As the population increases, the demand for food also increases. This may put immense pressure on the agricultural sector to produce more food to meet the demands of the growing population. The available agricultural land may not be sufficient to support this increased demand, especially if the efficiency of agricultural practices does not improve. Moreover, agricultural expansion may cause habitat destruction and loss of biodiversity, which may become increasingly unsustainable in the long run. 2. Distribution Networks: A well-functioning supply chain and effective distribution networks are essential for ensuring food availability for all. As the population grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to ensure that food reaches everyone, especially those living in remote areas or experiencing poverty. Inefficient distribution networks may lead to food wastage and greater disparities in food availability among different regions. 3. Advances in Technology: Technological advancements can help offset some of the challenges posed by population growth. Modern agricultural methods, such as precision farming, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), and vertical farming, have the potential to increase food production and make agriculture more sustainable. Improved transportation, cold chain management, and better storage facilities can also enhance food distribution. 4. Governmental Policies: Policies and programs formulated by governments can have a substantial impact on food availability. Population control measures, such as family planning programs, can help in managing the population growth rate. Government support for agricultural research, better infrastructure, and incentives to farmers can boost food production and distribution. Moreover, social welfare programs can ensure access to food for the underprivileged sections of the population. 5. Environmental Conditions: Climate change and natural disasters can have severe effects on food availability. As global temperatures rise, extreme weather events, such as floods, droughts, and storms, can lead to reduced crop yields. Additionally, the spread of pests and diseases affecting crops may cause food shortages. Responsive agriculture policies and practices, including diversification of crops and better management of water resources, are essential to mitigate these impacts. In conclusion, an increase in population can indeed lead to less food availability. However, it is imperative to understand that the relationship between population growth and food availability is not straightforward and depends on various factors. By focusing on improving agricultural productivity, efficient distribution networks, technological advancements, supportive government policies, and environmental resilience, it is possible to ensure adequate food supply for a growing population."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the beginning, Lygia, a Christian and hostage of Rome, becomes the object of Vinicius' love but she refuses his advances. Vinicius' friend Petronius tries to manipulate Nero, who has authority over all Roman hostages, to give Lygia to Vinicius, but Lygia is taken into hiding by Christians. Marcus Vinicius decides to find her and force her to be his wife. He goes to a Christian meeting along with Croton, a gladiator, to find her. After following her from the meeting, Marcus tries to take her, but Ursus, a strong man and friend of Lygia, kills Croton. Marcus himself is wounded in the fight, but is taken care of by Lygia and the Christians. Seeing their kindness he begins to convert to Christianity, and Lygia accepts him. Rome catches fire while the emperor, Nero, is away. Nero returns and sings to the crowd, but they become angry. At the suggestion of Nero's wife, the Christians are blamed for the fire, providing a long series of cruel spectacles to appease the crowd.

In order to use the washer and dryer for laundry, Steve separated his laundry into dirty and wet, then he filled the Pick your answer from: (I). washer with dirty laundry. (II). dryer with dirty laundry.","completion":"The sentence should end with: In order to use the washer and dryer for laundry, Steve separated his laundry into dirty and wet, then he filled the washer with dirty laundry. The reason for selecting option (I) rather than option (II) is based on the appropriate usage of the appliances in the process of completing one's laundry. The washer and dryer each serve a distinct purpose and should be used accordingly. A washer, also known as a washing machine, is designed to clean dirty laundry using water and detergent. The purpose of the washer is to effectively remove dirt, stains, and odors from clothing, beddings, or other fabric-based belongings. When using a washer, it is essential to sort articles of clothing by color, material, and level of dirtiness, in order to prevent the mixing of colors and potential damage to delicate fabrics during the washing cycle. So, it is accurate to say that Steve filled the washer with dirty laundry. On the other hand, a dryer, also known as a tumble dryer, is designed to remove excess moisture from clothing or other fabrics after they have been washed in the washer. The dryer uses heat or air to evaporate the water from the wet clothes and expels the moisture through a vent. Generally, dryers have distinct settings depending on the type of fabric and the level of desired dryness. Using a dryer with dirty laundry would be counterproductive and inefficient since the clothes have not gone through the necessary cleaning step in the washer.

Background: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation.

He had never been to the mountains. No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\\" Patch shouted up. \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.

A pony bit me earlier.\\" As it happened, the bite was virtually painless: more the kind of small bite you might get from a naughty child. The pony responsible was queuing up for some ice cream in the car park near Haytor, and perhaps thought I'd jumped in ahead of him. The reason why the ponies here are naughty is that Haytor is a tourist-heavy area and tourists are constantly feeding the ponies foods, despite sighs asking them not to. By feeding the ponies, tourists increase the risk of them getting hit by a car, and make them harder to gather during the area's annual pony drift . The purpose of a pony drift is to gather them up so their health can be checked, the baby ones can be stooped from feeding on their mother's milk, and those who've gone beyond their limited area can be returned to their correct area. Some of them are also later sold, in order to limit the number of ponies according to the rules set by Natural England. Three weeks ago, I witnessed a small near-disaster a few mils west of here. While walking, I noticed a pony roll over on his back. \\"Hello!\\" I said to him, assuming he was just rolling for fun, but he was very still and, as I got closer, I saw him kicking his legs in the air and breathing heavily. I began to properly worry about him. Fortunately, I managed to get in touch with a Dartmoor's Livestock Protection officer and send her a photo.

Q:Given the below context: A billion-dollar oil company, headed by Sumner Murdock, sets forth on an exploration project in the North Pole that is recommended and managed by Michael Baldwin. The film opens with several dynamite blasts to break up the ice that's clogging up the deep-sea drilling rigs. Disappointingly to the company, the drilling rig produces no oil. Baldwin is then picked up from work by an airplane flown by his wife Claudia. On the way home, Claudia tells Michael that she wants to move the kids back to Los Angeles where they can live in a more civilized environment. Michael argues that he cannot just walk away from the exploration since it was his idea. Upon arriving home, Michael and Claudia must deal with their three children arguing with each other about the existence of Santa Claus. To make matters worse for Michael, Murdock, portrayed as the stereotyped insensitive corporate boss, threatens to terminate his employment if the exploration does not produce results. The next day, Michael returns to his office, where he is met by Santa Claus's chief elf Ed. Ed informs Baldwin that their dynamiting is causing damage to North Pole City, the home of Santa Claus and his elves. He explains that while their activities at \\"Site A\\", their primary drilling area, are causing extensive damage, any blasts at their secondary site, known as \\"Site B\\", would destroy North Pole City due to the greater proximity of the dynamite blasts. Assuming that Ed was just hired to pull off a practical joke, Baldwin bursts into uncontrollable laughter. The next day, Ed arrives at the Baldwins' house in a modified World War II-era snowcat, explaining that he intends to take Michael and his family to North Pole City to prove that Santa Claus is real and reveal the damage that is being done.

Here's a detailed explanation: 1. The men are wearing coats: Yes, this is explicitly stated in the description, \\"two men in beige coats.\\" This indicates that the men are indeed wearing beige-colored coats at the time of the observation. 2. The men are outside: This part of the conclusion cannot be definitively confirmed, as there is no specific information provided about their location. The men could be outside, indoors, or in any other environment where it is possible for them to have a conversation. However, it is reasonable to assume that they are outside or at least in an environment where wearing coats would be practical, given that the fact that they are wearing coats is mentioned. Wearing coats often implies that the environment may be cool, chilly, or exposed to outdoor conditions. In general, people tend to wear coats when they are outside to protect themselves from the elements. Nevertheless, this assumption does not necessarily hold true in every case. For instance, the two men in beige coats could be: Inside a building with air conditioning — perhaps an office, a mall, or an airport — that's cold enough for them to wear coats. At a location where it's customary or required to wear coats as part of a uniform, such as a workplace, a formal event, or in the military. In a theater, performance, or movie set where their attire is part of a scene or a role they are playing. To make a specific conclusion about their location, we would need more context or information about the situation. Without additional information, we should refrain from definitively stating that the two men are outside. In summary, we can confidently conclude that the two men are wearing coats based on the given information, but we cannot definitively determine that they are outside without further context.

Hello, little friends! Today, we are going to learn about a group of soldiers from a long time ago called the SS Cavalry Regiment 1. They were a part of a bigger group called the Nazis, who were led by a man named Adolf Hitler. This was during an event called World War II, which happened many years before you were born. World War II was a big fight between many countries, and during this fight, the SS Cavalry Regiment 1 did some very harmful things. They targeted two main groups: Jewish people and soldiers from the Red Army. Do you know who the Red Army was? They were soldiers from a country called the Soviet Union, which doesn't exist anymore. Now, you might be wondering: which group did the SS Cavalry Regiment 1 hurt more – Jewish people or Red Army soldiers? Well, let's find out! During World War II, the Nazis had a plan called the Holocaust, which had a terrible goal to hurt and kill many Jewish people. The SS Cavalry Regiment 1 played a big part in this horrible plan. They went into many towns and cities and hurt a lot of Jewish people. In fact, they did this so much that they ended up hurting more Jewish people than Red Army soldiers. The exact number of people the SS Cavalry Regiment 1 hurt is hard to know, but we do know that they hurt and killed many thousands of Jewish people. Although the Red Army fought against the Nazis and many of their soldiers were also hurt or killed during World War II, the SS Cavalry Regiment 1 targeted Jewish people more during the war. It's essential to learn about these events so that we can make sure nothing like this ever happens again. We should always remember those who were hurt and be kind and loving towards everyone, no matter where they come from or what they believe in.

Songs are like stories, but with beautiful sounds that can help explain things. Sometimes, these songs make such a difference that they inspire people and can even lead to conflicts. Today, let's explore how many songs were written that inspired people and its conflicts. 1. \\"We Shall Overcome\\" - This song became very important in the fight for civil rights, helping people believe in their own strength. It helped them stand up against unfair things like racism. So this song brought courage to those who listened to it. 2. \\"Imagine\\" - A singer named John Lennon wrote a beautiful song called \\"Imagine.\\" The song is about a world without wars, where everybody gets along, and there are no more boundaries between people. It touched many people's hearts and made them rethink the way they look at the world. 3. \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" - This song, written by Bob Dylan, is about asking questions and finding answers. Sometimes the answers aren't that easy to find, but the song keeps asking anyway. It made people think about what's right and wrong, and helped them see that changes were important. 4. \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\" - Bob Marley sang this tune about standing up against people who abuse their power. It talks about fighting for what's fair and just, even if it gets you in trouble. So, how many songs were written that inspired people and its conflicts? Well, the four songs we talked about are just a few examples. But there are many, many more songs out there that have helped people stand up for what they believe in and fight against things that aren't right. We can't count them all, but we know that music is a powerful tool that can bring people together or show them that they should fight for their rights.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Electricity is a physical phenomenon associated with the presence of electric charge. Although initially considered a phenomenon separate to magnetism, since the development of Maxwell's Equations both are recognized as part of a single phenomenon:electromagnetism. Various common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges and many others. In addition, electricity is at the heart of many modern technologies. - Geography (from Greek , \\"geographia\\", literally \\"earth description\\") is a field of science devoted to the study of the lands, the features, the inhabitants, and the phenomena of Earth. The first person to use the word \\"\\" was Eratosthenes (276194 BC). Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of the Earth and its human and natural complexitiesnot merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. It is often defined in terms of the two branches of human geography and physical geography. The four historical traditions in geographical research are: spatial analyses of natural and the human phenomena, area studies of places and regions, studies of human-land relationships, and the Earth sciences. Geography has been called \\"the world discipline\\" and \\"the bridge between the human and the physical sciences\\". - The term export means shipping in the goods and services out of the jurisdiction of a country. The seller of such goods and services is referred to as an \\"exporter\\" and is based in the country of export whereas the overseas based buyer is referred to as an \\"importer\\". In international trade, \\"exports\\" refers to selling goods and services produced in the home country to other markets. - Lightning is a sudden electrostatic discharge that occurs during an electrical storm. This discharge occurs between electrically charged regions of a cloud (called intra-cloud lightning or IC), between two clouds (CC lightning), or between a cloud and the ground (CG lightning). The charged regions in the atmosphere temporarily equalize themselves through this discharge referred to as a \\"strike\\" if it hits an object on the ground, and a flash, if it occurs within a cloud. Lightning causes light in the form of plasma, and sound in the form of thunder. Lightning may be seen and not heard when it occurs at a distance too great for the sound to carry as far as the light from the strike or flash. - An economy (From Greek \\"household\\" and o \\"manage\\") is an area of the production, distribution, or trade, and consumption of goods and services by different agents in a given geographical location. Understood in its broadest sense, 'The economy is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use and management of resources'. Economic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments. Economic transactions occur when two parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency, but monetary transactions are only a small part of the economic domain. - The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the United States federal government, tasked with gathering, processing and analyzing national security information from around the world, primarily through the use of human intelligence (HUMINT). As one of the principal members of the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC), the CIA reports to the Director of National Intelligence and is primarily focused on providing intelligence for the President and Cabinet. - The military, also called the armed forces, are forces authorized to use deadly force, and weapons, to support the interests of the state and some or all of its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state and its citizens, and the prosecution of war against another state.

A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.

The answer is:","completion":"global warming. Acid rain is primarily caused by the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, which releases sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the atmosphere. These substances react with water vapor, oxygen, and other chemicals to form sulfuric acid and nitric acid, which then fall to the ground as rain, fog, or snow. Acid rain can damage buildings, harm aquatic life, and have negative effects on soil and vegetation. Coal is one of the most significant contributors to acid rain due to its high sulfur content. When coal is burned in coal-fired power stations, it releases a significant amount of SO2, along with other pollutants like mercury, arsenic, and particulate matter. The environmental damage caused by coal-fired power stations is concerning, both in terms of the local ecosystem and the global impact on climate change. Burning coal in power stations is not only related to acid rain but also to global warming because it is a major source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. CO2 is one of the primary greenhouse gases responsible for trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to a gradual increase in the planet's temperature. This is known as global warming and is causing a range of negative consequences, such as more frequent and severe weather events, melting of ice caps and glaciers, rising sea levels, and disruptions to ecosystems and agriculture. In addition to global warming, other answer choices, such as energy usage, coal mining, and deforestation, are also associated with electricity production. However, these options don't describe the direct environmental consequences of acid rain that result from certain types of electricity production. In summary, the best answer to the question \\"Certain types of electricity production can cause acid rain and contribute to\\" is global warming, as coal-fired power stations are a significant source of both acid rain and greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to this environmental crisis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Vision blurry, I wobbled out of the train depot and thought about the fact that I had never really done anything crazy in my life. The colors meant something here. Green was the color of plants but it was also the color of money. Plants were good but money was bad. I didn't know what green meant. Blue and red were clear though. Blue was the color of ocean and sky, both good things. Red was the color of Mars and it was manly but mars meant aliens and aliens were bad so red was bad. This is how I navigated. I followed the colors. I was lost in a daze of exhaustion and moved my feet slowly. They were dead and raw with pain and blisters, and I shuffled out into the city. My eyes darted from color to color, sign to sign, connection to connection. I floated like a ghost and thought about crying. There were few people out so I found a relative ease in that but my mind still jumped around reckless. I needed to find Kim. I saw a silent pay phone with a dangling phonebook and headed towards it until I remembered that phone books don't normally list cell phones.

If proprioceptive functions allow one to sense and maintain body position, then what allows one to sense and maintain body position? Answer choices: - kinetic functions - proprioceptive functions - fencing response - magic functions - Riding a bike - that material's properties - by keeping them warm - sensory neurons","completion":"Among the answer choices provided, proprioceptive functions are what allow one to sense and maintain body position. I will provide a detailed explanation to clarify the concept. Proprioception is the body's ability to sense and be aware of its position, movements, and spatial orientation without relying on external visual cues. Primarily, it is achieved through proprioceptive functions, which are controlled by sensory neurons. These neurons are found in our muscles, tendons, and joints, working together with the central nervous system (CNS) to collect and process information about the positioning and movements of body parts. Proprioceptive functions play a vital role in coordinating and controlling our movements, providing stability and balance during motion, and allowing us to perform daily activities such as walking, eating, and typing without constantly looking at our limbs. To further illustrate how proprioceptive functions enable us to sense and maintain our body position, let's discuss some key components involved in this process: 1. Sensory receptors: Specialized nerve endings called proprioceptors reside in muscles, tendons, and joints, where they collect information about muscle length, tension, and joint angle. Key types of proprioceptors include muscle spindles, Golgi tendon organs, and joint receptors. 2. Muscle spindles: These are sensory receptors located within muscle fibers, which detect changes in muscle length and measure the rate of length change. When muscles are stretched, muscle spindles are activated, sending information to the CNS regarding muscle position and movement. 3. Golgi tendon organs: Located at the junction of muscles and tendons, these receptors detect changes in muscle tension or force. They help in regulating muscle contraction and preventing injuries due to excessive force. 4. Joint receptors: Found in joint capsules and ligaments, joint receptors are sensitive to changes in joint angle and mechanical pressure. They communicate the position and orientation of the joint, enabling the body to coordinate its movements effectively. 5. Integration of sensorimotor information: The CNS processes the information received from sensory receptors to create a mental map of the body's position in space (body schema). This map helps the brain plan and execute accurate and coordinated movements. 6. Motor output: Based on the body schema, the CNS sends signals to muscles to adjust their contraction or relaxation, maintaining the desired body position and balance. In conclusion, proprioceptive functions are responsible for sensing and maintaining body position through a complex network of sensory receptors, neural pathways, and the CNS. They continuously monitor and process feedback from muscles, tendons, and joints to coordinate and control our movements. While some answer choices, like sensory neurons, are indeed involved in this process, the correct answer among the available options is proprioceptive functions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is a world of snow and ice all year round. China has sent many scientists there. They try to find resources under the icy land and study climate change and sea biology. What do they eat? Scientists don't have many choices on what they eat. About 60% their food is frozen food. It is easy to heat . Meat is common on the menu, while vegetables are not usual. Fresh vegetables are hard to grow in the cold weather. Therefore, people often eat dried and canned vegetables. How do they sleep? In Antarctica, summer lasts from November to March. During this time, Antarctica faces the sun and gets sunlight 24 hours of the day. In order to get some sleep,scientists cover the window with black cloth to make \\"night\\". How do they work? People can wear warm clothes to be against the cold weather, but they can do little with the strong wind. Sometimes, the wind is even stronger than a typhoon. It can easily blow people away. So there are ropes that connect some research stations. People can hold these ropes to keep balance in strong winds. How do they keep in touch with others? There are no cables or Internet on the frozen continent. So mobiles and computers don't work there. Scientists usually use two-way radios to communicate at work.

The answer is:","completion":"B) They mostly find resources and study climate change and sea biology. Antarctica is a fascinating and unique continent that offers numerous opportunities for scientific research. Chinese scientists, along with researchers from other countries, have been conducting various studies on this remote and icy land. Among these research endeavors, a prominent focus has been placed on finding resources, studying climate change, and investigating sea biology. Regarding resource exploration, Antarctica has the potential to hold natural resources such as minerals, oil, and gas that could be of immense value. By examining the geology and composition of the continent, scientists can determine what resources may exist beneath the ice and how they could be extracted safely and sustainably. Climate change research in Antarctica is crucial because the continent's ice sheets hold a vast amount of Earth's freshwater. Understanding how global warming affects Antarctica's melting ice can significantly impact global sea levels and lead to better predictions and mitigation strategies. Moreover, the investigation of ice cores offers insights into the Earth's climatic history, which aids our understanding of the current climate crisis. Sea biology is another major area of focus for scientists in Antarctica. The Southern Ocean that surrounds the continent harbors a diverse ecosystem teeming with life, from microscopic plankton to massive whales. This unique ecosystem allows researchers to study the effects of climate change on marine life, as well as uncover new species and explore the adaptive strategies that these organisms employ to survive in such extreme conditions. While other areas of research on Antarctica may include the study of ice and geography, as well as animals and plants, the options provided in the question specify that scientists predominantly find resources and study climate change and sea biology. It does not mean other research areas are not important, but the focus of the question dictates that option B is the most accurate answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

According to the tradition first reported by Sulcard around 1080, a church was founded at the site known as Thorn Ey (Thorn Island) during Mellitus's time as the Bishop of London. Mellitus was an early Christian missionary in England and later became the Bishop of London. He was part of the Gregorian mission sent by Pope Gregory the Great to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity in 601 AD. Mellitus was also one of the first bishops consecrated by Augustine of Canterbury, who played a prominent role in the early Christianization of England. In 604 AD, Mellitus was consecrated as the Bishop of the East Saxons, with his see at London. He subsequently faced various challenges and opposition during his time as a bishop and was briefly exiled. As the sentence suggests, the church founded at Thorn Ey (Thorn Island) during Mellitus's time as The Bishop of London is a testament to the earlier stages of Christianity in England. Further historical research into Mellitus and the context of the 7th century would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role and significance of bishops during that time frame."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Siobhán Emma Donaghy (born 14 June 1984) is an English singer-songwriter. She was a founding member of girl group the Sugababes and Mutya Keisha Siobhan. Donaghy left the Sugababes in 2001 following arguments and accusations in the trio with Keisha Buchanan. Donaghy released her debut solo album, \\"Revolution in Me\\", on 23 September 2003, which contained three single releases. Her second studio album, \\"Ghosts\\", was released on 25 June 2007. Donaghy appeared in a remixed version of the hit stage show \\"Rent\\" (titled \\"Rent Remixed\\") for its 20072008 run, playing the role of Mimi alongside Denise Van Outen. - Sweet 7 is the seventh and final studio album by British girl group the Sugababes, released on 15 March 2010, by Island Records. It marks as the final release from the fourth line up following them splitting in 2011. Production for the album began in April 2009 and was completed in January 2010. \\"Sweet 7\\" is the only release since the controversial departure of Keisha Buchanan, who was replaced by 2009 Eurovision Song Contest entry Jade Ewen in September 2009. As a result of the group line-up change, \\"Sweet 7\\" was re-recorded to feature the vocals of new member Ewen and for the removal of former member Buchanan's vocals. As a result, this is the only album that features none of the original members. - London Records is a record label in the U.K. that marketed records in the U.S, Canada, and Latin America from 1947 to 1979 before becoming semi-independent. - Jade Louise Ewen (born 24 January 1988) is an English singer, songwriter, actress and a former member of the band Sugababes. Ewen began her singing career in a girl group named Trinity Stone, which signed with Sony BMG in 2005 but disbanded in 2007 without releasing an album. In 2009, after winning the right, she represented the United Kingdom in the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest by performing the Andrew Lloyd Webber penned \\"It's My Time\\". She finished in fifth place, making her the most successful British Eurovision act since 2002. She is well known for her Connie Francis-like vocals. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - \`\` Shape '' is a song by English girl group Sugababes , released as the fourth and final single from their second studio album , Angels with Dirty Faces ( 2002 ) .

It features the Sugababes at a masquerade ball in a mansion . The Sugababes performed \`\` Shape '' on GMTV , at the V Festival , and on tour in support of their albums . - Dominic Miller (born 21 March 1960) is an Argentinian-born British-American guitarist best known for his involvement in Sting's projects for over 20 years. Together they wrote \\"Shape of My Heart,\\" which would be sampled by various artists, including in hit songs for Craig David and the Sugababes. He has released several solo albums. - The Sugababes were an English girl group, formed in 1998 with founding members Siobhán Donaghy, Mutya Buena and Keisha Buchanan. Their debut album, \\"One Touch\\", was released in the UK through London Records on 27 November 2000. The album achieved moderate success, peaking at number 26 in April 2001 and eventually being certified Gold. In 2001, Donaghy departed the group amid rumours of a rift with Buchanan and the group were dropped by their record label. With the introduction of Heidi Range, former member of fellow English girl group Atomic Kitten, the group began to experience a higher level of commercial success whilst keeping the critical acclaim they had achieved with their debut album. They released three studio albums before Buena announced her departure in December 2005, leading to Amelle Berrabah being brought in to replace her. Following the release of their first greatest hits album, the new line-up released two studio albums. In September 2009, after 11 years in the Sugababes, Buchanan, the final original member, was replaced by former UK Eurovision entry Jade Ewen. Range, Berrabah and Ewen released the group's seventh studio album, \\"Sweet 7\\", in 2010, after which they signed to RCA Records, before announcing an indefinite hiatus in 2011. In 2013, Ewen confessed that the Sugababes had split two years earlier.

Built upon vocal harmony, doo-wop was one of the most mainstream, pop-oriented R&B styles of the time. Singer Bill Kenny (19141978) is often called the \\"Godfather of Doo-wop\\" for his introducing the \\"top and bottom\\" format which featured a high tenor singing the lead and a bass singer reciting the lyrics in the middle of the song. Doo-wop features vocal group harmony, nonsense syllables, a simple beat, sometimes little or no instrumentation, and simple music and lyrics. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area.

Pop and rock groups such as the Beatles, the Dave Clark Five, the Kinks, the Rolling Stones, Herman's Hermits, and the Animals were at the forefront of the invasion. - A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music. Ballads derive from the medieval French \\"chanson balladée\\" or \\"ballade\\", which were originally \\"danced songs\\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa. Ballads are 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Atomic Kitten are an English pop girl group formed in Liverpool in 1998 whose current members are Natasha Hamilton, Kerry Katona and Liz McClarnon.

IBM opened a sprawling and sophisticated semiconductor factory here on Wednesday that cost more than 2.5 billion to build and equip, the largest single capital investment the company has ever made. The factory, which opens as the computer chip business is in a slump, is a costly and risky move for IBM. But it is also an expression of confidence by the company that it can remain a technology leader in the highly competitive global semiconductor industry, and a commitment that the best place to execute that strategy is in upstate New York. IBM is an exception among computer makers in that it still invests heavily in research to advance the design, manufacture and materials used in semiconductor chips. It is spending more than 500 million a year on semiconductor research and development. The factory will produce a wide range of specialized semiconductors used in everything from the largest mainframe computers to cell phones and video-game consoles. The new plant is part of IBM's push to gain a strong lead in chip-making beyond the personal computer business, where Intel and East Asian chip producers hold the advantage. \\"The core of our strategy is to lead in technology and attack the high-performance segments of the market,\\" said John Kelly, senior vice president in charge of IBM's technology group. An advantage to having the semiconductor fabricating factory here, Kelly explained, was that it was very close to its research laboratories in nearby Westchester County, N.Y. To stay ahead in advanced chip technology, he said, moving innovations out of the labs and into the factory as fast as possible is crucial. \\"What we call the lab-to-fab time should be as close to zero as possible,\\" Kelly said. \\"If our strategy were anything but to be on the leading edge, we'd have put the plant in Asia.\\" The new factory, which will begin normal production early next year, will employ about 1,000 people.

Write an article with the title: \\"Quiz: Who designed the first pyramid?\\"","completion":"Title: Quiz: Who Designed the First Pyramid? Introduction The birth of the Egyptian pyramids is a subject that has fascinated historians, architects, and scholars alike for centuries. Even today, they continue to captivate the minds of those who visit these enduring testaments to Egypt's ancient civilization. In this article, we will take a closer look at the origin of these architectural wonders with an intriguing quiz question: Who designed the first pyramid? To answer that, let us delve into the realm of ancient Egypt and embark on a journey that unravels the mystery behind the pioneering mastermind responsible for the inception of these immortal structural marvels. The First Pyramid: The Step Pyramid of Djoser To identify the person responsible for designing the first pyramid, we must first recognize the structure in question - the Step Pyramid of Djoser. Located in the Saqqara necropolis, northwest of Memphis, the Step Pyramid is dated back to the 27th century BCE. This monumental tomb served as a final resting place for Pharaoh Djoser, the second ruler of Egypt's Third Dynasty. Before the evolution into the recognizable pyramidal form, the tomb architecture in ancient Egypt consisted of \\"mastabas,\\" which were rectangular, flat-roofed structures made predominantly out of mud-bricks. The Step Pyramid of Djoser is widely acknowledged as the first pyramid largely because it innovatively combines six mastabas of diminishing size, one on top of the other, to form the unique step-like structure that would eventually pave the way for the true pyramidal form. The Architect Behind the First Pyramid: Imhotep The ingenious architect responsible for the groundbreaking design of the first pyramid is none other than Imhotep, a gifted multi-talented individual. Imhotep held various accolades and titles, such as an esteemed physician, sage, poet, high priest, astrologer and, of course, the chief architect of Pharaoh Djoser. Evidence suggests that it was Imhotep who envisioned the revolutionary design for the Step Pyramid, which marked a turning point in tomb construction in ancient Egypt. Imhotep's accomplishments did not end there, as his remarkable life earned him the distinction of becoming a deity after his death - a rare and exceptional honor bestowed upon him by the Egyptians. He was venerated as the god of medicine, learning, and wisdom, and his reverence endured well into the Greco-Roman period. A Revolutionary Architectural Feat Imhotep's idea to construct the Step Pyramid was inspired by several factors, including religious beliefs, a desire for elegant vertical ascension, and functional considerations. The Step Pyramid is predominantly built using limestone blocks, a significant departure from the previously employed mud-bricks. Limestone was not only more durable but also allowed for greater architectural flexibility to achieve the mastaba-stacking. With the groundbreaking concept formulated by Imhotep, subsequent generations of pharaohs and architects embraced and refined this pioneering design. This eventually culminated in the construction of the astounding true pyramids, such as the Great Pyramid of Giza designed for Pharaoh Khufu, the largest of the three pyramids on the Giza plateau and one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Conclusion The answer to the quiz question, as we have discovered, is Imhotep – the architect who conceptualized and designed the first-ever pyramid. The enduring legacy of Imhotep's architectural ingenuity can be seen not only in the iconic pyramids of ancient Egypt but also in the inspiration they provide to architects, engineers, and history enthusiasts throughout the ages. With the extraordinary feat of designing the first pyramid, Imhotep set in motion a legacy of architectural prowess, and the structures that followed his creation continue to leave us in marvel and awe."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: You should always discuss exercise changes with your doctor, but this is especially important if you haven't been very active in the past. Increasing your exercise levels too fast can lead to injury or medical complications. Not only is this dangerous, but it will also delay the results you want. Tell your doctor that you plan to workout 5 to 6 days a week, including both cardio and resistance training. Cardio is one of the best ways to lose weight, though you will need to combine it with dietary changes. For increased weight loss, do 45 minutes to 1 hour of cardio 5 times per week. Good cardio exercises include walking, running, swimming, cycling, rowing, and jumping rope. Start with something low-impact (like walking or swimming), then work your way up to more high-intensity cardio activities (like running or rowing). Allow your body time to adapt to a cardio fitness plan. Workout every other day for the first 1 to 2 weeks, if you were previously inactive. Add extra time and days to your plan until you reach a 6 day fitness goal. Use interval training methods. Work out at a moderate intensity and do bursts of high-intensity or resistance movement. You will burn more fat in the same period of time if you do intervals. Remember that calorie burns through exercise should be coupled with calorie deficits in your diet to see the results you want. Use free weights, weight machines, resistance bands or a combination to kick start your metabolism and lose extra weight. Strengthening your muscles will help you lose fat from a wider variety of muscles. Remember that muscle weighs more than fat. So, strength training will help you get leaner and lose fat even if the scale doesn’t show much weight loss. Continue doing strength training for 2 days a week for the first 2 to 4 weeks. Once your body gets used to the workout, you can increase to 3 days per week. This usually takes about a month. A weight loss period should be treated like training for a sports event. Failure to drink water, stretch, and give your body a rest can result in injury and it will be more difficult to lose weight with good nutrition alone. Take 5-10 minutes before each workout session to warm up your body. For your warm up, try dynamic stretches (those that involve performing controlled movements that gradually increase your range-of-motion). Dynamic stretches are best for warming up because they get the blood flowing throughout your body. Do not do static stretches when your muscles are cold, as this can lead to injury and reduce your performance. Signing up for fitness classes with a friend is a wonderful way to stay motivated. Meeting hour-long fitness goals is easier if you have scheduled the class in advance and are participating in a structured workout class. Signing up for classes means that other people will expect to see you there, especially after you’ve been going for a while. This will also help motivate you to keep going to the classes. Once you get to the second month, try some new workouts. Using different muscles for strength training and cardio exercise will increase your metabolism and help you lose weight. As you grow accustomed to certain cardio exercises, consider alternating machines/activities. For example, spend one day on the elliptical machine, then go for a swim the next day. During strength training, make sure that each muscle group has time to recover before your next session. Muscle confusion, or targeting different muscle groups once your body grows accustomed to a specific workout routine, can help increase your weight loss. Ask your trainer to do fitness tests at 1 month and 2 months to help you meet weight loss and inch reduction goals. Your personal trainer will be able to recommend certain activities that will help you with your weight loss goals, tailored specifically for your body. Cooling down will help your heart rate return to normal after your workout and will allow you to condition your muscles. Try practicing lunges to stretch out your thigh and calf muscles. Sit on the ground with your legs spread apart out in front of you and lean your arms toward one foot to stretch out your arms and back. Hold the stretch for a few moments, then lean back out toward the other foot.","completion":"It's important to talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise plan, especially if you haven't been active. To lose weight, do exercises like walking, swimming, or running, and mix in some strength training. Start slow and gradually increase how much you exercise. Try new workouts to keep your body guessing. Don't forget to warm up, cool down, and stretch to stay healthy. Doing exercise classes with a friend can be fun and help you stay motivated. Drinking enough water and eating well are also important for weight loss."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Math Problem Solve 10*q = -0*q + 10 for q.","completion":"To solve the equation 10*q = -0*q + 10 for q, follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation The equation is given as 10*q = -0*q + 10. Notice that -0*q is 0 since any number multiplied by 0 is 0. Therefore, we can simplify the equation to: 10*q = 10 Step 2: Solve for q Now, we need to solve for q. Since 10*q means 10 times q, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10 to isolate q. Doing so, we get: (10*q) / 10 = 10 / 10 This simplifies to: q = 1 So the solution to the equation 10*q = -0*q + 10 is q = 1."},{"prompt":"Given the question: When we got married we thought it was going to be all bliss and happiness for life.

Morley and Holmes discover that she has been fired; they quickly hire her back and promote her from her secretarial duties. Meanwhile, Baxter keeps seeing Patsy, trying to help her with his namesake. She manages to maintain her charade, but Morley sees them together and assumes that she is Baxter's mistress. Patsy discovers her new friend's identity when her bosses send her to present their latest idea. Meanwhile, Baxter's temper improves under Patsy's influence. When Morley and Holmes finally learn the truth, Patsy wants to confess all to Baxter, but they insist she carry on the masquerade until they get his signature on the contract. She reluctantly agrees, after they point out that they will probably have to close if they do not get Baxter's business, throwing hundreds out of work.

Understand the context: The context talks about The Creation of Adam, a fresco painting by Michelangelo. It is part of the Sistine Chapel's ceiling and was painted around 1508-1512. It tells us that the fresco is chronologically the fourth in the series of panels showing episodes from Genesis. 2.

Answer the following question: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. Two pedologists studied different types of soil. Yun studied forest soils, while Jian studied grassland soil. They were both very surprised with they findings.

According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal. Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient often leads to severe floods and course changes. Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal; and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea. Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh. India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.The Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options： A. hotel room B. garbage C. supermarket D. medicine cabinet E. restaurant A:","completion":"A. Hotel Room Although there are several options available to choose from, the most suitable answer to the question would be the hotel room. Hotels often provide guests with various amenities and complimentary items, one of which can be a disposable razor. Reasons for each option: A. Hotel Room - When staying at a hotel, it is common for guests to find a disposable razor in the room or available upon request if they need to shave. If the option of going to a department store is less favorable, a hotel room is a convenient and more easily accessible place to get a disposable razor. B. Garbage - Although it might be possible to find a disposable razor in the garbage, it is unhygienic, unsafe, and not a suitable option. Used razors may contain bacteria and can potentially cause skin infections or other health issues. C. Supermarket - While supermarkets often sell disposable razors, the question points out that \\"he didn't want to go to the department store.\\" Therefore, it is unlikely that he would go to another store like a supermarket to buy one. Additionally, the supermarket is not the most convenient option compared to a hotel room if he's staying at a hotel. D. Medicine Cabinet - A medicine cabinet could potentially have a disposable razor in it, particularly if the individual is at their own residence or a friend's place. However, people commonly store personal, non-disposable razors in their medicine cabinet so it is less likely to find a disposable razor there. E. Restaurant - A restaurant is not a suitable location for acquiring disposable razors. Instead, restaurants provide food and related services to customers. Even though some establishments may have restrooms with toiletries available, it is not a typical place to find a disposable razor. Therefore, option A (Hotel Room) is the most suitable answer to the question since hotels often provide disposable razors as an amenity for guests, making it an easily accessible and convenient option compared to other choices."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The berry , also known as the miracle fruit , was first documented by explorer Chevalier des Marchais , who searched for many different fruits during a 1725 excursion to its native West Africa . Miraculin itself is not sweet . However , after the taste buds are exposed to miraculin ( which binds to sweet receptors on the tongue ) , acidic foods which are ordinarily sour ( such as citrus ) are perceived as sweet . This effect lasts up to an hour . The active substance , isolated by Prof. Kenzo Kurihara ( Kurihara Kenz ) , a Japanese scientist , was named miraculin after the miracle fruit when Kurihara published his work in Science in 1968 . - Reynaud Des Marchais, Chevalier des Marchais was a French cartographer and navigator who travelled extensively in the west coast of Africa, the West Indies and the northwest coast of South America between 1704 and 1727, under service to the King of France. His maps and manuscripts were published posthumously by Père J. B. Labat in Amsterdam in 1730-31. - An oligosaccharide (from the Greek \\"olígos\\", \\"a few\\", and \\"sácchar\\", \\"sugar\\") is a saccharide polymer containing a small number (typically two to ten) of simple sugars (monosaccharides). Oligosaccharides can have many functions including cell recognition and cell binding. For example, glycolipids have an important role in the immune response. - Food energy is chemical energy that animals (including humans) derive from their food and molecular oxygen through the process of cellular respiration. (Cellular respiration involves either the process of joining oxygen from air with the molecules of food (aerobic respiration) or the process of reorganizing the atoms within the molecules (anaerobic respiration).) - West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa. West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo. - Glycosylation (see also chemical glycosylation) is the reaction in which a carbohydrate, i.e. a glycosyl donor, is attached to a hydroxyl or other functional group of another molecule (a glycosyl acceptor). In biology glycosylation mainly refers in particular to the enzymatic process that attaches glycans to proteins, lipids, or other organic molecules. This enzymatic process produces one of the fundamental biopolymers found in cells (along with DNA, RNA, and proteins). Glycosylation is a form of co-translational and post-translational modification. Glycans serve a variety of structural and functional roles in membrane and secreted proteins. The majority of proteins synthesized in the rough ER undergo glycosylation. It is an enzyme-directed site-specific process, as opposed to the non-enzymatic chemical reaction of glycation. Glycosylation is also present in the cytoplasm and nucleus as the O-GlcNAc modification. Aglycosylation is a feature of engineered antibodies to bypass glycosylation. Five classes of glycans are produced: - Synsepalum dulcificum is a plant known for its berry that, when eaten, causes sour foods (such as lemons and limes) subsequently consumed to taste sweet. This effect is due to miraculin. Common names for this species and its berry include miracle fruit, miracle berry, miraculous berry, sweet berry, and in West Africa, where the species originates, agbayun, taami, asaa, and ledidi. - The lemon (\\"Citrus\\" × \\"limon\\") is a species of small evergreen tree native to Asia. - Proteins (or ) are large biomolecules, or macromolecules, consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity. - Glycoproteins are proteins that contain oligosaccharide chains (glycans) covalently attached to polypeptide side-chains. The carbohydrate is attached to the protein in a cotranslational or posttranslational modification. This process is known as glycosylation. Secreted extracellular proteins are often glycosylated. - Taste, gustatory perception, or gustation is one of the five traditional senses that belongs to the gustatory system. - A sugar substitute is a food additive that provides a sweet taste like that of sugar while containing significantly less food energy. Some sugar substitutes are produced by nature, and others produced synthetically. Those that are not produced by nature are, in general, called artificial sweeteners. - Sugar is the generalized name for sweet, short-chain, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. They are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. There are various types of sugar derived from different sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, and galactose. The table or granulated sugar most customarily used as food is sucrose, a disaccharide. (In the body, sucrose hydrolyses into fructose and glucose.) Other disaccharides include maltose and lactose. Longer chains of sugars are called oligosaccharides. Chemically-different substances may also have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugars. Some are used as lower-calorie food substitutes for sugar, described as artificial sweeteners. - Food additives are substances added to food to preserve flavor or enhance its taste and appearance. Some additives have been used for centuries; for example, preserving food by pickling (with vinegar), salting, as with bacon, preserving sweets or using sulfur dioxide as with wines. With the advent of processed foods in the second half of the twentieth century, many more additives have been introduced, of both natural and artificial origin. - In biology, a common name of a taxon or organism (also known as a vernacular name, English name, colloquial name, trivial name, trivial epithet, country name, popular name, or farmer's name) is a name that is based on the normal language of everyday life; this kind of name is often contrasted with the scientific name for the same organism, which is Latinized.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Would a linguist find the following sentence to be a valid English sentence grammatically? Very heavy, this parcel!","completion":"A linguist would likely find the sentence \\"Very heavy, this parcel!\\" to be grammatically valid in English, though it may be seen as unconventional or informal. This is because the sentence demonstrates key aspects of both grammar and communication. First, it is essential to understand that grammar is not a strict set of rules that must be adhered to at all times. Language is a living, evolving entity, and grammar varies depending on the context, speaker, and situation. Different varieties of English, such as informal spoken English, written English, and nonstandard dialects, may adhere to different grammatical conventions. As such, some grammatical structures that may be considered nonstandard or ungrammatical in formal written English can still be perfectly valid and communicative in other contexts. Now let's examine the specific sentence in question: \\"Very heavy, this parcel!\\" While the sentence structure may seem unusual compared to the more standard \\"This parcel is very heavy,\\" it remains effective in conveying meaning. It consists of two main components: an adjective phrase (\\"very heavy\\") and a noun phrase (\\"this parcel\\"). The speaker's intention in emphasizing the weight of the parcel is clear, even though the sentence does not follow the conventional subject-verb-object (SVO) word order. There are a few reasons why a linguist might find the sentence grammatically valid despite its unconventional structure: 1. Emphasis: The sentence places the adjective phrase \\"very heavy\\" at the beginning, which creates emphasis on the weight of the parcel. This structure can be effective in grabbing the listener or reader's attention and emphasizing what the speaker finds most important. 2. Ellipsis: The sentence is an example of ellipsis, a linguistic phenomenon where certain elements of a sentence are omitted because they can be inferred from the context. In this case, the speaker has omitted the copula verb \\"is,\\" but the meaning remains clear. Ellipsis is a common feature of informal spoken English, and it can be used to create a more focused, expressive, or colloquial tone. 3. Vocatives and Exclamations: The sentence has an exclamatory tone, which can also affect its grammatical structure. Exclamatory sentences often follow less rigid grammatical rules than declarative or interrogative sentences. For example, consider the sentence \\"What a beautiful day!\\" This sentence does not follow the standard SVO structure, but its meaning is evident, and it effectively communicates the speaker's sentiment. In conclusion, while the sentence \\"Very heavy, this parcel!\\" may not adhere to the most conventional English grammar rules, it remains a valid sentence in terms of its ability to communicate meaning effectively. A linguist would likely recognize the sentence as an example of how language can vary depending on context, speaker, and intention, and they would understand that such variation does not necessarily invalidate a sentence grammatically."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Nepal does not border Bangladesh, which is located within only 27 km (17 mi) of its southeastern tip. It neither borders Bhutan due to the Indian state of Sikkim being located in between. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and largest city.

This is fortunate, since antennas at lower frequencies which are not rather large (a good fraction of a wavelength in size) are inevitably inefficient (due to the small radiation resistance Rr of small antennas). Most AM broadcast radios (except for car radios) take advantage of this principle by including a small loop antenna for reception which has an extremely poor efficiency. Using such an inefficient antenna at this low frequency (530–1650 kHz) thus has little effect on the receiver's net performance, but simply requires greater amplification by the receiver's electronics.

Summarize this article: BAGHDAD — The Islamic State militant group attacked the ancient archaeological site of Nimrud in northern Iraq and damaged it with heavy vehicles, Iraq’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said Thursday. It was the latest in a series of attacks on ancient structures and artifacts in Syria and Iraq that the group has destroyed in the name of its harsh interpretation of Islamic law. Last week, Islamic State militants videotaped themselves destroying statues and artifacts in the Mosul Museum and at the Nergal Gate entryway to ancient Nineveh. The militants captured the city during its offensive blitz through much of Iraq last June. “The terrorist gangs of ISIS are continuing to defy the will of the world and the feelings of humanity after they committed a new crime that belongs to its idiotic series,” the ministry said in a statement on its Facebook page, referring to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh. Nimrud is the sprawling site of a city founded by the Assyrian King Shalamansar I, who died in 1245 B.C. Among the most impressive objects at Nimrud are the colossal statues known as “lamassu,” mythological creatures that depict either lions or winged bulls with bearded human heads. Pairs of the 17-ton statues are at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the British Museum. ||||| Baghdad (AFP) - Condemnation poured in Friday of the Islamic State group's bulldozing of the ancient city of Nimrud, the jihadists' latest attack on Iraqi cultural treasures that the UN termed a \\"war crime\\". After rampaging through Mosul's museum with sledgehammers and torching its library last month, IS \\"bulldozed\\" the nearby ruins of Nimrud Thursday, the tourism and antiquities ministry said. The devastation comes with the jihadists the target of an Iraqi government offensive. The US military said Friday Iraqi government forces and allied tribal militia have retaken the town of Al-Baghdadi, from where jihadists had threatened to attack an airbase housing American troops. Iraqi antiquities officials said IS militants had moved trucks last week to the Nimrud site overlooking the Tigris River, 30 kilometres (18 miles) southeast of their main hub of Mosul. \\"Until now, we do not know to what extent it was destroyed,\\" one official said. Washington's National Security Council tweeted Friday: \\"Deeply saddened by incomprehensible destruction of historical, cultural and religious artifacts in Iraq, including recent attacks in Nimrud.\\" View gallery An Islamic State group militant is shown destroying a statue of an Assyrian diety in the Iraqi Gover … Nimrud was the latest victim of what appears to be a systematic campaign by the jihadists to obliterate Iraq's rich heritage. \\"I'm really devastated. But it was just a matter of time, now we're waiting for the video. It's sad,\\" Abdulamir Hamdani, an Iraqi archaeologist from Stony Brook University in New York, said of the propaganda film of the destruction that IS is likely to release. Nimrud was founded in the 13th century BC and was considered the jewel of the Assyrian era. Its stunning reliefs and colossal statues of winged bulls with human heads guarding palace gates filled the world's museums in the 19th century. A collection of 613 pieces of gold jewellery, ornaments and precious stones discovered in a royal tomb in 1988 has been described as one of the greatest archaeological finds of the 20th century. - 'Hatra next' - View gallery An image grab taken from a propaganda video uploaded on June 11, 2014 by the Islamic State jihadist … \\"Their plan is to destroy Iraqi heritage, one site at a time,\\" said Hamdani. \\"Hatra of course will be next,\\" he added of a 2,000-year-old UNESCO-listed site about 100 kilometres south of Mosul known for its beautifully preserved temples blending Hellenistic, Roman and Eastern influences. Irina Bokova, the head of the UN's cultural body UNESCO, condemned the destruction of Nimrud \\"with the strongest force\\". \\"We cannot stay silent. The deliberate destruction of cultural heritage constitutes a war crime, and I call on all political and religious leaders in the region to stand up against this new barbarity,\\" she said Friday. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, also calling the destruction a war crime, urged political and religious leaders in the region to speak out in condemnation of \\"these unacceptable attacks\\". UNESCO has called for tougher action to protect the many heritage sites in one of the cradles of civilisation, but little can be done in areas under jihadist control.

The destruction was met with condemnation and sadness on Baghdad's Mutanabi Street, a favourite haunt of Iraqi intellectuals. \\"After they killed the human spirit, they began killing civilisation,\\" Ibrahim Dawood, a writer and poet, said of IS. IS tries to justify the destruction by saying the statues are idolatrous, but experts say the jihadists traffic antiquities to fund their self-proclaimed \\"caliphate\\" and destroy only those pieces that are too bulky to be smuggled. Stuart Gibson, a UNESCO expert on museums, said pressure from the international community would have little effect on IS. \\"Unfortunately today the people in the region are exhausted and terrified. The remainder of us can only stand on the outside looking on in absolute despair,\\" he said. IS still controls large parts of northern and western Iraq, but has been losing ground under mounting military pressure from Iraqi federal and Kurdish forces backed by a US-led coalition and by Iran. Baghdad launched a huge offensive Monday to retake the city of Tikrit, in what commanders have said was a stepping stone toward an even larger operation to free Mosul. Iraqi forces also battled IS in the strategic town of Dawr on Friday as they pressed their offensive, Iraqi officials said. Dawr, on one of the main roads Iraqi forces are taking to reach Tikrit, needs to be captured for the anti-IS offensive to move forward. Since they swept through Iraq's Sunni heartland last June, IS has destroyed a long list of religious and heritage sites, including churches and Sunni shrines. ||||| BAGHDAD (AP) — Islamic State militants \\"bulldozed\\" the ancient Nimrud archaeological site near the northern Iraqi city of Mosul on Thursday using heavy military vehicles, the government said. A statement from Iraq's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities didn't elaborate on the extent of the damage, saying only that the group continues to \\"defy the will of the world and the feelings of humanity\\" with this latest act. Nimrud is a 13th century B.C. Assyrian archaeological site located on the Tigris River just south of Iraq's second largest city, Mosul, which was captured by the Islamic State group in June. The extremists, who control a third of Iraq and Syria, have attacked other archaeological and religious sites, claiming that they promote apostasy. Earlier this week a video emerged on militant websites showing Islamic State militants with sledgehammers destroying ancient artifacts at the Mosul museum, sparking global outrage. Last year, the militants destroyed the Mosque of the Prophet Younis — or Jonah — and the Mosque of the Prophet Jirjis, two revered ancient shrines in Mosul. They also threatened to destroy Mosul's 850-year old Crooked Minaret, but local residents surrounded the structure, preventing the militants from approaching. Iraq's national museum in Baghdad opened its doors to the public last week for the first time in 12 years in a move Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said was to defy efforts \\"to destroy the heritage of mankind and Iraq's civilization.\\" The Islamic State group has imposed a harsh and violent version of Islamic law in the territories it controls and has terrorized religious minorities. It has released gruesome videos online showing the beheading of captives, including captured Western journalists and aid workers. A U.S.-led coalition has been striking the group since August, and Iraqi forces launched an offensive this week to try to retake the militant-held city of Tikrit, on the main road linking Baghdad to Mosul. |||||","completion":"The Islamic State has attacked the ancient archaeological site of Nimrud in northern Iraq and has damaged it with heavy vehicles, Iraq's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said.

James could not finish drawing the diagram within the time give. The","completion":"instructor, noticing James struggling, decided to extend the deadline by a few extra minutes, but still, the pressure was mounting. James had always been a talented artist, known for his attention to detail, creativity, and patience. He excelled in various artistic mediums, from traditional sketching to digital design. However, that arduous task of completing a technical diagram within the time constraint was proving to be an unforeseen challenge. The diagram in question was for a complex mechanical system, which involved numerous components intricately interconnected. This demanded a precise understanding of how each part functioned both individually and collectively. James knew the importance of such diagrams in conveying essential information about the system's design, making his endeavors to craft it accurately and within the deadline even more crucial. As James continued to struggle, beads of perspiration formed on his forehead. He tightly gripped the pencil, trying different approaches to complete the diagram as quickly and accurately as possible. Unfortunately, each attempt seemed to lead to more confusion, partially erased lines, and mounting frustration. Seeing James' increasing agitation, his classmates tried their best to help without breaking any academic rules. Although their efforts were well-intended, they only added to the overwhelming atmosphere. Every whispered suggestion and every glance exchanged served only to exacerbate James' rising anxiety. Time was running out, and James had a decision to make. While he understood that the diagram's purpose was to convey detailed information to those who relied on it, he also acknowledged that it had to be completed. He decided to simplify some sections of the drawing, cutting away unnecessary details to highlight the most critical aspects. With renewed determination, James swiftly sketched the primary connections between the components, ensuring the overall structure was clear and concise. He left out some of the more intricate details, which, while visually appealing, didn't directly contribute to the understanding of the system. Finally, the instructor announced the end of the given time, and James looked down at his completed diagram. While it was not as detailed as he would have preferred, it was a functional representation of the system's design and would serve its intended purpose. The other students handed in their diagrams, each varying in levels of complexity and detail. Throughout this trial, James had learned a valuable lesson about time management and flexibility. There were instances when perfection and adherence to every detail could be counterproductive. This experience taught James the importance of adapting his approach and knowing when to prioritize certain aspects of a task over others. James went on to apply these lessons in his future work, using his newfound awareness to balance perfectionism with pragmatism to continue producing exceptional and functional art. Slowly, he realized that finding the right balance between detail and clarity was crucial and that these limitations could also foster creativity in their own unique ways."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Definition and meaning: The premise, \\"that's happened to me too,\\" is an expression where the speaker shares a similar experience or occurrence with someone who might have just mentioned the event. It implies that the speaker is acknowledging and empathizing with the other person's situation, as they have gone through the same situation themselves. On the other hand, the hypothesis \\"It happened to me as well\\" conveys the same message as \\"that's happened to me too.\\" It means that the speaker is agreeing with someone else's statement, indicating that they experienced a similar event or situation. 2. Analysis: When comparing the premise and the hypothesis, we can see that \\"that's happened to me too\\" and \\"It happened to me as well\\" express the same sentiment. Both phrases include the speaker's experiences as a point of emphasis to align their situation with the other person's experience. 3. Contextual usage: In different contexts, these phrases might appear differently depending on the nature of the conversation and informal vs. formal language use. For example: a) Conversation between friends: Friend A: \\"I once accidentally dropped my phone in the pool.\\" Friend B: \\"Oh, that's happened to me too; I had to replace my phone afterward.\\" In this context, both friends are speaking informally, and \\"that's happened to me too\\" works as an appropriate response. b) Formal presentation: Speaker A: \\"Many people have experienced a significant dip in their internet connection speeds over the past few days.\\" Speaker B: \\"Indeed, it happened to me as well, which led me to investigate the underlying cause.\\" In this formal context, using \\"It happened to me as well\\" sounds more professional and appropriate to the situation. 4. Conclusion: Based on the analysis and understanding of the premise \\"that's happened to me too\\" and the hypothesis \\"It happened to me as well,\\" we can conclude that the hypothesis is true, as both phrases convey the same meaning. They both indicate that the speaker shares a similar experience or occurrence with the person they are speaking to, and can be interchanged, depending on the context and formality of the conversation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Nannerl herself was an apt pupil, no less quick to learn than her brother, and was playing the keyboard with striking virtuosity by the time she was eleven. In that year, 1762, Leopold brought the children to Munich to play before Maximilian III Joseph, Elector of Bavaria. Leopold then took the entire family to Vienna, on a trip that lasted for three months. He had secured invitations from several noble patrons, and within three days of arriving the children were playing at the palace of Count Collalto. Among those present was the Viennese Treasury councillor and future prime minister Karl von Zinzendorf, who noted in his diary that \\"a little boy, said to be only five-and-a-half years old [Wolfgang was actually nearly seven], played the harpsichord\\". After an appearance before the Imperial Vice-Chancellor, the Mozarts were invited to the royal court, where the Empress Maria Theresa tested Wolfgang's abilities by requiring him to play with the keyboard covered. During this court visit Wolfgang met the Archduchess Maria Antonia, the future Queen Marie Antoinette of France, who was two months his senior. Mozart's biographer Eric Blom recounts an anecdote of how the Archduchess helped Wolfgang when he slipped on the polished floor; she is supposed to have received a proposal of marriage in return.As the Mozarts began to be noticed by the Viennese aristocracy, they were often required to give several performances during a single day. They were well rewarded for this activity—at the end of their first hectic week in Vienna, Leopold was able to send home the equivalent of more than two years' salary. Their schedule was interrupted when Wolfgang fell ill with scarlet fever, and their former momentum was not regained.

The former U.S. secretary of state, senator and first lady said her background gives her a \\"unique vantage point\\" to bring to the White House should she run in 2016. \\"I do have a unique vantage point and set of experiences about what makes the United States operate well and what doesn't and what a president can do and should be doing,\\" she said. \\"So I am going to be making a decision around, probably after the first of the year, about whether I'm going to run again or not.\\" Clinton first ran for president in 2008, but she was defeated in the Democratic primary by then-Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill. She was asked about her intentions for the next presidential cycle Friday at an event in Mexico City honoring thousands of scholarship students supported by the Telmex Foundation, one of several charitable organizations under the umbrella of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim. Clinton would only speak \\"hypothetically\\" about a possible presidential bid. She added she would have to have a clear vision of what she wants to achieve, and as well as how she would lead politically to realize that vision. \\"I think the most important question anybody should ask who's thinking about it is not whether you're going to run or whether you're going to win -- it is what's your vision for the country and can you lead us there?\\" she explained. \\"And I will have to be convinced that I have a very clear vision with an agenda of what I think needs to be done, and that I have the experience and know-how to lead -- not just those who agree with me, but those who disagree with me, to try to achieve those goals. It's a very serious undertaking, so obviously I'm thinking about it, but I have not made a decision yet.\\" Polls have shown Clinton all but running away with the Democratic nomination and performing strongly against most of her GOP challengers, though her lead in general election polls has recently diminished, according to some surveys. ||||| Hillary Clinton added some clarity to the timeline of her potential presidential run Friday, saying she will make a decision after the new year. “I am going to be making a decision … probably after the first of the year about whether I’m going to run again or not,” the former secretary of state said in Mexico City at a forum hosted by the charitable foundation of Mexican telecom billionaire Carlos Slim. During her last bid for the presidency in 2008, Clinton announced her candidacy on Jan. 20, 2007. Previously, Clinton has said she would decide by the end of 2014. Slim, the second richest man in the world after Bill Gates, has contributed to the Clinton Foundation, which presented Slim with a philanthropic award in 2012. New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie, another likely 2016 presidential candidate, also attended the event. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Hillary Rodham Clinton, during an event in Mexico City, stated her intention to make a decision about running for the presidency in 2016 after the start of the new year.

Mats Wilander: From Wimbledon to a Winnebago Former Grand Slam Tennis Champ Mats Wilander used to appear at fantasy tennis camps, where club-level players would fly into a resort for the weekend. Now he's taken his fantasy camp on the road. He makes house calls, so to speak, in his Winnebago. Mats Wilander, the former No. 1 tennis player in the world, won seven Grand Slam titles in a Hall of Fame career. If you would like to take a tennis lesson from him, please call 787-GET-GAME and he'll drive to your local club in his Winnebago. \\"At first I thought it was a joke,\\" said Andrew White, a bond trader at III Offshore Advisors who plays at Bear Lakes Country Club in West Palm Beach, Fla., where Wilander has visited the last two years. \\"Then he showed up.\\" Tennis junkies have long flown to fantasy camps for a hit-and-giggle with all-time greats. But a traveling fantasy camp? \\"It's—it's just weird,\\" said George Bezecny, the head tennis pro on Fisher Island in Miami, where Wilander put on two clinics last month. \\"He doesn't have to do this. It's amazing that he does.\\" Scenes from former champion Mats Wilander's visit to a Florida tennis club for a lesson. Mats Wilander, right, with his assistant Cameron Lickle It's not unusual for former No. 1 tennis players to find other work after they retire. John McEnroe has developed a lucrative career as a commentator and he recently opened a tennis academy. Ivan Lendl has started playing exhibitions again. Jimmy Connors had a stint as Andy Roddick's coach and is now a Tennis Channel commentator. For many, working isn't a choice. Tennis careers are so short (many players are done by 30) that even top players have had trouble building the kinds of fortunes they can sit on. Bjorn Borg narrowly avoided bankruptcy and several years ago considered selling his Wimbledon trophies. Wilander, 46, is on sound financial footing. He won nearly 8 million in his career, and earned more in endorsements and exhibitions. He owns an 81-acre estate in Sun Valley, Idaho, where he lives with his wife of 24 years, Sonya, and their four children. He's a commentator for Eurosport and a regular on the seniors circuit. He has coached players and served as Sweden's Davis Cup captain. Still, he says, he'd always wanted to spend less time on planes and in hotels and more time building a business of his own. So at a fantasy camp in Vermont a few years ago, he had an idea. A few players from Las Vegas had complained that they found the cost of the camp—and the hassles of travel—too burdensome. \\"So I thought, 'Why don't I come to you?'\\" Wilander said. \\"I love camping out, I love teaching tennis.\\" Wilander on Wheels, LLC, otherwise known as WOW, is a two-man operation. Despite the 787 area code, it is not based in Puerto Rico. \\"GET-GAME was the best number available,\\" said Cameron Lickle, Wilander's business partner and fellow instructor. \\"We didn't know it was in Puerto Rico until later.\\" Wilander does most of the driving. Lickle, a 30-year-old former top player at the Naval Academy who studied nuclear engineering, drums up business. They met in Sun Valley when investment strategist Kiril Sokoloff hired Lickle as a ringer to beat up on a few local bullies in doubles. For an hour-and-a-half clinic with eight players, Wilander and Lickle charge as little as 200 per person. Private lessons and home visits cost more. A full day at a club includes two clinics and an exhibition; customers are mostly recreational players, from 30-somethings taking a day out of the office to retirees. They'll happily stay for lunch or dinner, too. They also might ask for permission to sleep in the parking lot. \\"Sometimes it's too late to find a trailer park or a camp site,\\" Wilander said. Wilander has a queen-size bed in the rear of the Winnebago. Lickle bunks over the driver's seat and can't sleep without a Vornado, whirring at full blast, next to his head. \\"The pipes on ships are so loud, I needed something to drown it out,\\" he said. Wilander bought the Winnebago in 2000, when he and his wife moved their family from Greenwich, Conn., to Sun Valley, where the air is cool and dry, ideal conditions for their son, Erik, who has epidermolysis bullosa, a rare skin disease. The Winnebago is 29-feet long and has 48,000 miles on it. It drives beautifully but is beginning to show some wear. The windshield wipers don't wipe so much as splatter, and the skylights sometimes leak. One evening before bedtime last month, Wilander climbed onto the roof to stuff them with towels. The side door recently broke and now can't be opened from the inside unless pried with a screwdriver. \\"We're going to ride it into the ground,\\" Wilander said. Last May, Wilander and Lickle drove from Los Angeles (Lickle lives in Santa Monica) to Washington, D.C. For their recent trip through Florida, they had the Winnebago shipped from Sun Valley via truck. Their plan is to travel at least 12 weeks a year; they'd like to teach in all 50 states. Wilander's tennis philosophy is simple: run more, worry less about technique. \\"Tennis is a running game, not a hitting game—it's not golf,\\" he said. \\"In Sun Valley, people play tennis and then go for a hike. You should be too tired to go for a hike!\\" Wilander calls his favorite drill \\"the heart attack.\\" Players must hit a ball, shuffle to the far corner, circle back to where they began, and then hit another shot. It's a fast-spinning tennis carousel with two to three people per side. \\"That's it, Barbara!\\" he shouted at Barbara Rubenstein as she retrieved a wide ball on Fisher Island's perfectly manicured clay courts on a Wednesday afternoon last month. \\"Move, move, move—all the time, move!\\" Wilander's approach is punishing. \\"I hadn't been worked like that since high school soccer practice,\\" White, the bond trader, said of his first encounter with Wilander last year. \\"We nearly died.\\" \\"What time is the Advil break?\\" James Desnick, a 59-year-old ophthalmologist who now invests in health ventures, shouted in the middle of his Fisher Island clinic. \\"I'm exhausted,\\" he said later. \\"My back hurts, my arm hurts.\\" But he looked happy. In his heyday, Wilander seemed to glide along the court without expending any energy. His secret: He doesn't sweat. Lickle drenches two or three shirts during back-to-back clinics; in Florida, one young girl asked him if he had jumped into a swimming pool. Wilander can teach for nearly four hours, in bright sun and 80-degree heat, in one cotton shirt and finish with just a trace of sweat under his arms. He drinks very little water and eats small meals. \\"My genetic makeup is a little bit crazy,\\" he said. At dinner, the men tend to huddle around Wilander and ask him questions about other all-time greats, the toughest serve he ever faced (Steve Denton, a Texan nicknamed \\"The Bull\\"), and why Americans aren't as good at tennis these days (it's complicated, but footwork is a big reason). The women cozy up to Lickle, who looks more like a San Diego surfer dude than a former Navy lieutenant. \\"He's so cute!\\" Jody Bandremer said after her Thursday morning clinic at Bear Lakes last month. She took a photo with Lickle to text to a friend. After several plates of sushi had been depleted at a restaurant by the beach on Fisher Island, Barbara Goldin, chairwoman of the island's tennis committee, asked the inevitable question: \\"Mats, where are you staying tonight?\\" \\"We're sleeping in the Winnebago,\\" Wilander replied. Goldin paused. Then smiled. \\"And you enjoy that?\\" she asked. \\"Very much,\\" Wilander said. Wilander plans to buy a bigger Winnebago one day, with fancier features and a towering driver's seat like a bus. \\"The sides pop out, you push a button and it gets wider,\\" he said. \\"The chairs swivel, the kitchen sofa comes out—it's unbelievable. I want to get one of those when we grow old, take my wife around and visit the kids. They're not going to visit us, I know that.\\" What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about former Grand Slam Tennis Champion Mats Wilander, who now travels in a Winnebago offering tennis lessons and clinics to club-level players at their local clubs.

Sevendust is an American alternative metal band from Atlanta, Georgia, formed in 1994 by bassist Vince Hornsby, drummer Morgan Rose and guitarist John Connolly. After their first demo, lead vocalist Lajon Witherspoon and guitarist Clint Lowery joined the group. Following a few name changes, the members settled on the name Sevendust and released their self-titled debut album on April 15, 1997. They have attained success with three consecutive RIAA gold certified albums, a Grammy nomination, and have sold millions of albums worldwide. In 1994, bassist Vince Hornsby joined drummer Morgan Rose in a band called Snake Nation. John Connolly, a drummer, left his then band and joined Snake Nation as a guitarist. They recorded their first demo. Not happy with vocals, however, Snake Nation spent a year searching for a new singer before finding Lajon Witherspoon. Six months passed, Clint Lowery joined the band, and they renamed themselves Rumblefish. Rumblefish was short-lived, however, because they found another band with the same name. They renamed themselves Crawlspace, and released \\"My Ruin\\" on the Mortal Kombat soundtrack album entitled More Kombat through TVT Records in 1996. Shortly after, another band named Crawlspac' sent notice that they wanted 2,500 for the rights to their name. Rather than purchase the rights, the band members chose to rename themselves Sevendust, a name inspired by the commercial insecticide brand \\"Sevin Dust\\". The song Rumble Fish was included on the band's second album, Home. Sevendust released their self-titled debut, in-part produced by former Twisted Sister guitarist Jay Jay French, on April 15, 1997, known for its heavy riffs, angry vocals and thrash-like drumming, as in the songs \\"Black\\" and \\"Bitch\\". \\"Black\\" became the opening song for nearly every Sevendust concert until 2004. The debut album also contains the song \\"My Ruin\\", from the Mortal Kombat soundtrack. Sevendust appeared on the Billboard 200, remained there for sixteen weeks and peaked at 165 on April 4, 1998. The album went gold on May 19, 1999. In 1998, Sevendust performed at Dynamo Open Air (May 29-31) and Ozzfest 1998 (July through August). In the same year they released a compilation called Live and Loud which featured live footage of the band's performance of September 16, 1998 at Chicago's Metro.

The castle remained on the market for the following decade until bought in 1960 by Antonin Besse II, son of the late Sir Antonin Besse, and donated to the founding council of Atlantic College. Besse was a patron and honorary vice-president of the United World Colleges. The idea for an international school arose from a meeting between the educationalist Kurt Hahn, who founded Gordonstoun, and Air Marshal Sir Lawrence Darvall, the commandant of the NATO Defense College. They conceived of a college for 16–19-year-old students drawn from a wide range of nationalities, with the aim of fostering international understanding. With Rear-Admiral Desmond Hoare, the first headmaster, they persuaded Besse that the castle would make a suitable location for the first United World College, which opened in 1962 with fifty-six students.The first rigid-hulled inflatable boat was patented by Hoare at St Donat's in the 1960s. In an act of generosity, Hoare sold the patent for the boat to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in 1973 for a notional £1; the RNLI's cheque was not cashed and remains at the castle. From 1963 until 2013 the castle hosted an RNLI lifeboat station which was credited with saving ninety-eight lives along the South Wales coast during its period of operation. The college's early years were financially precarious, but major fund-raising efforts led by Sir George Schuster strengthened the financial position in the mid-1960s.The fiftieth anniversary of the college in 2012 was celebrated with a visit to the site by Queen Noor of Jordan, President of the United World Colleges Foundation. As at 2017, the college was home to 350 students from more than 90 countries. The Hearst Corporation maintains a connection with St Donat's through a sponsorship programme for students at the college. With a history of occupation from its construction in the late 13th century, St Donat's has been described as the oldest continuously inhabited castle in Wales. answer the following question: What are the full names of the two individuals who conceived of a college for students drawn from a wide range of nationalities, with the aim of fostering international understanding?

By Daily Mail Reporter PUBLISHED: 23:28 EST, 12 September 2013 | UPDATED: 07:04 EST, 13 September 2013 The Humane Society of Missouri is offering 5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person who viciously burned a pit bull last month, resulting in the dog's death. The pooch named Zeus was discovered August 27 with horrific third-degree burns to 75 per cent of his head and 30 per cent of his body in St Louis. His left front paw was scorched to the degree that there was no padding left. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT Heartbreaking crime: A 3-year-old pit bull named Zeus was brought to a veterinary clinic last month with horrific burns to most of his body Beloved pet: Zeus was adopted as a puppy by a","completion":"family in St. Louis who cherished the dog and considered him a member of their household. They were devastated when he disappeared from their backyard one day in August, only to be found in a nearby park severely injured. The family immediately took Zeus to a local veterinary clinic, where the staff worked tirelessly to treat his injuries and alleviate his pain. Unfortunately, the extent of the burns was too severe, and Zeus succumbed to his injuries a few days later, surrounded by his grieving family. Community outrage: News of the gruesome attack on Zeus spread quickly through the St. Louis community, and residents were outraged by the senseless cruelty. The story was picked up by local media outlets, which helped to raise public awareness about the case and the ongoing search for the person responsible. Humane Society steps in: Recognizing the severity of the crime and the need to hold the perpetrator accountable, the Humane Society of Missouri stepped in to offer a 5,000 reward for any information that might lead to the arrest of the individual responsible for Zeus's torture. The organization hopes that the reward will incentivize members of the community to come forward with any relevant information, no matter how small or inconsequential it may seem. Investigation efforts: The St. Louis Police Department has been working closely with the Humane Society to investigate the case and follow up on any leads. In addition to canvassing the area where Zeus was found, police have been interviewing potential witnesses and reviewing security footage from nearby homes and businesses. While progress has been slow, the authorities remain committed to seeking justice for Zeus and preventing similar acts of cruelty. Public response: The tragic story of Zeus has struck a chord in the hearts of animal lovers around the city and beyond, prompting an outpouring of support for the bereaved family and demands for justice. Social media campaigns have emerged, using the hashtag #JusticeForZeus to rally support and share updates on the case. A call for change: The barbaric abuse of Zeus has also sparked a larger conversation in the community about the need for more stringent animal cruelty laws and harsher penalties for those who commit such heinous acts. Several local animal welfare organizations have joined forces to lobby for legislative changes that will better protect animals and ensure that those who harm them are held accountable. In conclusion, the most logical way to complete this passage is to emphasize the community's reaction, the efforts of St. Louis Police Department and Humane Society, the public response, and the resulting call for stronger animal cruelty laws in the wake of this horrible crime against Zeus the pit bull. Moreover, by sharing updates on the ongoing efforts to catch the perpetrator and supporting the bereaved family, the passage sheds light on how deeply such a tragedy can affect not just the family and community but also inspire changes in legislation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He repeated again and again the pledge he had just made to Nicolette: I am your true troubadour, now and forever. It felt like a knife stabbing into him. I do love her, as I have not loved any other - except Diane. Under his fur-lined mantle he was sweating, despite the bone-deep chill of the January night. Was my pledge to Nicolette a lie? No, not now that Diane has vowed herself to God. He had always believed that a man or a woman could love but one person. For all the years he had loved Diane, he had accepted that as a sacred law of Love. It was the way things should be. But it was not the way they were. Not for him. What if I had known, that day I saw Nicolette at Chinon, that Diane was still alive? I would have wanted Nicolette just as much, but would not have begun this. There would have been no messages, no song in her garden. But I was sure Diane was dead. There was nothing but a memory of a younger time to check my feelings for Nicolette. And then, when I found Diane again, I could not have her. I had lost her forever. So at last I wrote again to Nicolette. But tonight, when Nicolette would have let me make love to her - and how I want her! - I could not go beyond an embrace and a kiss. Not as long as I still love Diane.

He falls in love with her, they marry, and Serena comes with George to his land. There, she starts taking control of things, pressuring and questioning George, while remaining affectionate towards him. George's business partner Buchanan feels threatened by her, as she begins to exceed his authority. Things grow worse between George and Buchanan, and Buchanan strikes a deal with the local sheriff, who wants to buy George's land to make a park. George is hurt by Buchanan's betrayal, and Serena convinces George that Buchanan was never his friend. The next day, they both go shooting alone from the group attempting to flush out a bear. After some snide remarks from Buchanan, George contemplates killing him only to hesitate and be seen by Buchanan. As Buchanan cocks his rifle, George fires first and shoots him in the chest. Campbell, George's worker, witnesses the murder, but denies it when Sheriff McDowell inquires. The death is ruled an accident. Serena consoles George and justifies his actions. One day, he sees his illegitimate son, Jacob, posing with his mother, Rachel, for a picture.

Examine the situation to determine that there is a change in the temperature or phase. Is there heat transfer into or out of the system? When the presence or absence of a phase change is not obvious, you may wish to first solve the problem as if there were no phase changes, and examine the temperature change obtained. If it is sufficient to take you past a boiling or melting point, you should then go back and do the problem in steps—temperature change, phase change, subsequent temperature change, and so on. Identify and list all objects that change temperature and phase. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). A written list is useful. Make a list of what is given or what can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns). Solve the appropriate equation for the quantity to be determined (the unknown). If there is a temperature change, the transferred heat depends on the specific heat (see Table 14.1) whereas, for a phase change, the transferred heat depends on the latent heat. See Table 14.2. Substitute the knowns along with their units into the appropriate equation and obtain numerical solutions complete with units. You will need to do this in steps if there is more than one stage to the process (such as a temperature change followed by a phase change). Check the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense? As an example, be certain that the temperature change does not also cause a phase change that you have not taken into account.

His mother, from Hamburg, was a German Roman Catholic immigrant, and his father was Jewish. Hunter's father was reportedly abusive, and within a few years of his birth, his parents divorced. Tab grew up in California with his mother, older brother Walter, and maternal grandparents, John Henry and Ida (nee Sonnenfleth) Context: Hunter had a 1957 hit record with the song \\"Young Love,\\" which was No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for six weeks (seven weeks on the UK Chart) and became one of the larger hits of the Rock 'n' Roll era. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. He had the hit, \\"Ninety-Nine Ways,\\" which peaked at No. 11 in the US and No. 5 in the UK. His success prompted Jack L. Warner to enforce the actor's contract with the Warner Bros. studio by banning Dot Records, the label for which Hunter had recorded the single (and which was owned by rival Paramount Pictures), from releasing a follow-up album he had recorded for them. He established Warner Bros. Records specifically for Hunter. Hunter's acting career was also at its zenith. William Wellman used him again in a war film, Lafayette Escadrille (1958). Columbia Pictures borrowed him for a Western, Gunman's Walk (1958), a film that Hunter considers his favorite role. Hunter starred in the 1958 musical film Damn Yankees, in which he played Joe Hardy of Washington, D.C.'s American League baseball club. The film had originally been a Broadway show, but Hunter was the only one in the film version who had not appeared in the original cast. The show was based on the 1954 best-selling book The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant by Douglass Wallop. Hunter later said the filming was hellish because director George Abbott was only interested in recreating the stage version word for word. He also starred in They Came to Cordura (1959), with Gary Cooper and Rita Hayworth. Sidney Lumet starred him opposite Sophia Loren in That Kind of Woman (1959). Question: Did the song do well?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, the song \\"Young Love\\" by Tab Hunter did exceptionally well. It reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States, where it remained for six consecutive weeks. Moreover, in the UK Chart, it held the No. 1 spot for seven weeks. This success marked \\"Young Love\\" as one of the biggest hits of the Rock 'n' Roll era. The song's immense popularity led to sales surpassing one million copies, earning it a gold disc awarded by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Tab Hunter's success with \\"Young Love\\" and his subsequent hit \\"Ninety-Nine Ways\\" (which reached No. 11 in the US and No. 5 in the UK) highlighted his musical talent alongside his thriving acting career. His achievements in both fields caught the attention of Jack L. Warner, who established Warner Bros. Records specifically for Hunter and further enforced the actor's contract with the Warner Bros. studio. During this time, Hunter also worked with notable directors such as William Wellman and George Abbott and starred in films like Lafayette Escadrille (1958), Gunman's Walk (1958), Damn Yankees (1958), They Came to Cordura (1959), and That Kind of Woman (1959), showcasing his remarkable versatility and solidifying his status as one of the most prominent artists of that time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This method provides better protection, as the microfiber cloth can help prevent scratches and damage to the jewelry, while the plastic bag keeps everything organized and contained, reducing the chances of losing items. The first option suggests using a change purse for storage, which may not be adequate for protecting the jewelry or keeping it organized.

Movie title: Emperor of the North Context: Driven to desperation by the economic depression of 1930s America, a subculture of hobos hopped freight trains to get from place to place in search of jobs, handouts, or even to take it easy sometimes. Emperor of the North Pole depicts a microcosm of this subculture set in Oregon, and actually used the Oregon, Pacific & Eastern railroad which was taken up in 1994 like so much other trackage around the country. Thus, this motion picture serves as not only a look into an important aspect of American history, but into a specific piece of it in the Pacific Northwest.The film opens with the mechanical star, 2-8-2 steam locomotive #19, stopping to take on water while a hobo who calls himself \\"A-#1\\" looks on in anticipation of hopping this local train. Meanwhile, the conductor, \\"Shack\\", makes his presence known to the other hobos hiding in the weeds with a menacing countenance. As they pull back onto the mainline, Shack spies an ambitious hobo hopping between cars and quickly makes him pay his fare by knocking him down between the rails to his death. This sets the tone for the movie. The single-minded, almost hateful Shack bound and determined to prevent anyone from riding his train versus the veteran hobo A-#1 bound and determined to ride the 19 train. Each has his reputation at stake.A-#1 manages to hop aboard and hide in a cattle car undetected, but a greenhorn punk who calls himself \\"Cigaret\\" gives him away as he, too, climbs into the same car. Shack sees the kid closing the hatch and locks them in, leading to an unexpected turn of events.A-#1 sets fire to the hay in the car in order to burn his way through the wooden slats. He succeeds and hurls himself off the car to make his getaway as the train pulls into the yard with smoke billowing up. The kid, Cigaret, follows him with glee, but his celebration is short-lived as the yard workers haul him into the shop for a good grilling.The kid spins a yarn as if he were the veteran hobo whose plans were bolloxed up by A-#1, but the yard workers believe him and set up a...

Given the question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Who was possibly a satrap?\\" is in \\"The Greek kingdom of Bactria began as a breakaway satrapy of the Seleucid empire, which, because of the size of the empire, had significant freedom from central control. Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

Sales tend to pick up at this time of year, known as the spring bounce. But the British Bankers' Association said mortgage approvals - an indicator of future sales - had dropped. The association said that the total of 65,132 approvals was down for the fourth month in a row and was 3.5% lower overall than in the same month of last year.

Question: Information: - The prince-electors (or simply electors) of the Holy Roman Empire ((), pl. \\"Kurfürsten\\", ) were the members of the electoral college of the Holy Roman Empire. - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - An emperor (through Old French \\"empereor\\" from ) is a monarch, usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm. Empress, the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife (\\"empress consort\\"), mother (\\"empress dowager\\"), or a woman who rules in her own right (\\"empress regnant\\"). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings. In Europe the title of Emperor was, since the Middle Ages, considered equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope, due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of Western Europe. The Emperor of Japan is the only currently reigning monarch whose title is translated into English as \\"Emperor\\". - The Holy Roman Emperor (historically \\"\\" \\"Emperor of the Romans\\") was the ruler of the Holy Roman Empire. From an autocracy in Carolingian times the title evolved into an elected monarchy chosen by the Prince-electors. Until the Reformation the Emperor elect (\\"imperator electus\\") was required to be crowned by the Pope before assuming the imperial title. - The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman Empire during the imperial period (starting in 27 BC). The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history. Often when a given Roman is described as becoming \\"emperor\\" in English, it reflects his taking of the title \\"Augustus\\" or \\"Caesar\\". Another title often used was \\"imperator\\", originally a military honorific. Early Emperors also used the title \\"princeps\\" (first citizen). Emperors frequently amassed republican titles, notably \\"Princeps Senatus\\", \\"Consul\\" and \\"Pontifex Maximus\\". - An autocracy is a system of government in which supreme power is concentrated in the hands of one person, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regularized mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for the implicit threat of a coup d'état or mass insurrection). Absolute monarchy (such as Saudi Arabia) and dictatorship (such as North Korea) are the main historical forms of autocracy. In very early times, the term \\"autocrat\\" was coined as a favorable feature of the ruler, having some connection to the concept of \\"lack of conflicts of interests\\". - This is a list of those who were granted the rank of Feldmarschall by the Holy Roman Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation , 1618 -- 1806 .

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person Lennon misunderstood while drinking?, using the article: ABKCO Industries was formed in 1968 by Allen Klein as an umbrella company to ABKCO Records. Klein hired May Pang as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \\"He likes you a lot.\\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \\"lost weekend\\". In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.In June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them. Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends. By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking.

It is referenced in the provided context where it says, \\"Zen Buddhism (禅), pronounced Chán in Chinese, seon in Korean or zen in Japanese (derived from the Sanskrit term dhyāna, meaning 'meditation').\\" The context makes it clear that Zen is the Japanese pronunciation of a concept that originated from the Sanskrit word \\"dhyana.\\" The term \\"dhyāna\\" in Sanskrit refers to a state of profound meditation which is significant in Buddhism. Sanskrit is the classical language of India and the liturgical language of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. It is through Sanskrit that the term \\"dhyana\\" has been incorporated into Buddhism to define the very core of its practices focused on meditation. It's interesting to note that as Buddhism spread from India to other parts of Asia, the original Sanskrit terms were embraced and localized, contributing to the development of varying forms of Buddhism. The term \\"dhyana\\" traveled along the Silk Road with Buddhism, into China, where it was translated into the Mandarin term \\"Chán\\". From China, Chán Buddhism spread south to Vietnam and became Vietnamese Thien, east to Korea and became Seon Buddhism, further east to Japan becoming Zen. The Japanese term \\"Zen\\" is thus derived from the Chinese word \\"Chán\\", which in turn is derived from the Sanskrit \\"dhyāna\\", with all of them pointing to the act or practice of meditation. On the other hand, Zen is a school of Buddhism that became popular in China (as Chán), Korea (as Seon), and Japan (as Zen). It emphasizes meditation (dhyāna in Sanskrit) and direct personal realization of enlightenment. It lays stress on the experiential wisdom—particularly as realized in the form of meditation known as zazen—in the attainment of enlightenment. So, in summary, between Zen and Dhyāna in the given context, it is Dhyāna which is the term in the Sanskrit language, whereas Zen is an adaptation of the concept in Japan derived from Sanskrit's \\"dhyāna\\" via Mandarin's \\"Chán\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who accepted Walton's proposal? , can you please find it? In 1947, Walton was presented with the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal. In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year. While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954.

A hard-rocking quartet, Tin Machine came into being after Bowie began to work experimentally with guitarist Reeves Gabrels. The line-up was completed by Tony and Hunt Sales, whom Bowie had known since the late 1970s for their contribution, on bass and drums respectively, to Iggy Pop's 1977 album Lust for Life. Although he intended Tin Machine to operate as a democracy, Bowie dominated, both in songwriting and in decision-making. The band's album debut, Tin Machine (1989), was initially popular, though its politicised lyrics did not find universal approval: Bowie described one song as \\"a simplistic, naive, radical, laying-it-down about the emergence of Neo-Nazis\\"; in the view of biographer Christopher Sandford, \\"It took nerve to denounce drugs, fascism and TV ... in terms that reached the literary level of a comic book.\\" EMI complained of \\"lyrics that preach\\" as well as \\"repetitive tunes\\" and \\"minimalist or no production\\". The album nevertheless reached No. 3 and went gold in the UK.Tin Machine's first world tour was a commercial success, but there was growing reluctance—among fans and critics alike—to accept Bowie's presentation as merely a band member. A series of Tin Machine singles failed to chart, and Bowie, after a disagreement with EMI, left the label. Like his audience and his critics, Bowie himself became increasingly disaffected with his role as just one member of a band. Tin Machine began work on a second album, but Bowie put the venture on hold and made a return to solo work. Performing his early hits during the seven-month Sound+Vision Tour, he found commercial success and acclaim once again.In October 1990, a decade after his divorce from Angie, Bowie and Somali-born supermodel Iman were introduced by a mutual friend.

Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? pick from the following. [I] Using a screwdriver, disassemble the door knob and then reassemble it.. [II] Using a screwdriver, disassemble the door knob and then reassemble it with glue.....I think the answer is","completion":"[I] Using a screwdriver, disassemble the door knob and then reassemble it. The more reasonable method for fixing a door's lock out of the given options is [I] Using a screwdriver, disassemble the door knob and then reassemble it. This answer is based on practicality and the proper way of addressing the issue without causing potential further damage to the lock or door. Let me provide a detailed explanation of why this method is more suitable compared to the other option. First and foremost, using a screwdriver to disassemble and reassemble the door knob allows you to diagnose the issue with the lock more effectively. By disassembling the lock and examining its components, you can identify any damaged or worn-out parts that need to be replaced or repaired. This method provides an opportunity to thoroughly inspect and solve the issue. Moreover, working with a screwdriver is a standard procedure when dealing with door locks and knobs. It is a common and recommended tool for adjusting, fixing, or replacing such hardware. As a result, this approach is aligned with best practices and ensures a higher chance of success compared to unconventional methods. Now, let's examine the alternative option - [II] Using a screwdriver, disassemble the door knob and then reassemble it with glue. This method is less reasonable for several reasons: 1. Glue might compromise the functionality and integrity of the lock and the surrounding components. Locks often rely on precise mechanisms and moving parts, and the introduction of glue might cause the lock to become more difficult to operate—or worse, render it unusable. 2. It would be challenging to disassemble the lock again if the glue causes the components to become stuck together. This approach, therefore, may cause damage to the door or the lock that would require a costly replacement or professional repair. 3. Utilizing glue is not a standard practice in lock repair, and it could potentially void any warranty on the lock or door hardware. This method might not be reliable in the long term, and it could lead to further expenditure and complications. In conclusion, the more reasonable method for fixing a door's lock is [I] Using a screwdriver, disassemble the door knob and then reassemble it. This approach aligns with standard practices and allows for proper diagnosis and repair of the issue without causing additional damage. On the other hand, option [II] is more likely to compromise the lock's functionality and create further problems, making it the less suitable choice."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premiering on NBC on September 14, 2009, the program aired on weeknights at 10:00 p.m. ET/PT through February 9, 2010. The program was modeled upon the format of a late night talk show--specifically, Jay Leno's incarnation of The Tonight Show, opening with a comedic monologue, followed by interviews with celebrity guests and other comedy segments. Sketches from The Tonight Show (including Headlines and Jaywalking) were carried over to The Jay Leno Show, along with new sketches. In early January 2010, multiple media outlets reported that, following the 2010 Winter Olympics, The Jay Leno Show would be shortened to 30 minutes and begin airing weeknights at 11:35 pm ET, with Conan O'Brien and Jimmy Fallon's shows following it beginning at 12:05 am on March 1, 2010. On January 10, NBC Universal Television Entertainment Chairman Jeff Gaspin confirmed that The Jay Leno Show would indeed move to 11:35. Leno immediately accepted the return to 11:35 p.m., calling the move \\"all business.\\" He had made it known in the press in November 2009 that he wished to return to his old timeslot; behind the scenes, Leno had privately indicated that he did not believe the 10:00 experiment would work. On the other hand, O'Brien's contract stipulated that the network could move the show back to 12:05 a.m. without penalty, a loophole put in primarily to accommodate sports preemptions, the network's traditional nightly Wimbledon tournament highlights show, and specials such as New Year's Eve with Carson Daly. O'Brien did not seriously respond for several days after the announcement, then drafted a press release explaining why he felt it was unfair to him, his staff, Fallon, and the legacy of The Tonight Show to move the show past midnight. He concluded by saying that he \\"cannot participate in what I honestly believe is [The Tonight Show's] destruction.\\" O'Brien received an outpouring of celebrity and viewer support for rejecting the move, while Leno received heavy criticism. On January 21, O'Brien signed a 45 million deal allowing him to leave the network, and aired his final episode of Tonight on January 22; Leno returned as host of Tonight on March 1. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What was the dispute over timeslot about?","completion":"The dispute over the timeslot was primarily about NBC's decision to move The Jay Leno Show to 11:35 p.m., which would consequently push Conan O'Brien and Jimmy Fallon's shows back to 12:05 a.m. This decision was made in early 2010 after the experiment of placing The Jay Leno Show at 10:00 p.m. did not work as well as the network had hoped. Jay Leno accepted the return to his old timeslot, whereas Conan O'Brien felt that moving his show and The Tonight Show legacy past midnight would ultimately lead to its destruction. O'Brien's contract allowed the network to move the show back to 12:05 a.m. without penalty, but he publicly expressed his disapproval and eventually signed a deal to leave NBC. As a result of this disagreement and its fallout, Leno received significant criticism while O'Brien gained support from celebrities and viewers alike."},{"prompt":"Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who had an images of being a sex symbol? from the following article ? Presley's physical attractiveness and sexual appeal were widely acknowledged. \\"He was once beautiful, astonishingly beautiful\\", in the words of critic Mark Feeney. Television director Steve Binder, no fan of Presley's music before he oversaw the '68 Comeback Special, reported, \\"I'm straight as an arrow and I got to tell you, you stop, whether you're male or female, to look at him. He was that good looking. And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence.\\" His performance style, as much as his physical beauty, was responsible for Presley's eroticized image. Writing in 1970, critic George Melly described him as \\"the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl\\". In his Presley obituary, Lester Bangs credited him as \\"the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America\\". Ed Sullivan's declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.While Presley was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality, some cultural critics have argued that his image was ambiguous. In 1959, Sight and Sound's Peter John Dyer described his onscreen persona as \\"aggressively bisexual in appeal\\". Brett Farmer places the \\"orgasmic gyrations\\" of the title dance sequence in Jailhouse Rock within a lineage of cinematic musical numbers that offer a \\"spectacular eroticization, if not homoeroticization, of the male image\\". In the analysis of Yvonne Tasker, \\"Elvis was an ambivalent figure who articulated a peculiar feminised, objectifying version of white working-class masculinity as aggressive sexual display.\\"Reinforcing Presley's image as a sex symbol were the reports of his dalliances with various Hollywood stars and starlets, from Natalie Wood in the 1950s to Connie Stevens and Ann-Margret in the 1960s to Candice Bergen and Cybill Shepherd in the 1970s.

Options: 1. He hoped more republicans had come out to vote for him; 2. not enough information; 3. He wanted a recount; 4. He was not ready to concede the race; Given those answer options, answer the question: In a race with national implications, Democrat Conor Lamb declared victory in a very close special congressional election held Tuesday in Pennsylvania. Officially, the race has not been called for Lamb, who holds a lead of 627 votes over Republican candidate Rick Saccone, a strong supporter of President Donald Trump. It’s possible Saccone and his supporters may request a recount, given the close vote. Even though Lamb’s apparent victory is narrow, the Pennsylvania result could broaden implications for Republicans looking to defend their congressional majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate in the November midterm elections. Lamb ran surprisingly strong in a district that Trump carried by nearly 20 points, campaigning as a moderate Democrat. “We fought to find common ground, and we found it, almost everywhere. Democrats, Republicans, independents — each of us, Americans,” Lamb told supporters early Wednesday. Saccone was not ready to concede the race. “We are going to fight all the way to the end. You know I never give up.” The Pennsylvania race follows Democratic victories late last year in Virginia and Alabama, fueled in large part by what some analysts see as an anti-Trump theme that continues to build. “The opposition to Donald Trump is as intense as I have seen since the last year of [Richard] Nixon’s presidency,\\" said University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato via Skype. “It is so intense, it is so hot, that it could result in a much bigger turnover than we think in the midterm elections to the Democrats and away from the Republicans.” Saccone cast himself as the president’s “wingman,” and Trump campaigned on his behalf at a rally last Saturday when Trump urged Republicans to get out and vote. “We want to keep the agenda, the make America great, going. You have got to get him in. This is a very important race,” Trump said. Democrats were thrilled with the result, while some Republicans saw the race as a “wake-up” call for what could be a devastating midterm in November. According to the above context, answer the following question. What is probably true about Rick Saccone? A:","completion":"4. He was not ready to concede the race. According to the given context, Rick Saccone was not ready to concede the race, despite the narrow lead of Democrat Conor Lamb in the special congressional election held Tuesday in Pennsylvania. Saccone expressed that he and his supporters were \\"going to fight all the way to the end,\\" stating, \\"You know I never give up.\\" The close vote count might lead Saccone and his supporters to request a recount, given the national implications of the election results and the potential impact on the Republicans' congressional majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate in the November midterm elections."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Kendall understood and appreciated Cameron's inferences as Cameron talked to the crowd. Given the context: What will Kendall want to do next? Possible answers: call Cameron stupid, send Cameron away, take some notes A:","completion":"Given the context, it is likely that Kendall will want to take some notes. By understanding and appreciating Cameron's inferences, Kendall acknowledges the value of the information being shared. Taking notes would allow Kendall to retain and further analyze the points made by Cameron, potentially leading to new insights and ideas. Additionally, taking notes aligns with both understanding and appreciating Cameron's inferences, as opposed to the other two options. Calling Cameron stupid would be contradictory, as Kendall is portrayed as appreciating what Cameron is saying. This choice would dismiss the validity of the conversation and diminish the value of the information being shared. Also, it would showcase a lack of respect and maturity from Kendall. Sending Cameron away may appear as an alternative choice, however, it does not align with Kendall's appreciation of the inferences being made. Dismissing Cameron would prevent any further understanding or discussion of the topic. Moreover, sending Cameron away would not benefit Kendall, as it would deprive them of the opportunity to gather more information or engage in a meaningful dialogue. Thus, taking notes emerges as the best choice for Kendall, considering their appreciation of Cameron's inferences.

Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis (/ˌnjuːmənoʊˌʌltrəˌmaɪkrəˈskɒpɪkˌsɪlɪkoʊvɒlˌkeɪnoʊˌkoʊniˈoʊsɪs/ ( listen)) is a word invented by the president of the National Puzzlers' League as a synonym for the disease known as silicosis. It is the longest word in the English language published in a dictionary, the Oxford English Dictionary, which defines it as \`\`an artificial long word said to mean a lung disease caused by inhaling very fine ash and sand dust.'' Is it true that the longest word in the english language is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?","completion":"Yes, it is true that pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is considered one of the longest words in the English language. The word is made up of 45 letters and was coined as an extended synonym for silicosis, which is a lung disease caused by the inhalation of fine silica particles, typically found in volcanic ash or sand dust. The term was created by Everett M. Smith, the President of the National Puzzlers' League, during its annual meeting in 1935, as a way to demonstrate a playful, yet complex, linguistic creation. The Oxford English Dictionary has published the word, recognizing it as the longest word in the English language. However, it is important to note that there are other long words in the language as well, though they might not be as commonly acknowledged. Some of these long words include: 1. Antidisestablishmentarianism (28 letters): This term refers to the opposition to the disestablishment of the Church of England as the state church. Though shorter than pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, this word is often cited for its length and complexity. 2. Floccinaucinihilipilification (29 letters): This word is used to describe the act of estimating something as being worthless. It is another example of a long and complex term in the English language. It is worth mentioning that the length of a word does not necessarily correlate with its frequency of use or importance in the language. Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis and other lengthy words are often more linguistic curiosities than regularly employed terms. In conclusion, pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is indeed one of the longest words in the English language and holds a recognized position in the Oxford English Dictionary.

In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year. While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954.

If someone steals it, he'll get chances to steal something else. We use passwords everywhere in our life. We are so used to passwords that we don't pay any attention to them until we lose or forget one. A study of 28,000 passwords recently stolen from a popular website showed that people often do the easy thing. It found that 16% took a first name as a password. Another 14% used the easiest keyboard combinations such as \\"12345678\\"or \\"QWERTY\\". 5% of the stolen passwords were names of television shows or stars popular with young people. 3% of the passwords expressed feelings like \\"I don't care\\", \\"Whatever\\", \\"I love you\\" or their opposite, \\"I hate you\\". Robert Graham, who did the study, advises people to choose a password that is longer than eight characters with one capital letter and one symbol.

IBM used liquid cleaning agents in circuit board assembly operation for more than two decades, and six spills and leaks were recorded, including one leak in 1979 of 4,100 gallons from an underground tank. These left behind volatile organic compounds in the town's soil and aquifer. Traces of volatile organic compounds have been identified in Endicott’s drinking water, but the levels are within regulatory limits. Also, from 1980, IBM has pumped out 78,000 gallons of chemicals, including trichloroethane, freon, benzene and perchloroethene to the air and allegedly caused several cancer cases among the townspeople. IBM Endicott has been identified by the Department of Environmental Conservation as the major source of pollution, though traces of contaminants from a local dry cleaner and other polluters were also found.

Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has ruled the federal government may not deny funds from its global anti-AIDS program to organizations that refuse to actively oppose prostitution. In a 6-2 decision on Thursday, the justices determined the policy requiring fund recipients adhere to a larger message about fighting disease and its root causes was not directly related to the \\"core\\" mandate of the AIDS program. Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the opinion for the majority, said the 2003 law violated the First Amendment. The ruling tosses out the policy. The case was closely watched by many U.S.-based non-governmental organizations that distribute financial and other assistance overseas. In addition to promoting abstinence, monogamy, counseling, and the use of condoms, the law sought to use OPTIONS: - AIDS funds to \\"educate men and boys about the risks of procuring sex commercially\\" as well as finding ways to help \\"commercial sex workers\\" themselves get out of the business. - CNN funds to \\"educate men and boys about the risks of procuring sex commercially\\" as well as finding ways to help \\"commercial sex workers\\" themselves get out of the business. - First Amendment funds to \\"educate men and boys about the risks of procuring sex commercially\\" as well as finding ways to help \\"commercial sex workers\\" themselves get out of the business. - John Roberts funds to \\"educate men and boys about the risks of procuring sex commercially\\" as well as finding ways to help \\"commercial sex workers\\" themselves get out of the business. - Supreme Court funds to \\"educate men and boys about the risks of procuring sex commercially\\" as well as finding ways to help \\"commercial sex workers\\" themselves get out of the business. - U.S. funds to \\"educate men and boys about the risks of procuring sex commercially\\" as well as finding ways to help \\"commercial sex workers\\" themselves get out of the business. - Washington funds to \\"educate men and boys about the risks of procuring sex commercially\\" as well as finding ways to help \\"commercial sex workers\\" themselves get out of the business. - anti-AIDS funds to \\"educate men and boys about the risks of procuring sex commercially\\" as well as finding ways to help \\"commercial sex workers\\" themselves get out of the business.","completion":"In addition to promoting abstinence, monogamy, counseling, and the use of condoms, the law sought to use - AIDS funds to \\"educate men and boys about the risks of procuring sex commercially\\" as well as finding ways to help \\"commercial sex workers\\" themselves get out of the business.
