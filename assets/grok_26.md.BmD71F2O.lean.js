This summer the British driving test celebrates its seventy-fifth birthday.It's often described as one of the most frightening tests we face. It is a painful experience that doesn't come very cheap nowadays.Taking the test in 1935 cost just 37. 5 pence;now candidates can expect to pay PS93. The test is also harder than ever.In 1935,the pass rate was 63%; now it's 43%.In recent years,the DSA--the organization that oversees the driving test -- has looked for ways to assess different aspects of what makes a good driver Now the DSA has announced that candidates will drive for ten minutes without detailed instructions from the examiner.DSA'S chief driving examiner Trevor Wedge said the aim was to measure a candidate's ability to drive safely while making decisions independently. However,drivers will not be punished for getting lost. \\"Candidates won't be failed for going off route,\\" Mr. Wedge said. No doubt there will still be complaints. The BBC has learnt that in 2009 there were l,889 complaints about examiners,of which just 51 were supported. Complaints that were rejected included ''Candidate crashed during test--claims examiner distracted \\" and \\"Candidate says examiner took her on busy roads during rush hour,which was unfair\\". Someone else seemingly failed to understand the nature of an emergency stop when the complaint was filed that an emergency stop was conducted without warning.

Their claim centered on a four-note sequence in \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" which they alleged was identical to part of \\"This Game We Play\\". When the songwriters were gathering evidence, one posed as an employee of composer James Horner to contact Don Black and solicit his services for Ocean's Eleven.

Write a text based on \\"muted reaction to breakup ruling\\" Text:","completion":"Title: A Muted Reaction to the Breakup Ruling: The Unexpected Calm Amidst the Storm Introduction In a world where breakups within high-profile companies and conglomerates usually shake the business landscape, evoke strong emotions, and prompt heated debates, it is rather surprising to witness a rather lukewarm response to a recent breakup ruling. The muted reaction has left onlookers and industry experts scratching their heads, trying to decipher the reasons behind the unexpected calm. Background and Context The anticipated breakup ruling came as a result of regulatory authorities assessing the monopolistic practices of a major conglomerate operating in the technology, entertainment, and communication sectors. Over the past few years, the conglomerate has been scrutinized for dominating the market, suppressing competition, and violating consumer rights through exploitative pricing. Expected Repercussions Whenever a ruling of this magnitude is announced, one would expect a whirlwind of activity in the market. Such repercussions would typically involve stock market fluctuations, where share prices of directly affected or associated companies could soar or plummet. This would also subsequently impact the investments of stakeholders who have invested heavily in these enterprises. The public, consumers, and investors would all seek answers and assurance regarding the potential impact of such a ruling on their lives and businesses. However, the reactions to this particular breakup ruling have been anything but typical. The stock market reaction has been relatively stable with minor fluctuations. Investors seem unfazed by the announcement and the general public appears to be indifferent. Media coverage, although present, is not as intense as one would have expected, and the overall response appears to be lackluster. Possible Reasons for the Muted Reaction 1. Timing and Fatigue: The ruling arrives amid the backdrop of a saturated news environment. The world has experienced a series of shocking events, such as pandemics, political turmoil, climate change effects, and economic crises. The general public might be overwhelmed and desensitized to yet another major event. 2. Long Gestation Period: The process leading to the breakup ruling has been a long and public affair, with the conglomerate's transgressions and regulatory authorities' investigations well-documented over time. The unsurprising nature of the ruling may have diminished its shock value and the resultant reactions. 3. Limited Immediate Impact: While the breakup ruling will have long-term effects on the conglomerate and associated industries, its direct immediate consequences may not have been acutely felt by the general public, especially considering the company's size and its diverse portfolio of products and services. The breakup could appear more as a structural reshuffling, rather than a dramatic overhaul directly affecting consumers at the ground level. 4. Faith in Market Resilience: Given the resilience of the market in recent times, investors and the public may not be too worried about the impact of the breakup ruling on the market. Instead, they might consider the event as an opportunity for market correction and the emergence of new players. Conclusion While the muted reaction to the breakup ruling has caught many off-guard, it could simply be a reflection of the times we live in. The rapid succession of global events and the pre-existing knowledge of the breakup scenario may have muted the otherwise typical reactions to such a ruling. As the dust around the announcement settles, it remains to be seen how the conglomerate, associated industries, and the general public will respond and adapt to the new landscape shaped by this transformative ruling."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Remember, sometimes our body needs a superhero to help take care of it and be strong. Cortisol is like one of those superheroes that live in our body and help us when we are stressed. Sometimes we need more of it, and sometimes we need less of it. That's why the answers are different. Let me tell you what you can do in each case. Question 1: To increase cortisol levels, you might do the following: 1. Wake up early: When you wake up early, the sun tells your body it's time to wake up, and your cortisol superhero gets to work. 2. Exercise: When you play or do sports, your body sends a message that it needs more energy and your cortisol superhero helps. 3. Get excited or a little stressed: When you get excited, like before a big game, your body needs help from your superheroes, and the cortisol superhero is one of them. Question 2: To reduce cortisol levels, you can try: 1. Relaxing: This is like giving a break to your superheroes. You can relax by listening to soft music, taking a nap, or going for a walk. 2. Breathing: Taking deep breaths can help calm you down and put your cortisol superhero to more rest. 3. Eating well and sleeping well: A healthy snack and a good night's sleep will help keep all your superheroes, including cortisol, happy and strong.

The opening soprano solo in E major, \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" is one of the few numbers in the oratorio that has remained unrevised from its original form. Its simple unison violin accompaniment and its consoling rhythms apparently brought tears to Burney's eyes. It is followed by a quiet chorus that leads to the bass's declamation in D major: \\"Behold, I tell you a mystery\\", then the long aria \\"The trumpet shall sound\\", marked pomposo ma non-allegro (\\"dignified but not fast\\"). Handel originally wrote this in da capo form, but shortened it to dal segno, probably before the first performance. The extended, characteristic trumpet tune that precedes and accompanies the voice is the only significant instrumental solo in the entire oratorio. Handel's awkward, repeated stressing of the fourth syllable of \\"incorruptible\\" may have been the source of the 18th-century poet William Shenstone's comment that he \\"could observe some parts in Messiah wherein Handel's judgements failed him; where the music was not equal, or was even opposite, to what the words required\\". After a brief solo recitative, the alto is joined by the tenor for the only duet in Handel's final version of the music, \\"O death, where is thy sting?\\" The melody is adapted from Handel's 1722 cantata Se tu non-lasci amore, and is in Luckett's view the most successful of the Italian borrowings. The duet runs straight into the chorus \\"But thanks be to God\\".The reflective soprano solo \\"If God be for us\\" (originally written for alto) quotes Luther's chorale Aus tiefer Not. It ushers in the D major choral finale: \\"Worthy is the Lamb\\", leading to the apocalyptic \\"Amen\\" in which, says Hogwood, \\"the entry of the trumpets marks the final storming of heaven\\". Handel's first biographer, John Mainwaring, wrote in 1760 that this conclusion revealed the composer \\"rising still higher\\" than in \\"that vast effort of genius, the Hallelujah chorus\\".

As you know, the prizes were started by a Swede called Alfred Nobel. He was born in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. Alfred Nobel was a great scientist. He made two important inventions, and so he became very rich. Although he was rich, Nobel was not a happy man. He never married or had children. Also, he was a sick man during his large part of life. When he died at the age of 63, he left a fund of 9,000,000. The money was to be used in giving prizes to those who made great achievements in physics, chemistry , medicine and literature , and for world peace. The first Nobel Prizes were given on December 10, 1901, five years after Nobel's death. Since then many famous people from all over the world have been given Nobel Prizes for their achievements. Each prize has three parts. The first part is a gold medal. Second, a winner of a Nobel Prize is given a certificate saying that he has been given the prize. The third part of the prize is a large amount of money-about 40,000. Often a prize is given to just one person, but not always. Sometimes a prize is shared. It may be given to two or more people who have worked together. It is also sometimes true that a prize is not given at all if there is no great achievement.

Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it. Question: What is likely true about the politics regarding gun rights in the US? Options: A. not enough information B. Many individuals have varying opinions regarding what should be done about the shootings in the US. C. It is heavily divided and contended among citizens and politicians. D. Most of the citizens that own guns feel threatened about the notion of new laws calling for gun control. A:","completion":"C.

No one matched winning numbers in Wednesday night's Powerball drawing. Largest jackpot in U.S. history was 656 million in Mega Millions game in 2012. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Powerball Jackpot Soars to 600 Million, Nearing Record-Breaking U.S. Lottery Prize Introduction: The Powerball jackpot has risen steeply in recent days, now reaching a staggering 600 million due to no one matching the winning numbers in Wednesday night's drawing. With a cash value of 377 million, this jackpot has tickled the fancy of not only regular Powerball players but also those who rarely take part in this chance-based game. As the prize pool grows, it nears the record-breaking jackpot set by the Mega Millions game back in 2012 at 656 million. Why this matters: (Reason: Inform the public about the substantial jackpot available) The significant increase in the Powerball jackpot has gained much public attention, as it offers a life-changing sum for those who choose to participate. With such a tremendous prize at stake, even the most casual lottery players find themselves enticed by the possibility of winning the vast fortune. As the jackpot continues to grow, more people are expected to join in on the chance to win. Comparing the two jackpots: (Reason: Put the current jackpot into context) As the Powerball prize pool edges closer to the record-breaking 656 million Mega Millions jackpot from 2012, it is worth considering how the two games compare. While the Mega Millions jackpot earned the title of the largest jackpot in U.S. history, the current Powerball jackpot shows potential to surpass this milestone if no winners emerge in the upcoming draws. Odds of winning: (Reason: Guide the audience to understand their chances of winning the jackpot) While the impressive jackpot may be enough to sway some people to buy a few extra tickets, it is crucial to remember the odds of winning the grand prize. According to Powerball, the chances of winning the jackpot stand at 1 in 292.2 million. Although the odds may be slim, the anticipation and possibility of a life-altering win often outweigh the low chances of success for many people. Conclusion: (Reason: Summarize the article and encourage readers to participate if they wish) As the Powerball jackpot surges to a remarkable 600 million, the excitement and buzz around this lottery game continue to grow. While the odds may be long, the dream of winning such wealth keeps players coming back for their chance at a life-changing experience. As the jackpot nears record-breaking status, it remains to be seen if a lucky winner will emerge or if the prize will continue to soar to even greater heights."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Three people inside the helicopter and five people inside The Clutha were killed after the Police Scotland aircraft came down at 22:30 on Friday. A further 14 people are being treated for \\"very serious injuries\\" in hospitals across the city. A major investigation is under way and the Air Accidents Investigations Branch will conduct an inquiry into the crash. Dr Jennifer Armstrong, medical director at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, said that of the 32 people taken to local hospitals after the crash, 18 had now been treated and discharged. She confirmed that 14 people were still being treated for serious injuries. \\"The main injuries we have seen include chest injuries, head injuries, long-bone fractures and lacerations,\\" she said. It is thought that about 120 people were in the pub at the time of the crash. Many were rescued or escaped but others were trapped by a collapse on the left-hand side of the building. The three occupants of the helicopter who died were two police officers and a civilian pilot. A significant number of personnel from Police Scotland, The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and Scottish Ambulance Service are still at the scene.

The King Street car park next to the scene is full of cars, and buses are passing just 100 yards from the cordon. There is no debris on our side of the cordon - it's hard to believe what has happened just a few yards away. We can see the blue and green tarpaulins on top of the roof of the pub, but there is no activity on that roof. On our side of the cordons, a pack of around 40 journalists and photographers are taking statements from eyewitnesses and waiting for news. He said: \\"This is a complex and ongoing rescue operation.

He paid tribute to the emergency service personnel who were working at the scene and the people of Glasgow who disregarded their own personal safety to help survivors in the aftermath of the crash. Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the same news conference that the increased death toll from the crash was \\"news that everybody today has been both dreading and expecting\\". \\"Our hearts go out to everyone who has been bereaved. It is impossible to imagine the grief and loss that they are experiencing,\\" she said. \\"They should know that the thoughts and prayers of everyone across the city, and indeed across Scotland, are with them at this unimaginably difficult time. Ms Sturgeon also praised the courage and fortitude of the emergency services and people of Glasgow in the aftermath of the crash.

Some societies, such as America and Australia for example, are mobile and very open. People here change jobs and move house quite often. As a result, they have a lot of relationships that often last only a short time, and they need to get to know people quickly. So it's normal to have friendly conversations with people that they have just met, and you can talk about things that other cultures would regard as personal. On the other hand there are more crowded and less mobile societies where long-term relationships are more important. A Malaysian or Mexican business person, for example, will want to get to know you very well before he or she feels happy to start business. But when you do get to know each other, the relationship becomes much deeper than it would in a mobile society. To Americans, both Europeans and Asians seem cool and formal at first. On the other hand, as a passenger from a less mobile society puts it, it's no fun spending several hours next to a stranger who wants to tell you all about his or her life and asks you all sorts of questions that you don't want to answer.

Question: what order was amended and superseded by Executive order 11246? Context: Ideas for affirmative action came as early as the Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) in which a former slave population lacked the skills and resources for sustainable living. In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the \\"Forty acres and a mule\\" policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term \\"affirmative action\\" in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors \\"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\\" This executive order realized the government's intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people. This executive order was eventually amended and superseded by Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order 11246 which prevented discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin by organizations which received federal contracts and subcontracts. In 1967, the order was amended to include sex as well. The Reagan administration was opposed to the affirmative action requirements of Executive Order 11246, but these contemplated changes[which?] faced bi-partisan opposition in Congress.

Write some highlights for the following article: Manuel Neuer is the ultimate 'sweeper-keeper' and now seems to want to spend more time outside his area than inside it. Germany's No 1 could be found nearer the halfway line during Bayern Munich's 0-0 draw with Hamburg on Saturday. As the match neared its conclusion, Neuer came to clear a loose ball but instead of hacking it away he took on not one but two opponents. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Manuel Neuer make a save near the half-way line on Saturday. Manuel Neuer's loose touch left him scrambling against Julian Green, forcing the keeper to make a save. Unfortunately for Neuer, the incident happened outside the box, and he received a yellow card. He rounded the first, but came unstuck when a loose touch left him scrambling to reach the ball before the second opposition. He didn't get there in time, and goalkeeping instincts came to the fore as Neuer got down low and stopped the ball with an outstretched arm. Luckily for him and Bayern, he was only given a yellow card, and the match finished 0-0. His reputation as a 'sweeper-keeper' was cemented during the World Cup after his display against Algeria. He regularly found himself sprinting off his line to clear and was ultimately the difference as Germany won 2-1 on their way to lifting the trophy. Neuer reacts after a disappointing 0-0 draw with Hamburg in the Bundesliga on Saturday. A loose touch from the Germany No 1 gifted Hamburg an opportunity. Hamburg players react instantly as the ball strikes Neuer's hand, well outside his 18-yard box.

At one point, he had to run really fast to reach the ball before some other players. He used his hands to stop the ball but was not allowed to do that outside his goal box, so he got a yellow card, which is like a warning. The game ended in a tie, with no goals from either team.

Summarize: While your popcorn garland might seem like the finishing touch to your Christmas tree, it’s actually easier to hang it when there aren’t ornaments in the way. You should add your lights before the garland, though. The best way to hang popcorn strings on your tree is to softly drape them over the branches rather than firmly stuffing them in gaps. Start at the top and carefully work your way down. For a formal look, make sure to drape your popcorn strings in even, uniform loops. For a more casual look, allow the popcorn strings to drape unevenly. If you want your popcorn garland to stand out on your tree, consider doubling up the strings and draping them together over the branches. Once the popcorn strings are in place, you can hang your ornaments on the tree. However, you should take care when placing them among the garlands because you don’t want any large, heavy ornaments to rest on the popcorn and possibly break it.","completion":"To hang a popcorn garland on your Christmas tree effectively, it's important to follow a specific order and technique. Begin by installing the lights on the tree before adding the garland, as this will prevent any interference with the delicate popcorn strings later on. To ensure the most aesthetically pleasing result, focus on gently draping the popcorn strings over the tree's branches opposed to forceful stuffing into gaps. Start from the top of the tree and methodically progress downwards, taking care to preserve the popcorn's shape and integrity. Depending on your desired look, you can either create a formal or casual aesthetic. For a formal appearance, arrange the popcorn strings into even, uniform loops across the branches. Alternatively, for a more relaxed and informal design, let the popcorn strings drape unevenly and more organically. If you'd like the popcorn garland to be more prominent on your tree, consider doubling up the strings so that they appear thicker and more noticeable when draped on the branches. After you've carefully positioned the popcorn strings, you can then move on to hanging your ornaments. However, it's crucial to be cautious when adding ornaments near the garlands, as heavy or large ornaments may cause damage to the popcorn if they rest directly on it. By following these steps, you will achieve a beautiful Christmas tree adorned with an exquisite popcorn garland that adds a charming, festive touch to your holiday decorations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Which brother studied more about how rocks usually move several centimeters? Hint: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).

Article: STOCKHOLM - Mo Yan, the 2012 Nobel Prize winner for literature, said on Friday that diversity in global cultures makes human beings' cultural life interesting. Mo told a reception in the Chinese Embassy in Stockholm that it was a responsibility to protect the diversity in cultures while creating the diversity as well. He said that translation played a very important role in bridging different cultures, adding that without the translators who had translated his books he couldn't have won the Nobel Prize. \\"I think translation is much harder than writing itself,\\" said Mo Yan, explaining that it only took 43 days to write the work Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out, while it took Swedish sinologist Anna Gustafsson Chen six years to translate the work. Earlier in the day he visited a Swedish middle school, where about 20 Swedish students who were studying Chinese welcomed him by singing the theme song in the movie \\"Red Sorghum\\" which was based on his novel of the same name. \\"Unlike the rough and husky voice in the movie, the Swedish students presented the song with a gentle and soft voice, making it rather a romantic song,\\" Mo told the gathering at the Chinese Embassy. He said he hoped that there were going to be some outstanding translators among the students, adding that meeting them made him \\"extraordinarily happy.\\" He said language was going to be \\"the most reliable way\\" for interaction between peoples because one had to know the language of a nation to understand the people's inner world and spiritual life. Lan Lijun, Chinese Ambassador to Sweden, said that Chinese literature had stepped into the spotlight worldwide after Mo Yan had won the Nobel Prize, which would help contribute to the literature communication and dialogue between China and the rest of the world. People in Sweden and other parts of the world were all welcome to know more about Chinese culture, he added.

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The formes fixes ( singular forme fixe , \`\` fixed form '' ) are the three fourteenth - and fifteenth - centuries French poetic forms : the ballade , rondeau and virelai . Each was also a musical form , generally a chanson , and all consisted of a complex pattern of repetition of verses and a refrain with musical content in two main sections . All three forms can be found in thirteenth - century sources but a fifteenth - century source gives Philippe de Vitry as their first composer while the first comprehensive repertory of these forms was written by Guillaume de Machaut . The formes fixes stopped being used in music around the end of the fifteenth century , although their influence continued ( in poetry they , especially the rondeau , continued to be used ) . Sometimes forms from other countries and periods are referred to as formes fixes . These include the Italian fourteenth century madrigal and later ballata and barzelletta , the German bar form , Spanish 13th century cantiga , and the later canción , and villancico . - A chanson (\\"song\\", from Latin \\"cantio\\", gen. \\"cantionis\\") is in general any lyric-driven French song, usually polyphonic and secular. A singer specializing in chansons is known as a \\"chanteur\\" (male) or \\"chanteuse\\" (female); a collection of chansons, especially from the late Middle Ages and Renaissance, is also known as a chansonnier. - Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, \\"poiesis\\", \\"making\\") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of languagesuch as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metreto evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - A refrain (from Vulgar Latin \\"refringere\\", \\"to repeat\\", and later from Old French \\"refraindre\\") is the line or lines that are repeated in music or in verse; the \\"chorus\\" of a song. Poetic fixed forms that feature refrains include the \\"villanelle\\", the \\"virelay\\", and the \\"sestina\\". - The Late Middle Ages or Late Medieval Period was the period of European history generally comprising the 14th and 15th centuries (c. 13011500). The Late Middle Ages followed the High Middle Ages and preceded the onset of the early modern era (and, in much of Europe, the Renaissance). - A sestina (Old Occitan: \\"cledisat\\" ; also known as \\"sestine\\", \\"sextine\\", \\"sextain\\") is a fixed verse form consisting of six stanzas of six lines each, normally followed by a three-line envoi. The words that end each line of the first stanza are used as line endings in each of the following stanzas, rotated in a set pattern. - Vulgar Latin or Sermo Vulgaris (\\"common speech\\") is a generic term for the \\"nonstandard\\" (as opposed to \\"classical\\") sociolects of Latin from which the Romance languages developed. Works written in Latin during classical times used Classical Latin rather than Vulgar Latin, with very few exceptions (most notably sections of Gaius Petronius' \\"Satyricon\\"). Because of its nonstandard nature, Vulgar Latin had no official orthography. Vulgar Latin is sometimes also called colloquial Latin, or Common Romance (particularly in the late stage). In Renaissance Latin, Vulgar Latin was called \\"vulgare Latinum\\" or \\"Latinum vulgare.\\" - Old French (', ', \\"\\"; Modern French ) was the Gallo-Romance dialect continuum spoken from the 9th century to the 14th century. In the 14th century, these dialects came to be collectively known as the \\"langues d'oïl\\", contrasting with the \\"langue d'oc\\" or Occitan language in the south of France. The mid-14th century is taken as the transitional period to Middle French, the language of the French Renaissance, specifically based on the dialect of the Île-de-France region. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - A song, most broadly, is a single (and often standalone) work of music that is typically intended to be sung by the human voice with distinct and fixed pitches and patterns using sound and silence and a variety of forms that often include the repetition of sections. Written words created specifically for music or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs in a simple style that are learned informally are often referred to as folk songs. Songs that are composed for professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs. These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers and lyricists. Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are performed live and recorded on audio or video (or in some, cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded). Songs may also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and within operas. - A chansonnier (, Galician and , ) is a manuscript or printed book which contains a collection of chansons, or polyphonic and monophonic settings of songs, hence literally \\"song-books,\\" although some manuscripts are so called even though they preserve the text but not the music (for example, the Cancioneiro da Vaticana and Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional, which contain the bulk of Galician-Portuguese lyric). The most important chansonniers contain lyrics, poems and songs of the troubadours and trouvères of the Middle Ages. Prior to 1420, many song-books contained both sacred and secular music, one exception being those containing the work of Guillaume de Machaut. Around 1420, sacred and secular music was segregated into separate sources, with large choirbooks containing sacred music, and smaller chansonniers for more private use by the privileged. Chansonniers were compiled primarily in France, but also in Italy, Germany and in the Iberian peninsula. - A villanelle (also known as \\"villanesque\\") is a nineteen-line poetic form consisting of five tercets followed by a quatrain. There are two refrains and two repeating rhymes, with the first and third line of the first tercet repeated alternately until the last stanza, which includes both repeated lines. The villanelle is an example of a fixed verse form. The word derives from Latin, then Italian, and is related to the initial subject of the form being the pastoral. - The Renaissance was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history. It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe, marking the beginning of the Early Modern Age. - A virelai is a form of medieval French verse used often in poetry and music. It is one of the three \\"formes fixes\\" (the others were the ballade and the rondeau) and was one of the most common verse forms set to music in Europe from the late thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries. After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'formes fixes' with the relationship of 'subclass of'. Choices: - age - alphabet - ancient greek - art - articulation - branch - bridge - classical music - collection - color - composer - continent - criticism - dialect - examination - feature - female - forme fixe - french - general - greek - history - human - instrumental - language - latin - latin alphabet - line - literature - male - manuscript - music - musical - occitan - ocean - official - orthography - peninsula - pitch - poem - poetry - point - portuguese - production - professional - renaissance - river - sea - singer - singing - single - song - sound - spread - style - symbolism - tempo - term - text - third - word Answer:","completion":"The entity that related to 'formes fixes' with the relationship of 'subclass of' is 'poetry'. Formes fixes, including the ballade, the rondeau, and the virelai, are types or subclasses of medieval French poetry. Each of these forms was characterized by specific rules concerning the structure of stanzas and the repetition of verses or refrains, reflecting the broader definitions and characteristics of poetry as a genre of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language to evoke meanings. Poetry features a significant variety of forms and styles, of which formes fixes are a particular category or subclass, noted for their historical development during the 14th and 15th centuries in France."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Gary Mulholland of The Observer considers the release of Is This It a \\"world-changing moment\\" and notes that its impact was \\"immediate and dramatic\\" on both music and attire. BBC Radio 1's Zane Lowe suggests that the album moved popular opinion from DJs and pop music to \\"skinny jeans and guitars\\", \\"the template for rock 'n' roll in the modern day\\". Tam Gunn of FACT agrees and explains that it \\"caused a sea change\\" in mainstream music in the US and the UK, while Anthony Miccio of Stylus points out that the Strokes' success created the commercial context for \\"other new-wavers\\" to flourish. Rolling Stone writes that Is This It inspired \\"a ragged revolt\\" in Britain, led by the Libertines and Arctic Monkeys, and continued its influence in the US on the success of bands like Kings of Leon. The Observer shares a similar view and concludes that \\"a fine brood of heirs\\", like the Libertines and Franz Ferdinand, would not have existed and been successful if the Strokes had not reinvigorated \\"rock's obsession with having a good time\\". Jared Followill of Kings of Leon notes that the album was one of the main reasons that he wanted to get into a band; he states, \\"The title track was one of the first basslines I learned ...

They cannot travel through empty space. This was demonstrated in the 1600s by a scientist named Robert Boyle. Boyle placed a ticking clock in a sealed glass jar. The clock could be heard ticking through the air and glass of the jar. Then Boyle pumped the air out of the jar. The clock was still running, but the ticking could not be heard. Thats because the sound couldnt travel without air particles to transfer the sound energy. Is there any other place where sound cannot be heard? Here is a hint: is there any other place that does not have air molecules? Thats right, in space sound cannot be transferred. So can astronauts hear each other? Yes, they can, because they are in enclosed space stations or pressurized suits.In both cases, they are surrounded by air molecules.

As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775. - The United States Air Force (USAF) is the aerial warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven American uniformed services. Initially part of the United States Army, the USAF was formed as a separate branch of the military on 18 September 1947 under the National Security Act of 1947. It is the most recent branch of the U.S. military to be formed, and is the largest and one of the world's most technologically advanced air forces. The USAF articulates its core functions as Nuclear Deterrence Operations, Special Operations, Air Superiority, Global Integrated ISR, Space Superiority, Command and Control, Cyberspace Superiority, Personnel Recovery, Global Precision Attack, Building Partnerships, Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support. - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - The National Security Act of 1947 was a major restructuring of the United States government's military and intelligence agencies following World War II. The majority of the provisions of the Act took effect on September 18, 1947, the day after the Senate confirmed James Forrestal as the first Secretary of Defense. After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'ivor parry evans' exhibits the relationship of 'conflict'. Find the answer from the choices below. Choices: - american civil war - american revolutionary war - cold war - first barbary war - second barbary war - world war ii Answer:","completion":"Ivor Parry Evans was a United States Air Force officer and commander. The United States Air Force (USAF) was formed as a separate branch of the military on 18 September 1947 under the National Security Act of 1947.

No. The text specifically mentions that the events of Chapter 16 took place on a Friday, not a Sunday. Thus, we can infer that the statement provided is incorrect. It is not possible to infer that Chapter 16 starts by describing the events that took place on a Sunday because the text clearly states \\"Friday was a comfortable day in the household of King.\\" Furthermore, the events of this chapter seem to revolve around storytelling by the Story Girl, and the overall good humor in the King household. The range of stories mentioned, from Eastern myth to anecdotes of Carlisle workaday folks, suggest an atmosphere of imagination, conviviality, and familial interaction. Nonetheless, the day on which these events occur is distinctly stated as Friday. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty in the time reference provided in the text. Consequently, the notion that they happened on a Sunday is not supported or inferred from the information provided in the text. The text does not provide information on whether similar events occur on a Sunday or any other day of the week, therefore it is not possible to make assumptions or inferences outside of this specified day.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: yeah i didn't realize that Hypothesis: I finally realized it just now. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"To analyze whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we first need to understand the context and meaning of both statements. Let's break them down and examine them closely. Premise: \\"Yeah, I didn't realize that.\\" In this statement, the speaker acknowledges that they were unaware of a particular piece of information or a fact. They may or may not indicate when they became aware of it, but it is clear that they realized their lack of knowledge at some point. Hypothesis: \\"I finally realized it just now.\\" This statement refers to the speaker's gaining of insight or awareness about the previously unknown fact. They specify that the realization happened at the present moment (\\"just now\\"). The use of \\"finally\\" suggests that this realization may have been expected to happen eventually or that the person might have struggled with understanding the information before. Now, let's examine whether the premise entails the hypothesis. An argument's premise entails its conclusion if the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion, making it impossible for the premise to be true without the conclusion also being true. In this case, the premise acknowledges the speaker's past state of being unaware of a fact, while the hypothesis focuses on the present moment and the actual realization of that fact. The two statements are related but do not guarantee the truth of each other. It is theoretically possible for the person to have been unaware of the information (premise) but not necessarily have the realization at the specific moment indicated in the hypothesis. However, there is a close relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and both statements suggest that the speaker has experienced a change in their understanding. The premise may not strictly entail the hypothesis, but the hypothesis can be conceived as a logical progression based on the premise. The speaker's prior lack of understanding (premise) could naturally lead to the moment of realization (hypothesis), especially when considering additional context, such as a conversation or experience that helped this realization to occur. In conclusion, while the premise does not strictly entail the hypothesis, there is a logical progression from one statement to the other. The relationship between the two statements makes it reasonable to believe that the speaker once did not understand the fact but has since come to understand it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Every chemical reaction occurs with a concurrent change in what?

Step 1: Understand the question The question is asking for the common factor that changes during a chemical reaction, and provides four choices. Step 2: Analyze each choice - Neutrons: Neutrons are subatomic particles in the nucleus of atoms, and chemical reactions involve electrons and breaking/making of chemical bonds. Therefore, change in the number of neutrons is not relevant in a chemical reaction. - Mass: The mass doesn't change in a chemical reaction, as the Law of Conservation of Mass states that mass is conserved during a chemical reaction. - Hydrogen: While hydrogen may be involved in some chemical reactions, it is not always present in every reaction. - Energy: During chemical reactions, energy is either released (exothermic reaction) or absorbed (endothermic reaction) as bonds are broken and new ones are formed. Step 3: Choose the correct answer Based on the analysis, energy is the concurrent change in every chemical reaction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Would \\"Farmington Hills consistently ranks as one of the safest cities in the United States , as well as in the state of Michigan.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","completion":"Farmington Hills, MI is located in Oakland County. Regarding whether \\"Farmington Hills consistently ranks as one of the safest cities in the United States, as well as in the state of Michigan\\" is a reasonable answer, it depends on the context. If the question is focused on the safety aspect of Farmington Hills, this statement can be a part of the response. It is important, however, to provide sources or statistical data to support the claim. Farmington Hills indeed has a reputation for being a safe city. Factors contributing to this distinction include the city's low crime rates, good education system, and efforts by local law enforcement to maintain order and security. Additionally, the strong sense of community, well-maintained infrastructure, and numerous recreational options make the city an attractive place to live. The Farmington Hills Police Department adheres to the community policing philosophy, engaging in proactive measures to prevent crime and resolve public safety concerns. Officers work closely with local organizations, businesses, schools, and community members to foster a safe environment. In recent years, various surveys and reports have highlighted the safety of Farmington Hills. For example, SafeWise, a home safety and security resource, ranked the city among the top 25 safest cities in Michigan in its annual report. Other sources, such as AreaVibes, have also given Farmington Hills high safety ratings based on factors like crime rates and police presence. Education plays a key role in the perception of Farmington Hills' safety. The city is part of the award-winning Farmington Public Schools district, which provides quality education and numerous resources for students and their families. The dedication to education within the community can contribute to lower crime rates and a sense of stability. Furthermore, Farmington Hills has a wealth of recreational facilities and community centers that promote a healthy and active lifestyle. These facilities include parks, trails, golf courses, public pools, ice arenas, and more. The availability of resources for residents to engage in leisure activities and build community bonds has a positive impact on the overall safety and well-being of the city. In conclusion, the statement claiming that Farmington Hills consistently ranks as one of the safest cities in the United States and in Michigan has merit. However, to make the answer more substantial, it is crucial to support the statement with reliable sources or statistical data, especially when addressing specific safety concerns or factors contributing to the city's safety reputation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Is the premise \\"Two sumo wrestlers wrestling in a sand ring.\\" true if \\"There is a international sumo match going on.\\"?","completion":"The premise \\"Two sumo wrestlers wrestling in a sand ring\\" cannot be directly confirmed or disproved solely based on the information \\"There is an international sumo match going on.\\" Here's why: 1. Sumo Wrestling and its Environment: Traditional sumo wrestling, a competitive full-contact wrestling sport that originated in Japan, typically takes place in a circular ring known as a \\"dohyo.\\" The ring is not made of sand, but instead of clay and covered in a layer of sand. 2. International Sumo Matches: If there is an international sumo match going on, it would logically follow that there are at least two sumo wrestlers wrestling each other. However, details about the specific environment or ring in which they are wrestling are not provided in the statement. 3. Sand Ring: Sumo wrestling traditionally occurs in a dohyo, not a \\"sand ring.\\" Thus, the premise \\"Two sumo wrestlers wrestling in a sand ring\\" seems to deviate from the norms of traditional sumo wrestling. However, this doesn't mean it's impossible. Untraditional matches could take place in a sand ring, though this would be unusual and is not suggested by the information given. In conclusion, though it is plausible that two sumo wrestlers could wrestle in a sand ring (perhaps under special or nontraditional circumstances), it is not possible to verify or falsify this purely from the information that an international sumo match is taking place. More specific data about the location and conditions of the match would be required. Furthermore, considering the traditional norms of sumo wrestling which use a dohyo instead of a simple sand ring, the original premise seems unlikely in the context of a formal international sumo match."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Off the coast of which county would you find the 'Goodwin Sands'????","completion":"The Goodwin Sands is a 10-mile-long sandbank located off the coast of Kent, a county in southeastern England. It lies about six miles east of the town of Deal and is situated in the English Channel, which separates the United Kingdom from continental Europe. This submerged sandbank has caused numerous shipwrecks throughout history due to its notorious and treacherous nature. Formed by the deposition of sediment carried by river channels and tidal currents, Goodwin Sands serves as a crucial natural habitat for many marine species. It is home to an array of fauna like seals, crustaceans, mollusks, and different fish species. Additionally, the sandbank significantly contributes to the coastal defense of Kent. The sands help break up incoming waves that would otherwise erode the coastline along Deal, Ramsgate, and Kingsdown. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) operates a lifeboat station in Ramsgate, as the ever-shifting sands make navigation in the area dangerous, especially for inexperienced sailors. The Goodwin Sands have been claimed to be one of the \\"shipwreck capitals\\" of the world, with over 2,000 shipwrecks documented across the centuries. Aside from its environmental and maritime significance, Goodwin Sands has an interesting history. From the 13th century, the sandbank was mentioned in tales of folklore, including the legend of the lost city of Lomea, which is believed to have been swallowed by the sands. Goodwins also played a role in major conflicts, such as the Battle of Goodwin Sands in 1652 during the First Anglo-Dutch War. Moreover, it served as a hiding spot for British submarines in World War II and a graveyard for several downed military aircraft. Overall, the Goodwin Sands sandbank, off the coast of Kent County in southeastern England, constitutes an essential ecological site and historically significant location. It is a noteworthy feature of the English Channel that continues to draw attention for its perilous disposition and rich maritime history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Since it is not specified what type of deadline was missed in the article, I will provide a general overview of potential outcomes. 1. Missed Opportunities: One of the most immediate effects of missing a deadline is the potential loss of opportunities related to the task or project. This might mean missing out on business deals, job offers, or collaborations that could have arisen if the deadline was met. 2. Damage to Reputation: Constantly missing deadlines could lead to a negative perception of the person's work ethic, professionalism, and reliability. Such a damaged reputation may result in difficulty securing new jobs and projects, or maintaining professional relationships. 3. Strained Relationships: Whether the deadline involved personal commitments or professional collaboration, missing deadlines can strain relationships with colleagues, friends, or family members who were relying on the individual to meet their commitments. This strain may lead to long-term damage or loss of trust. 4. Additional Stress and Workload: Missing a deadline often means having to put in extra hours to catch up on the missed task, along with handling other tasks that continue to come in. The additional workload could lead to increased stress and burnout. 5. Financial Consequences: In some cases, missing a deadline could result in financial penalties, such as late fees or having to pay compensation to other parties who were affected by the delays. 6. Lowered Productivity: When a deadline is missed, it may cause other tasks and projects to be delayed, potentially creating a domino effect on productivity. This negatively affects the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the individual or team involved. To cope with and recover from missing a deadline, the person should take immediate and appropriate actions such as: 1. Communicate with those affected: It is crucial to notify the relevant stakeholders about the missed deadline and explain the reasons behind it. This shows a sense of responsibility and can help maintain trust. 2. Develop a plan to catch up: The person should create a recovery plan with revised deadlines and priorities. This will help ensure timely completion of the delayed task as well as upcoming tasks. 3. Learn from the experience: Analyze why the deadline was missed (e.g., poor time management, overcommitment, or procrastination) and develop strategies to avoid similar issues in the future. 4. Make amends: Depending on the nature of the deadline, offering an apology or compensating for any consequences due to the delay may help maintain the relationships involved. 5. Establish a more realistic timeline in the future: When committing to future deadlines, it is essential to consider the lessons learned from the missed deadline and set more achievable goals. In conclusion, missing a deadline can lead to various negative outcomes, including missed opportunities, a damaged reputation, strained relationships, additional workload, financial penalties, and lowered productivity. To minimize these consequences, the individual should communicate with the relevant parties, create a plan to catch up, learn from the experience, make amends where necessary, and establish more realistic deadlines in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Food picked up just a few seconds after being dropped is less likely to contain bacteria than if it is left for longer periods of time, according to the findings of research carried out at Aston University's School of Life and Health Sciences. The findings suggest there may be some scientific basis to the \\"5 second rule\\" --- the belief about it being fine to eat food that has only had contact with the floor for five seconds or less. Although people have long followed the 5 second rule, until now it was unclear whether it actually helped. The study, undertaken by final year Biology students and led by Anthony Hilton, Professor of Microbiology at Aston University, monitored the transfer of the common bacteria from a variety of indoor flooring types (carpet, cement floor etc.) to toast, pasta, a biscuit and a sticky sweet when contact was made from 3 to 30 seconds. The results showed that: Time is a significant factor in the transfer of bacteria from a floor surface to a piece of food; and the type of flooring the food has been dropped on has an effect, with bacteria least likely to transfer from carpeted surfaces and most likely to transfer from cement flooring surfaces to moist foods making contact for more than 5 seconds. Professor Hilton said: \\"Consuming food dropped on the floor still carries an infection risk as it very much depends on which bacteria are present on the floor at the time.\\" The Aston team also carried out a survey of the number of people who employ the 5 second rule. The survey showed that: 87% of people surveyed said they would eat food dropped on the floor, or already have done so. 55% of those who would eat or have eaten food dropped on the floor are women. 81% of the women who would eat food from the floor would follow the 5 second rule. Professor Hilton added, \\"Our study showed that a surprisingly large majority of people are happy to consume dropped food, with women the most likely to do so. But they are also more likely to follow the 5 second rule.\\" Options: A time B space C contrast D example Answer: C contrast Question: The answer is:","completion":"C contrast Question: According to the study carried out at Aston University's School of Life and Health Sciences, which factor significantly affects the transfer of bacteria from floor surfaces to food when dropped?

Remy gave candy to their friends when they were at their house. Given the context: What will Remy want to do next? Possible answers: have fun, ask about their friends, Hard to understand Answer:","completion":"Based on the given context, it can be concluded that Remy has a friendly and generous personality since they are giving candy to their friends. Although it is hard to predict exactly what Remy wants to do next, we can deduce the most probable course of action based on their behavior and potential social scenarios. One possibility is that Remy aims to have fun with their friends. Sharing candy could be Remy's way of initiating a social gathering or a casual hangout. Remy might want to engage in conversation, play games, watch a movie, or partake in other enjoyable activities with their friends. Bonding over shared experiences strengthens relationships and creates lasting memories. Thus, having fun could be Remy's primary objective in this situation. Another plausible scenario is that Remy wants to show genuine interest and concern for their friends by asking about their lives, problems, and achievements. This act of caring can reinforce their relationships and foster a sense of camaraderie. Remy might inquire about their friends' work, studies, hobbies, or family life, or converse about recent experiences and future plans. By being an attentive listener and offering support or advice, Remy can convey empathy and nurture their friendships. Additionally, Remy's next course of action might not be explicitly stated in the given context. It could be a combination of both having fun and asking about their friends. It is also possible that Remy has a specific reason for the candy-sharing gesture, such as celebrating an achievement or commemorating a special occasion. In such cases, their subsequent actions would be aligned with the event's purpose. In conclusion, while it is challenging to pinpoint Remy's precise intentions, we can infer that their next actions are likely motivated by a desire to bond with their friends and create an enjoyable atmosphere. Therefore, engaging in fun activities and showing concern for their friends are the most probable outcomes based on the given context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the title of this article: After the consulship had been opened to the plebeians, the plebeians were able to hold both the dictatorship and the censorship. Plebiscites of 342 BC placed limits on political offices; an individual could hold only one office at a time, and ten years must elapse between the end of his official term and his re-election. Further laws attempted to relieve the burden of debt from plebeians by banning interest on loans. In 337 BC, the first plebeian praetor was elected. During these years, the tribunes and the senators grew increasingly close. The senate realised the need to use plebeian officials to accomplish desired goals. To win over the tribunes, the senators gave the tribunes a great deal of power and the tribunes began to feel obligated to the senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators were often able to secure the tribunate for members of their own families. In time, the tribunate became a stepping stone to higher office.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Gary, a high school student, is supposed to be studying two different cells under a microscope during his biology class. Gary doesn't like biology class at all though and can't find the motivation to look at the cells in detail. In his homework where students are supposed to write what they observed, Gary simply wrote down the first thing he saw under the microscope which was that Cell A is larger than cell B. It won't get him a great grade, but Gary is hoping it will at least get him a pass on the assignment. But I can use this background: As a cell grows, its volume increases more quickly than its surface area. If a cell was to get very large, the small surface area would not allow enough nutrients to enter the cell quickly enough for the cell’s needs. This idea is explained in Figure below . However, large cells have a way of dealing with some size challenges. Big cells, such as some white blood cells, often grow more nuclei so that they can supply enough proteins and RNA for the cell’s requirements. Large, metabolically active cells often have lots of cell protrusions, resulting in many folds throughout the membrane. These folds increase the surface area available for transport of materials into or out of the cell. Such cell types are found lining your small intestine, where they absorb nutrients from your food through protrusions called microvilli . What is an answer for this question: Does Cell A or Cell B have more folds across the membrane? Answer:","completion":"To determine whether Cell A or Cell B has more folds across the membrane, we must first consider the available information and background knowledge provided in the situation. Gary, the high school student, only provided one observation: Cell A is larger than Cell B. While this information is limited, we can use the background knowledge on cell growth, surface area, and the strategies cells employ to deal with size challenges to reason about which cell might have more folds across the membrane. As mentioned in the background information, as a cell grows, its volume increases more quickly than its surface area. As a result, large cells may not have a sufficient surface area to allow the efficient transport of nutrients and materials in and out of the cell. Therefore, large cells have developed adaptations to overcome this limitation, such as acquiring more nuclei or increasing the number of folds across the membrane. These folds, such as microvilli, can be found in highly active cells like those lining the small intestine. Considering this information, we can make an educated guess that the larger Cell A may have more folds across the membrane compared to the smaller Cell B. The reason is that larger cells, like Cell A, need to compensate for their limited surface area compared to their volume to maintain the efficient transport of nutrients and materials. This is achieved by increasing the number membrane folds, which increases the surface area for transport. It is important to note that it's impossible to provide a definitive answer based on the single observation from Gary that Cell A is larger than Cell B. A more detailed analysis of the cells under the microscope would need to be performed to accurately identify the number of membrane folds in each cell. However, with the limited information provided, our best-educated guess is that larger Cell A might have more membrane folds than Cell B as part of its adaptive strategies."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What is significant about birds??\\" is in \\"Ninety-five percent of bird species are socially monogamous. These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids. Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer is:","completion":"The significant aspect about birds mentioned in the passage is that 95% of bird species are socially monogamous.

Separate the eggs: First, crack your eggs and separate the egg whites from the yolks. Put the egg whites in one bowl and the yolks in another. 2. Beat the egg whites: Using a whisk or an electric mixer, beat the egg whites until they become foamy and form soft peaks. This will make the omelette spongier because the beaten egg whites will trap air, making the omelette fluffy. 3. Mix yolks, flour, and milk: In the bowl with the egg yolks, add a little bit of flour and some milk. Mix everything together until it is smooth. This mixture will make your omelette spongier because the flour will help it hold its shape and the milk will make it tender. 4. Combine the mixtures: Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the yolk, flour, and milk mixture. Be very careful not to overmix, as this could cause your omelette to be less spongy. 5. Cook the omelette: Heat a non-stick pan or a greased skillet over medium heat. Pour the mixture into the pan and cook the omelette until it's golden brown on both sides and cooked through.

Bob had a nice parcel of old growth forest, while the other farmer, named Bill , had a similar sized parcel covered in grasslands. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which farmer observed a greater buildup of calcium in the soil? Hint: Precipitation in grasslands is equal to or less than evapotranspiration and causes soil development to operate in relative drought. Leaching and migration of weathering products is therefore decreased. Large amounts of evaporation causes buildup of calcium (Ca) and other large cations flocculate clay minerals and fulvic acids in the upper soil profile. Impermeable clay limits downward percolation of water and fulvic acids, reducing chemical weathering and podzolization. The depth to the maximum concentration of clay increases in areas of increased precipitation and leaching. When leaching is decreased, the Ca precipitates as calcite (CaCO3) in the lower soil levels, a layer known as caliche.

Context: As a mother, I’m right now navigating the hardest moment with my two daughters and my son … I was raped at 15 and molested by a teacher from 15–16 … it took 13 years of fighting before I saw any justice for those crimes and it paled in comparison to having to live with that trauma for the last 25 years. I thought I had moved past it for the most part, thanks to supportive family and lots of counseling and medication to treat my treatment resistant depression I’ve struggled over the last 25 years. I will be 40 this year. My son, the oldest, turned 15 this year … the same age I was when it began. I see how young he is and recognized for the first time just how young I had been when I was abused. That was really hard for me, emotionally. Now, I look at my two girls, ages 9 and 3, and worry for their safety - probably more than I should, but understandable given what I went through. We have had lots of “body safety” talks and my older daughter understands the very basics of what I went through, mainly because I have spent a great part of this past year writing a memoir about my experiences and have begun speaking publicly about what I went through and what it means to be a survivor. This is challenging because it’s hard to talk about and explain to a child in a way that they understand without making them fear the world. I struggle with this often. I’ve chosen to use it as an opportunity to teach them about activism and the power of speaking the truth, what it means to be a survivor instead of a victim.

In Thailand , you do n't normally bring a present for the bride and groom . However , you can give some money . You put this in the same envelope that you received your invitation . This already has your name on it . Question: What may be the reason for giving a bride and groom money for their wedding ?","completion":"There are several reasons why giving a bride and groom money for their wedding is a common practice in Thailand, as well as in many other cultures around the world. Some of the reasons include the following: 1. Financial Assistance: Weddings can be an expensive endeavor, and providing monetary gifts can help the couple offset the costs associated with the event. This assistance can be especially meaningful in Thailand, where families might not have as much disposable income, and it can be seen as a way for guests to show their appreciation and support for the couple as they start their new life together. 2. Cultural Significance: In Thai culture, giving money at a wedding signifies the guest's respect and wishes for prosperity and good fortune for the couple. It is considered a blessing and symbolizes the transfer of positive energy and wealth from the guest to the newlyweds, as they embark on their journey together. 3. Flexibility: Money as a gift provides the couple with the flexibility to use it according to their needs and preferences. This can be particularly useful for newlywed couples setting up their new home or planning their honeymoon. Monetary gifts allow them to prioritize their spending on what matters the most to them, which may be different for each couple. 4. Convenience: For guests, giving money can be both convenient and practical, as they may not have the time or resources to find the perfect gift for the bride and groom. Additionally, it helps to eliminate the possibility of the couple receiving duplicate items, which they might have to return or exchange. 5. Traditional Rituals: In some instances, the giving of money during a Thai wedding can also be linked to specific ceremonial customs, such as the \\"Sinsod\\" or dowry that is given by the groom to the bride's family. This can involve a negotiation of a sum, and the money is then presented during the wedding ceremony as a symbol of the groom's commitment to care for his new wife and her family. In conclusion, giving money as a gift to the bride and groom in a Thai wedding reflects a combination of cultural significance, practicality, and a desire to contribute to the couple's financial stability as they start their married life together. It is embraced as a thoughtful and meaningful gesture by both the couple and their guests, demonstrating a deep connection and respect for the traditions and values that shape Thai marriages."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Manchu (Manchu: manjU; Mollendorff: manju; Abkai: manju; simplified Chinese: Man Zu ; traditional Chinese: Man Zu ; pinyin: Manzu; Wade-Giles: Man3-tsu2) are an ethnic minority in China and the people from whom Manchuria derives its name. They are sometimes called \\"red-tasseled Manchus\\", a reference to the ornamentation on traditional Manchu hats. The Later Jin (1616-1636), and Qing dynasty (1636-1912) were established by Manchus, who are descended from the Jurchen people who earlier established the Jin dynasty (1115-1234) in China. Manchus form the largest branch of the Tungusic peoples and are distributed throughout China, forming the fourth largest ethnic group in the country. The early phase of Manchu clothing succeeded from Jurchen tradition. White was the dominating color. To facilitate convenience during archery, the robe is the most common article of clothing for the Manchu people. Over the robe, a surcoat is usually worn, derived from the military uniform of Eight Banners army. During the Kangxi period, the surcoat gained popularity among commoners. The modern Chinese suits, the Cheongsam and Tangzhuang, are derived from the Manchu robe and surcoat which are commonly considered as \\"Chinese elements\\". Wearing hats is also a part of traditional Manchu culture, and Manchu people wear hats in all ages and seasons in contrast to the Han Chinese culture of \\"Starting to wear hats at 20 year-old\\" (Er Shi Shi Guan ), . Manchu hats are either formal or casual, formal hats being made in two different styles, straw for spring and summer, and fur for fall and winter. Casual hats are more commonly known as \\"Mandarin hats\\" in English. Manchus have many distinctive traditional accessories. Women traditionally wear three earrings on each ear, a tradition that is maintained by many older Manchu women. Males also traditionally wear piercings, but they tend to only have one earring in their youth and do not continue to wear it as adults. The Manchu people also have traditional jewelry which evokes their past as hunters. The fergetun (fergetUn), a thumb ring traditionally made out of reindeer bone, was worn to protect the thumbs of archers. After the establishment of the Qing dynasty in 1644, the fergetun gradually became simply a form of jewelry, with the most valuable ones made in jade and ivory.

According to the same biblical text, God denies David the opportunity to build the temple and his son, Absalom, tries to overthrow him. David flees Jerusalem during Absalom's rebellion, but after Absalom's death he returns to the city to rule Israel. Before his peaceful death, he chooses his son Solomon as his successor. He is mentioned in the prophetic literature as an ideal king and an ancestor of a future Messiah, and many psalms are ascribed to him. 1. What Gəˁəz: Dawit means? 2. Who was David? 3.

A: The answer is:","completion":"During diastole, the elastic walls of the arteries relax and expand. Diastole is the phase of the cardiac cycle when the heart relaxes and fills with blood. This relaxation occurs after the heart contracts or beats (called systole) to pump blood out to the body. When the ventricles of the heart are in the process of relaxation (diastole), blood pressure in the large arteries decreases. As a result, the elastic walls of the arteries expand to accommodate the reduced pressure and store the blood that was ejected during systole. This expansion of the artery walls helps to maintain a relatively constant blood flow and pressure throughout the arterial system. The elastic properties of the arteries play a crucial role in the circulation of blood by acting as a shock absorber and a reservoir to maintain blood pressure during the different phases of the cardiac cycle. This ensures that oxygen and nutrients continue to be delivered to the organs and tissues, even when the heart is in its resting phase."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options: - food - specialty store - christmas tree - department store - christmas stocking The answer is \\"christmas tree\\" because The answer is:","completion":"\\"christmas tree\\" because: Step 1: Analyze the given options and their relevance to the question. In this case, the question is about providing a great gift for a poor family in December, specifically aiming at providing decorations. The given options are food, specialty store, christmas tree, department store, and christmas stocking. Step 2: Eliminate irrelevant options. The first step is to eliminate options that do not directly fulfill the requirement of being a decoration. - Food: While food is essential for a family's survival especially in a time of need, it does not serve as a decoration for the festive season. - Specialty store and Department store: These are both places to buy items, not actual gifts or decorations themselves. Therefore, they can be eliminated. Step 3: Compare the remaining options. At this point, we have two options left - christmas tree and christmas stocking. - Christmas Tree: A Christmas tree is a universally recognized symbol of the December holiday season. It serves as a centerpiece for holiday decorations and offers a sense of festivity and joy. - Christmas Stocking: Although a Christmas stocking is also a part of holiday decorations, it is a much smaller item and may not have the same impact in transforming the atmosphere of the home as a Christmas tree would. Step 4: Choose the best option based on the comparisons. Based on the analysis of the remaining options, a \\"Christmas tree\\" would make the best gift for the poor family, as it is a more prominent decoration associated with December festivities and can significantly uplift the atmosphere of their home during the holiday season."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Both Seti II and Amenmesse have been suggested although the fact that that Siptah later changed his royal name or nomen to Merneptah Siptah after his Year 2 suggests rather than his father was Merneptah. If correct, this would make Siptah and Seti II half-brothers since both of them were sons of Merneptah. - A sarcophagus (plural, sarcophagi) is a box-like funeral receptacle for a corpse, most commonly carved in stone, and usually displayed above ground, though it may also be buried. The word \\"sarcophagus\\" comes from the Greek \\"sarx\\" meaning \\"flesh\\", and \\"phagein\\" meaning \\"to eat\\", hence \\"sarcophagus\\" means \\"flesh-eating\\"; from the phrase \\"lithos sarkophagos\\". Since \\"lithos\\" is Greek for \\"stone\\", \\"lithos sarcophagos\\" means, \\"flesh-eating stone\\". The word also came to refer to a particular kind of limestone that was thought to decompose the flesh of corpses trapped within it. - Not to be confused with Amun - her - khepeshef , a son of Ramesses II , and Amun - her - khepeshef , a son of Ramesses III.

She was the Great Royal Wife of Pharaoh Ramesses VI and mother of Pharaoh Ramesses VII, Princess Iset (God's Wife of Amun) and Princes Amenherkhepshef and Panebenkemyt. - Limestone is a sedimentary rock, composed mainly of skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as coral, forams and molluscs. Its major materials are the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO). - Ramesses VI Nebmaatre-Meryamun (also written Ramses and Rameses) was the fifth ruler of the Twentieth dynasty of Egypt who reigned from 1145 to 1137 BC and a son of Ramesses III by Iset Ta-Hemdjert. His royal tomb, KV9, is located near Tutankhamun's tomb in the Valley of the Kings. - Iset Ta-Hemdjert or Isis Ta-Hemdjert, simply called Isis in her tomb, was an Ancient Egyptian queen of the twentieth dynasty; the Great Royal Wife of Ramesses III and the Royal Mother of Ramesses VI. - Usermaatre Setepenre Meryamun Ramesses VII (also written Ramses and Rameses) was the sixth pharaoh of the 20th dynasty of Ancient Egypt.

If you want your first kiss to be special, then try picking the person you think would make it the most special. If you're worried that your kissing technique isn't all that great yet, then maybe choose someone you'd be less embarrassed about. (And stop worrying! Kissing is fun once you get the hang of it.) There's nothing like kissing a real, breathing human being. A person will respond to your lips like a hand or a fruit can't. Kissing comes naturally to humans. That's why we do it! Practicing kissing before you actually kiss is like practicing riding a bike on a seesaw. It doesn't really prepare you for the real deal. You get good at riding a bike by riding a bike, just like you get good at kissing by kissing another person. If you're a girl, you might just be able to go up to a guy and ask him if he wants to kiss. (Or you can develop a friendship with him and if it blossoms into something stronger, kiss him when you're close.) If you're a guy, your job is going to be a bit harder. Look for a good opportunity to kiss someone: Kiss someone you think is attracted to you. It's hard to know sometimes, but if you know that someone does or doesn't like you, use that information accordingly. Work up to a kiss. Work up to a kiss first by flirting. Touch the person's shoulder gently when you're talking to them; compliment an aspect of their eyes; or stare longingly into their eyes. Be physically close to the person. It'll be awkward if you're five feet away when you move in for a kiss. Get close to the person. Maybe even put your arm around their waist if all the signals you're getting say \\"yes!\\" You want your lips to be supple, soft, and smooth before you kiss. Balm your lips regularly before you kiss so that they're free of dry, flaky skin that can distract from the moment. Remember: Do not apply lip-gloss before you kiss. Lip-gloss can be sticky, glittery, and sweet. You don't want the sticky, your partner doesn't need the glittery, and you don't need the sweet. Your lips are sweet enough! Do not apply lipstick before you kiss. Lipstick may look smashing, but it's usually for older women. It can smudge when you kiss, leaving your kissing partner marked. If you have the luxury of brushing your teeth right before the kiss, take advantage of it. If not, take a breath mint. Avoid onions, garlic, and other strong-tasting foods right before you kiss. Send the signal for your partner to get ready for the kiss by getting really close. Almost uncomfortably close. If your partner moves back, she/he isn't ready for a kiss. If your partner stays where s/he is or moves even closer, you know you're doing something right. This one is important. Fix the other person's gaze with your eyes. The eyes are very powerful, and they can communicate a lot of things that we can't with our voice. When you move in for the kiss, turn your eyes to the person's mouth. You want your mouth to land on the other person's mouth, so you need your eyes if you don't want to botch the landing. Once your lips are interlocked, close your eyes. We don't know why, but it's kinda creepy to have someone staring at you while you kiss them. It's better just to close your eyes altogether. If you try to kiss your partner straight on, your noses are going to get in the way and keep you from actually meeting lips. Instead, tilt your head either to the left or the right slightly so that your noses don't disturb the action your lips want! If you're sitting next to a person, the side your sitting on should dictate which way you tilt your head: If you're sitting to the left of someone, it's best to tilt your head to the left. If you're sitting to the right of someone, it's best to tilt your head to the right. The first time you kiss, keep your lips locked for a couple seconds, unless the other person opens their lips and starts kissing quicker. If you let the first kiss last, you'll get rid of some butterflies and set the stage for the next couple of kisses. Not at the same time, of course. Start by taking your lips and softly kiss your partner's lower lip a few times. Then, move to their upper lip. Be gentle. Your partner will appreciate it, even if your heart is beating through your chest. Plus, it will make the kiss more sensual. Be responsive. Responsive just means respond to what the other person is doing. A kiss is like a dance: you have to move based on how your partner moves. Go for slow instead of fast. A bad kisser will try to rush the kiss, kissing at about a thousand lips per second. Slow it down, savor every last touch of the lips, and remember to keep your eyes closed! Not everyone is ready to start more intimate types of kissing at the same time. If you force a french kiss, you will probably embarrass yourself, and this could ruin your date, and the moment.","completion":"To have a special first kiss, choose the right person, practice good hygiene, get physically close, maintain eye contact, tilt your head, be gentle, and be responsive, while avoiding rushing into more intimate types of kissing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Some of Baird's early inventions were not fully successful. In his twenties he tried to create diamonds by heating graphite and shorted out Glasgow's electricity supply. Later Baird invented a glass razor, which was rust-resistant, but shattered. Inspired by pneumatic tyres he attempted to make pneumatic shoes, but his prototype contained semi-inflated balloons, which burst. He also invented a thermal undersock (the Baird undersock), which was moderately successful. Baird suffered from cold feet, and after a number of trials, he found that an extra layer of cotton inside the sock provided warmth. Baird's numerous other developments demonstrated his particular talent at invention. He was a visionary and began to dabble with electricity. In 1928, he developed an early video recording device, which he dubbed Phonovision. The system consisted of a large Nipkow disk attached by a mechanical linkage to a conventional 78-rpm record-cutting lathe. The result was a disc that could record and play back a 30-line video signal. Technical difficulties with the system prevented its further development, but some of the original phonodiscs have been preserved, and have since been restored by Donald McLean, a Scottish electrical engineer. Baird's other developments were in fibre-optics, radio direction finding, infrared night viewing and radar. There is discussion about his exact contribution to the development of radar, for his wartime defence projects have never been officially acknowledged by the UK government. According to Malcolm Baird, his son, what is known is that in 1926 Baird filed a patent for a device that formed images from reflected radio waves, a device remarkably similar to radar, and that he was in correspondence with the British government at the time. The radar contribution is in dispute. According to some experts, Baird's \\"noctovision\\" is not radar. Unlike radar (except Doppler radar), Noctovision is incapable of determining the distance to the scanned subject. Noctovision also cannot determine the coordinates of the subject in three-dimensional space.

Every now and then, we are gifted with a rare sighting of an animal that is simply extraordinary. One such example of nature's amazing surprises is the appearance of a white squirrel. With the odds of a squirrel being born white thought to be about one in 100,000, spotting one in your back garden is definitely an occasion worth capturing on camera. The Rarity, Background, and Cause of White Squirrels White squirrels are incredibly rare, with their numbers estimated to be as low as one in 100,000. This rarity in the squirrel population can be attributed to a few factors. Most white squirrels are the result of a genetic trait known as leucism or albinism. In the case of leucism, there is a partial loss of pigmentation in the animal, leading it to appear white or pale in color. Albino squirrels, on the other hand, have a complete lack of melanin production, which leads to their white fur and pink or reddish eyes. White squirrels tend to face several challenges in the wild, predisposing them to a lower likelihood of survival as compared to their more common, brown- or grey-furred counterparts. Due to their stark contrast from their surroundings, white squirrels are more easily spotted by predators, significantly endangering their lives. Furthermore, the absence of pigmentation in albinos makes them susceptible to a range of health issues, including susceptibility to sunburn and poor eyesight. Capturing the Moment Despite the odds, spotting a white squirrel is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that should be celebrated and documented. Using a camera to capture this rare moment is essential for several reasons: 1. Preserving the memory: Encountering a white squirrel is a unique and unforgettable experience. Taking a photograph of the enchanting creature is a fantastic way to cherish the moment and share it with your friends and family. 2. Raising awareness: By capturing the sighting on film, you can help raise awareness for these rare animals and their conservation. By sharing the images or anecdotes, you encourage others to appreciate the diversity and beauty of the wildlife in their own backyards. 3. Research opportunities: Documenting white squirrel sightings can be a valuable contribution to ongoing research dedicated to understanding the genetics, distribution, and ecology surrounding these uncommon creatures. Citizen scientists can add to the available information and increase the knowledge on these elusive animals. Conclusion Nature is undoubtedly full of wondrous creatures, and the white squirrel is a shining testament to that. The odds of one being born are already astoundingly low at an estimated one in 100,000, making each sighting an exceptional event worth preserving on camera. Not only does capturing these events allow us to celebrate and appreciate the marvels of nature, but it also contributes to the research and conservation of these captivating animals. Encounters with white squirrels serve as a reminder to be more aware of our natural surroundings and to protect the environment for these rare beauties and the countless other creatures that call it home."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw... and the situation: Two continents were known for the strange discrepancies in animal populations. Asia was mostly populated by reptiles of all species, while Africa was mostly populated by birds and very few reptiles. Answer the following question: Which continent was inhabited by fewer turtles?

Philips is not the only organisation to have researched ways to transmit data via specialised LED bulbs. Engineers at the University of Edinburgh are working on a \\"li-fi\\" system capable of transmitting data at up to 10 gigabits per second, which they suggest could offer an alternative to radio waves. The Philips scheme is more limited in its scope, but has the benefit of being ready for market. It works by making each of the fitted LEDs transmit a distinct location code. If users open a compatible app and let their smartphone camera look upwards, this can be used to determine their location - accurate to up to 1m - and the direction they are facing. It functions in a similar way to GPS-based maps used outdoors, and compares favourably to wi-fi based location systems, which are typically accurate to only 3-5m. Many retailers, however, are investing instead in beacons - small Bluetooth 4 transmitters that allow compatible apps to work out how far away a user is standing, but not their precise position. Beacons have the benefit of being cheaper and potentially easier to try out than replacing a store's complete lighting system. However, one expert saw the merits of Philips's alternative. \\"You have to look at this as a long-term investment, but this is potentially an easier spend to swallow as you're not just betting on one thing - you still have a good lighting system,\\" commented Chris Green, principal technology analyst at the Davies Murphy Group consultancy. \\"It also goes far beyond what is achievable with the beacons. \\"To try and get a similar effect you'd need so many of them that they would be awkward to deploy, plus you'd need to rely on users having a phone that not only supports the newer Bluetooth standard but also has it switched on. \\"By contrast, this is up in the air, so easier to roll out.\\" A summary of the above article is?","completion":"The article discusses a new technology designed by Philips and installed at a Carrefour supermarket in Lille, France.

After two years in Yonkers, New York, the family moved to Longmeadow, Massachusetts, where Santiago attended Longmeadow High School and graduated from Wilbraham & Monson Academy in 1983. His first experience with a musical instrument was playing a Hammond organ at the age of eight, but he never took on the instrument seriously because he had to share it with five brothers. Santiago first played a guitar at the age of nine after he noticed a classical guitar hanging on his oldest brother's wall for decoration.

In August 1913, Karluk, a brigantine formerly used as a whaler, became trapped in the ice while sailing to a rendezvous point at Herschel Island. After a long drift across the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, in January 1914 the ship was crushed and sunk. In the ensuing months, the crew and expedition staff struggled to survive, first on the ice and later on the shores of Wrangel Island. In all, eleven men died before rescue. The Canadian Arctic Expedition was organised under the leadership of Canadian anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and had both scientific and geographic purposes. Shortly after Karluk was trapped, Stefansson and a small party left the ship, stating that they intended to hunt for caribou. However, the ice carried Karluk westwards, far from the hunting party who found it impossible to return to the ship. Stefansson reached land and then devoted himself to the expedition's scientific objectives, leaving the crew and staff on board the ship under the charge of its captain, Robert Bartlett. After the sinking, Bartlett organised a march across the ice to Wrangel Island, 80 miles (130 km) away. Conditions were difficult and dangerous; two four-man parties were lost before the island was reached. From the island, Bartlett and an Inuk companion set out across the frozen sea for the Siberian coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent.

See options at the end Sarah has able to ride a bike without training wheels, unlike Katrina, because Pick your answer from: (1). Sarah was younger and had poor balance.; (2). Katrina was younger and had poor balance.;","completion":"Sarah has been able to ride a bike without training wheels, unlike Katrina, because Katrina was younger and had poor balance. This statement illustrates that Sarah's proficiency in biking has less to do with her own abilities and more to do with Katrina's lack of the same. Let's break it down a little more: To begin, age can be an important factor in developing certain physical skills such as bike riding. Younger children often struggle more with balance due to the ongoing development of their motor skills. Adults, on the other hand, generally have fully developed motor skills and therefore better balance. So, if Katrina was younger than Sarah when trying to learn bike-riding, she might've had more difficulty due to her age and still-developing motor skills. The ability to ride a bike is heavily dependent on balance. It requires the rider to continually adjust their body position to stay upright while maintaining control over the direction and speed of the bike. If Katrina had poor balance, this would certainly make riding a bike without training wheels much more challenging. Training wheels help keep the bike stable while learners are still developing their balance skills for bike riding. If Katrina was not yet able to maintain her balance independently, she would need to continue using training wheels. In contrast, Sarah, being presumably older than Katrina, has developed better balance and may have accessed bike riding at an age when her balance and motor skills were better developed. This developmental edge could've made it easier for her to learn how to ride without training wheels. Assuming they had comparable opportunities and resources for learning, it's plausible that Sarah was able to ditch the training wheels before Katrina due to these age-linked physical development differences. But it's worth remembering that every individual's growth and development is different. Some might have excellent balance at a younger age, while others might only develop it when they get a little older. It's a process that's unique to each person, which is why it's important to be patient and understanding when teaching new skills, especially those like biking that have a physical developmental component. To summarize, Sarah has been able to ride a bike without training wheels, unlike Katrina, because Katrina was younger and had poor balance. But with time, practice, and patience, Katrina will likely be able to develop the necessary balance and skills to ride without training wheels, just like Sarah."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"Yes, these two questions are inquiring about the same information, which is understanding if an individual identifies as an introvert. I will provide you with a detailed and long answer to help you identify if you may be an introvert. Introversion and extroversion are personality aspects that describe how individuals respond to social situations and where they gain their energy. Introverts typically gain energy by spending time alone or in small, intimate groups, while extroverts thrive in larger groups and social situations. It's important to note that these traits exist on a continuum, and most people fall somewhere in between, as ambiverts. Here are some key characteristics and behaviors that may indicate you are an introvert: 1. Social preferences: One primary sign of an introvert is preferring to spend time alone or in the company of a few close friends and family, rather than larger social occasions. If you feel drained after attending bigger events and need time to recharge, you could be an introvert. 2. Need for privacy and personal space: Introverts generally value their privacy and the need to have a space of their own, where they feel safe to think, process, and recharge away from the stimuli of the world. 3. Enjoyment of solitude: Unlike extroverts who gain energy from social situations, introverts usually prefer engaging in activities alone or involving fewer people. They might enjoy reading, writing, or other solitary hobbies. 4. Deep thinkers: Introverts tend to have a rich inner world and often engage in deep thinking and introspection. They may spend significant time pondering life's complexities, analyzing situations, and reflecting on their feelings and thoughts. 5. Active listening skills: Introverts often excel at listening and absorbing information, preferring to observe and understand the world around them before speaking up or sharing their insights. 6. Small group preferences: Introverts generally feel more comfortable in small, intimate group settings where they can engage in meaningful conversations rather than trying to mingle in larger, more chaotic environments. 7. Selective in forming relationships: Introverts usually prefer to develop a few deep and close relationships rather than having numerous, but less intimate acquaintances. 8. Sensitivity to external stimuli: Introverts might be more sensitive to external stimuli such as loud noises, bright lights, or large crowds, which can lead to overwhelm and the need to retreat from these settings. 9. Focus and concentration: Introverts often have the ability to maintain focus on a task or project for extended periods, particularly in quiet or secluded environments. Remember that people can have a combination of introverted and extroverted qualities, and exhibiting some of these characteristics may not necessarily mean one exclusively identifies as an introvert. Personality traits can evolve over time with experience and personal development. To further explore if you are an introvert, consider taking reliable self-assessment tests, such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) or the Big Five Personality Test. These tests can provide valuable insights into your personality type and help you better understand your preferences and tendencies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Remans are a slave race of the Romulan Empire, used as miners and cannon fodder. A faction of the military is in support of Shinzon, but the Praetor and senate are set against it. After rejecting the motion, the Praetor and remaining senators are disintegrated by a device left in the room by a military-aligned senator. Meanwhile, the crew of the USS Enterprise-E prepares to bid farewell to first officer Commander William Riker and Counselor Deanna Troi, who are being married on Betazed. En route, they discover a positronic energy reading on a planet in the Kolaran system near the Romulan Neutral Zone. Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Lieutenant Commander Worf, and Lieutenant Commander Data land on Kolarus III and discover the remnants of an android resembling Data. When the android is reassembled it introduces itself as B-4. The crew deduce it to be a less-advanced, earlier version of Data. Picard is contacted by Vice Admiral Kathryn Janeway and orders the ship on a diplomatic mission to nearby Romulus. Janeway explains that the Romulan Empire has been taken over in a military coup by Shinzon, who says he wants peace with the Federation and to bring freedom to Remus. On arrival, they learn Shinzon is a clone of Picard, secretly created by Romulans to plant a high ranking spy into the Federation, but the project was abandoned and Shinzon left on Remus as a child to die as a slave. After many years, Shinzon became a leader of the Remans, and constructed his heavily armed flagship, the Scimitar. Initially, diplomatic efforts go well, but the Enterprise crew discover the Scimitar is producing low levels of thalaron radiation, which had been used to kill the Imperial Senate and is deadly to nearly all life forms.

(August 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) is released from a mental institution after spending 22 years in confinement. Lila Loomis (Vera Miles), sister of Marion Crane, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the seven people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home behind the Bates Motel by Dr. Bill Raymond (Robert Loggia), who assures him everything will be fine. Norman is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey (Dennis Franz). The following day, Norman reports to a prearranged job as a dishwasher and busboy at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named Emma Spool (Claudia Bryar). One of his co-workers there is Mary Samuels (Meg Tilly), a young waitress. After work, Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned what had been a shabby but respectable motel into a sleazy adult one.

Premise: \\"So I don't know and it's also a long way away.\\" The premise comprises two separate statements: 1. \\"I don't know\\" - The speaker does not have enough information or knowledge about the subject. 2. \\"It's also a long way away.\\" - The subject being discussed is far away from the speaker's current location or in terms of time or difficulty. Hypothesis: \\"It's also a long way away.\\" The hypothesis is a single statement referring to the idea that the subject is at a considerable distance from the speaker's location or in terms of time or difficulty. To examine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to assess if the information provided in the premise is adequate to hold the hypothesis true. If the premise necessarily leads to the hypothesis, it can be said that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. In this case, we see that the second statement in the premise is identical to the hypothesis. When the speaker says, \\"it's also a long way away,\\" they are directly referring to the idea expressed in the hypothesis. Thus, we can confidently state that the hypothesis, \\"It's also a long way away,\\" is entailed by the premise, \\"So I don't know and it's also a long way away.\\" However, it is essential to note that the first statement in the premise (i.e., \\"I don't know\\") is irrelevant to the entailed hypothesis.

People in the coastal area naturally get more iodide from food items because the soil has more iodized salt. But farther we go inland, the soil lacks necessary iodine. As a result, inland population do not get enough iodine naturally. Where people are more at risk of mental retardation, coastal area or inland? Hint: Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development. Large amounts of iodide ion are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater fish. A:","completion":"Inland populations have historically been at a higher risk of iodine deficiency and its related health issues, such as thyroid gland problems and mental retardation, compared to those living in coastal areas. This is primarily due to natural iodine sources being more abundant in coastal regions. Coastal populations typically have access to seafood and seaweed, which are rich in iodine. Seawater also contains a higher concentration of iodide ions, allowing marine plants and animals to accumulate them in their bodies. Therefore, people living near the coast who consume these marine products tend to have a sufficient intake of iodine. Moreover, the soil near the ocean also contains higher levels of iodine from the sea, which permeates into the soil and crops grown along the coast. Conversely, inland populations face a higher risk of iodine deficiency. In regions farther from the coast, the soil generally contains lower levels of iodine. This is a result of the natural decrease in iodine content as one moves farther from the ocean and the natural processes, such as rain and geological leaching, which carry away minerals from the soil. As a consequence, the crops and water that people rely on in these inland areas are likely to have much lower iodine concentrations. Before the introduction of iodized salt, iodine deficiency was a significant issue, especially in rural or mountainous areas. The 1920s marked a turning point in the understanding and treatment of iodine deficiency when it was discovered that adding iodide anion to the diet could alleviate its related health problems. One of the easiest ways to increase iodide intake was by adding it to table salt. The widespread use of iodized salt has played a crucial role in preventing iodine deficiencies worldwide. In conclusion, inland populations historically faced a higher risk of iodine deficiencies and their associated health problems compared to those in coastal regions, primarily due to the limited availability of natural iodine sources in their diet and soil. The implementation of iodized salt as a public health measure has greatly contributed to reducing this risk and improving the overall health of individuals living in both coastal and inland areas. However, it is essential to continue monitoring iodine levels and taking appropriate preventive measures, especially in regions where deficiency remains a concern."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: In late 1994, Marvel acquired the comic book distributor Heroes World Distribution to use as its own exclusive distributor.

According to some people of the 1780s American English was a peasant's language that a \\"gentleman\\" will not speak. Considered in a bilingual point of view, British English was the dominant language linked to prestige and language purism . The belief in the authority or say in the superior of British English, has remained to the twentieth century, especially in the former British Empire or in the fields of British influence. Thus, it is reported that in prefix = st1 /China, teachers and school textbooks refer to and recommend Received Pronunciation as the model, as well as standard British sentence structures, spelling and words. British English is also encouraged and accepted as the criteria of some major official examinations, for example, College English Test and Test for English Majors which are conducted by government. Similar situations could be found in countries, for example, in Africa, the West African Examination Council and Joint Admission accepts the British English as the standard English.

Michael took Steven to the shooting range because","completion":"Michael took Steven to the shooting range because he recognized that both of them shared a strong passion for firearms, and he wanted to bond with Steven by engaging in an activity that they both enjoyed and appreciated. Michael knew his way around firearms, having gained extensive knowledge and practical experience since he was young. His father, a military officer, had instilled in him both respect and admiration for firearms, emphasizing the importance of safety and proper handling when using them. As a result, Michael had developed exceptional marksmanship skills and a keen understanding of various firearm models and their mechanisms. Steven, on the other hand, also knew his way around a firearm but came from a different background. Raised by a single mother, he never had the same close connection with a strong male role model like Michael's father. Nonetheless, he developed a love for firearms on his own, primarily through books, online forums, and watching videos on the internet. On weekends, he would join his friends at a local shooting range to practice and hone his skills, gradually familiarizing himself with different guns and their individual quirks. Shooting became more than just a hobby to Steven; it was an essential outlet for him, a means of feeling empowered and confident in a world that had often left him feeling vulnerable and insecure. Michael, having observed Steven's enthusiasm and dedication to the world of firearms, decided to take him along to the shooting range one fateful afternoon to strengthen their connection. He believed that the shared experience would provide them with an opportunity to learn from each other and create a powerful bonding experience that transcended mere hobby or activity. Upon arriving at the range, Michael wasted no time setting up targets and preparing their firearms for a day of shooting. The two men eagerly exchanged insights on different models, firing techniques, and overall gun safety practices. As the hours flew by, Michael and Steven found their conversations expanding beyond the boundaries of firearms, delving into more profound discussions about life, aspirations, and the paths they were forging in this world. As the sun began to set, the pair reflected on the many lessons they had learned from each other throughout the day. It was clear that this shared experience had brought them closer, transcending their initial common ground of firearms and developing into a profound connection characterized by mutual respect and understanding. In summary, Michael took Steven to the shooting range because he recognized the significance of their shared passion for firearms and foresaw the potential for a powerful bonding experience that would ultimately allow them to forge a strong friendship. This shared activity enabled both Michael and Steven to learn valuable skills from one another, creating a unique and meaningful connection that would undoubtedly last a lifetime."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Brown Eyed Girls (Hangul: beuraun aideu geolseu, Japanese: buraunaidogaruzu), often abbreviated as B.E.G., BG or beuageol (beu-ah-geol) is a South Korean girl group managed by Mystic Entertainment. The group consists of four members: JeA, Miryo, Narsha, and Gain. They debuted as an R&B/Ballad vocal group with \\"Come Closer (dagawaseo)\\" in 2006 and have since challenged themselves with a notable variety of different music genres. They rose to popularity in 2008 with \\"L.O.V.E\\" and their retro-dance number \\"How Come,\\" and cemented their position in the K-pop world in 2009 with \\"Abracadabra\\", with its electronica-based genre, pioneering (albeit controversial) concept, along with its iconic and now globally recognized dance entitled 'The Arrogant Dance (sigeonbangcum)'--successfully ingraining themselves into modern popular culture. The group's leader, Jea, was the one responsible of the group's creation and was actively involved in the selection of the other members, picking out Miryo, who was known as a great female rapper from the hip-hop community having previously worked with other fellow rappers, such as Gil Seong-joon from Leessang, and the main female rapper in well-known hip-hop group Honey Family. Narsha was chosen when Jea remembered her as a \\"talented singer\\" from her high school days, and Ga-in was selected by the three members after she was eliminated from \\"Battle Shin Hwa.\\" According to Ga-in, she was crying in the bathroom after failing the audition, was found by composer Ahn Jung Hoon, and then was chosen through the audition in Brown Eyed Girls' company. Singer Yoari trained with the group until 2006, when it was decided she would be the lead singer for Sprinkler. The four members held several small size concerts, and was actually known as \\"Crescendo\\" before officially debuting as \\"Brown Eyed Girls.\\" After more than 3 years of training in singing and holding several small size concerts, the Brown Eyed Girls released their debut album Your Story in South Korea on March 2, 2006, with the ballad track, \\"Come Closer\\" as their single. Debuting as a \\"faceless group\\" they did not appear on any visual media and chose to not even appear in their own music video. The album was well received by critics but did not do as well as expected commercially. The album was later re-released to include \\"Hold The Line\\" (which samples \\"Push The Button\\" by British girl band Sugababes and \\"Technologic\\" by Daft Punk). This song became a hit, further boosting the band's popularity. \\"Hold the Line\\" was disclosed across the world because it was included in the list of songs from the game Pump it Up. After a short break, the group went back into the studio to work on their second album Leave Ms. Kim (ddeonara miseugim), which included their R&B title track \\"You Got Me Fooled\\" (neoege sogassda). Subsequent singles were \\"Oasis\\" (oasiseu) featuring Lee Jae Hoon and \\"It's Mine\\" (naeggeoya), a collaboration with fellow group SeeYa. During the break between their debut and second albums, the Brown Eyed Girls released their first digital single entitled \\"I Am a Summer\\" (naega yeoreumida), which was later included in their second LP. The first two albums contained typical R&B ballads which had been very popular in the K-pop scene. However, the commercial success was relatively higher in two singles between the first and second albums. Moreover, the second album containing \\"You Got Me Fooled\\" (neoege sogassda) was released at nearly the same time as Wonder Girls' \\"Tell Me\\" which received a nationwide success in Korea. Therefore, their second album was once again a commercial disappointment. At the same time, the general K-pop scene was changing from R&B ballads to dance music.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Is Your Story the name of an album?","completion":"Yes, Your Story is the name of an album.

Ballads derive from the medieval French \\"chanson balladée\\" or \\"ballade\\", which were originally \\"danced songs\\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa. Ballads are 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - Jesus Christ Superstar is a 1970 rock opera with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice. The musical started as a rock opera concept album before its Broadway debut in 1971. The musical is sung-through, with no spoken dialogue. The story is loosely based on the Gospels' accounts of the last week of Jesus's life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his disciples in Jerusalem and ending with the crucifixion. It highlights political and interpersonal struggles between Judas Iscariot and Jesus that are not present in the Bible narratives. - Slowhand is a 1977 album by Eric Clapton. Released on 25 November by RSO Records, and titled after Clapton's nickname, it is one of his commercially and critically most successful studio albums. \\"Slowhand\\" produced the two hit singles \\"Lay Down Sally\\" and \\"Wonderful Tonight\\", reached various international music charts and was honored with numerous awards and recording certifications. In 2012, a deluxe edition was released to celebrate the album's 35th anniversary. - \`\` Wonderful Tonight '' is a ballad written by Eric Clapton . It was included on Clapton 's 1977 album Slowhand . Clapton wrote the song about Pattie Boyd . The female vocal harmonies on the song are provided by Marcella Detroit ( then Marcy Levy ) and Yvonne Elliman . - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - \\"Lay Down Sally\\" is a song performed by Eric Clapton, and written by Clapton, Marcella Detroit (as Marcy Levy, the diminutive form of her birth name), and George Terry. It appeared on his November 1977 album \\"Slowhand\\", and reached No. 3 on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100 chart. - The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is a hall of fame and museum located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun to recognize and archive the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the hall of fame's permanent home. Since opening in September 1995, the \\"Rock Hall\\" part of the city's redeveloped North Coast Harbor has hosted more than 10 million visitors and had a cumulative economic impact estimated at more than 1.8 billion. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Marcella Detroit (born Marcella Levy, June 21, 1952) is an American soprano vocalist (perhaps best known for her backup singing on many Top 20 Billboard hits), guitarist, and songwriter. She released her debut album \\"Marcella\\" in 1982 to little success before she joined Shakespears Sister with ex-Bananarama member Siobhan Fahey. Detroit sang the lead vocals on their biggest hit, \\"Stay\\", which was number one in the United Kingdom for eight consecutive weeks.

Often referred to as \\"the quiet Beatle\\", Harrison embraced Hindu mythology and helped broaden the horizons of his fellow Beatles as well as their Western audience by incorporating Indian instrumentation in their music. Although most of the Beatles' songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \\"Taxman\\", \\"Within You Without You\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"Something\\", the last of which became the Beatles' second-most covered song. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \\"high A\\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \\"soprano C\\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody. The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice. - Yvonne Marianne Elliman (born December 29, 1951) is an American singer who performed for four years in the first cast of \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\".

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \\"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well.:115–147\\"?

Matthew was able to solve the case but Lawrence was totally stumped, because Available options: [A]. Matthew lacked the attention to detail do the job. [B]. Lawrence lacked the attention to detail do the job.","completion":"B. Lawrence lacked the attention to detail do the job. Despite their partnership, Matthew and Lawrence had stark differences in their approach to solving cases. Matthew was a seasoned detective; his reputation was built upon his incredible prowess in piecing together clues and spotting the minute details that others often overlooked. Lawrence, on the other hand, was relatively new to the field. Though he possessed an impressive understanding of the criminal mind, he lacked the essential attention to detail in order to unravel the complexities of most cases. As the investigation unfolded, the duo faced one of the most challenging puzzles of their careers. The case involved a series of seemingly unrelated thefts, each one more elaborate than the last. At first glance, there appeared to be no discernible pattern. Yet, amidst the chaos, Matthew’s keen eye picked up on the subtle connections between the crimes. Lawrence found himself growing increasingly frustrated with his inability to discover such connections. He dedicated long hours to studying the reports, poring over crime scene photos, and examining evidence, all in an attempt to match his partner's efficacy. Despite his determination, the success he craved continued to elude him. The limits of his capabilities became all too apparent as the case progressed. Matthew, aware of his partner's struggles, became increasingly concerned about Lawrence's mental and emotional state. The stress of the case was evident in Lawrence's graying demeanor, his strained voice, and the deepening lines on his tired face. Nonetheless, Matthew resolved to bolster his partner's self-confidence by encouraging him to take on more responsibility in the investigation. But the persistent presence of Lawrence’s weakness left them at a disadvantage. The case required an exceptional level of scrutiny, and while Matthew did his best to delegate tasks, he could not ignore the fact that Lawrence's inadequacy was hindering their progress. Matthew realized that this was no ordinary case—rather, it was one that could potentially make or break their partnership. As the two worked tirelessly over the case, Matthew began to close in on the truth. He discovered an intricate web of strategic dealings, unexpected twists, and falsified alibis, all pointing toward one mastermind responsible for orchestrating the crimes. With his keen perception and years of experience, Matthew expertly unraveled the manipulation and deceit that had kept the criminal concealed for so long. When the case was finally solved, Matthew looked on as Lawrence stood crestfallen, overwhelmed by his shortcomings. Lawrence's frustration at his inability to contribute as he had hoped, coupled with Matthew’s astounding success, cast a heavy pall over his self-worth. But it was in this moment of self-doubt that Matthew imparted a valuable lesson. It is in the face of our deepest failures that we discover our greatest opportunities for growth. All great detectives, Matthew explained, have experienced loss and failure. But it is in the ashes of defeat that true potential and determination are forged. As Matthew and Lawrence moved on to their next case, they did so with a newfound understanding of their dynamic partnership. Lawrence, still stung by his struggles but inspired by Matthew's words, vowed to better himself and one day master the art of paying attention to detail. Together, they continued to tackle the dark shadows of crime, each one learning from the other, and striving to become the best detectives they could be."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Food is taken into the mouth - The food is chewed - Saliva mixes with the food and starts breaking it down - The chewed food travels down the esophagus to the stomach - The stomach secretes acid - Grinds and mixes the food - The food moves to the small intestine - The small intestine uses enzymes to further break down the food - The food passes into the colon - The food is expelled from the body. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose High fiber foods like Bran happens, how will it affect Foods with lots of fiber are eaten. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that introducing a change, in this case, the consumption of high fiber foods like bran, may have an effect on the previously mentioned process of digestion. Foods with lots of fiber will indeed have a direct impact on the digestive process, particularly on the movement and breakdown of food, as well as nutrient absorption. Let's examine the impact of high fiber foods on each step of the digestive process: 1. Food is taken into the mouth: High fiber foods like bran might require more chewing due to their texture, which in turn increases the time spent in the mouth for mechanical breakdown. 2. The food is chewed: Chewing breaks down the food into smaller pieces, making it easier for enzymes like amylase in saliva to break down the carbohydrates in fiber-rich foods. 3. Saliva mixes with the food and starts breaking it down: Salivary amylase, an enzyme found in saliva, breaks down some of the carbohydrates in high fiber foods, specifically targeting starch while leaving most of the fiber intact. 4. The chewed food travels down the esophagus to the stomach: The presence of fiber in the food bolus may slow down the movement through the esophagus due to increased viscosity. 5. The stomach secretes acid: Fiber-rich foods have a buffering effect by absorbing and neutralizing some of the stomach acid, which may reduce irritation or damage to the stomach lining. 6. Grinds and mixes the food: High fiber foods might take longer to be broken down in the stomach due to gastric motility, slowing down the gastric emptying rate. This increased transit time in the stomach creates a feeling of fullness or satiety, which may reduce total calorie intake. 7. The food moves to the small intestine: Fiber can help regulate the release of food into the small intestine, preventing sudden spikes in blood sugar. However, the presence of fiber may also reduce the efficiency of nutrient absorption as it can interfere with the absorption of certain minerals, vitamins, and other nutrients by binding to them. 8. The small intestine uses enzymes to further break down the food: High fiber foods increase the secretion of digestive enzymes (like pancreatic amylase and lipase) to help break down the carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. However, insoluble fiber is not broken down by these enzymes and remains relatively intact, as it travels through the small intestine. 9. The food passes into the colon: Both soluble and insoluble fiber have specific effects on the colon. Soluble fiber acts as a prebiotic, feeding the beneficial bacteria in the gut and contributing to the production of short-chain fatty acids. These fatty acids serve as an energy source for the colon cells and have anti-inflammatory properties, promoting overall gut health. Insoluble fiber adds bulk to the stool and helps retain water, promoting regular bowel movements and preventing constipation. 10. The food is expelled from the body: High fiber foods, specifically insoluble fiber, promote regular bowel movements by increasing stool bulk and softening the stool, which makes it easier to pass. In conclusion, high fiber foods have both direct and indirect effects on the digestive process. Most of these effects are beneficial, such as improving gut health, promoting satiety, and regulating bowel movements. However, some drawbacks may include reduced absorption of certain nutrients and possible abdominal discomfort for those not accustomed to a high-fiber diet. It is essential to gradually increase fiber intake and ensure adequate hydration to minimize any adverse effects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Cheap Prices in Salinas Ecuador What is the correctly punctuated version of this sentence?","completion":"The sentence you provided, \\"Cheap Prices in Salinas Ecuador\\", doesn't necessarily need punctuation as it currently stands. It seems like a statement or title to a concept rather than a standard sentence that would require punctuation. The punctuation essentially depends on the sense you want to convey. If you are trying to denote that Salinas, Ecuador has cheap prices, the sentence could need a comma for clarification: \\"Cheap Prices in Salinas, Ecuador\\". This is because the comma separates the city (Salinas) from the country (Ecuador), which is standard punctuation in geography. If you want to express astonishment about the cheap prices in Salinas, Ecuador, you can add an exclamation mark: \\"Cheap Prices in Salinas, Ecuador!\\" If you're making a declaration for a commercial purpose or advertising, it might look like, \\"Discover cheap prices in Salinas, Ecuador!\\" If it's the start of a longer sentence, additional context would be needed. For instance, \\"Cheap prices in Salinas, Ecuador, are attracting many tourists.\\" In conclusion, the correct punctuation for the phrase \\"Cheap Prices in Salinas Ecuador\\" very much depends on the context in which the sentence occurs.

Input: Article: Many university students dislike studying history because there is little to get excited about when historical events are presented in a boring manner. However, I'll never forget my American History professor, Dr. Williamson. Each event leaped from the pages of our text and became as real as the daily news report on the radio. My favorite lecture concerned the American Revolution. Dr. Williamson set the mood for the study by imitating Pall Revere, a well-known silversmith, working in his shop. The American colonists were angry because of the British control over their lives. Revere felt that war between the British and the colonists was inevitable. Then, Dr Williamson told us about Revere rowing across the Charles River from Boston on April 18,1775. I could see the professor row as he raised his hand to his forehead as if he were looking across the Charles River to the old North Church in Boston. Suddenly, Revere spotted two lanterns, a signal which meant that the British would attack by sea. He jumped on his horse to warn the villagers of the attack. Professor Williamson reminded us that the first battles of the American Revolution were fought at Concord and Lexington, Massachusetts, the year before the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776. Never before had history seemed so alive to me. And all because a professor cared enough to put his heart into his teaching.

Cody has wanted to be a professional surfer ever since a visit from legendary surfer Ezekiel \\"Big Z\\" Topanga several years ago. When a talent scout shorebird named Mikey (Mario Cantone) arrives to find entrants for the \\"Big Z Memorial\\" surfing contest, Cody jumps at the chance despite the lackluster support from his family. En route to the contest, Cody befriends another entrant, Chicken Joe. The entrants arrive at Pen Gu Island, the site of the contest, where Cody meets and immediately falls in love with Lani, an eighteen-year-old female gentoo penguin who is a lifeguard.

They attempt to take the log back to Geek's house, only to lose control of it and end up on a beach far away from the contest. When Cody gets to the beach, he discovers a shack full of old trophies and surfboards, which are actually Z's belongings. After observing Geek solemnly reflecting in the shack, he realizes that Geek is actually Z and asks him to teach him how to surf. Reluctantly, Z agrees, but says that Cody has to make his own board first. The attempt doesn't go well, however, as an impatient Cody doesn't listen to Z's...

Summarize this article in one sentence. A trail of death and destruction was left across the 4,000 villages of Rudraprayag district when floods engulfed the famous Hindu shrine of Kedarnath. At least 5,700 people missing were presumed dead while more than 540 bodies recovered from the mountains were buried in the aftermath. A year later, skeletons of missing people continue to be found. Sanjay Sharma, a pilgrim from Delhi, says news of 12 more bodies found in the Kedarnath valley last week have made him afraid. \\"Naturally I am scared and am planning to wind up the trip in a few days. Looking at the debris, I am sure many more bodies would be buried right here,\\" he said. Rudraprayag District Magistrate Raghav Langar says the government has constituted a special force for intensive combing operations to find the thousands who are still missing. \\"We may find more bodies in the coming weeks as snow has begun to melt, and with the onset of the monsoon they are likely to come to the surface,\\" he told reporters on Sunday. There was compensation for bereft families and the temple reopened for prayers last September. But despite a year of relief and reconstruction efforts by the government and aid agencies, many of the villages which were completely washed away by the surging waters of Mandakani river remain cut off. For the thousands who were displaced and provided shelter by the government in various towns, it appears a long wait to return home. \\"I lost my home and a few relatives in the floods but have suffered more in the last few months. My tea stall has no visitors and tourists are absent this year. How will my family survive?\\" asked Proornanand Bhatt, a resident of Rudraprayag. Every summer, hundreds of thousands of devout Hindus make a pilgrimage to the Kedarnath shrine as part of the Himalayan Char Dham Yatra (Four pilgrimages) to four temple towns in Uttarakhand. Badrinath, Yamunotri and Gangotri are the other three pilgrimage spots. But that was until last year. Fear appears to have kept away those who have been regulars to this region this year, affecting local businesses badly - the only means of livelihood for hundreds of people living in the higher mountains. Newly constructed roads leading up to Guptakashi, near Kedarnath, are empty and so are the hundreds of lodges and hotels lined up next to the river. \\"I'll give you an 80% discount over the regular room rates if you stay with us,\\" a tourist lodge owner pleaded with us in Guptakashi. The temple town of Kedarnath, meanwhile, continues to resemble a ghost town with hundreds of damaged homes and lodges covered with boulders, mud and silt. An expensive chopper ride from Guptakashi remains the only way to reach the shrine and the temple compound is the only place of any visible activity. Some, however, have returned to offer prayers for having survived last year when a glacial lake above the town burst after days of heavy rainfall. Janardan Rai and wife Anjula were only a few miles away from the shrine when news of the flooding reached them. \\"It was God's wish that we are alive. So we are here to thank him and offer prayers. I agree things here are in a bad shape, but that should not come in the way of faith,\\" Mr Rai said. The government of Uttarakhand, meanwhile, has been working hard to restore normalcy to the affected areas and work is going on to repair damaged roads and bridges. In a bid to woo more pilgrims, the government is offering cheap accommodation and food to pilgrims who wish to visit the shrines in the near future. But with the entire economy of Uttarakhand so heavily dependent on religious tourism over decades, this appears to be a race against time.

Question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? Are William Goyen and Joe R. Lansdale both writers? Answer:","completion":"Yes, both William Goyen and Joe R. Lansdale are writers. They each have distinctly different styles, backgrounds, and contributions to the world of literature, as well as unique places in American literary history. William Goyen was an American writer born in 1915 in Texas, and he passed away in 1983. He is primarily known for his novels, short stories, and contributions to the Southern Gothic literary tradition. One of his most famous works is his debut novel \\"The House of Breath\\" (1950), which tells an emotionally resonant story about the people living in a small Texas town. This novel, like many of Goyen's other works, contains a lyrical, poetic, and avant-garde approach to language and storytelling. He is also known for his collections of short stories like \\"Ghost and Flesh\\" (1952) and \\"The Faces of Blood Kindred\\" (1960). With a particular interest in exploring themes of memory, identity, and the human condition, Goyen's works often delve into the complexities of human relationships and the impact of the past on our present lives. Joe R. Lansdale, on the other hand, was born in 1951, also in Texas, and is still an active writer today. Lansdale's writing spans several genres, including (but not limited to) mystery, suspense, horror, science fiction, and even Westerns. Known for his eclectic storytelling style, Lansdale is often praised for his ability to create vivid and memorable characters, unique settings, and engaging plots. Among his most notable works is the Hap and Leonard series, which began with \\"Savage Season\\" in 1990 and continues to this day. These crime novels feature the private investigators Hap Collins and Leonard Pine, whose adventures showcase Lansdale's penchant for dark humor, sharp dialogue, and evocative descriptions. Lansdale has also published numerous standalone novels, short stories, and comic books, adapting some of his own works to the graphic novel format. His works my often blend multiple genres, combining elements such as supernatural, noir, and action to create a fresh and often unique narrative experience. In conclusion, both William Goyen and Joe R. Lansdale are indeed writers, each having left their own distinct marks on the landscape of American literature. While their styles, genres, and themes might differ significantly, it is this rich diversity of voices that contributes to the continued vibrancy and evolution of the literary world."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

In the postulated homeland region (present-day Ukraine), they had contacts with the Iranic Sarmatians and the Germanic Goths. After their subsequent spread, they began assimilating non-Slavic peoples. For example, in the Balkans, there were Paleo-Balkan peoples, such as Romanized and Hellenized (Jireček Line) Illyrians, Thracians and Dacians, as well as Greeks and Celtic Scordisci. Over time, due to the larger number of Slavs, most descendants of the indigenous populations of the Balkans were Slavicized. The Thracians and Illyrians vanished from the population during this period – although the modern Albanian nation claims descent from the Illyrians. Exceptions are Greece, where the lesser numbered Slavs scattered there came to be Hellenized (aided in time by more Greeks returning to Greece in the 9th century and the role of the church and administration) and Romania where Slavic people settled en route for present-day Greece, Republic of Macedonia, Bulgaria and East Thrace whereby the Slavic population had come to assimilate. Bulgars were also assimilated by local Slavs but their ruling status and subsequent land cast the nominal legacy of Bulgarian country and people onto all future generations. The Romance speakers within the fortified Dalmatian cities managed to retain their culture and language for a long time, as Dalmatian Romance was spoken until the high Middle Ages. However, they too were eventually assimilated into the body of Slavs. Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): When did Dalmatian Romance assimilate the Slavs?","completion":"Dalmatian Romance did not assimilate the Slavs. Instead, the Romance speakers in the Dalmatian cities managed to keep their culture and language for a long time, but eventually, they were assimilated into the larger group of Slavs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who planned to work with his longtime librettist? , can you please find it? The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's...

The law of criminal procedure in the United States consists of a massive overlay of federal constitutional case law interwoven with the federal and state statutes that actually provide the foundation for the creation and operation of law enforcement agencies and prison systems as well as the proceedings in criminal trials. Due to the perennial inability of legislatures in the U.S. to enact statutes that would actually force law enforcement officers to respect the constitutional rights of criminal suspects and convicts, the federal judiciary gradually developed the exclusionary rule as a method to enforce such rights. In turn, the exclusionary rule spawned a family of judge-made remedies for the abuse of law enforcement powers, of which the most famous is the Miranda warning. The writ of habeas corpus is often used by suspects and convicts to challenge their detention, while the Civil Rights Act of 1871 and Bivens actions are used by suspects to recover tort damages for police brutality. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What acts cover tort damages from police brutality cases?","completion":"The question can be answered. In the United States, two primary legal actions cover tort damages from police brutality cases: the Civil Rights Act of 1871 and Bivens actions. 1. The Civil Rights Act of 1871 (42 U.S.C. § 1983): This federal statute allows individuals to sue government officials, including police officers, for violations of their constitutional rights. Victims of police brutality can seek compensatory and punitive damages under this statute. The purpose of this act is to hold state and local government officials accountable for unlawful actions that infringe on an individual's rights. 2. Bivens actions: Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents (403 U.S. 388) is a 1971 U.S. Supreme Court case that established the right to sue federal agents personally for damages caused by a violation of constitutional rights. A Bivens action allows individuals to seek damages for police brutality committed by federal law enforcement officers. Similar to a § 1983 claim, a Bivens action can result in compensatory and punitive damages. These two legal actions provide individuals with avenues to seek tort damages for police brutality cases, regardless of whether the law enforcement officers involved are part of state, local, or federal agencies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

With QB Josh McCown out with an injury, QB Daunte Culpepper got a chance to get redemption against his former team. The game was delayed for 30 minutes due to thunderstorms in the Miami area. In the first quarter, Oakland got off to a fast start with Culpepper completing a 7-yard TD pass to WR Jerry Porter, along with getting a 2-yard TD run.

The Dolphins would respond with QB Trent Green completing a 3-yard TD pass to TE Justin Peelle. In the fourth quarter, Oakland sealed its first road win since Week 11 of the 2005 season with Culpepper hooking up with Porter again on a 27-yard TD pass, along with getting a 3-yard TD run.

The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is?

A federal judge in New York sentenced three men to a minimum 25 years in prison on Wednesday for plotting to detonate bombs at two Bronx synagogues and attack a military base in New York. James Cromitie, Onta Williams and David Williams were arrested in 2009 after planting what they thought were live explosives. Laguerre Payen, a fourth member of the group who was arrested and tried together with the defendants, was not in the courtroom pending a psychological evaluation. In August, the jury spent six weeks listening to the testimony and undercover tapes from an FBI informant who posed as a Pakistani militant. After eight days of deliberations in October, the defendants were convicted on seven of eight counts, including conspiracy and attempts to use and acquire weapons of mass destruction and anti-aircraft missiles. Cromitie and Williams were also found guilty of attempting to kill officers and employees of the United States . In an emotional statement on Wednesday, Cromitie apologized to the people of United States, his family and friends. \\"I have never been a terrorist and I never will be a terrorist and everyone here knows that,\\" he said. David Williams and Onta Williams also apologized to their families and thanked supporters, and Onta apologized to the people of Riverdale. The prosecutors were pushing for life in prison for the three men. \\"What these three defendants did was as serious a set of offenses as is imaginable,\\" said Assistant U.S. Attorney David Raskin in court Wednesday. Members of the defense team argued during the trial that their clients were victims of entrapment. The original sentencing was postponed from March 24 so the judge could hear defense arguments on the government's usage of a confidential informant in the case. \\"The real crime in this case is that the government was allowed to do something like this,\\" Suzanne Brody, attorney for Onta Williams, said after the sentencing. Lawyers for the three men have said they will appeal. U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon admonished the defendants for what they tried to do, calling it \\"beyond despicable,\\" yet she handed down the minimum sentence, calling the defendants \\"thugs for hire,\\" not religious or political martyrs. She praised the \\"brilliant lawyering\\" in the case and the defense for dedication to their clients. \\"James Cromitie, David Williams and Onta Williams voluntarily agreed to target synagogues and military planes using what they thought were real bombs and missiles,\\" said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. \\"Today's sentences ensure that the defendants will be punished for their actions.\\" Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"Three men, James Cromitie, Onta Williams, and David Williams, were sentenced to a minimum of 25 years in prison for plotting to detonate bombs at two Bronx synagogues and attack a military base in New York.

LONDON, England (CNN) -- There is one man who will be pacing around the Hazeltine National Golf Club in Minnesota this week hoping to make it three majors in a row -- but you won't find his name when you trail your finger down the list of starters at the 91st PGA Championship. Tiger Woods possesses a mental toughness that none of his competitors can match. Though his presence may be unnoticed by spectators lining the fairways, his influence on the players he coaches is becoming far more conspicuous. That is because sports psychologist Dr. Morris Pickens, or \\"Dr Mo\\" as his players like to call him, is fast gaining a reputation for being one of the best mental coaches in golf. During practice rounds, OPTIONS: - 91st PGA Championship will spend around half a day with each of his players. - CNN will spend around half a day with each of his players. - Dr Mo will spend around half a day with each of his players. - England will spend around half a day with each of his players. - Hazeltine National Golf Club will spend around half a day with each of his players. - LONDON will spend around half a day with each of his players. - Lucas Glover will spend around half a day with each of his players. - Minnesota will spend around half a day with each of his players. - Morris Pickens will spend around half a day with each of his players. - Pickens will spend around half a day with each of his players. - Stewart Cink will spend around half a day with each of his players. - Tiger will spend around half a day with each of his players. - Tiger Woods will spend around half a day with each of his players. - Zach Johnson will spend around half a day with each of his players.","completion":"During practice rounds, Dr Mo will spend around half a day with each of his players. This dedicated and personalized support allows him to assess their mental state, discuss their thoughts, feelings, and performance goals, and provide tips and strategies to help them maintain focus, overcome adversity, and maximize their potential on the golf course. Dr. Morris Pickens' roster of players is indeed impressive, as it includes some of the top names in professional golf like Lucas Glover, Stewart Cink, and Zach Johnson - all of whom have enjoyed significant successes in their careers. Many players credit Dr. Mo with helping them unlock their full capabilities, pointing to their improved mental stamina, increased self-confidence, and heightened ability to respond positively to pressure situations as key factors in their improved game. Dr. Mo's unique approach to sports psychology combines elements from various psychological theories and methodologies, along with insights drawn from his own experiences as an athlete and a student of the game. He is a firm believer in the power of visualization and positive thinking, which is why he encourages his players to imagine themselves winning and performing at their best in critical moments even before stepping onto the golf course. At the same time, he teaches them to be aware of and manage their emotions, particularly those that may prove detrimental to their performance, such as anger, frustration, or anxiety. The effectiveness of Dr. Mo's methods can be seen in tangible improvements in the performances of his players. For example, Glover and Cink both credit him for helping them win their respective major championships, attributing their mental resilience and focused energy during the tournaments to Dr. Mo's guidance. In addition, several other players have noted marked improvements in their overall consistency and competitiveness, as well as a newfound ability to bounce back from setbacks or difficult rounds. As Dr. Mo's reputation as one of the best mental coaches in golf continues to grow, it is not surprising that more and more players are seeking his assistance in refining their mental game. With the gap between the top golfers in the world becoming narrower, the importance of managing the psychological aspect of the sport cannot be overstated. Golf is just as much a mental game as it is a physical one, and players who can master both will consistently come out on top. Dr. Morris Pickens' proven ability to help players unlock their mental strength is thus an invaluable asset for these golfers, ensuring they remain at the pinnacle of their sport for years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite its gold reserves of 106.3 million pounds, Russia's pre-war financial situation was not enviable. The country had large budget deficits year after year, and was largely dependent on borrowed money. Russia's war effort was funded primarily by France, in a series of loans totalling 800 million francs ; another loan in the amount of 600 million francs was agreed upon, but later cancelled. These loans were extended within a climate of mass bribing of the French press . Although initially reluctant to participate in the war, the French government and major banks were co-operative since it became clear that Russian and French economic interests were tied. In addition to French money, Russia secured a loan in the amount of 500 million marks from Germany, who also financed Japan's war effort. Conversely, Japan's pre-war gold reserves were a modest 11.7 million pounds; a major portion of the total cost of the war was covered by money borrowed from the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. During his canvassing expedition in London, the Japanese vice-governor of the Bank of Japan met Jacob Schiff, an American banker and head of Kuhn, Loeb & Co. Schiff, in response to Russia's anti-Jewish pogroms and sympathetic to Japan's cause, extended a critical series of loans to the Empire of Japan, in the amount of 200 million US dollars .

UPDATED:. 15:15 EST, 13 August 2012. A bankrupt Pakistani man and his son managed to set up a business and cheat their local community out of almost £50,000 despite being in the UK illegally, a court heard. Siyed Asem, 58, and his son Syed Bukhari, 25, ran a corner shop and operated a Western Union money transfer service offering ‘excellent rates’ on transactions. But more than 20 customers who used the service to send money to India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, were left thousands of pounds out of pocket. Father and son partnership: Bankrupt Siyed Asem, left, and his son Syed Bukhari, right, together stole nearly £50,000 from their customers who had requested for the cash to be transferred to India. Jailing father and son for two years. each, Judge Jamie Tabor QC described their offences against their own. Asian community in Gloucester’s Barton area as ‘despicable.’ Judge. Tabor said it was ‘extraordinary’ that the men had been able to run a. shop and set up the money transfer business when they were both illegal. overstayers and Asem was bankrupt. Asem. came to the UK on a visitor’s permit eight years ago and never left. His son was in the UK on a student permit which would not allow him to. work or run a business. Gloucester crown court heard that the service operated legitimately at first but the pair soon started stealing the money - which amounted to a total of £48,206. One of their customers, retired Khadijabbi Mulla, lost £1,000 he requested to be transferred to India to pay for his operation there. Prosecutor Lisa Hennessy said: 'He was told it would take 8 weeks, which would take him close to the date of his operation. 'When he got to India he still had not received the promised PIN number to access his money. 'He. contacted a friend in Gloucester to ask him to complain and the message. he got back was that he would get a refund when he got back. Jailed: Siyed Asem and Syed Bukhari were sentenced to two years in prison at Gloucester Crown Court. 'He has never received a refund - as he puts it he has just had lots of excuses and delays.' Mrs Hennessy said another victim of the con, Fatima Kazi, paid the men £1,500 to be transferred to India to help fund the building of a mosque in her late father’s memory. Mrs Hennessy continued: 'The money never arrived.' She detailed how other customers lost money in similar transactions - Runara Begum and her husband lost almost £5,500 which was supposed to be going to Bangladesh; Rashid Salloo lost £1,000 destined for India; Yusuf Chand transferred £7,000 to India in two transactions but it never arrived. There were other customers who had transferred significant sums and either received nothing or were given very small refunds, she added. Mrs Hennessy said all the offences occurred within a few months between late 2010 and early 2011 after Bukhari applied in October 2010 to become an agent for Finit UK, a Western Union money transfer company. The application was granted and he was approved after ‘various checks had been carried out’. Mrs Hennessy told the court the fact that both men were illegal immigrants didn't appear to 'have come up on the checks'. She added that they also failed to notice that Asem had been made bankrupt in 2008. Fraud: The pair set up a Western Union money transfer service but stole thousands of pounds from customers that was meant to be sent to India. Bukhari admitted 11 offences of fraud - of masking false representations to customers that his money transfer business was in a sound financial position and that money would be transferred at a preferential rate of exchange - between January and March 2011. Asem admitted 12 similar charges. Mrs Hennessy said Bukhari was responsible for £33,688 of the total fraud and Asem £14,518. Sabhia Pathan, defending, said Bukhari had come to Britain legitimately to study to be a chartered accountant but had started working at McDonald’s to earn some money and then had opened the shop with his father. Asem had trusted his son’s business acumen and joined him in the venture but the money transfer service had quickly gone wrong because they were offering such good exchange rates that they made no profit, she said. Ms Pathan said that Western Union had checked only Bukhari’s credit rating before allowing him to set up the service. She added that both men knew they were facing deportation after their sentences and Asem was fearful of going back to Pakistan because he has health problems which are better treated here. Despite his status he has been getting free medication, she said. Jailing the men, Judge Tabor said: 'Over a period of three months you stole just under £50,000 from many members of your local community. 'That money was entrusted to you to transfer abroad for a variety of purposes including allowing people to have operations and to help with a mosque and other charitable tasks. 'People trusted you, especially you, father, because of the seniority that you held. I accept that when you started this business in November you ran it legitimately for a short period of time. 'But by the middle of January you were nothing more or less than confidence tricksters. You have done considerable damage to your community and you know it. 'These were despicable offences.' He told them police will now investigate their finances to see what can be confiscated from them under the Proceeds of Crime Act.","completion":"A man from Pakistan and his son had a little store in the UK, even though they weren't allowed to be there. They also had a money transfer business that let people send money to other countries like India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. But instead of sending the money, they kept it for themselves. They took almost £50,000 from over 20 people who trusted them. A judge said this was very bad and sent them to jail for two years. After they finish their time in jail, they might have to go back to their own country.

Question: What does Sara reveal to Grady? Title: Wonder Boys Movie plot: Professor Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) is a novelist who teaches creative writing at an unnamed Pittsburgh university (the movie was shot chiefly in and around Carnegie Mellon). He is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), whose husband, Walter (Richard Thomas), is the chairman of the English department in which Grady is a professor. Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending. The book runs to over two and a half thousand pages and is still far from finished. He spends his free time smoking marijuana. Grady's students include James Leer (Tobey Maguire) and Hannah Green (Katie Holmes). Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers. Hannah, who rents a room in Grady's large house, is attracted to Grady, but he does not reciprocate. James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing fiction more than he first lets on. During a party at the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is pregnant with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when he finds it attacking Grady. James also steals a very valuable piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal. Gradually, he realizes that much of what James tells him about himself and his life is untrue, and is seemingly designed to elicit Grady's sympathy.

Step 2: Introduce the characters - Paul and Amanda Kirby: A seemingly wealthy couple - Detective Alex Foster: A seasoned NYPD investigator - Elizabeth Whitman: A journalist covering the story - Charles and Isabella Harrington: Friends of the Kirby family Step 3: Create the main plot The movie begins with an impressive fundraiser hosted by Paul and Amanda Kirby at their opulent Manhattan penthouse. The event is attended by high-society members, including their friends Charles and Isabella Harrington. As the guests settle, they are captivated by the incredible art collection and expensive furnishings, as well as the elegance of the couple. However, something feels off about the couple - their story has inconsistencies and their past is shrouded in mystery. Step 4: Introduce the conflict A week after the fundraiser, a major art heist occurs in the city. Several valuable paintings are stolen, including an artwork that was displayed at the Kirby's penthouse during the event. Suspicion rises, and Detective Alex Foster is assigned to the case. Journalist Elizabeth Whitman also takes an interest in the case, as she recalls interviewing Paul and Amanda at the fundraiser and noting their peculiar behavior. Step 5: Investigate the leads Detective Foster and Elizabeth separately start uncovering details about the Kirby's past. They discover that Paul and Amanda are not who they claim to be – they are, in fact, impostors who stole the real Paul and Amanda's identity to gain access to high society. Step 6: Explore subplots - Foster and Elizabeth begin to develop feelings for each other as they work towards solving the case. - Charles and Isabella are revealed to be part of an international crime syndicate that deals in stolen art. - The real Paul and Amanda were killed and replaced by the impostors to initiate the heist.

With the help of back-up from his precinct, Detective Foster apprehends the criminals, retrieving the stolen art and avenging the real Kirby couple. Step 8: Resolution The conspirators are charged, and the stolen art is returned to its rightful owners. Foster and Elizabeth acknowledge their feelings for each other, and their shared experience brings them closer together. The events prompt societal elites to reevaluate their lives and the value they place on material goods. Consequently, they become more aware of their surroundings and the intentions of those around them.

Kathleen Mary Ferrier, CBE (22 April 1912 – 8 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles.

Given the question \\"How would you describe Austin?\\", is \\"no non-sense\\" a valid answer? A:","completion":"If we're analyzing the question, \\"How would you describe Austin?\\", we can certainly argue that \\"no non-sense\\" would be a valid answer, considering the context we've been given. Although the answer options provided, \\"Yes\\" and \\"No,\\" would not seem ideal for this type of question, we can still elaborate on the reasoning behind selecting \\"no non-sense\\" as a valid description of Austin's character. Based on the given information, Austin made Sydney choose between two seemingly opposite options: attending a party or spending the night studying. It's clear from this that Austin has a preference for clear-cut decisions and acknowledges the need for balance between academic responsibilities and social life. This shows a sense of pragmatism on Austin's part, which is in line with the \\"no non-sense\\" characterization. Furthermore, the fact that Austin is presented as someone who makes people choose between two distinct options could also imply that their approach to problem-solving is streamlined, rational, and direct. This further supports the notion that Austin has a \\"no non-sense\\" attitude. In addition, a \\"no non-sense\\" individual is typically characterized as someone who is straightforward, honest, and practical. Such a person is more likely to be focused on achieving goals and making well-thought-out decisions, even if it means sacrificing short-term pleasures. By making Sydney choose between attending the party and studying, Austin can be seen as prioritizing the consequences of each option and promoting a rational decision-making process. Therefore, given the context and information provided, it is reasonable to describe Austin as a \\"no non-sense\\" person, as they evidently exhibit traits and behaviors synonymous with this characterization. Although the answer options of \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\" do not directly describe Austin, we can gather that \\"no non-sense\\" would indeed be an appropriate and valid way to describe Austin's character."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Battle of the Kasserine Pass Answer:","completion":"Title: Beyond the Kasserine Pass Genre: War, Drama, History, Action Plot: \\"Beyond the Kasserine Pass\\" is a riveting war drama set during World War II. It follows the story of General George S. Patton, who is tasked with relieving the strategic town of Bastogne during the blistering winter of 1944. Surprisingly, the script takes a creative spin, setting the pivotal moment during the Battle of the Kasserine Pass – a historical encounter from 1943 in Tunisia, North Africa. The film commences with the German forces, backed by Colonel Von Litzow and Lieutenant Colonel Max, breaking through the weak Axis defenses. They inflict heavy losses on the Allies in the process, especially the American forces. The Kasserine Pass serves as a vital hub to win the control of Tunisia. Meanwhile, the town of Bastogne in Belgium falls under siege from the German forces. General Patton, played by a charismatic actor, steps in as the newly appointed commander of II Corps American forces after their devastating defeats early in the North African campaign. Patton vehemently seeks to reinvigorate the shattered morale of his troops and build a stronger defense for the Allies. Preparing for a counteroffensive, Patton leads his forces to Kasserine Pass, confronting the Germans in a desperate bid to maintain control. The heroes of the story, a group of soldiers led by Sergeant Thompson, play a key role in executing Patton's daring tactical plans to fend off the enemy. As the intense battle rages on, the Allies finally achieve victory at Kasserine Pass, setting them on their path to liberate Tunisia. However, crucial photos taken by a reconnaissance plane reveal a plot by the Germans to launch a devastating attack on Bastogne. When General Eisenhower entrusts Patton with the secret responsibility of liberating the vital Belgian town, Patton and his forces must prepare themselves for another seemingly impossible task. The gripping climax focuses on Patton and his troops' efforts to relieve Bastogne, mirroring the excitement and intensity of the battles at Kasserine Pass. As the stakes rise, the protagonists demonstrate camaraderie, resilience, and strategic brilliance—showcasing the true American spirit. Their relentless pursuit gains the admiration of Allied forces, marking a pivotal turning point of the war. Ultimately, \\"Beyond the Kasserine Pass\\" offers a thrilling blend of historical fiction and wartime drama. It creatively explores the lesser-known Battle of the Kasserine Pass while integrating the infamous, freezing siege of Bastogne. This powerful tale highlights the bravery and strategic finesse of General George S.

A metal-halide lamp is an electrical lamp that produces light by an electric arc through a gaseous mixture of vaporized mercury and metal halides (compounds of metals with bromine or iodine). It is a type of high-intensity discharge (HID) gas discharge lamp. Developed in the 1960s, they are similar to mercury vapor lamps, but contain additional metal halide compounds in the quartz arc tube, which improve the efficiency and color rendition of the light. The most common metal halide compound used is sodium iodide. Once the arc tube reaches its running temperature, the sodium dissociates from the iodine, adding orange and reds to the lamp's spectrum from the sodium D line as the metal ionizes. As a result, metal-halide lamps have high luminous efficacy of around 75--100 lumens per watt, which is about twice that of mercury vapor lights and 3 to 5 times that of incandescent lights and produce an intense white light. Lamp life is 6,000 to 15,000 hours. As one of the most efficient sources of high CRI white light, metal halides as of 2005 were the fastest growing segment of the lighting industry. They are used for wide area overhead lighting of commercial, industrial, and public spaces, such as parking lots, sports arenas, factories, and retail stores, as well as residential security lighting and automotive headlamps (xenon headlights).

A pond is an example of standing water. But most ponds are fed by springs or brooks and most have an outlet. Thus some current of changing water flows through them. On the other hand, a river is an example of flowing water. In some places, however, a river may have such a slow current that it is very difficult to detect. Standing inland waters differ in size, in age, and in many _ environmental characteristics. They range in size from roadside puddles to the Caspian Sea.

The unexpected closure of the brand has left customers questioning the stability of celebrity-backed fashion startups and the reliability of these labels. In this article, we will delve into the factors that contributed to the fashion label’s downfall and analyze the possible future implications for both customers and the fashion industry. The Fashion Label’s Rise to Fame The brand in question launched its business by targeting younger, fashion-forward audiences eager to wear clothing favored by their favorite celebrities. With A-list stars endorsing the label and modeling their products, the company quickly gained traction and widespread fame. The use of famous faces quickly translated to an increase in sales, as customers assumed that the celebrity support would translate to guaranteed quality and style. However, the fashion label's moment in the spotlight was short-lived. Despite its initial success, the company faced challenges and criticism, only to soon go bankrupt. Customers who had heavily invested in their products were left feeling misguided by the very same celebrities who had lured them into trying the brand in the first place. Reasons Behind the Brand's Collapse Several factors contributed to the downfall of the celeb-backed fashion label. Some of these factors include: 1. Overdependence on Celebrity Endorsements: The label relied heavily on celebrity partnerships to drive sales and brand awareness. This dependence on superstars likely led to an imbalance in the brand's marketing efforts, with too much focus on the fleeting fame of the endorsers rather than the actual products. 2. Inadequate Focus on Product Quality and Innovation: The brand's management may have overlooked the importance of maintaining high product quality standards. With the excessive emphasis on celebrity endorsement, the company is likely to have failed to consistently innovate and evolve their product offerings in a competitive market. 3. Mismanagement of Finances: The heavy use of celebrity endorsements and prolific marketing campaigns might have put a significant strain on the company's finances. Inadequate financial planning, coupled with the high cost of signing celebrities, probably overwhelmed the company's budget, leading to its eventual collapse. 4. Customer Dissatisfaction: The combination of subpar products, untimely deliveries, and unresponsive customer service resulted in an increasing number of disgruntled customers. As these unhappy customers voiced their complaints on social media and other platforms, the brand's reputation took a hit, further translating to a decrease in customers' trust and willingness to make purchases. The Ripple Effect on Customers and the Fashion Industry The brand’s surprising bankruptcy has left its loyal customers feeling deceived, outraged, and uncertain about future purchases from other celebrity-endorsed fashion labels. Not only did these individuals invest their hard-earned money into the brand's products, but they also unknowingly placed their trust in celebrities who may not have had adequate knowledge about the label's core values and management. This turn of events has prompted customers to reconsider their buying choices, particularly when influenced by celebrity endorsements. Many are now questioning the authenticity of endorsements and the celebrities' actual involvement in the brands they promote. The fashion industry can also feel the reverberations from the debacle. It serves as a wake-up call for other fashion startups and even established brands, making them reevaluate their marketing strategies and the reliance on celebrity influencer campaigns. Brands must now strive to strike a balance between leveraging celebrity power and focusing on quality control, customer service, and overall brand value. Conclusion The unexpected bankruptcy of the celebrity-endorsed fashion label has ignited a fierce debate over the efficacy of celebrity partnerships and the importance of establishing a strong brand identity before leveraging the power of famous faces. As customers are left fuming, their trust in celebrity-backed fashion labels is wavering. The fashion industry must learn from this example and refocus its efforts on delivering excellent products and customer experiences rather than merely using popular figures as pawns for marketing purposes. This shift in the approach will be crucial to maintain consumers' trust and ensure the longevity and success of fashion labels worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: so are you gonna do that Sentence 2: Your not going to do it. pick from the following. - yes; - it is not possible to tell; - no; Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. In analyzing both sentences, we can see that they express separate thoughts and do not necessarily follow one another in a logical sequence. Sentence 1: \\"So are you gonna do that?\\" This sentence is a question, inquiring whether the subject (presumably the AI or another person) will perform a particular action or task. The question format implies uncertainty about whether or not the action will indeed be done. Sentence 2: \\"Your not going to do it.\\" This sentence is a statement, asserting that the subject will not be completing the task or action. The tone here is more decisive, as the speaker is conveying their certainty that the action will not be performed. Now let's consider the options provided: yes, it is not possible to tell, and no. To answer whether the second sentence is entailed by the first, it is important to understand what entailment means. Entailment occurs when the truth of one statement guarantees the truth of another statement. In this case, we are checking if the first sentence guarantees the truth of the second sentence. As the first sentence is a question exhibiting uncertainty, and the second sentence is a conclusive assertion, there is no guarantee that the truth of one will automatically result in the truth of the other. The two sentences do not share a dependently logical relationship entailing one another. Therefore, the answer is \\"no,\\" as the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 2*j = 5*j + 12 for j.","completion":"To find the solution for the equation 2*j = 5*j + 12, we'll perform the following steps: Step 1: Rearrange the equation so that all terms involving \\"j\\" are on one side, and constants are on the other side. This allows for a clearer way to isolate the variable we're solving for. Subtract 2*j from both sides of the equation. This will isolate the j term on one side of the equation. This leaves us with: 0 = 5*j - 2*j + 12 Step 2: Simplify the left side, which combines the like terms 5*j and -2*j to 3*j. This leaves us with: 0 = 3*j + 12 Step 3: Next, subtract 12 from both sides of the equation. This will isolate the j term completely on one side of the equation. This leaves us with: -12 = 3*j Step 4: Finally, we want to solve for j. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of j, which is 3. This gives us the final solution: j = -12 / 3 Thus, the solution for the given equation is: j = -4 This solution is justifiable as it satisfies original equation 2*j = 5*j + 12. When substitute j = -4 in original equation, both sides of the equation will be equal confirming the correctness of found solution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I am hoping that the weather is lovely today. How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","completion":"The linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence, \\"I am hoping that the weather is lovely today,\\" can be evaluated by examining several aspects such as its syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and overall coherence. In order to provide a detailed analysis, let us break down each component individually. 1. Syntax: Syntax involves the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-structured sentences in a language. In this particular sentence, the syntax seems to be appropriate and follows standard English grammar rules. The subject of the sentence is \\"I,\\" the verb is \\"am hoping,\\" and the object is the entire dependent clause \\"that the weather is lovely today.\\" The conjunction \\"that\\" is used correctly to introduce the dependent clause, which functions as the object of the main clause. Overall, the sentence has a clear and properly structured syntax. 2. Semantics: Semantics is the branch of linguistics concerned with meaning. In this sentence, the semantics are quite clear. The speaker is expressing their desire or hope that the current day's weather is pleasant. The use of the word \\"lovely\\" indicates a positive judgment of the weather situation. There is no apparent ambiguity in the meaning, and the concepts expressed are understandable and relevant. 3. Pragmatics: Pragmatics is the study of how context influences the interpretation of meaning. The pragmatic aspect of the sentence can be interpreted in several ways. For instance, the sentence could be a simple statement of the speaker's hope for pleasant weather, without any further connotations. Alternatively, it can also be interpreted as an expression made during a conversation with someone else, to express optimism or even start a conversation on the topic of the weather. In either case, the sentence is appropriate and functions well in conveying the intended meaning. 4. Overall coherence: Considering syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, the sentence demonstrates a high level of linguistic integrity. It is a well-structured sentence with clear meaning, and its components work together harmoniously to provide an easily understandable and relevant expression of the speaker's hope for pleasant weather. Additionally, the sentence is free from any spelling or punctuation errors. In conclusion, the sentence \\"I am hoping that the weather is lovely today\\" possesses strong linguistic integrity, as it is well-formed, comprehensible, contextually relevant, and coherent. It effectively communicates the speaker's desire for pleasant weather and adheres to the standard rules of English grammar, making it an appropriate and valid construction within the language."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you need to provide the parts-of-speech tag of a word present in a sentence specified within curly braces ( '{{ ... }}' ). The parts-of-speech tags are coarse labels that represent a category of words with similar grammatical properties. The list of part-of-speech tags i.e. tagset of this corpus is 'ADJ': Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their properties or attributes, 'ADP': Adposition is a cover term for prepositions and postpositions, 'ADV': Adverbs are words that typically modify verbs for such categories as time, place, direction or manner, 'AUX': An auxiliary is a function word that accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, voice or evidentiality, 'CCONJ': A coordinating conjunction is a word that links words or larger constituents without syntactically subordinating one to the other and expresses a semantic relationship between them, 'DET': Determiners are words that modify nouns or noun phrases and express the reference of the noun phrase in context, 'INTJ': An interjection is a word that is used most often as an exclamation or part of an exclamation, 'NOUN': Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing, animal or idea, 'NUM': A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner, adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction, 'PART': Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal parts of speech, 'PRON': Pronouns are words that substitute for nouns or noun phrases, whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic context, 'PROPN': A proper noun is a noun (or nominal content word) that is the name (or part of the name) of a specific individual, place, or object, 'PUNCT': Punctuation marks are non-alphabetical characters and character groups used in many languages to delimit linguistic units in printed text, 'SCONJ': A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the status of a (subordinate) clause, 'SYM': A symbol is a word-like entity that differs from ordinary words by form, function or both, 'VERB': A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause, 'X': The tag X is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned a real part-of-speech category.

Inside the most blinged-out proms Since she made a pact to go with her best guy friend sophomore year, Olivia Perrault, a senior at St. John’s Prep in Astoria, has fantasized about prom. “Prom is the big one — we don’t really have school dances,” explains the 18-year-old East Elmhurst resident, whose big day was held at The Pierre hotel earlier this month. A lot of pressure rides on prom — but with social media, the whole world is watching, not just classmates. Olivia Perrault wowed her prom date, Tommy Turkovic — and Instagram. But her big night came at a cost, totaling over 4,000.Photo: Angela Domingo For the grand event, Perrault sported a sophisticated chignon from the Louis Licari salon on Fifth Avenue, where she spent 700 for a cut, highlights and style. “My hair was really important to me,” admits the blonde, who normally wears her long locks cascading down. The bling and bulging budget didn’t end there. When she stepped into the sleek Mercedes S550 with her date and another friend (100 each), the Pace-bound biochemistry student stunned in 3,000 Swarovski crystal-encrusted Louboutins. “Honestly, it was crazy!” she says. “We felt like movie stars.” Prom isn’t an easy — or cheap — proposition these days. After all, you have Instagram followers (600 strong for Perrault) to think about. “I posted my prom pictures on Instagram and one got 143 likes,” she gushes. “Of course, it’s a great feeling.” When teens manage carefully curated Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts, the presence of social media in their lives drives this trend to spend — forcing them to up the ante on prom for their thousands of rapt social media followers. “Teens can research everything and compare themselves to their peers, which further escalates the anticipation, but can also add to the pressure of looking great for the big night,” says Mary Kate Steinmiller, senior fashion market editor of Teen Vogue. While a recent study revealed that families are shelling out 14 percent less on proms this year — with costs dipping to 978 and spending expected to drop 27 percent in the Northeast — local teens are still looking to stand out with one or two enviable touches.

When Amy Perez is schlepping home after 9 p.m. on the hourlong 5 train ride back to The Bronx from Soho, where she works in a trendy boutique several days a week, she tries to keep her goal in mind: prom. “The main reason I got a job last year was for this,” says Perez, 18, a senior at University Heights High School. Instead of an off-the-rack dress for her big day, Perez is commissioning a custom gown from her favorite designer on Instagram, Manuel Palferez. “I shopped since junior year for a dress,” says the fussy fashionista of her nearly two-year-long hunt for an unforgettable outfit. “Everybody really tries to look better than everybody else — no one wants to look the same or similar.” So she’s shelling out 720 for a custom-made red-and-nude lace number with a high-slit leg. “I wanted it to fit my body exactly,” says Perez. “It’s crazy, but I told my mom we’d go half-and-half on it.” “I’m not materialistic or anything, but I like to look my best.” That price tag doesn’t include shoes, hair and makeup — or ticket cost, transportation and after-party. All told, Perez will spend around 1,200. (She says she plans to resell the dress to recoup some of her expenses.) “My Instagram is going to blow up,” she predicts of her feed post-prom. Perrault spent 700 on her hair alone, for a cut, highlights and style.Photo: Angela Domingo But not all teens are drinking — or buying — the very expensive Kool-Aid, so to speak. “Social media is definitely a part of the hype for going all-out for prom. It’s more acceptable to post about your expensive night rather than brag about it — it makes being pretentious OK,” says Joeann Salvati, a senior at Bronx Science. “Most people want to show their followers they had a good time, almost as if their ‘likes’ are reassurance.” The 17-year-old from Ozone Park, who holds down two jobs, was almost priced out of her prom next month at the Waldorf-Astoria, with an eye-popping 220 individual ticket. Many of her classmates are shelling out serious dough on hotel rooms and boat cruises après-prom, causing some of her friends to opt out altogether in favor of a trip to the beach. But in the end, she decided to splurge. “Personally, like most typical teenage girls, I can’t imagine saying no to a traditional prom night, regardless of its price tag.” Guys don’t get off much easier. Bronx senior Nicholas Pollard of University Heights High School has held down a cashier job for 20 hours a week since November — how else to pay for the pricey sunglasses and designer watch he plans to unveil at prom? He’s looking at a minimum 600 for prom and related accoutrement. Bronx senior Nicholas Pollard shops for wrist bling at Shinola.Photo: Astrid Stawiarz “I need a new watch — I’m looking at Michael Kors or Movado — I want to look good!” says Pollard, who’s shopping at downtown watch mecca Shinola. “A lot of the guys want the designer watch,” he notes. Add that to the designer sunglasses prom-bound guys are coveting, and the pressure they feel to look a certain part stacks right up with that felt by their notoriously competitive female counterparts. “Girls always try to outdo each other with dresses,” concedes 18-year-old Pollard. “But for the guys, we have to look good, too.” You can’t blame him for not wanting to disappoint his 1,000-strong Instagram following: “These pictures are going straight to Instagram,” he says. But what’s an entire life’s savings when it comes to the night of your life? “It’s the last time being together and socializing like that,” says Pollard. “It’s going to be an amazing night, but not a cheap night.” Summary:","completion":"This news article is about how some high school students are spending lots of money on their prom outfits and accessories.

Question: Given the following passage \\"In his book, Humanism (1997), Tony Davies calls these critics \\"humanist anti-humanists\\". Critics of antihumanism, most notably Jürgen Habermas, counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own. Others, like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German \\"race\\" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists. Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century \\"it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them\\". For \\"it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason\\". Yet, he continues, \\"it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution. The freedom to speak and write, to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests, to protest and disobey: all these can only be articulated in humanist terms.\\"\\", answer the following question.

This is the preferred treatment recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics for mild to moderate dehydration. Plan to restore your child’s fluid levels over the course of three to four hours. Use a commercial electrolyte solution such as Pedialyte. These solutions have sugar and salt electrolytes to help prevent low blood sugar. It is possible to make your own rehydration solutions, but due to the possibility of error, it is generally safer to use commercial solutions. Give your child 1–2 teaspoons (5–10 ml) of the solution every few minutes. You can use a spoon or an oral syringe (does not contain a needle). Start off slow; too much fluid at once can cause nausea or vomiting. If your child vomits, wait 30 minutes before starting again. If your child is dehydrated, he will probably need to have the electrolyte balance in the bloodstream restored. Sodas and juices may cause hyponatremia, or low blood sodium, in children. Plain water also does not contain enough electrolytes to replenish your child’s body because children have a much faster electrolyte turnover than adults. Sodas may also contain caffeine, which is a diuretic and can further dehydrate the child. Juices may have too much sugar and can make dehydration worse in young children. This is also true for sports drinks such as Gatorade. Sports drinks can be diluted with water — mix one part water with one part Gatorade. Other fluids to avoid include milk, clear broths, tea, ginger ale, and Jell-O. If your baby is still breastfeeding, try to persuade the infant to breastfeed. This will help restore the baby’s electrolyte and fluid levels and will also help further fluid loss through diarrhea. You can use oral rehydration solution in between breast feeding if your infant is very dehydrated; however, you should be taking your infant to the emergency room if she's severely dehydrated. Do not use formula during the rehydration period. Once your child has had the initial fluids restored, you need to make sure that the child continues to get enough fluid for the next 24 hours. The American Association of Family Physicians recommends the following formula: Infants should receive 1 ounce of oral rehydration solution per hour. Toddlers (ages 1–3) should receive 2 ounces of oral rehydration solution per hour. Older children (over 3) should receive 3 ounces of oral rehydration solution per hour. To make sure that rehydration is working, check the color of your child’s urine. As with adults’ urine, healthy children should have pale, clear yellow urine. Very clear or colorless urine could be a sign of overhydration. Ease up on the fluids for a bit to make sure that you don’t throw off your child’s sodium balance. If the urine is amber or darker, continue with the rehydration treatment. Summary:","completion":"To treat mild to moderate dehydration in children, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends using commercial electrolyte solutions like Pedialyte over a three to four-hour period, avoiding sodas, juices, and sports drinks, and monitoring the child's urine color for effective rehydration."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It also suggests that honesty is less important to a country’s current economic growth than during earlier periods in history. The study examined whether people from different countries were more or less honest and how this related to a country’s economic development. More than 1500 participants from 15 countries took part in an online survey involving two incentivised experiments, designed to measure honest behaviour. Firstly, they were asked to flip a coin and state whether it landed on ‘heads’ or ‘tails’. They knew if they reported that it landed on heads, they would be rewarded with 3 or 5. If the proportion reporting heads was more than 50 per cent in a given country, this indicated that people were being dishonest. The same participants were then asked to complete a music quiz where they were again rewarded financially if they answered all questions correctly. They were asked not to search for the answers on the internet, and had to tick a box confirming they had answered on their own before moving on to the next question. Three of the questions were deliberately difficult so it would be highly likely that participants would need to look up the answer - getting more than one of these questions right indicated cheating. Data from the tests was compared to estimate whether people from particular countries were more likely to tell the truth. The countries studied - Brazil, China, Greece, Japan, Russia, Switzerland, Turkey, the United States, Argentina, Denmark, the United Kingdom, India, Portugal, South Africa, and South Korea - were chosen to provide a mix of regions, levels of development and levels of social trust. The study’s author Dr David Hugh-Jones, of UEA’s School of Economics, found evidence for dishonesty in all the countries, but that levels varied significantly across them. For example, estimated dishonesty in the coin flip ranged from 3.4 per cent in the UK to 70 per cent in China. In the quiz, respondents in Japan were the most honest, followed by the UK, while those in Turkey were the least truthful. Participants were also asked to predict the average honesty of those from other countries by guessing how many respondents out of 100 from a particular country would report heads in the coin flip test. However, participants’ beliefs about other countries’ honesty did not reflect reality. Dr Hugh-Jones, a senior lecturer in economics, will present his findings today at the London Experimental Workshop conference, hosted by Middlesex University London. “Differences in honesty were found between countries, but this did not necessarily correspond to what people expected,\\" he said. \\"Beliefs about honesty seem to be driven by psychological features, such as self-projection. Surprisingly, people were more pessimistic about the honesty of people in their own country than of people in other countries. One explanation for this could be that people are more exposed to news stories about dishonesty taking place in their own country than in others.” In the coin flip test, the four least honest countries were China, Japan, South Korea and India. However, Asian countries were not significantly more dishonest than others in the quiz, where Japan had the lowest level of dishonesty. Dr Hugh-Jones said the difference between Asian and other countries in the coin flip may be explained by cultural views specific to this type of test, such as attitudes to gambling, rather than differences in honesty as such. People expected Greece to be the least honest country but in the coin flip it was one of the most honest, while in the quiz it ranked in the middle. Of the respondents who expected less honesty in their own country, Greece and China were the most pessimistic. Another finding was that less honest respondents also expected others to be less honest, as, unexpectedly, did those from more honest countries. Dr Hugh-Jones said there was increasing interest in the cultural and behavioural roots of economic development. He found that while the honesty of countries related to their economic growth - poor countries were less honest than rich ones - this relationship was stronger for growth that took place before 1950. “I suggest that the relationship between honesty and economic growth has been weaker over the past 60 years and there is little evidence for a link between current growth and honesty,” said Dr Hugh-Jones. “One explanation is that when institutions and technology are underdeveloped, honesty is important as a substitute for formal contract enforcement. Countries that develop cultures putting a high value on honesty are able to reap economic gains. Later, this economic growth itself improves institutions and technology, making contracts easier to monitor and enforce, so that a culture of honesty is no longer necessary for further growth.” Dr Hugh-Jones added: “People’s beliefs about the honesty of their fellow citizens, and those in other countries, may or may not be accurate, and these beliefs can affect how they interact. For example, a country’s willingness to support debt bailouts may be affected by stereotypes about people in the countries needing help. So it is important to understand how these beliefs are formed.” Dr David Hugh-Jones’ study ‘Honesty and beliefs about honesty in 15 countries’ was funded by a British Academy Leverhulme Small Research Grant.

I am familiar with the type of person who gets into hooliganism and I know just how they act and how they speak. Have to say this is a bad, bad movie. I can tell you that Green Street is one of the most unrealistic movies I have ever seen. I spent most of the movie cringing with embarrassment. I felt I should write a mini review because I felt I needed to point out a few things. a) People just don't talk like that in London in real life; the filmmakers took the whole slang thing too far and made it sound stupid. Unfortunately hooligan types do exist, but those you see in Green Street are more like parodies. b) The actor who plays Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam) unfortunately sounded about as 'English' or 'Cockney' as Osama Bin Laden. He's from up north in Newcastle and I'm just amazed any of the other actors could keep straight face acting alongside him - how are we supposed to take him seriously. Why they didn't just get someone from East London to play that part is beyond me. I could have done 'a bang up job' myself, hehe. c) Mr Frodo. I mean how can I be expected to take seriously Elijah Wood kicking the ass of people twice his size and who are genuinely nasty hooligans. He'd be dead. Simple as that. Honestly (as a Brit) it was hard to watch this film. I'm pretty sure this film will bomb here in the UK. It may do a little better in the states because the Americans just wont know (or care) how inaccurate it is. Please my American and foreign friends, don't believe a word of this nonsense. Yes these firms do exist but it's all extremely underground and hush hush, and on a vastly smaller scale. The movie only gets a 2 from me because they actually filmed some of it in London.

Select from: (A). ice wedging (B). hot and cold (C). rain and runoff (D). Condensation (E). rice and beans (F). Physical weathering (G). flooding (H). ice and sun A:","completion":"Based on the provided information, Fact 1 states that lakes are formed by precipitation and runoff, and Fact 2 states that rain is also known as precipitation. Considering these two facts, we can determine that lakes are formed by rain and runoff, which corresponds to option (C). Lakes can be created by various natural processes, including precipitation and runoff. Precipitation occurs when atmospheric moisture falls to the Earth's surface due to condensation, while runoff is water that flows overland after precipitation has exceeded the land's ability to absorb the moisture. Rain, as stated in Fact 2, is one form of precipitation and is primarily composed of water droplets. When rain falls on the landscape, it can either infiltrate the ground or flow over the surface depending on the permeability of the soil, vegetation, and other landscape features. In some cases, the water may accumulate in a depression or a natural basin, gradually forming a lake as more and more water collects in the area. Over time, water in the lake can continue to rise with ongoing precipitation events, eventually reaching its capacity as a body of standing water. In conclusion, the correct answer, based on the given facts, is lakes are formed by rain and runoff, which corresponds to option (C)."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Question: Food on what kind of transport is normally freeze dried or dehydrated?

Here is an article: CURITIBA, Brazil A sweeping investigation into corruption in Brazil is targeting more infrastructure projects for this year's Olympic Games than previously made public, a federal prosecutor told Reuters, citing testimony from construction companies and executives. Carlos Lima said the probe into corruption on projects for the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in August was not limited to Porto Maravilha, or the \\"Marvelous Port\\", a regeneration of the city's waterfront that includes five high-rises bearing the name of U.S. property mogul and presidential candidate Donald Trump. \\"There are more,\\" Lima said in an interview in his office in the southern city of Curitiba on Monday. \\"There are leniency agreements underway that talk about this, but until they are finalized we will not know how many (projects) for sure.\\" Lima is a lead prosecutor on a task force that discovered a cartel of engineering firms siphoning kickbacks from state oil firm Petrobras (PETR4.SA) to political parties, a scandal fuelling a crisis that could force President Dilma Rousseff from power. His comments were the clearest indication yet that the Olympics has become a focus of the two-year-old investigation. The corruption allegations are not expected to hinder work on infrastructure for the Games, which is nearly finished, but they do further cloud an event set to start in the middle of Brazil's worst political and economic crises in decades. The lower house of Brazil's Congress, many of whose members are themselves under investigation for corruption, voted on Sunday to impeach Rousseff on charges she manipulated budget accounts. If the Senate agrees to put her on trial, as seems likely, Rousseff will be suspended for up to six months and would be unlikely to return to power. Five engineering firms are building most of the 39 billion reais (11 billion) worth of venues and infrastructure needed for the Olympics, the first to be held in South America. All five are under investigation for price fixing at Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as Petrobras is formally known. Latin America's largest engineering conglomerate, Odebrecht SA [ODBES.UL], which is at the center of the Petrobras scandal, is involved in over half of all Olympic projects by value, according to contracts reviewed by Reuters. Court files made public last month showed police uncovered documents from Odebrecht executives referencing 1 million reais in suspected bribes connected to the Porto Maravilha project and other kickbacks allegedly linked to a Rio metro line. More than 20 corporate developments are planned to revitalize Rio in the downtown Porto Maravilha area - the main legacy project of the Games - including hotels and the five Trump towers. They were announced in 2012 as the largest corporate development in any major emerging nation. Trump only sold naming rights and offered consulting on the high-rise project. Lima said the investigation of Porto Maravilha, like other Olympic projects, was now under the jurisdiction of prosecutors in Brasilia. That is because they involve potential kickbacks to sitting politicians, who under Brazilian law can only be judged by the Brasilia-based Supreme Court rather than Federal Judge Sergio Moro in Curitiba. The change in jurisdiction will likely slow the investigation. The Supreme Court has a backlog of some 50 politicians to investigate on charges that they received bribes, though Rousseff is not among them. \\"We collaborate, we work together, but the pace of the 13th district is one thing, the Supreme Court is another,\\" said Lima. The prosecutor's office in Brasilia declined to comment. Moro and the Curitiba-based prosecutors and police are famous across Brazil for swiftly and aggressively handling its largest-ever corruption probe. Their investigation has ensnared dozens of top businessmen and was cited by many lawmakers who voted in favor of Rousseff being impeached. Plea bargains and leniency deals, relatively new legal tools in Brazil, have been key to cracking the case and helping investigators find hard evidence. However, defense lawyers and some independent analysts have criticized the use of lengthy pre-trial detentions of dozens of suspects. Corruption allegations are now spreading to stadiums built for the 2014 World Cup and the Olympics, two events that were meant to showcase Brazil's rise as a modern global economic power. On March 22, the same day prosecutors publicly accused Odebrecht of graft involving World Cup stadiums and Porto Maravilha, the company said it would seek to collaborate with the investigation and aim for a leniency agreement and plea deals for its executives. The other four companies involved in much of the rest of the Olympic work are OAS SA [OAS.UL], Andrade Gutierrez SA, Queiroz Galvao SA, and Carioca Christiani Nielsen Engenharia SA. Odebrecht, Andrade Gutierrez and Queiroz Galvao declined to comment. The other companies did not respond to requests for comment. Lima did not specify which company or companies had mentioned Olympic projects in testimony. The city of Rio de Janeiro is overseeing the bulk of the Olympic construction projects, though a few are financed by the federal or state government and Rio 2016, the local organizing committee, handles some non-permanent structures like seating. Rio's city government said the contracts were mostly funded with private resources and that all bids were overseen by regulators. Rio 2016 referred Reuters to City Hall. The International Olympic Committee did not respond to request for comment.

Pick your answer from: a). negative b). positiveWould the following phrase be considered positive or negative? rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences , that glass 's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby .","completion":"Analyzing the phrase, it seems to lean more towards a negative connotation. Here's a detailed explanation as to why: 1. \\"Rhapsodize cynicism\\": The term \\"rhapsodize\\" implies enthusiasm or passion, while \\"cynicism\\" is associated with negativity, distrust, or skepticism. This combination suggests that the subject (in this case, the glass's dirgelike score) is filled with enthusiasm for negativity, which gives the phrase an overall negative impression. 2. \\"Repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences\\": Repetition is often perceived as boring or tedious, and the inclusion of \\"languorous slo-mo sequences\\" adds a sense of sluggishness or lethargy to the description. These characteristics contribute to the negative aspect of the phrase. 3. \\"Dirgelike score\\": A dirge is a slow, mournful, and often somber piece of music typically played at funerals. Describing the score as \\"dirgelike\\" emphasizes the dark, sad, or melancholic emotions associated with such a piece, which is another negative element in the phrase. 4. \\"Fang-baring lullaby\\": The juxtaposition of \\"fang-baring\\" and \\"lullaby\\" creates an unsettling image of something intended to be soothing (a lullaby) but is instead threatening or menacing (fang-baring). Instead of evoking comfort, the phrase generates an atmosphere of fear, which is another negative point. Based on these observations, it is more appropriate to categorize the phrase as negative. The combination of cynicism, repetition, languorous sequences, a dirgelike score, and a menacing lullaby creates a predominantly negative description that is far from positive or uplifting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? Has a boxer ever been knocked into a coma? What are the benefits of having sex?","completion":"No, the two questions asked do not share the same meaning at all. They discuss two completely separate and distinct topics - one being on the subject of boxing and potential physical harm involved, while the other explores the benefits of sexual activity. The first question, \\"Has a boxer ever been knocked into a coma?\\", is seeking to explore whether a boxing match has ever resulted in a participant falling into a state of coma due to injuries sustained during the match. It's a question about the risks associated with a specific physical contact sport. Boxing is known to be a sport with significant associated risks, as it involves direct, often extreme, physical contact. Therefore, the question is likely addressed towards finding out whether a worst-case scenario, such as a participant falling into a coma, has ever happened in the history of the sport. On the other hand, the second question, \\"What are the benefits of having sex?\\", is a topic rooted in areas such as biology, psychology, and even sociology. It's a question that can be broadly divided into two categories – physical benefits and emotional or psychological benefits. The physical benefits of sex include, but are not limited to, boosts to the immune system, improved heart health, enhanced physical fitness, pain relief, better sleep, and in some cases, increased longevity. From a psychological and emotional perspective, sex, particularly when it is with a loved partner, can lead to increased feelings of intimacy and bonding, improved self-esteem and happiness, reduction in stress and anxiety, and overall mental well-being. So, in answer to both questions: yes, boxers have unfortunately been knocked into comas in the past due to the extreme physicality of the sport, and yes, there are many benefits both physically and psychologically to having sex. But these two questions are completely distinct, addressing different topics with their own specific implications and details."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose orchestral skills had been building up throughout the decade, according to McVeagh? , can you please find it? Elgar was contemptuous of folk music and had little interest in or respect for the early English composers, calling William Byrd and his contemporaries \\"museum pieces\\". Of later English composers, he regarded Purcell as the greatest, and he said that he had learned much of his own technique from studying Hubert Parry's writings. The continental composers who most influenced Elgar were Handel, Dvořák and, to some degree, Brahms. In Elgar's chromaticism, the influence of Wagner is apparent, but Elgar's individual style of orchestration owes much to the clarity of nineteenth-century French composers, Berlioz, Massenet, Saint-Saëns and, particularly, Delibes, whose music Elgar played and conducted at Worcester and greatly admired.Elgar began composing when still a child, and all his life he drew on his early sketchbooks for themes and inspiration. The habit of assembling his compositions, even large-scale ones, from scraps of themes jotted down randomly remained throughout his life. His early adult works included violin and piano pieces, music for the wind quintet in which he and his brother played between 1878 and 1881, and music of many types for the Powick Asylum band. Diana McVeagh in Grove's Dictionary finds many embryonic Elgarian touches in these pieces, but few of them are regularly played, except Salut d'Amour and (as arranged decades later into The Wand of Youth Suites) some of the childhood sketches. Elgar's sole work of note during his first spell in London in 1889–91, the overture Froissart, was a romantic-bravura piece, influenced by Mendelssohn and Wagner, but also showing further Elgarian characteristics. Orchestral works composed during the subsequent years in Worcestershire include the Serenade for Strings and Three Bavarian Dances. In this period and later, Elgar wrote songs and partsongs. W. H. Reed expressed reservations about these pieces, but praised the partsong The Snow, for female voices, and Sea Pictures, a cycle of five songs for contralto and orchestra which remains in the...

Q:What is the answer for the question: What rank is held by Carol's husband? from the following article ? Lieutenant Commander Ken White orders the submarine Tiger Shark to dive to evade an aerial and surface attack. Crewman Boyer begs him to wait for the captain, Commander Josh Rice, still topside, but White refuses, and Rice (his good friend) and the quartermaster are lost. When they resurface shortly afterward, they discover that the war is over. No one other than Boyer, not even the captain's widow and father, blames him. White marries Carol and remains in the Navy after the war. Everything is fine, until one day he is assigned to show a reporter around who is doing a story about the mothballed Navy. By chance, the submarine that catches the journalist's attention is the Tiger Shark. The newsman remembers the tragic story of the last day of the war and mentions that the officer who ordered the dive \\"must feel like a heel\\", and White's feelings of guilt resurface, straining his marriage. Then Boyer is assigned to his unit. When Boyer sees White, he immediately requests a transfer. As it happens, the Tiger Shark is being recommissioned, so White sends him there. A fire breaks out on the submarine, trapping a man in a compartment. Boyer wants to charge in to his rescue, but White makes him go \\"by the book\\" and put on a protective suit first, fueling Boyer's hatred. White is about to resign from the Navy to escape the ghosts of his past, but changes his mind at the last moment. As a result, Carol decides to leave him. The North Koreans invade South Korea the same day, starting the Korean War. White is given command of the Tiger Shark. He sets sail from the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for the war as soon as the submarine is ready. Boyer is a disgruntled member of the crew.

Question 2: Will I die if I eat a bunch of Mentos and drink Coca Cola really fast? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1: Is it harmful to eat Mentos with soft drink, if yes then why? Eating Mentos and drinking a soft drink like Coca-Cola or Pepsi can lead to a rapid physical reaction due to the sudden release of carbon dioxide gas bubbles from the beverage. This sudden release is caused by the surface texture of the Mentos candy, which has many tiny pits, allowing carbon dioxide gas to nucleate around the candy very quickly. When carbon dioxide is released from the soft drink, it creates pressure and an explosive volume increase, causing foam to be produced. Although this reaction can be quite intense and create a huge mass of foam, the consumption of Mentos with a soft drink is generally not harmful if consumed in moderate amounts and not consumed rapidly. Consuming too much of this combination can cause stomach discomfort and bloating due to the gas created in the reaction. However, if the candy and the soft drink are consumed too quickly, it may cause intense pressure in the person's stomach, which can lead to discomfort and a small possibility of stomach rupture. The risk of stomach rupture is very minimal if you don't have any pre-existing gastrointestinal issues. In most cases, you would likely experience stomach pain or vomit before any severe damage would occur. Question 2: Will I die if I eat a bunch of Mentos and drink Coca Cola really fast? It is highly unlikely that you would die from eating a bunch of Mentos and drinking Coca Cola really fast. As mentioned earlier, the main risk comes from experiencing discomfort from the release of gas bubbles. In extremely rare cases, if you were to consume an excessive amount of this combination and had a pre-existing gastrointestinal condition, there could be a risk of stomach rupture, but the likelihood of this occurring is very minimal. It's important to note that if you were to consume excessive amounts of sugary soft drinks and Mentos continuously over an extended period, you could experience health complications such as obesity, dental problems, and other issues related to excessive sugar consumption. That is a separate concern from the gas-related discomfort caused by the rapid release of carbon dioxide gas bubbles when Mentos are combined with soda. To answer the final question, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 asks if it is harmful to eat Mentos with soft drinks and explains why there might be potential harm, while question 2 specifically asks if someone would die from consuming the combination quickly. The first question focuses on the potential harm, while the second question addresses the severity of potential consequences."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It may decrease bloating, pain, and other symptoms by softening your stools so that your body can pass them more easily. Good sources of fiber are fruits, vegetables, whole grain breads, and whole grain cereals. Try to eat something containing fiber with each meal. Add fiber to your diet slowly to minimize bloating and gas that can be brought on by a sudden increase in fiber. Work with your doctor and possibly a dietitian to find a diet that is healthy and that works for you. Sources of soluble fiber may also help, such as dried beans and other legumes, oats, barley, and berries. These work to slow down the passage of food from the stomach to the intestines. If you suffer from diarrhea caused by IBS, then this diet modification is not for you. You don't need to avoid fiber entirely — you need it as part of a healthy diet — just make sure you're eating soluble fiber (found in peas, oats, dried fruits, and more) rather than insoluble fiber (found in wheat, corn, the skins of root vegetables, and more). All of these can make IBS symptoms worse, including diarrhea. Specific foods to avoid are dairy, honey, chocolate, sugar-free candy and gums, and wheat and rye breads. Also, vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts may trigger bloating and gas. Beverages to avoid include alcoholic beverages, dairy, anything containing chocolate, anything with caffeine such as coffee, tea, and soda, and anything with fructose syrup. Even with the above guidelines, each body reacts differently to different foods. Elimination diets are a very effective way to pinpoint foods that trigger negative reactions. Make a list of possible food triggers, then eliminate one food at a time for 12 weeks. Another option is to try a gluten-free and/or a lactose-free diet, as these are common triggers for IBS symptoms. See if bloating and gas decrease. If you switch to either diet permanently, make sure to research and work with your doctor to ensure you're getting appropriate nutrition.","completion":"Fiber can help prevent IBS symptoms by improving intestinal functioning, with good sources including fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; however, individuals should consult their doctor and consider elimination diets to identify specific triggers and ensure proper nutrition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Against the supposition that forest fires in Alaska, Canada and Siberia warm the climate, scientists have discovered that cooling may occur in areas where burnt trees allow more snow to mirror more sunlight into space. This finding suggests that taking steps to prevent northern forest fires to limit the release of greenhouse gases may warm the climate in northern regions. Usually large fires destroyed forests in these areas over the past decade. Scientists predict that with climate warming, fires may occur more frequently over the next several centuries as a result of a longer fire season. Sunlight taken in by the earth tends to cause warming, while heat mirrored back into space tends to cause cooling. This is the first study to analyze all aspects of how northern fires influence climate. Earlier studies by other scientists have suggested that fire in northern regions speed up climate warming because greenhouse gases from burning trees and plants are released into the atmosphere and thus trap heat. Scientists found that right after the fire, large amounts of greenhouse gases entered the atmosphere and caused warming. Ozone levels increased, and ash from the fire fell on far-off sea ice, darkening the surface and causing more radiation from the sun to be taken in. The following spring, however, the land within the area of the fire was brighter than before the fire, because fewer trees covered the ground. Snow on the ground mirrored more sunlight back into space, leading to cooling. \\"We need to find out all possible ways to reduce the growth of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\\" Scientists tracked the change in the amount of radiation entering and leaving the climate system as a result of the fire, and found a measurement closely related to the global air temperature.

Scientists, however, found that when fire occurs more frequently, more radiation is lost from the earth and cooling results. Specifically, they determined when...

Austin didn't need their shoes anymore and didn't know what to do with them. Austin sold their shoes in the market. Given the context: What will happen to Austin? Possible answers: make some money, buy Austin's old shoes, get leave the market full Answer:","completion":"Austin will likely make some money from selling their shoes in the market. Since Austin no longer needs the shoes, selling them is a good way to repurpose the shoes and allow someone else to benefit from them. The decision to sell the shoes might have been influenced by various reasons such as the shoes being in good condition and having some value, or the desire to declutter and make space in their closet. When Austin sells their shoes in the market, it provides an opportunity for potential buyers who are looking for shoes like Austin's to purchase them. Buyers might be interested in such shoes for several reasons, including the shoes' design, brand, size, or simply a preference for second-hand shoes, which could be more affordable. Once the transaction is completed, Austin will earn some money from the sale. Depending on the shoe's condition and demand, the revenue generated can vary. Austin might use this income for various purposes, such as buying new shoes, saving it, or spending it on other necessities or leisure activities. Additionally, Austin's decision to sell their shoes aligns with sustainable practices. By giving these shoes a second life rather than throwing them away, they're reducing waste and promoting the importance of recycling and reusing items. This can have positive environmental impacts, as it reduces the demand for new shoes to be produced and conserves raw materials.

Cells are often referred to as the smallest living units that can perform all the functions necessary for life. They are the building blocks that make up all living organisms, from simple single-celled organisms like bacteria to more complex multicellular organisms such as plants, animals, and humans. There are two primary types of cells: prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotic cells are mainly found in bacteria and archaea, whereas eukaryotic cells comprise the cells of plants, animals, fungi, and protists. Prokaryotic cells are generally smaller and simpler in structure than eukaryotic cells. They lack a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Their genetic material (DNA) is organized within a region called the nucleoid, which is not surrounded by a membrane like the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotic cells reproduce through cell division called binary fission. Their relatively small size and simple organization allow them to reproduce very quickly and efficiently. Eukaryotic cells are more complex in structure and function compared to prokaryotic cells. They contain a true nucleus enclosed by a nuclear envelope, where the genetic material (DNA) is stored. Eukaryotic cells also possess membrane-bound organelles like the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and chloroplasts (in plant cells), which perform specific functions necessary for the survival and maintenance of the cell. Each organelle within a eukaryotic cell has a specific role in maintaining the cell's functionality. For example, the endoplasmic reticulum is involved in the synthesis and modification of proteins and lipids, while the Golgi apparatus sorts and packages these proteins and lipids for transport to other parts of the cell or secretion out of the cell. Mitochondria are responsible for producing the energy molecule, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which fuels various cellular processes through cellular respiration. Plant cells contain an additional organelle called the chloroplast, which is involved in photosynthesis, the process of converting light energy into chemical energy stored as glucose. Eukaryotic cells can also reproduce, albeit through more complex processes than those found in prokaryotic cells. They undergo mitosis (in somatic or body cells) and meiosis (in germ or sex cells) to ensure the proper division and inheritance of genetic material, respectively. In summary, the most basic unit of living things is the cell, which is the structural and functional unit of life. These cells can be classified into two main types: prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotes are simpler and smaller in structure, while eukaryotes possess a more complex organization with membrane-bound organelles. Each type of cell carries out various processes necessary for life, growth, and reproduction, while also building and maintaining the structure and function of all living organisms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Different sports: The statement specifically mentions tennis players, not soccer players. Tennis and soccer are two distinct sports with different primary objectives, rules, playing fields, and equipment. Soccer primarily involves kicking a ball with an aim to score goals, whereas tennis involves using rackets to strike a tennis ball back and forth across a net with the intention of scoring points. 2. Unusual action in context: The statement indicates that the tennis players are kicking the ball, which is not a typical action within the sport of tennis. In tennis, players primarily use rackets to strike or hit the ball. Kicking the ball is not a normal gameplay action in tennis, and it would not be valid to assume that this is a common situation that could be correlated with soccer. The statement may instead suggest an unusual or non-standard occurrence within a tennis game. 3. Misinterpretation of the context: Even if the fact that tennis players are kicking the ball might be associated with soccer players in some way, it is essential to consider the context in which the action is taking place. It could be a training session, a recreational activity, or simply breaking away from traditional game rules for fun. However, it would still be inadequate to assume that two soccer players are rushing to kick the ball based on the given statement. 4. Activities not analogous: The statement implies that the tennis players are already kicking the ball, whereas the conclusion suggests that soccer players are rushing towards the ball, presumably to kick it. These two actions are not equivalent, as one involves the act of kicking, while the other points to an intention or approach. In summary, it is not possible to conclude that \\"Two soccer players rush to kick the ball\\" based on the provided statement \\"Two tennis players are kicking the ball.\\" The sports are different and have varying objectives, actions, and equipment.

She had studied it in school, so she thought herself as an expert. I once had a neighbor who played it constantly, loudly, and badly, so I thought I knew it better. Malaquez tried to mediate, but I saw him as siding with Tasha. So, I think, did she. The subject shifted from music to Tasha's obsession with fame, undoubtedly by a leap that I made. She had no choice but to follow. (I do not remember any of this well, just now, nor do I care to. Those who are truly curious may look at the last act of \\"Captured Moments.\\") I remember suggesting, with characteristic tact, that she add Emil to her small list of major accomplishments. Malaquez glanced away, embarrassed. Tasha looked at me as if to say, \\"I will.\\" She said, \\"I feel sorry for you, Nardo. I'll see Emil home.\\" \\"Yes,\\" I said, \\"Do that,\\" and did not care what she did, or why. Emil asked, \\"You're all right?\\" I muttered something he must have interpreted as assent. They both walked up to Emil's home while I watched the scarlet moonlight ripple on distant waves. Disgusted with Tasha but more disgusted with myself, I finally realized she would not return that night and went into The Sleeping Flamingo to drink myself to sleep.

In this case, it states that \\"that\\" does not possess the trait of being consistent. - \\"consistent\\" translates to \\"johdonmukaista\\" in Finnish, which is an adjective describing something that follows a logical order or is characterized by consistency.

What is the correct answer to this question? Pick from: (a). limestone caverns. (b). marine fossils. (c). abrasion of surface rocks. (d). peeling slabs of rock....A:","completion":"The correct answer to this question is (c). abrasion of surface rocks. Detailed Answer: Glaciers are large masses of ice that have immense erosional power. They have played a vital role in shaping the Earth's landscape over millions of years. When attempting to determine if an area of land was once covered by a glacier, it is essential to observe various pieces of evidence present within the landscape. These pieces of evidence help scientists to understand the past glacial processes and the history of the Earth's climatic conditions. (a). Limestone caverns - Limestone caverns are formed as a result of chemical weathering, not glaciation. Limestone dissolution occurs when acidic rainwater, percolating through cracks in the rock, reacts with the calcium carbonate present in the limestone. This process forms underground cavities and channels, which may eventually lead to the development of caves and other karst features. Thus, limestone caverns cannot be considered evidence that an area of land was once covered by a glacier. (b). Marine fossils - The presence of marine fossils in a land area indicates that the area was once submerged underwater and that marine organisms inhabited the location. Although the marine environment may have been affected by glaciation in the past, the presence of marine fossils alone cannot provide adequate evidence of past glacial activity in that area. (c). Abrasion of surface rocks - The best evidence of an area of land once being covered by a glacier is the abrasion of surface rocks. As glaciers move, they entrain rocks and sediment within their ice, which eventually scours the bedrock as the glacier flows over it. This process, called glacial abrasion, leaves behind unmistakable landforms and specific markings, such as striations (scratches) and polish on the bedrock surface. These features definitively point to a history of glacial activity in the area. (d). Peeling slabs of rock - Peeling slabs of rock can be a result of exfoliation, a mechanical weathering process that occurs due to enormous temperature variations or pressure changes. While peeling slabs could be found in areas that have experienced glaciation, they are not specific to glacial activity and can occur in other geological contexts. In conclusion, the best evidence for an area of land having been covered by a glacier is the abrasion of surface rocks. The other options provided, while informative about the geological history and processes in an area, don't provide conclusive evidence of past glacial activity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer a question about this article: Intense media interest in the opinions and private lives of the royal family during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press, not all of which were entirely true. As Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, told his staff: \\"Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not true—so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards.\\" Newspaper editor Donald Trelford wrote in The Observer of 21 September 1986: \\"The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of ... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not.\\" It was reported, most notably in The Sunday Times of 20 July 1986, that the Queen was worried that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment, a series of riots, the violence of a miners' strike, and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation. Thatcher reputedly said the Queen would vote for the Social Democratic Party—Thatcher's political opponents. Thatcher's biographer John Campbell claimed \\"the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making\\". Belying reports of acrimony between them, Thatcher later conveyed her personal admiration for the Queen, and the Queen gave two honours in her personal gift—membership in the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter—to Thatcher after her replacement as prime minister by John Major. Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Elizabeth was a \\"behind the scenes force\\" in ending apartheid.

Believing a cure may exist, Hatcher orders Nelson to send a team into Scotland to find medical researcher Dr. Kane, who was working on a cure when Scotland was quarantined. Nelson chooses Major Eden Sinclair to lead the team. Sinclair's team crosses the wall and goes to Glasgow, Dr. Kane's last known location. In Glasgow, while searching the local hospital for survivors, Sinclair and her team are ambushed by a group of marauders. Sgt. Norton and Dr. Stirling manage to escape, while the team suffers heavy casualties. Sinclair and Dr. Talbot are captured by what turns out to be a huge gang of brutal cannibals.

In a gun battle one police officer and both attackers were killed, and the attack is now over, police say. Three police officers were injured during the gun battle that lasted for several hours, Mr Rahimi told the BBC's Mahfouz Zubaide in Kabul. No one staying at the compound was injured. North Gate is mainly used by foreigners. It is a heavily guarded compound, which was attacked by militants three years ago.

Playing in their second game of the season, the Cincinnati Bengals had a lot of things go wrong. Playing Ohio state rivals Cleveland Browns, the defense looked the exact opposite as they did in week one. Browns quarterback Derek Anderson started and threw for 328 yards and five touchdowns. It was only the third time in NFL history that two quarterbacks had thrown at least five touchdown passes in the same game. Jamal Lewis had 215 yards rushing with one touchdown and the Browns had two receivers with over 100 yards, Braylon Edwards and Kellen Winslow. The Bengals offense tried their best to keep the team in the game, however, as Carson Palmer threw for 6 TD's and Chad Johnson caught for 209 yards. The game started out slowly in the first quarter but the second quarter saw a combined 35 points scored. It was close in the end, when the Bengals started a drive with under one minute left. They managed to get the ball to the 50-yard line when Carson Palmer was intercepted by Leigh Bodden on an intended pass for Chad Johnson. This game ended up being the eighth highest scoring game in NFL history, but not the highest scoring game between these two teams. In 2004, the Bengals beat the Browns 58-48 for the second-most combined points. The Redskins (72) and Giants (41) combined for 113 points in 1966 for the most.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Bristol was founded by 1000; by about 1020, it was a trading centre with a mint producing silver pennies bearing its name. By 1067 Brycgstow was a well-fortified burh, and that year the townsmen beat off a raiding party from Ireland led by three of Harold Godwinson's sons. Under Norman rule, the town had one of the strongest castles in southern England. Bristol was the place of exile for Diarmait Mac Murchada, the Irish king of Leinster, after being overthrown. The Bristol merchants subsequently played a prominent role in funding Richard Strongbow de Clare and the Norman invasion of Ireland. The port developed in the 11th century around the confluence of the Rivers Frome and Avon, adjacent to Bristol Bridge just outside the town walls. By the 12th century Bristol was an important port, handling much of England's trade with Ireland, including slaves. There was also an important Jewish community in Bristol from the late 12th century through to the late 13th century when all Jews were expelled from England. The stone bridge built in 1247 was replaced by the current bridge during the 1760s. The town incorporated neighbouring suburbs and became a county in 1373, the first town in England to be given this status. During this period, Bristol became a shipbuilding and manufacturing centre. By the 14th century Bristol, York and Norwich were England's largest medieval towns after London. One-third to one-half of the population died in the Black Death of 1348–49, which checked population growth, and its population remained between 10,000 and 12,000 for most of the 15th and 16th centuries.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. Cleaning out and organizing a garage can be a messy process in itself, requiring you to nearly empty out the space and evaluate what you've got to work with. Depending on the clutter and the junk pile up, it can be a quick afternoon of tidying or a long weekend project requiring a couple trips to the hardware store. Clean out the drawers, the shelves, and the storage units and start over. Don't try to a half-job by moving some stuff around and calling it \\"reorganized,\\" even if your garage is relatively uncluttered. It's still a good idea to re-evaluate the storage space you do have to use it to its maximum potential. When you're getting started, pair like items with like items. How you choose categories will depend on the stuff you've got in your garage, but you might pair automotive tools with automotive tools, yard tools with yard tools, and sporting goods with other sporting goods for an easy start. You can get more specific as you start organizing. Set up a few tarps on the driveway or in the yard if you've got a real mess on your hands. This can help to keep the mess contained if you've got especially greasy or oily tools. If you've got a cluttered garage, it's important to get rid of anything that's broken, useless, or unnecessary. Doing so should reduce your amount of clutter significantly and make it easier to organize what you really do need more effectively. Here are some questions to help you figure out whether or not a particular item is essential to your garage: Have you used the item in the last year? Does the item work properly? If not, are you likely to fix it in the next year? Is the item valuable, or does it have sentimental value? Whatever you end up putting in the \\"unusable\\" pile, get rid of it as soon as possible. Don't take it to the dump \\"next time you get around to it,\\" do it right now. Clearing out the clutter is the only way to commit to a more organized and efficient work space in your garage. If you don't need it, don't keep it around to take up premium space. Throw away broken or damaged items that are beyond repair and give away duplicate items or outdated items that you've replaced with newer models. You might consider giving away an old busted socket set if you've got a newer set yourself. Recycle scrap metal and other valuable stuff you might find lying around the garage. Consider a garage sale. If your garage is packed to the gills with old Halloween decorations, stacks of Rolling Stone from the mid-80s, and trash-bags full of kids clothes, it's probably time to throw some price stickers on the junk and have a yard sale. After evaluating all the usable items, clean them up as well as possible. Don't put away dirty tools, muddy soccer cleats, and otherwise compromised gear into new, neatly organized places. Spend time committing to clean. If it's been a couple years since you've cleaned up around the space, reorganization is a good opportunity to do just that. Clean the floors with disinfectant and address the dust that's built up over the years. Using a bit of acetone is a great way of quickly cleaning up old stainless steel tools that have been laying around collecting grease. Use an old rag and a small amount of acetone in a well-ventilated area.","completion":"This article emphasizes the importance of thoroughly cleaning and decluttering a garage by categorizing items, disposing of broken or unnecessary objects, and ensuring cleanliness for an efficient and organized workspace."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Nina Simone - 10 of the best Few artists have thrived so spectacularly while being so disinclined towards the recording industry, but then few have been as talented as Nina Simone. The turning point in her career was a rejection from the Curtis Institute of Music in 1951, which she later came to understand was racially motivated. Nina Simone – born Eunice Kathleen Waymon – was a child prodigy, and a fund had been set up by people in her native Tryon, North Carolina to help her become the first female black concert pianist in the US. The surprise rejection left her rudderless and in need of money. After various legitimate jobs, Eunice adopted a stage name to ensure her Methodist minister mother wouldn’t find out she was playing “the devil’s music” in an Atlantic City bar (Nina was a pet name given to her by a boyfriend; Simone came from French actress Simone Signoret). After a first night of interspersing gospel songs with Bach, Czerny and Liszt at the Midtown Bar and Grill, Simone was told she’d have to sing in future if she wanted to keep her job. She quickly built up a repertoire and a steady following, leading to interest from Bethlehem Records, which released her first album, Little Girl Blue. A beautifully tender version of I Love You, Porgy was laid down at the suggestion of a friend who’d heard Billie Holiday do it, and Simone’s rendition soon started picking up radio play, becoming a surprise Top 20 US hit in 1959. Simone bristled at the comparisons with Holiday. “I didn’t like to be put in a box with other jazz singers because my musicianship was totally different, and in its own way superior,” she wrote in her autobiography, I Put a Spell on You. “It was a racist thing: ‘If she’s black she must be a jazz singer.’ It diminished me.” The deal Simone agreed with Bethlehem Records was shortsighted. She signed away the rights to all her early recordings in exchange for 3,000, which probably seemed like a lot of money at the time. That lack of forethought would cost her a fortune, and it wouldn’t be the last time she demonstrated a lack of financial nous. After Simone realised her mistake and went to Colpix Records, Bethlehem put out a cobbled together second album – Nina Simone and Her Friends – but it wasn’t until 1987, when My Baby Just Cares for Me exploded in Europe, that it really hit her pocket. That said, the exposure – the song featured in a perfume commercial – brought Simone to a new audience and allowed her to work only when she needed to until her death in 2003. (She recorded only one more studio album, A Single Woman, in 1993). It’s astonishing that My Baby Just Cares for Me managed to remain relatively obscure for so long given how good it is, featuring a jaw-dropping virtuoso piano solo that is the perfect conflation of her classical training and jazz improvisation, while her dolorous timbre, set against a prideful narrative and generally upbeat mood, creates an odd paradox. As on the beautiful He Needs Me, there’s a sense that the whole conceit about her paramour could be based entirely on a delusion. Related: Nina Simone: 'Are you ready to burn buildings?' With standards in her repertoire such as Work Song evoking the backbreaking toil of the chain gang, it was clear Simone’s sympathies were with the civil rights movement in the early 60s, but a self-penned protest song in response to cold-blooded murder saw her emerge as a figurehead in 1964. Civil rights activist Medgar Evers had been assassinated by a member of the White Citizens’ Council the year before, as well as the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist church in Birmingham, Alabama, where four young girls were killed. Mississippi Goddam is a frustrated call to arms, a plea for mercy, a recalcitrant cry of defiance and an angry voice of reason crying out against the most untenable and unjust of situations. While Simone had much admiration for Martin Luther King, she didn’t necessarily subscribe to his doctrine of passive righteousness. “Can’t you see it, can’t you feel it in the air?” she wails, “I can’t stand the pressure much longer!”. Mississippi Goddam was controversial, not least because of the cursing in its title. “We released it as a single and it sold well, except in the south where we had trouble with distribution,” wrote Simone. “The excuse was profanity – Goddam! – but the real reason was obvious enough.” The origin of Sinnerman (or Sinner Man before Simone dispensed with the spacing) is ambiguous, some claiming the traditional African-American spiritual started life as a Scottish folk song. The earliest known recorded version is Les Baxter’s 1956 rendition, though Simone would have almost certainly picked it up from her church, where she was the pianist from an early age. Her version, recorded live in New York in the mid-60s for her Pastel Blues album, has become the defining version, used for its high drama in a glut of movies including David Lynch’s Inland Empire, as well as being remixed by Felix da Housecat and sampled by Kanye West and Talib Kweli on the latter’s Get By (West is no stranger to sampling Simone, having garnered opprobrium for using the harrowing Strange Fruit as the basis for him to sound off about alimony). Sinnerman has become one of her trademark songs, and listening to its 11 minutes of heart-racing rhythms, thrills and spills and inspired moments of spontaneous invention, it’s not difficult to see how she picked up the High Priestess of Soul epithet. Simone performed many times in New York during the 60s, and her dream of playing Carnegie Hall was realised in 1963 but for one caveat: she wasn’t there to play her beloved Bach. Simone didn’t write many of her own songs, but – as one of the finest interpreters of others’ tunes – she hardly needed to. Take Screamin’ Jay Hawkins’ I Put a Spell on You, written in 1956. “I was just a normal blues singer. I was just Jay Hawkins,” said the composer. “It all sort of just fell in place. I found out I could do more destroying a song and screaming it to death.” It’s a deeply enjoyable, if slightly jarring, voodoo waltz with some sinister barking when Hawkins performs it in his bellicose fashion. At least that’s how it sounds compared with Simone’s version, which is smoother than a polished palatial floor. The swirling brass at the outset followed by Simone’s deep alto scowl, and then those irresistible, skittering glissandos can hardly fail to imbue the sense one is beholding something classic upon each listen. I Put a Spell on You glides effortlessly in through your ear, and before you know it, it has you right where it wants you. Simone might have resented being called a jazz musician but it’s hard to deny the big-band oomph of Feeling Good, possibly her best-loved song. It arose from the musical The Roar of the Greasepaint – The Smell of the Crowd the year before, which was written and performed by Anthony Newley with words by Leslie Bricusse. Simone and Brooklyn-based producer Hal Mooney set about stripping away the tinkly intro to leave just her naked voice, building up tremendous tension before releasing it with a fusillade of bombastic brass. The rest of the track, with its staccato piano as counterpoint, is equally irresistible. Simone’s Feeling Good was yet another song that benefited from repeat plays on a 80’s commercial (this time for fabric conditioner) and since then it has been sampled a number of times by hip-hop artists, including Kanye West, for New Day on the Watch the Throne album with Jay Z. Aside from throwing in a megaphone, Muse were faithful to Simone’s arrangement when they covered it in 2001, a rendering NME readers voted best cover version of all time in 2010, which one hopes caused Muse some embarrassment. Simone’s interpretations of existing songs were so emphatic that other artists would often thieve her version rather than the original performer’s. For his album Wild Is the Wind, David Bowie admitted he was inspired to record a version of the title track after he met Simone in Los Angeles in 1975, while Jeff Buckley’s Lilac Wine slips uncannily into the metre chosen by the singer. Few artists had the audacity to cover her own composition Four Women though, such is its inimitability. Set over a stark, mid-paced groove, she presents to us four strong women of colour: Aunt Sarah, Safronia, Sweet Thing and Peaches, each describing themselves in the first person and conveying their personal suffering. Safronia for instance, sings: “My father was rich and white / he forced my mother late one night.” It’s a strange song given its structure, and with no chorus to speak of its simplicity is goosebump-inducingly effective. Simone was dismayed that some critics accused her of racial stereotyping despite her stature as an activist; Aunt Sarah says her hair is “wooly”, and some felt making her an aunt fell within the Aunt Jemima mammy archetype. “Black women didn’t know what the hell they wanted because they were defined by things they didn’t control,” Simone said defiantly. “And until they had the confidence to define themselves they’d be stuck in the same mess forever – that was the point the song made.” Simone recorded roughly as many live albums as she made in the studio, and some were a mixture of the two. For a performer as accomplished as she was with almost telepathic musical compadres like Al Shackman, one presumes the one-take nature of live work would agree with her. ‘Nuff Said is special in that it was recorded at the Westbury Music Fair three days after the assassination of Dr King, and as such it captures the raw emotions, the shock and the collective coming together that the tragedy brought – the show featured the tribute Why? (The King of Love is Dead), written by Simone’s bass player, Gene Taylor, shortly after he heard the news. Another song recorded in the studio a month later – or rather two songs pushed together from the musical Hair – also very much captures the mood of 1968. Ain’t Got No / I’ve Got Life is a joyous hippy anthem that celebrates the utopian values of the longed-for promised land. “Like most numbers from Hair, it could easily have been soon forgotten,” wrote Robert Dimery in 1,001 Songs You Must Hear Before You Die. “Its inclusion on the serious-minded ’Nuff Said! is, on the face of it, surprising, but in Simone’s hands the call for freedom takes on a harder-edged civil rights tone, in keeping with the other tracks, while still managing to retain the upbeat mood.” It reached No 2 in the UK singles charts. Another song that caught the mood in the late 60s was I Wish I Knew How it Would Feel to be Free, adopted as the unofficial anthem of the civil rights movement when sung by Simone five years before it was co-opted by Barry Norman and the BBC’s Film … series. She upped the ante in 1969, recording a song she wrote herself – To Be Young, Gifted and Black – named after an unfinished play by her friend Lorraine Hansberry, who was the first black writer to have a hit Broadway show. Simone said Hansberry, who died from cancer aged 34, was her inspiration, having forced her to take the black movement seriously. The lyrics couldn’t be any less ambiguous or any more positive: “In the whole world you know / There are a billion boys and girls / Who are young, gifted and black / And that’s a fact!” The uplifting gospel number might have resonated with many, but after Simone left America in 1971 for a journey around the world that latest until the end of her days, she expressed alarm that the civil rights movement had seemingly lost its way and been usurped by disco. It’s no coincidence that her recording career began to fall off around this period. Simone would wait six years before she recorded another studio album and when she finally did, she disowned it because of her lack of involvement in arrangements, despite it receiving universal critical acclaim. Recorded with producer Creed Taylor in Brussels, the elegiac Everything Must Change is recognisably Simone, but on other tracks she’s in unchartered territory, including a Hall and Oates cover (Rich Girl) and a reggae-inspired Randy Newman number for this title track.

James Haskell admits he will be inspired by Lawrence Dallaglio when he leads Wasps throughout the 2014-15 season. Haskell's first taste of captaincy will be Saturday's opening match of the traditional Aviva Premiership London double-header against Saracens at Twickenham. England great Dallaglio presided over the most successful period in Wasps' history, a reign that included four league titles and two Heineken Cup crowns. Stand and deliver: James Haskell will be the Wasps captain ahead of the 2014-15 Premiership season. Haskell played alongside Dallaglio for six years and while determined to forge his own path, he knows he will be influenced by a man he regards as the complete skipper. 'To me Lawrence was everything you want in a leader,' Haskell said. 'When he spoke you always felt he cared about what he was saying and he always backed it up, leading by example. 'He had the respect of the guys around him and that is all you can ask for. 'I'm not trying to be Lawrence and I won't copy him, but you can't help but be inspired by a guy who was a natural leader and had respect from people.' Haskell is one of the game's more colourful personalities, but he understands the need to be economical with his words when required. 'The last thing you want is to be someone who just talks,' he said. 'The boys find out pretty quickly if you are covering for your inefficiencies by putting great Churchillian speeches together. If that happens, you'll fall flat on your face. 'As long as I perform on the field and get the respect of the guys, then that is key.' It's mine to keep right? Haskell poses with the Aviva Premiership trophy before the start of the season. Wasps have been lifted by the return of Christian Wade - a potential solution to England's problems on the wing - from the foot injury that has kept him sidelined since November. Will Fraser's own injury problems are over, so he is restored at openside by Saracens as he begins his quest to challenge for Chris Robshaw's England jersey. Robshaw's load in World Cup year has been lightened by Harlequins' decision to relieve him of the captaincy after four seasons and give it to Joe Marler, who will lead the side against London Irish on Saturday. Tough act to follow: Lawrence Dallaglio won the Heineken Cup as Wasps captain in 2007. Marland Yarde makes his debut following his summer move from the Exiles and despite the England wing's arrival, Quins have been widely tipped to miss the play-offs this season. 'We want to be the best we can be individually and collectively. If we manage that, we'll be hard to beat,' director of rugby Conor O'Shea said. 'Anyone can finish in the top four. We've been written off as the team that will drop out this season, but we were written off last season but still got in. 'Anyone who writes us off is deluded if you look at the quality of the team we can put out.' Fly-half George Ford returns from shoulder surgery to pull the strings for Bath against Sale and will duel with England rival Danny Cipriani at the AJ Bell Stadium. Freddie Burns makes his Leicester debut against Newcastle and with Ed Slater in the treatment room, Ben Youngs leads the Tigers. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"In 2014, James Haskell became the captain of the Wasps team, a rugby team in England. He was inspired by Lawrence Dallaglio, a great player, and captain from the past, who helped their team win many titles. James wanted to be a good leader like Lawrence but also wanted to be himself.

This move showcases the determination of the current administration to prioritize political and economic integration with the EU, even as various challenges from within its own ranks arise. Step 1: Prioritize the main points of the article In addressing the issue at hand, the government has initiated a series of political and democratic reforms to ensure compatibility with the EU’s requirements. These measures include addressing issues related to fundamental freedoms, the rule of law, transparency, and accountability. Additionally, efforts to minimize the role of the military in politics have also been introduced, adjusting the traditional power balance within the country. Step 2: Discuss the implications of such reforms on the military establishment While these sweeping reforms signify the government’s commitment to meeting EU stipulations, they have not been welcomed by all factions within the Turkish social and political landscape. The military, in particular, has exhibited a certain degree of apprehension regarding these changes. Historically, the Turkish military has played a significant role in shaping the country's politics and has acted as the guardian of the secular principles of the republic. Step 3: Highlight the potential struggles between the government and the military Tensions between the government and the military have been heightened on the back of these ambitious reform goals. Despite the army's unease, the government has shown firm determination in persevering with its EU-centric agenda. However, ongoing public debates and occasional crises indicate that the path towards EU integration may not be entirely smooth. Step 4: Address the EU's position and role The EU, meanwhile, has been closely monitoring the evolving situation in Turkey. It is expected that European officials will continue to support Turkey's reform efforts, considering the strategic importance of the country as a bridge between Europe and Asia. The EU's encouragement of the Turkish accession process will likely contribute to the gradual establishment of political stability in the region. Step 5: Close with a focus on possible outcomes and future developments In conclusion, the Turkish government's dedication to implementing EU-minded reforms, despite the unease within the military establishment, highlights the nation's determination to integrate into the European family. While tensions and challenges persist, the end goal of political and economic integration remains a key priority for the current Turkish administration. The future will reveal whether Turkey's EU aspirations ultimately foster greater collaboration or exacerbate existing fissures within the country's political sphere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A:","completion":"Title: The Shadows of Verona Genre: Drama/Mystery Plot Summary: Two seemingly average suburban families in Verona, Italy, become entwined in a mysterious series of events that force them to confront the secrets lurking beneath their picture-perfect lives. As they band together to unravel the hidden threads connecting their families, they begin to uncover a darker history that has haunted Verona for centuries, ultimately putting their own families at risk. Act 1: Introducing the Families The story opens in the idyllic town of Verona, which the movie portrays as a beautiful, picturesque, and seemingly perfect place to live. The camera pans over the town to introduce the two focal families: the Moretti family - consisting of husband Marco, wife Isabella, their teenage daughter Sofia, and young son Luca - and the Rossi family - Paolo, his wife Anna, their teenage son Matteo, and daughter Maria. The audience sees the families going about their daily routines, like preparing breakfast, attending school, and going to work. They appear to lead a perfect suburban life, with friendly neighbors and a close-knit community. Their routines intersect as they attend school events, local sports games, and social functions. Act 2: The Mysterious Events Begin One night, while both families are attending a local charity event, they witness a strange, unsettling occurrence - an eerie, unexplained sound that seems to be coming from beneath the ground. They brush it off as a one-time event, but the mysterious incidents keep happening. Objects in their homes move without explanation, and shadows seem to follow them when they walk through the streets at night. Intrigued and uneasy, the families decide to investigate together. They dig into Verona's history and discover reports of similar events dating back centuries. The more they uncover, the more they realize that something truly sinister may be threatening their town. Act 3: Revelations and Resolutions As the families research Verona's past, they come across the legend of a powerful, malevolent spirit that has supposedly haunted the town for generations. This spirit has claimed several victims over the centuries and has been awaiting the perfect time to unleash its full power on the town. The families come to believe that they are somehow connected to the spirit, but they don't know why. Desperate to save their families and their town, Marco and Paolo unite to find the key to banishing the spirit forever. They discover that their ancestors played a role in containing the spirit in the past. Realizing they share this responsibility, the families come together to confront the dark entity. In a gripping final act, the families confront the malevolent spirit at its source - a hidden underground chamber. They defeat it by following hidden instructions left by their ancestors, making peace with their intertwined destinies and re-affirming their commitment to protect the town and their families. Epilogue: A New Beginning Now free from the haunting, the families rebuild their lives and celebrate their newfound connection. They continue to work together to preserve the beauty and safety of Verona, maintaining the legacy left by their ancestors. As they watch over their town, the two families are forever bonded, united by the extraordinary secrets of their shared past."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Being the wife of a jockey can be nerve-racking, as Annabel Waley-Cohen found out at Cheltenham today. Her face, contorted into a variety of pained expressions, said it all as she watched her husband Sam finish third in the Ryanair Chase at Britain's biggest jump festival. But as well as being an amateur rider, Sam Waley-Cohen also has a rather fascinating claim to fame: he is believed to be the man who brought his close friends Prince William and Kate Middleton back together after their split in 2007. It was at a party thrown by Sam at his family’s mansion in Oxfordshire in June of that year that Kate and William were seen chatting - and within a few weeks they were holidaying together on a yacht in the Seychelles. Annabel Waley-Cohen watches her husband Sam ride in the Ryanair Chase at Cheltenham today. Sam Waley-Cohen threw a party in June 2007 - just months after his good friends Kate and William had split up. The reunited pair holidayed in the Seychelles weeks later. Annabel could hardly bear to watch as 'royal matchmaker' Sam rode Rajdhani Express in the Ryanair Chase. Annabel shouts encouragement to her husband. Annabel feels the relief after the race is over and her husband finished in third place. Speaking to the Mail in 2011, Sam was quick to play down his role as Cupid. ‘People love the idea that somebody put them back together but they put themselves together far more,’ he said at the time. By coincidence, it was at the Cheltenham Festival, in March 2007, that it first became clear there was any trouble in Kate and William's relationship. The spark appeared to be gone, whereas just a year earlier they were spotted kissing in public for the first time. Days later, pictures emerged of William partying in Boujis nightclub with other women. Sam Waley-Cohen (right) finished third in the race today. Speaking to the Mail in 2011, Sam was quick to play down his role as Cupid. 'People love the idea that somebody put them back together but they put themselves together far more,' he said at the time. Sam and Annabel (left) at Cheltenham yesterday. Right, Sam has been involved in organising charity events, including the DayGlo roller-disco in 2008 at which Kate Middleton wore yellow hot pants. It was at the Cheltenham Festival, seven years ago (above), that cracks in Kate and William's relationship became apparent. That Easter, Kate gave William an ultimatum - to either commit to their relationship, or it was over. So it was that the young couple, who had met while studying history together at St Andrews University in 2001, called time on their romance. Mere months later, Sam threw his party... and the rest is royal history. The son of leading racehorse owner Sir Robert Waley-Cohen and his wife Felicity, the daughter of Viscount Bearstead, Sam is the product of a privileged background. However, tragedy struck his family while he was a teenager. Prince William kisses his wife Kate, Duchess of Cambridge on the balcony of Buckingham Palace after the Royal Wedding in April 2011. Sam celebrates with Princess Anne after winning on Long Run at the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2011. In 1995, his brother Thomas, younger by two years, was diagnosed with Ewing’s sarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer. He died in 2004, just days after his 20th birthday. For Sam, horse-racing helped him through his grief. In 2005, he unexpectedly won at the Cheltenham Festival, riding his father’s horse Libertine. And in 2011, he also won the Cheltenham Gold Cup on another of his father's horses, Long Run.

Between 1864 and 1885 Russia gradually took control of the entire territory of Russian Turkestan, the Tajikistan portion of which had been controlled by the Emirate of Bukhara and Khanate of Kokand. Russia was interested in gaining access to a supply of cotton and in the 1870s attempted to switch cultivation in the region from grain to cotton (a strategy later copied and expanded by the Soviets).[citation needed] By 1885 Tajikistan's territory was either ruled by the Russian Empire or its vassal state, the Emirate of Bukhara, nevertheless Tajiks felt little Russian influence.[citation needed] What was Russian interested in Tajikistan area for?","completion":"Russian was interested in the Tajikistan area because they wanted to gain access to a supply of cotton.

Suzanne: I can see the appeal of both, honestly. It's been a while since we've had a night out with all our friends, and I would love the opportunity to catch up with everyone.

We could start the evening at Eddie's, catch up with everyone, and then head over to Rita's for some late-night dancing. That way, we don't have to choose between the two. Suzanne: That could be a possibility, but it might be a bit exhausting. Not to mention, I don't want either of our hosts to feel like we're just using their party as a stepping stone to the next one. I genuinely want to enjoy both events for what they are. Lola: I understand that concern, but I think as long as we're honest with our intentions and give each party a fair amount of time, both Eddie and Rita would appreciate our effort to make it to their events. Plus, who knows, the vibe at each party could change throughout the night, and we might find that we're more comfortable at one than we originally thought. Suzanne: That's true. Maybe we should just play it by ear, see how we feel tomorrow, and decide then. Either way, we're bound to have a good time no matter where we end up. Lola: Sounds like a plan. We'll touch base tomorrow, and no matter what we decide, I'm sure it'll be a great night. Suzanne: Agreed. I can't wait to see how it all unfolds!

Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin.

Given the following context: Antoine's marriage to Marie of Lorraine was unhappy and yielded only two daughters. Monaco's constitution confined the throne to members of the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the lack of (the politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died just months later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the Monégasque constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.Jacques I assumed the name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French aristocracy showed scant respect towards the new prince who had risen from their ranks and chose to spend his time absent from Monaco. He died in 1751 and was succeeded by his and Louise-Hippolyte's son Prince Honoré III.Honoré III married Catherine Brignole in 1757 and later divorced her. Before his marriage, Honoré III had been conducting an affair with his future mother-in-law. After her divorce Marie Brignole married Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé, a member of the fallen French royal house, in 1798. Ironically, the Grimaldi fortunes were restored when descendants of both Hortense Mancini and Louis I married: Louise d'Aumont Mazarin married Honoré III's son and heir, the future Honoré IV. This marriage in 1776 was extremely advantageous to the Grimaldi, as Louise's ancestress Hortense Mancini had been the heiress of Cardinal Mazarin. Thus Monaco's ruling family acquired all the estates bequeathed by Cardinal Mazarin, including the Duchy of Rethel, and the Principality of Château-Porcien.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Digestive System Organs The easiest way to understand the digestive system is to divide its organs into two main categories. The first group is the organs that make up the alimentary canal. Accessory digestive organs comprise the second group and are critical for orchestrating the breakdown of food and the assimilation of its nutrients into the body. Accessory digestive organs, despite their name, are critical to the function of the digestive system. Q: What are accessory digestive organs critical for breaking down? A: Answer:","completion":"Accessory digestive organs are critical for breaking down food and the assimilation of its nutrients into the body. These organs, although not part of the alimentary canal itself, play a significant role in the overall digestive process by producing essential secretions and enzymes that help in the breakdown, absorption, and metabolism of nutrients from the consumed food. Some of the major accessory digestive organs include the salivary glands, the liver, the gallbladder, and the pancreas. Each of these organs contributes to the digestive process in specific ways: 1. Salivary glands: These glands are located in the mouth and produce saliva, which contains enzymes like salivary amylase that initiate the breakdown of starches into simpler sugars. Saliva also helps in lubricating and moistening food, making it easier to swallow and move through the alimentary canal. 2. Liver: The liver is the largest internal organ in the body and plays a crucial role in various metabolic processes. In terms of digestion, it produces bile, a greenish-yellow fluid that aids in the emulsification and digestion of fats. Bile also helps neutralize the acidic content of the partially digested food entering the small intestine from the stomach, thus creating optimal conditions for further digestion and absorption of nutrients. 3. Gallbladder: The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ that stores the bile produced by the liver. It releases this bile into the small intestine when needed through the bile duct, contributing to the digestion of fats and the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). 4. Pancreas: The pancreas is a dual-function organ with both endocrine and exocrine functions. Its exocrine role involves producing and secreting digestive enzymes, such as amylase (for carbohydrate digestion), lipase (for fat digestion), and proteases (for protein digestion). These enzymes, together with the bicarbonate-rich pancreatic juice, are delivered into the small intestine through the pancreatic duct and play an essential role in the breakdown of food into simpler molecules, allowing their absorption into the bloodstream. In summary, accessory digestive organs are critical for breaking down food and assimilating its nutrients into the body. They produce and secrete various enzymes and secretions that facilitate the complex process of digestion, ensuring the proper absorption and metabolism of nutrients from the food we consume."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

(0:55) UCLA freshmen LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill, who had been detained in China for the past week on suspicion of shoplifting, landed in Los Angeles on Tuesday evening and boarded a van to return to campus. The basketball players' return came hours after President Donald Trump said he was hopeful they would be allowed to return home after he had a long conversation with President Xi Jinping of China. \\"They're working on it right now,\\" Trump told reporters in the Philippines, as he prepared to return to Washington after a nearly two-week visit to Asia that included an earlier stop in Beijing. \\"He's been terrific,\\" Trump said, in an apparent reference to Xi. \\"But it was not a good subject. That was not something that should have happened.\\" On Wednesday, Trump tweeted about the players. Do you think the three UCLA Basketball Players will say thank you President Trump? They were headed for 10 years in jail! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 15, 2017 It's not yet clear what the players were charged with and what penalty they faced in China. UCLA Chancellor Gene D. Block, while saying he was \\"grateful\\" the players were headed home, issued a statement Tuesday saying the school will look into the matter and decide what action will be taken. Ball, Riley, Hill, UCLA coach Steve Alford and Bruins athletic director Dan Guerrero will hold a news conference Wednesday. Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott said in a statement that \\"the matter has been resolved to the satisfaction of the Chinese authorities. We are all very pleased that these young men have been allowed to return home to their families and university.

We also want to acknowledge UCLA's significant efforts on behalf of their student-athletes. Finally, we want to thank the president, the White House and the U.S. State Department for their efforts towards resolution.\\" The players were questioned last week about allegedly stealing sunglasses from a Louis Vuitton store next to the team's hotel in Hangzhou, where the Bruins had been staying before leaving for Shanghai to face Georgia Tech on Friday. They were released on bail early Wednesday morning and had been staying at a lakeside hotel in Hangzhou since then. A source told ESPN's Arash Markazi there is surveillance footage of the players shoplifting from three stores inside a high-end shopping center, which houses Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Salvatore Ferragamo stores. An anonymous U.S. official told The Washington Post that charges against the three players have been reduced. \\"I want to be clear that we take seriously any violations of the law,\\" Block, the UCLA chancellor, said in a statement. \\"We remain one of the world's top academic institutions in large part because of our values and standards, which we work hard to infuse throughout our campus community. \\"When members of the UCLA family fail to uphold these values, we review these incidents with fair and thorough processes. In this particular case, both Athletics and the Office of Student Conduct will review this incident and guide any action with respect to the involved students.\\" The UCLA hoops team returned to the United States on Saturday without Ball, Riley and Hill. Alford had declined to discuss the matter after the squad's win over the Yellow Jackets. UCLA will play its home opener Wednesday night against Central Arkansas. There was no immediate word on the status of Ball, Riley and Hill for that game.

What happens next in this paragraph? How to stop shaking Take a deep breath. An excess of adrenaline can cause your body to shake. This shaking will probably be most noticeable in your hands and legs. Choices: (a). Slowly lower your body into a seated position. You can do this seated position in your favorite chair or sitting in a recliner. (b). Using a deep breathing exercise can help counteract shaking. Practice deep breathing by doing the following exercises: inhale deeply through your nose, hold your breath for a few seconds, and slowly exhale to relax your body. (c). If you find that you are shaking as a result of a fear or nervousness, the best thing that you can do is take a deep breath. Deep breathing stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system, which is associated with sleep and relaxation. (d). Reducing your anxiety by breathing deeply can help push the shaking away by controlling the blood in your brain and increasing its electrical activity. Try to relax each muscle on your body.","completion":"The next actions after acknowledging the shaking are multifaceted. Initially, it is advisable (a) to lower your body into a comfortable position like sitting in your favorite chair or a recliner. This position change aids in reducing stress and nervousness by providing a more comfortable location for the body to cope with the shaking. By aligning the body in a restful posture, less strain is put on the muscles, further diminishing shaking. While seated, ensure your back is straight, but not tense, to facilitate better breathing and overall relaxation. Following this, (b) initiate a deep breathing exercise. The process of deep breathing involves inhaling deeply through your nose, holding that breath for a few seconds, then slowly exhaling. This process can help counteract shaking by addressing the root physiological cause: adrenaline surges. Taking the time to focus on each segment of the breath shifts attention away from the original cause of the shaking and toward the restorative action of breathing. This controlled breathing helps to calm the mind and steady the body, reducing muscle contractions behind the noticeable shaking. The calming effects of deep breathing may be especially beneficial when your shaking is (c) attributed to anxiety, fear, or nervousness. Deep breathing stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system, which is associated with rest and relaxation. This system can counterbalance the symptoms of anxiety, such as an increased heart rate, perspiration, and shaking. By actively engaging this calming response, fear and nervousness can be controlled, reducing the automatic adrenaline response and curbing the physical sign of shaking. Finally, (d) decrease the anxiety by continued deep breathing. This process can help push the shaking away by controlling the oxygen and blood flow in your brain, and increasing its electrical activity. This calming activity encourages relaxation of the mind, which can subsequently promote relaxation of the body. You can also try to consciously relax each muscle starting from your head and slowly moving to your toes. This process, combined with deep breathing, can help manage anxiety and decrease shaking. In addition, keeping a positive mind and identifying triggers can also help manage shaking from nervousness or anxiety. If shaking is a persistent issue or associated with more serious conditions like Parkinson’s disease, it might be wise to consult a health professional. They may be able to provide targeted strategies, medication, or therapies to manage the symptoms. To sum up, managing shaking involves a combination of physiological and mental strategies which can be practiced at one's own pace and comfort."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The statement \\"By his middle 20s, he knew that he suffered from tuberculosis, and he coughed blood increasingly as the years went on\\" suggests that the person in question became aware of his tuberculosis in his middle 20s. From this point onward, he had knowledge and understanding of his condition. Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria. It primarily affects the lungs, but it can also involve other organs. Symptoms may include a persistent cough, coughing up blood, chest pain, weakness, fatigue, fever, chills, and weight loss. When individuals develop these symptoms and seek medical attention, they may be diagnosed with tuberculosis based on medical history, physical examination, imaging tests, and laboratory tests, such as sputum culture and molecular testing. In the given context, it can be inferred that the person might not have had an idea about his tuberculosis before his middle 20s. It is plausible that he started experiencing symptoms or his symptoms worsened, prompting him to seek medical care and leading to the eventual diagnosis. Once he was diagnosed with the disease, he became aware of his medical condition, indicated by the statement, \\"he knew that he suffered from tuberculosis.\\" It is also possible that his previously mild or subtle symptoms progressed over time, becoming more severe and noticeable, further reinforcing his awareness of his tuberculosis. As the years went on, the statement suggests that the person's condition deteriorated, as he coughed blood increasingly. This could be attributed to the progression of the disease or lack of effective treatment. Tuberculosis can be treated with a combination of antibiotics over several months, and it is crucial for individuals to complete the entire course of therapy as prescribed to prevent the development of drug-resistant strains of the bacteria. In conclusion, while the person might not have been aware of his tuberculosis before his middle 20s, the statement does not support the claim that \\"He had no idea that he had tuberculosis\\" as an overarching assertion. Once diagnosed with the condition in his middle 20s, he had some level of understanding and awareness of his disease, evidenced by the ongoing symptoms and the increasing instances of coughing up blood over time."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the question...who has won the 2018 formula 1 chinese grand prix tournament??","completion":"The 2018 Formula 1 Chinese Grand Prix was held on April 15, 2018, at the Shanghai International Circuit in Jiading District, Shanghai, China. This race was the third round of the 2018 FIA Formula One World Championship. The winner of the 2018 Chinese Grand Prix was Daniel Ricciardo, an Australian racing driver who was competing for the Red Bull Racing team during that season. Ricciardo's victory in China was quite memorable, as he pulled off some exceptional overtakes and benefited from a strategically well-timed pit stop that gave him fresher tires compared to his competitors. The race started with Sebastian Vettel from Scuderia Ferrari on pole position, followed by his teammate Kimi Räikkönen in second, and Valtteri Bottas from Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport in third. Bottas managed to overtake both Ferraris in the pit stops, taking the lead of the race. However, a safety car incident caused by the two Toro Rosso drivers, Pierre Gasly and Brendon Hartley, changed the landscape of the race. Red Bull Racing, seeing an opportunity to capitalize on the safety car situation, opted to pit both Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen for fresh soft tires, which gave them a significant advantage over their rivals who stayed out on older tires. This decision ultimately played a major role in Ricciardo's victory. Ricciardo's impressive drive saw him overtake several competitors, including Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen, Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton, and eventually Bottas, who was leading the race until Ricciardo's overtake. The Australian driver pulled off a total of five overtakes in just ten laps to claim a memorable victory. The final podium positions for the 2018 Chinese Grand Prix were as follows: 1. Daniel Ricciardo, Red Bull Racing 2. Valtteri Bottas, Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport 3. Kimi Räikkönen, Scuderia Ferrari This victory marked Daniel Ricciardo's sixth career win in Formula 1 and his first in the 2018 season.

Within the Solar System, the terrestrial planets are the inner planets closest to the Sun, i.e. Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The terms \\"terrestrial planet\\" and \\"telluric planet\\" are derived from Latin words for Earth (\\"Terra\\" and \\"Tellus\\"), as these planets are, in terms of composition, \\"Earth-like\\". - The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury. - Theta Doradus ( Theta Dor , Doradus , Dor ) is an orange K - type giant with an apparent magnitude of +4.81 . It is approximately 546 light years from Earth . Theta Doradus is moving through the Galaxy at a speed of 31.9 km / s relative to the Sun. Its projected Galactic orbit carries it between 22,400 and 24,800 light years from the center of the Galaxy . - In mathematics, the logarithm is the inverse operation to exponentiation. That means the logarithm of a number is the exponent to which another fixed number, the base, must be raised to produce that number. In simple cases the logarithm counts factors in multiplication. For example, the base logarithm of is , as to the power is; 10 is used as a factor three times. More generally, exponentiation allows any positive real number to be raised to any real power, always producing a positive result, so the logarithm can be calculated for any two positive real numbers and where is not equal to .

About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - The apparent magnitude of a celestial object is a number that is a measure of its brightness as seen by an observer on Earth. The brighter an object appears, the lower its magnitude value (i.e. inverse relation). The Sun, at apparent magnitude of 27, is the brightest object in the sky. It is adjusted to the value it would have in the absence of the atmosphere. Furthermore, the magnitude scale is logarithmic; a difference of one in magnitude corresponds to a change in brightness by a factor of , or about 2.512. - Brightness is an attribute of visual perception in which a source appears to be radiating or reflecting light.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Multi-choice problem: Choose from the options at the end, and answer how do you do this: computer Choices: (1). creates comfort . (2). creates art .","completion":"Option 2: A computer creates art. A computer can create art through various methods and techniques, which are constantly evolving with advances in technology. Digital art, generative art, and computer-aided design are just a few of the many possibilities for artistic expression using a computer. These techniques harness the power of algorithms, programming languages, and specialized software to generate and manipulate unique and diverse works of art, from simple illustrations to complex three-dimensional models. Here is a detailed breakdown of how a computer creates art: 1. Software and tools: Digital artists use specialized software and tools to create their works. These range from simple painting and drawing programs like Microsoft Paint and Krita, to more advanced tools like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and CorelDRAW. These programs are designed with a variety of tools that allow artists to achieve various visual effects and styles in their creations. 2. Vector and raster graphics: One of the key concepts in digital art is the difference between vector and raster graphics. Raster graphics are made of individual pixels, which can lead to loss of quality when resized. Vector graphics, on the other hand, are made up of mathematical formulas that define shapes, lines, and curves. This means that vector graphics can be resized without any loss of quality or clarity. Depending on the desired outcome, artists may choose to use either vector or raster graphics when creating their art. 3. Generative art: Generative art is a form of digital art that relies on the use of algorithms and procedures to create visual elements. Artists write code or use software with built-in algorithms to generate patterns, shapes, and colors, which are then combined in a variety of ways to produce unique, unpredictable, and visually interesting works of art. Generative art can be created using programming languages like Processing, Java, and Python, or through software like Unity and Cinema 4D. 4. 3D modeling and animation: Computers can also be used to create complex 3D models and animations. Artists use various software tools such as Blender, 3ds Max, and Maya to build intricate digital worlds, characters, and objects. These models can be manipulated, textured, and animated to produce visually stunning, realistic, or stylized art pieces. 3D models can also be 3D printed, allowing the digital art to take on a tangible form in the physical world. 5. Interactive art: With the rise of virtual reality, augmented reality, and interactive installations, artists are using computers to create art that is both engaging and immersive. Interactive artworks can respond to user inputs, environmental factors, or even data from the internet to create unique experiences for viewers. Programming languages such as JavaScript and C# are often used to develop interactive applications, websites, and games that bridge the gap between art, technology, and the user. 6. Artificial intelligence: AI and machine learning have opened up new and exciting opportunities for artistic expression. Artists can train algorithms on large datasets of images and use the resulting models to generate new, unique, and often surprising works of art. Deep learning techniques, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have been at the forefront of producing AI-created art pieces that often blend the line between human and machine-generated artwork. In conclusion, the creation of art using a computer is a versatile and ever-evolving process. By leveraging the power of software, algorithms, and various technical tools, artists can push the boundaries of traditional art and find new ways to express their creativity and engage with their audience. Modern advances in technology continue to open up new possibilities and challenges for artists to explore and transform the world of art as we know it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Iron is exposed to oxygen - Is exposed to air - A chemical reaction occurs - The iron starts to oxidize - The iron starts to rust. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the egg was expelled during menstruation happens, how will it affect more iron is exposed to the oxygen. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case refers to the expulsion of an egg during menstruation. We are looking for any direct or indirect effects this perturbation might have on the process of iron being exposed to oxygen, which eventually leads to rusting. We will analyze the possible connections between the two events step by step. Step 1: Iron is exposed to oxygen. During menstruation, the body expels blood, which contains small amounts of iron in the form of hemoglobin. However, this iron is bound within the hemoglobin molecule and is not directly exposed to oxygen in a way that would cause it to rust. Therefore, there is no direct connection between the expulsion of an egg during menstruation and iron being exposed to oxygen. Step 2: Iron is exposed to air. Although iron present in the blood during menstruation might be exposed to air when it leaves the body, the iron is still bound within the hemoglobin molecules and not exposed to air in a metallic form that would immediately cause rusting. Step 3: A chemical reaction occurs. If a chemical reaction were to occur that could break down the hemoglobin molecules and separate the iron contained within, there could be a potential indirect connection between menstruation and iron exposure to oxygen. However, this would require specific conditions and chemical reactions that are not typically observed during menstruation. Step 4: The iron starts to oxidize. If the iron from the hemoglobin molecules were somehow separated and exposed to air during menstruation, it could potentially start to oxidize. However, this scenario seems highly unlikely given the protective nature of the hemoglobin molecules and the absence of specific chemical reactions required to separate the iron. Step 5: The iron starts to rust. Given the unlikelihood of iron being separated from hemoglobin molecules and being exposed to oxygen during menstruation, the perturbation hypothesis does not appear to have a direct or indirect effect on the process of iron rusting. In conclusion, while there might be some minor exposure of iron to air during menstruation due to the presence of iron in the blood, it is unlikely to have any significant impact on the process of iron rusting. The perturbation hypothesis related to menstruation does not have a direct or indirect effect on the process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Cheating can happen in a lot of different ways. When people cheat, it's not fair to other people, like the kids who studiedfor the test or who were the true winners of a game. Many people like the action of cheating. It makes difficult things seem easy, like getting all the right answers on the test. But it doesn't solve the problem of not knowing the material and it won't help on the next test --- unless the person cheats again. Some people lose respect for cheaters and think less of them. The cheaters themselves may feel bad because they know they are not really earning that good grade. And, if they get caught cheating, they will be in trouble at school, and maybe at home, too. Some kids cheat because they're busy or lazy and they want to get good grades without spending the time studying. Other kids might feel like they can't pass the test without cheating. Even when there seems to be a \\"good reason\\" for cheating, cheating isn't a good idea. If you were sick or upset about something the night before and couldn't study, it would be better to talk with the teacher about this. And if you don't have enough time to study for a test because of swim practice, you need to talk with your parents about how to balance swimming and school. A kid who thinks cheating is the only way to pass a test needs to talk with the teacher and his or her parents so they can find some solutions together. Talking about these problems and working them out will be better than cheating.

The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse was told Lord Janner abused children over a 33-year period, arranging for those \\"in whom he had a sexual interest\\" to be brought to the Houses of Parliament. His family denies the allegations. The inquiry, chaired by Dame Lowell Goddard, will be the biggest in British history. It is set to last for five years and has a budget of Â£17.9m for this financial year alone. Lord Janner's case is one of 13 areas it will initially focus on. Speaking at the first preliminary hearing, counsel to the inquiry Ben Emmerson QC said: \\"The allegations in summary are that Greville Janner exploited children and perpetrated a full range of sexual offences against them, including what would now be termed in English law as rape. \\"In relation to a number of the complainants it is alleged that Janner abused his position as an MP by arranging for children in whom he had a sexual interest to be brought to the Houses of Parliament.\\" The offences are alleged to have taken place in children's homes and hotels between 1955 and 1988 - previously the oldest allegations to emerge against him dated back to the late 1960s. Wednesday's preliminary hearing was told that 17 complainants in the Janner case had been given core participant status in the inquiry, meaning they have the right to make statements, see documents and seek permission to ask questions. The inquiry has not received an application for core participant status from Lord Janner's family. The hearing also heard submissions about the anonymity of some witnesses, and whether public hearings, due to begin in September, will be televised. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders originally decided the peer should not be charged when the allegations emerged because he was suffering from dementia, but this was overturned by an independent review. A trial of the facts was due to take place at the Old Bailey, but was dropped when Lord Janner died. It would have heard evidence from alleged victims, but decided only whether the ex-MP committed the physical acts of abuse - and would not have made a finding of guilt or a conviction. Referring to the Goddard inquiry as a whole, Mr Emmerson said: \\"The task is vast but critically important.\\" He continued: \\"Allegations of the involvement of politicians in child sexual abuse are reported on the one hand as evidence of a paedophile conspiracy... and on the other as evidence of a modern-day witch-hunt. \\"It is the role of this inquiry to move from the realms of rumour and speculation, allegation and counter-allegation, to the assessment of objective facts.\\" He cited figures indicating that between April 2012 and March 2014 more than 50,000 children were identified as victims of sexual abuse, but said the true number may be as high as 450,000. \\"These figures should answer the doubts of anyone who questions the need for this inquiry,\\" the QC said. As part of her wider inquiry, Dame Lowell, who served as a judge in her native New Zealand, will investigate the way in which public bodies handled child sex abuse claims. The inquiry is unable to make findings of criminal or civil liability, but Mr Emmerson added: \\"No-one should be in any doubt that, where the evidence justifies it... the panel will make findings of fact on allegations of child sexual abuse.\\" He said it \\"will also need to recognise the damage that can be caused by false accusations of sexual abuse\\". A summary of the above article is?","completion":"The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse is currently investigating claims that, over a 33-year period, Lord Janner (who died in December 2015, aged 87) abused children and arranged for those \\"in whom he had a sexual interest'' to be brought to the Houses of Parliament. As the largest British inquiry to date, it has a budget of £17.9m for this financial year alone, is set to last five years, and will target 13 initial focus areas. Janner's family members deny the allegations, and 17 complainants in the Lord Janner case have now been granted core participant status in the inquiry. The offenses Lord Janner is accused of are alleged to have taken place in children's homes and hotels between 1955 and 1988. When the allegations emerged, Alison Saunders, Director of Public Prosecutions, decided not to charge him due to dementia; this decision was subsequently overturned by an independent review. A trial of the facts was scheduled to be held at the Old Bailey but was dropped when Lord Janner died. The hearing would have listed evidence from the alleged victims, determined whether the physical acts of abuse were committed but not whether Lord Janner was guilty or legally convicted. The critical aim of the Goddard inquiry is to evaluate objective facts rather than unsubstantiated rumors and media speculation surrounding allegations involving politicians in child sexual abuse. Counsel to the inquiry, Ben Emmerson QC, highlights the importance of addressing the damage that false accusations can cause, although the inquiry itself cannot make any findings of criminal or civil liability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Given the below context: The term \\"Viking metal\\" has sometimes been used as a nickname for the 1990s Norwegian black metal scene, which was \\"noisy, chaotic, and often augmented by sorrowful keyboard melodies\\". It has also been variously described as a subgenre of black metal, albeit one that abandoned black metal's Satanic imagery, \\"slow black metal\\" with influences from Nordic folk music, straddling black metal and folk metal almost equally, or running the gamut from \\"folk to black to death metal\\". Typically, Viking metal artists rely extensively on keyboards, which are often played at a \\"swift, galloping pace\\". These artists often add \\"local cultural flourishes\\" such as traditional instruments and ethnic melodies. It is similar to folk metal, and is sometimes categorized as such, but it uses folk instruments less extensively. For vocals, Viking metal incorporates both singing and the typical black metal screams and growls. Overall, Viking metal is hard to define since, apart from certain elements like anthem-like choruses, it is not based entirely on musical features and overlaps with other metal genres, with origins in black and death metal Some bands, such as Unleashed and Amon Amarth, play death metal, but incorporate Viking themes and thus are labeled as part of the genre. Generally, Viking metal is defined more by its thematic material and imagery than musical qualities. Rather than being a mock-up of medieval music, \\"it is in the band names, album titles, artwork of album covers and, especially, in the song lyrics that Viking themes are so evident.\\" Viking metal, and the closely related style pagan metal, is more of a term or \\"etiquette\\" than a musical style. Since they are defined chiefly by lyrical focus, any musical categorizations of these two styles is controversial. Thus, Viking metal is more of a cross-genre term than a descriptor of a certain sound. Ashby and Schofield write that \\"The term 'Viking metal' is one of many that falls within a complex web of genres and subgenres, the precise form of which is constantly...

Fact 2: Diploid zygote forms multicellular embryo in venter. Given the two facts above, what can lead to the formation of multicellular embryo in venter? A:","completion":"Given the two facts provided, the formation of a multicellular embryo in the venter can be described through the following process: 1. Gamete formation: In sexually reproducing organisms, gametes (sperm and egg cells) are produced via meiosis. Both male and female gametes are haploid, meaning they contain half the number of chromosomes as somatic (body) cells. 2. Fertilization: The union of male and female gametes during fertilization results in the formation of a diploid zygote. This zygote, which is a single cell, contains a complete set of chromosomes (one set from each parent). 3. Zygote development: The diploid zygote undergoes a series of cell divisions (mitosis) and differentiation, giving rise to a multicellular embryo. Cell differentiation is an essential process for the development of various cell types, tissues, and organs. 4. Formation of the multicellular embryo in the venter: The venter refers to the swollen, basal portion of the archegonium or female reproductive structure in some plants, fungi, and algae. In these organisms, the fertilized egg (zygote) develops directly within the venter's protective environment, which provides the necessary nutrients and conditions for growth. In summary, the formation of a multicellular embryo in the venter is primarily driven by the fertilization event, where haploid gametes unite to form a diploid zygote. This zygote then undergoes cell divisions and differentiation to give rise to a multicellular embryo within the protected environment of the venter."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If you want different colored jigglers, you'll need a different bowl and pan for each color.","completion":"Next, follow these steps to make your jigglers: 1. Boil water: In a medium-sized saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to a rolling boil. Be careful not to overfill the saucepan, as boiling water may spill over. 2. Add boiling water to the mix: Carefully pour the boiling water into the bowl containing the jello powder. Use a whisk to mix the contents thoroughly, ensuring that all the powder is dissolved into the water. This process should take around 2 minutes. 3. Add cold water: Measure 1 cup of cold water and slowly pour it into the jello mixture. Continue whisking until the mixture is evenly combined. 4. Prepare the pan: Select a pan for molding your jigglers, such as a 9x13-inch baking dish or a silicone mold with individual compartments for more intricate shapes. Spray a thin layer of cooking oil in the pan to prevent the jigglers from sticking. 5. Pour mixture into the pan: Slowly pour the jello mixture into the prepared pan or mold, ensuring that it's evenly distributed. If using multiple colors, repeat steps 1-3 for each color and pour them into separate bowls. Carefully layer the different colored mixtures into the pan or mold, waiting for each layer to slightly set before adding the next. 6. Refrigerate: Place the pan in the refrigerator, ensuring that it's on a level surface to prevent any spills. Allow the jigglers to chill for at least 3-4 hours, or until they are completely set and firm to the touch. For best results, let them refrigerate overnight. 7. Remove jigglers from the pan: Once the jigglers have set, remove them from the refrigerator. If using a baking dish, use a sharp knife to cut the jigglers into squares or other shapes. If using a silicone mold, gently push the jigglers out of the compartments. You can also use a small spatula or a butter knife to loosen the edges before removing. 8. Serve and enjoy: Place the jigglers on a serving plate, and enjoy them as a fun and colorful treat! Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week. Optional Add-ins: To make your jigglers more interesting, consider adding some of the following ingredients: - Fruit: Chop up small pieces of fruits such as strawberries, blueberries, or kiwis, and add them to the jello mixture before pouring it into the pan. - Whipped topping: Serve your jigglers with a dollop of whipped cream or whipped topping for added flavor and creaminess. - Alcohol: For adult jiggler variations, replace part of the cold water with your favorite spirit or liquor, such as vodka or tequila. Make sure to keep these jigglers separate from the non-alcoholic ones and consume responsibly. With these simple steps, you'll have a delightful treat that both children and adults can enjoy at parties, gatherings, or as a fun snack on a relaxing day at home."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After he explains how it works (including a \\"non-return key\\" that keeps the machine at the traveler's destination and a \\"vaporizing equalizer\\" that keeps the traveler and machine on equal terms), police constables arrive at the house searching for Jack the Ripper. A bag with blood-stained gloves belonging to one of Herbert's friends, a surgeon named John Leslie Stevenson (David Warner), leads them to conclude that Stevenson might be the infamous killer. Wells races to his laboratory, but the time machine is gone. Stevenson has escaped to the future, but because he does not have the \\"non-return\\" key, the machine automatically returns to 1893. Herbert uses it to pursue Stevenson to November 5, 1979, where the machine has ended up on display at a museum in San Francisco. He is deeply shocked by the future, having expected it to be an enlightened socialist utopia, only to find chaos in the form of airplanes, automobiles and a worldwide history of war, crime and bloodshed. Reasoning that Stevenson would need to exchange his British money, Herbert asks about him at various banks. At the Chartered Bank of London, he meets liberated employee Amy Robbins (Mary Steenburgen), who says she had directed Stevenson to the Hyatt Regency hotel.

Scrutinizing refers to the act of closely examining or analyzing something to identify potential discrepancies, inaccuracies, or misleading information. This is especially important for consumers to avoid falling victim to false claims, exaggerated benefits, or scams. Here are some steps that can be taken when scrutinizing product claims: 1. Research the product and company: Look for information about the product and the company behind it. Check for customer reviews, testimonials, and industry reputation. Investigate the company's history, any previous products they have released, and whether or not they have a track record of making false claims or selling low-quality products. 2. Assess the validity of the proof provided: Check if the proof is based on scientific studies, and if so, look at the methodology, sample size, and the relevance of the study to the product's claims. If possible, find and read the full study to understand its findings and limitations. Additionally, be cautious of anecdotal evidence, as it can be biased and potentially misleading. 3. Look for independent, third-party verification: If a product has been certified or endorsed by a credible organization or expert, it lends credibility to the effectiveness claims. However, ensure that the organization or expert is indeed independent and not connected to the company that manufactures or sells the product. 4. Compare the product to similar products on the market: Analyze how the product's claims stack up against comparable products from different brands. This can help identify whether the claims are reasonable or too optimistic. 5. Use logic and common sense: If a product claims to provide exceptional results that seem to defy conventional wisdom or scientific understanding, it's crucial to approach these claims with skepticism. By scrutinizing the proof for a product's effectiveness, savvy consumers can protect themselves from being misled and make more informed purchasing decisions.

Answer with \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\". The National Security Act of 1947 created the position of Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). Independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U.S.intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities. The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA. As an independent agency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources. The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations. Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA. The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet. The director's power under federal law over the loose, confederated \\"intelligence community\\" is limited. He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress. This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises. Neither is true. In fact, the DCI's real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned over the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense.

His stark declaration underscores an intriguing backstory. Wales' historic encounters with Australia have offered a mix of triumph and heartbreak, underscoring a classic rivalry and creating a compelling narrative in the world of Rugby. Wales had experienced a World Cup dry spell against Australia since 1987, until they broke the cycle with a thrilling 29-25 victory in Tokyo during the 2019 Rugby World Cup. The previous string of losses, however, did nothing to dampen the fighting spirit of the Wales team. Instead, the team leveraged the past as a valuable lesson, fashioning their previous drawbacks into stepping stones towards the victory they keenly desired. This new determination is evident in the revived spirit of the team, their unwavering confidence, and their fierce approach towards the game, irrespective of the opponent's reputation. The rarity of their victories only served to intensify their appetite for more, propelling them into a new age with an unquenchable thirst for triumph. Gatland's comment, therefore, comes against the backdrop of this transformation within the Wales team - a transformation that has been masterfully driven by Gatland himself. His leadership style expertly balances hard-nosed discipline and an empathetic understanding of the psychological factors that motivate athletes to outperform and exceed expectations. As the team girds up for their clash with their long-standing rivals, Australia, the anticipation is palpable. Despite the respectable prowess of the Australian team, the invigorated Wales team, under the strategic and robust leadership of Gatland, feels destined to not just compete but to conquer. The Welsh coach's passionate proclamation resonates with tinges of personal ambition as well as a collective urge to elevate the performance of the team. It demonstrates the intense and unwavering commitment of Gatland towards charting out a victorious course for his team. In conclusion, Coach Warren Gatland's earnest statement enhances the lore of the enduring rivalry between Wales and Australia in rugby. It has undoubtedly added a fresh layer of excitement to the impending clash between the two nations. As the team marches on, driven by Gatland's desire, the world watches on, eager to see if this renewed zeal will indeed transform into a historic victory."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Napoleon's educational reforms laid the foundation of a modern system of education in France and throughout much of Europe. Napoleon synthesized the best academic elements from the Ancien Régime, The Enlightenment, and the Revolution, with the aim of establishing a stable, well-educated and prosperous society. He made French the only official language. He left some primary education in the hands of religious orders, but he offered public support to secondary education. Napoleon founded a number of state secondary schools (lycées) designed to produce a standardized education that was uniform across France. All students were taught the sciences along with modern and classical languages. Unlike the system during the Ancien Régime, religious topics did not dominate the curriculum, although they were present in addition to teachers from the clergy. Napoleon simply hoped to use religion to produce social stability. He gave special attention to the advanced centers, notably the École Polytechnique, that provided both military expertise and state-of-the-art research in science. Napoleon made some of the first major efforts at establishing a system of secular and public education. The system featured scholarships and strict discipline, with the result being a French educational system that outperformed its European counterparts, many of which borrowed from the French system.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If you partner turns their back to you at any point, let your hands slide down until they’re resting on their hip bones. This will allow you to feel their movements more closely, and will also give you a little bit of control if you decide to change up your technique. It’s normal for the person in the rear to hold onto their partner’s hips. Even so, be sure to lower your hands slowly so that your partner will have a chance to say something if they’re not okay with it. Don’t venture any further unless you’re explicitly told that it’s alright to do so. Unwanted touching is still inappropriate, even while grinding. Bend your knees slightly and sway from side to side. From there, you can begin moving in circles, or experiment with any other movements that suggest themselves to you in the heat of the moment. Depending on your height, you may have to stand up taller or put a little extra bend in your knees to keep even with your partner. Grinding is all about getting in synch with your partner, so stick close enough to keep your hips against your partner’s throughout the dance and try to mirror their movements. Allow your partner to call the shots when it comes to things like what movements to use and how much touching there is in various places. Being a good partner is all about respecting the person you’re sharing the floor with and adjusting your style to suit theirs. The more chemistry you have with your partner, the more likely they are to step up the amount of contact between you. If you’re dancing with someone you don’t know, or just don’t feel like dancing too close, you can tilt slightly to one side. Your partner will lean in the other direction. That way, you’ll be grinding on your your leg more than your lap. Pay attention to signs that your partner is hesitant to continue dancing so close. If their movements slow or stop or they try to pull away, for instance, it’s best to create a little distance. It wouldn’t be very fun if just you stood there and rocked your hips back and forth the entire time. To keep things fresh, try cycling between different movements every couple of minutes, or take turns leading and following. You may only have until the end of the song to enjoy your connection with your partner, so make it count! If you and your partner are on the same page, you could even try dropping it low, dipping to opposite sides, or improvising your own embellishments. Another simple way to make grinding more interesting is to alternate between dancing from the front and back. Just because your partner was willing to grind with you, doesn’t that they’re up for anything beyond that. People often come to a club just because they want to dance, not looking for hook-ups. If your partner seems interested in you though, you can always ask them out, but be prepared to respect their answer. If your partner walks away after the song ends, don’t chase them. Instead, appreciate the fact that you had a chance to dance together and start looking for a new partner. Summary:","completion":"The article provides advice on how to respectfully and effectively engage in grinding, a dance style, by adjusting to your partner's movements and preferences, paying attention to their comfort level, and experimenting with various techniques to keep the dance interesting, while reminding dancers to respect boundaries and be mindful of body language."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Sediment becomes loose from the rest of the soil - The sediment rolls down hill towards a river - The heavy items sink to the bottom - The lighter items float on the top and in convection cycles - As the river flows the sediment is moved - The sediment gets dumped through tributaries into lakes and the ocean - The sediment keeps moving around the world in convection currents. Question: suppose the spark plugs are weak happens, how will it affect LESS sediment being transported. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","completion":"The scenario described in the process consists of sediment transportation through natural geological events. However, the question pertains to the impacts of weak spark plugs on sediment transport. To provide a detailed and long answer, we will first explain the function of spark plugs and then discuss their potential influence on sediment transport, if any. Spark plugs are critical components in vehicles with internal combustion engines, such as cars, trucks, and motorcycles. Their primary function is to produce a high-voltage electrical spark that ignites the air-fuel mixture within the engine's combustion chamber. By doing so, spark plugs enable the power required to propel the vehicle. In case of weak spark plugs, the electrical discharge is not robust enough, which results in inefficient or incomplete combustion and may lead to reduced engine performance, poor gas mileage, and increased emissions. Now, let's consider the possible relationship between weak spark plugs and sediment transport. The transportation of sediment naturally occurs due to geological events like soil erosion, water flow down hills, river movements, and oceanic currents. These events do not depend on human interference or technological malfunctions such as weak spark plugs. However, a potential indirect connection between weak spark plugs and sediment transportation can be identified through human activities that involve using vehicles powered by internal combustion engines. For instance, if vehicles with weak spark plugs are used for construction works in a specific area, the reduced engine performance might result in slower or less efficient sediment movement or transport during the excavation and material relocation processes. In such a scenario, weak spark plugs may affect sediment transportation but in a very limited context. Given the broader context of sediment transportation as a natural process driven mainly by geological events, weak spark plugs essentially have no direct and substantial impact. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is: C: No effect It's important to note that this answer only holds when considering sediment transportation across the world in natural convection cycles. A focused analysis of the effect of continuous human interference in certain regions might show a slight influence of weak spark plugs on local sediment transportation due to inefficient machinery. Nonetheless, such influence would still be minimal when compared to the vastness and complexity of sediment transport at a global scale."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: May 14, 2016 7:07 PM EDT Politics By Reena Flores / CBS News The New York Times was out with a blistering report Saturday on presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, shining a spotlight on his oftentimes problematic personal and professional dealings with women. Trump's treatment of the women he has considered rivals during his presidential campaign has been well-documented, including his threats and tweet attacks against Ted Cruz's wife Heidi, his crude dismissals of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly and his insults of one-time primary competitor Carly Fiorina. But the Times dove deep into his long history of employing women in the Trump Organization and in his beauty pageants, painting a sometimes contradictory portrait of a man who both elevated women professionally and yet still treated them with blatant disrespect. Some women involved in the pageant industry said Trump sometimes treated contestants in inappropriately affectionate ways, with one former pageant competitor saying the Miss USA owner greeted her with a kiss on the lips. \\"He kissed me directly on the lips. I thought, 'Oh my God, gross,'\\" Temple Taggart, Miss Utah in 1997, told the Times. \\"He was married to Marla Maples at the time. I think there were a few other girls that he kissed on the mouth. I was like 'Wow, that's inappropriate.'\\" Another contestant, Carrie Prejean, Miss California in 2009, wrote in a memoir that the women during one pageant \\"were told to put on our opening number outfits -- they were nearly as revealing as our swimsuits -- and line up for him onstage.\\" One encounter Prejean outlined included a question Trump posed to Miss Alabama, asking \\"who's the most beautiful woman here?\\" When the woman answered that she found Miss Arkansas \\"sweet,\\" Trump reprimanded her. \\"I don't care if she's sweet,\\" Trump said, according to Prejean. \\"Is she hot?\\" After Trump's inspections during the pageant, some girls \\"were sobbing backstage,\\" Prejean wrote, because they were \\"devastated to have failed even before the competition really began.\\" Trump denied to the Times that all these pageant encounters ever took place, saying he would have been uncomfortable with pressing his lips to those of strangers. Discussing whether he had ever evaluated his contestants onstage in the manner Prejean described, Trump said he would never have done so because \\"that's hurtful to people.\\" One incident involving Trump's own daughter was recalled by the 1997 Miss Universe, Brook Antoinette Mahealani Lee. When Ivanka Trump helped host the 1997 Miss Teen USA pageant, Trump reportedly turned to Lee and asked for her opinion on his daughter. \\"'Don't you think my daughter's hot? She's hot, right?'\\" Lee recalled of Trump's question to her. \\"I was like, 'Really?' That's just weird. She was 16. That's creepy.\\" For one pageant winner, Trump's words had a lasting negative impact on her. Alicia Machado, the 1996 Miss Universe, discussed how Trump had publicly shamed her into losing weight after she won her title, saying Trump's people had taken her to a gym and \\"exposed her to 90 media outlets\\" after she had asked for the Miss Universe Organization for help in recuperating after the pageant. \\"I was about to cry in that moment with all the cameras there,\\" Machado said. \\"I said, 'I don't want to do this, Mr. Trump.' He said, 'I don't care.'\\" The encounter sparked a yearslong struggle with anorexia and bulimia, the former Miss Universe told the Times. Trump told the Times he pressed Machado to lose weight. For some of the women in his professional life, Trump both built them up and tore them down, according to the Times report. One top executive, Barbara Res, who was Trump's chief of construction for several years in the 1980s, recalled Trump once casually commenting after she had gained some weight: \\"You like your candy.\\" Res nevertheless credited Trump for hiring her in such a high-level position, even when his own father seemed to scoff at the idea of a woman as the chief of construction. \\"'I know you're a woman in a man's world,'\\" Res said Trump had once told her. \\"'And while men tend to be better than women, a good woman is better than 10 good men.'... He thought he was really complimenting me.\\" Some of the women he dated also spoke to the Times, revealing unflattering encounters with Trump. One model, Rowanne Brewer Lane, was 26 years old when she first met a then-44-year-old Donald Trump. She told the newspaper that immediately after meeting her, Trump had asked her to change out of her clothes. \\"He took me into a room and opened drawers and asked me to put on a swimsuit,\\" Lane said, discussing a pool party of Trump's she once attended. \\"I went into the bathroom and tried one on,\\" she said, referring to a bikini. \\"I came out, and he said, 'Wow.'\\" Of that encounter, Trump told the Times that \\"a lot of things get made up over the years.\\" Title:","completion":"\\"Trump's Complex History with Women: Empowerment and Disrespect\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: a ) 40 , b ) 72 , c ) 84 , d ) 90 , e ) 108 Solution:","completion":"To compare the times it takes for Tom to cover half and twice the distance Linda has covered, first we need to set up equations representing their respective distances. Let L be the distance covered by Linda and T be the distance covered by Tom. We know that Linda walks at 2 miles per hour and has a 1 hour head start on Tom. So, Linda's distance can be represented as: L = 2 * (t + 1) Tom jogs at 8 miles per hour, so Tom's distance can be represented as: T = 8 * t Now we need to find the times it takes for Tom to cover half of Linda's distance and twice of Linda's distance. 1) Half the distance: T = 0.5 * L Using the equations we derived earlier: 8 * t = 0.5 * (2 * (t + 1)) 8 * t = t + 1 Solving for t: 7 * t = 1 t = 1/7 hours 2) Twice the distance: T = 2 * L Using the equations we derived earlier: 8 * t = 2 * (2 * (t + 1)) 8 * t = 4 * (t + 1) 8 * t = 4 * t + 4 Solving for t: 4 * t = 4 t = 1 hour Now, we need to find the positive difference between the times: Difference = |2 * (1/7) - 1| = |2/7 - 7/7| = |(-5)/7| Converting the difference to minutes: Difference(minutes) = (|(-5)/7|) * 60 = 300/7 ≈ 42.86 The closest option to this value is option (c) 84."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Given the below context: While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against Richard Wagner's music dramas, heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period. Fanning writes, \\"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera Saul and David and the Second Symphony (The Four Temperaments) and the cantatas Hymnus amoris and Søvnen\\". Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start, but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer's life.Nielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate.

The incredible spectacle was caught on camera by astute observers who managed to capture the stunning images of the fireball before it disappeared into the darkness. As the meteor lit up the sky, it not only provided a breathtaking visual experience, but also offered an extraordinary opportunity for scientists to study the properties and path of the celestial object. The Meteor Sighting: The sighting occurred when the sky was clear and the meteor's light was strong enough to outshine the moon. Residents of north-east Scotland were captivated by the brilliant streak of light, filling social networks with reports of the sighting and sharing their awe-inspiring images and videos. For a brief yet memorable moment, the meteor's flare turned the night sky into day, its vivid colors and intense brightness stirring the excitement of those who managed to witness the extraordinary event. Expert Reactions: Meteor experts wasted no time in examining the available footage and data in order to better understand the meteor's properties, size, and path. Scientists were eager to calculate the meteor's speed, as well its composition and possible origin within the solar system. Dr. Paul Relis, an expert in meteor studies, shares his insights on the meteor: \\"The meteor is estimated to have been 100 times brighter than the full moon, making it an exceptionally bright fireball.\\" Moreover, the team at the UK Meteor Observation Network (UKMON) was quick to jump into action, collecting the data, images, and videos shared by the public. With their vast experience and specialized equipment, they were able to determine the meteor's trajectory and the potential landing site for any meteorite fragments that may have reached the Earth's surface. These fragments are of significant interest to researchers, as they offer valuable clues about our solar system's history and the formation of celestial bodies. The Impact on the Community: For those who were fortunate enough to witness the meteor lighting up the sky, it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that left a lasting impact. The immense power and beauty of the celestial object offered an extraordinary display for sky watchers. Many residents reported feeling humbled and awestruck by the meteor's appearance, describing the surreal scene as a transcendent moment where the sheer scale and wonder of the universe was on full display. Social networks buzzed with excitement, as people shared their experiences and reactions to the stunning meteor. Astronomers and sky watchers in the region and beyond celebrated the rare opportunity to observe such a dramatic astronomical phenomenon. In an era where we are so often consumed by our technology and daily routines, this meteor sighting served as a timely reminder that the universe around us is vast, mysterious, and capable of surprising us in the most awe-inspiring ways. Conclusion: As the memory of the meteor's dazzling light begins to fade, the skies above north-east Scotland have returned to their normal, starry state. Yet, for those who managed to catch a glimpse of the fireball, the celestial event has left a lasting impression—a reminder of the tremendous forces at play in the cosmos and the beauty that can emerge from seemingly nowhere. The images and videos captured will not only serve as treasured keepsakes, but also provide valuable data for scientists, allowing them to expand our understanding of meteors and the celestial dance that takes place far beyond our planet's atmosphere."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

It inflicted little major damage physically, but changed Japanese strategy while firing up Americans. 'It was what you do ... over time, we've been told what effect our raid had on the war and the morale of the people,' Lt. Col. Edward Saylor, 93, said in an interview. The Brusset, Mont. native, who now lives in Puyallup, Wash., said he was one of the lucky ones. 'There were a whole bunch of guys in World War II; a lot of people didn't come back,' he said. Staff Sgt. David Thatcher, 92, of Missoula, Mont., said during the war, the raid seemed like 'one of many bombing missions'. The most harrowing part for him was the crash-landing of his plane, depicted in the movie Thirty Seconds over Tokyo. Three crew members died as Raiders bailed out or crash-landed their planes in China, but most were helped to safety by Chinese villagers and soldiers.

The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases.

Lombardi's perfectionism, authoritarian nature and temper, instilled in his wife a masterful ability to verbally assault and demean Lombardi when he verbally abused her. His children were not immune from his yelling. When Lombardi had not lost his temper, he would often be reticent and aloof. Lombardi's grandson, Joe Lombardi, was named the offensive coordinator for the Detroit Lions in January 2014. He was relieved of this position midway through the 2015 season. Lombardi was previously quarterbacks coach for the New Orleans Saints.

Both sought to expand their influence and territory. The Austrian Empire – like the Holy Roman Empire – was a multi-ethnic state, but German-speaking people there did not have an absolute numerical majority; the creation of the Austro-Hungarian Empire was one result of the growing nationalism of other ethnicities especially the Hungarians. Prussia under Otto von Bismarck would ride on the coat-tails of nationalism to unite all of modern-day Germany.

After being held for nearly 26 years on Robben Island for planning acts of sabotage against the South African state, Mandela's release also marks what soon becomes the end of apartheid in South Africa. A new election is held, which Mandela handily wins. For his oath, he gives a speech pledging to unite the people of South Africa. The current divide has largely divided the Afrikaners (white South Africans that came from Europe during the 17th century) and the various black tribes, the largest of which include Zulu, Xhosa, and Bapedi. The effects of Mandela's victory give rise to jubilation for much of the black population of South Africa, while the white Afrikaners and Zulu begin to feel that they're losing the country. This is punctuated by a squadron of cars carrying Mandela down a road, poor black kids playing soccer on one side, white Afrikaners playing rugby on the other. The coach of the National team, the Springboks, tells his team to remember this day, as it marks 'the day the country went to the dogs'.Mandela's head of security Jason Tshabalala (Tony Kgoroge) makes a request of Mandela concerning the team. He asks for more personnel to secure the president, the current team being made up of four blacks. Mandela's response is to hire four white former Special Branch members led by Etienne Feyder (Julian Lewis Jones). On first meeting, they clash due to deep-seated racial issues, yet are compelled to work out their differences. Seeing that he has no choice but to work alongside them, Tshabalala tells his black co-workers, especially Linga Moonsamy (Patrick Mofokeng), that while working together, they will watch the whites carefully.In his first days in office, the tension is palpable, as most of the former president's underlings (mostly Afrikaners) still hold their jobs.

Therefore, the correct answer is (2). The given statement does not offer us any information about the physical condition or structural integrity of the carriages as such. The primary focus of the sentence is on the uncomfortable seats, which are likened to shells, indicating that while it might be an unpleasant experience to sit in them, it doesn't necessarily suggest damage or breakage in any way. It is important not to make assumptions based on limited information presented. The sentence could be interpreted in several ways, and none of them conclusively provide insight into the condition of the carriages. For instance, it could mean: 1. The carriages have been designed in such a way that they are divided into sections with multiple isles, featuring these uncomfortable, shell-like seats. 2. The carriages are arranged closely together, creating an overall experience of discomfort as passengers navigate through them, primarily due to the shell-like seating arrangements. 3. Alternatively, it could be a metaphorical description of a crowded or unpleasant environment that exists within the interconnected carriages or their seating arrangements, using the imagery of shell-like seats to emphasize the discomfort. However, none of these interpretations directly address the structural condition of the carriages themselves. While they shed light on the experience of the passengers with regards to the seating, there is no substantial evidence or mention of the carriages being either intact or damaged.

It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament. - The International Pentecostal Holiness Church ( IPHC ) or simply Pentecostal Holiness Church ( PHC ) is a Pentecostal Christian denomination founded in 1911 with the merger of two older denominations . Historically centered in the Southeastern United States , particularly the Carolinas and Georgia , the Pentecostal Holiness Church now has an international presence . In 2000 , the church reported a worldwide membership of over one million -- over three million including affiliates . Heavily influenced by two major American revival movements -- the holiness movement of the late 19th century and the Pentecostal revival of the early 20th century -- the church 's theological roots derive from John Wesley 's teachings on sanctification . Several ministers who were raised in the Pentecostal Holiness Church have come to have greater name recognition than the church itself , such as Oral Roberts , an internationally known charismatic evangelist ; Charles Stanley , a former president of the Southern Baptist Convention ; and C.M. Ward , a former Assemblies of God radio preacher . - Apostolic succession is the method whereby the ministry of the Christian Church is held to be derived from the apostles by a continuous succession, which has usually been associated with a claim that the succession is through a series of bishops. This series was seen originally as that of the bishops of a particular see founded by one or more of the apostles. According to historian Justo L. González, apostolic succession is generally understood today as meaning a series of bishops, regardless of see, each consecrated by other bishops, themselves consecrated similarly in a succession going back to the apostles. But, according to documentation produced by the Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue Between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church, the sees (\\"cathedrae\\") play \\"an important role in inserting the bishop into the heart of ecclesial apostolicity\\". - A Christian denomination is a distinct religious body within Christianity, identified by traits such as a name, organisation, leadership and doctrine. Individual bodies, however, may use alternative terms to describe themselves, such as church or sometimes fellowship. Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine; issues such as the nature of Jesus, the authority of apostolic succession, eschatology, and papal primacy may separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices, and historical ties are sometimes known as \\"branches of Christianity\\" or \\"denominational families\\". - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.

Write some highlights for the following article: The mother of a 17-year-old girl who was shot and killed by Colorado police earlier this week is calling for an independent autopsy because she doesn't trust the official investigation. Laura Sonya Rosales Hernandez made the demand after her daughter Jessica was shot on Monday - the fourth time in seven months a Denver officer fired at a vehicle after perceiving it as a threat. The request came yesterday as the Denver Police Department and an independent city official who monitors the agency disclosed that separate investigations were underway into policies regarding officers shooting at moving vehicles. Scroll down for video. Laura Sonya Rosales Hernandez (right) is asking for a second autopsy to be conducted on her daughter (left) 17-year-old Jessica Hernandez (pictured) was shot and killed on Monday by two Denver police officers. Denver police say Jessica drove a stolen car at two of the department's officers, hitting one of them in the leg. Mrs Hernandez said: 'I want another autopsy on my daughter so we can know how much damage they did.' 'I want to know, how did this happen? I want to know everything.' She also has five other children, including a four-year-old son, to worry about. Police have said the two officers involved in the shooting, Daniel Greene, a 16-year-veteran, and Gabriel Jordan, a nine-year-veteran of the force, fired after Hernandez drove a stolen car into one of them. Jordan suffered a fractured leg. A passenger in the car disputed that account, saying police opened fire before the vehicle struck the officer. Police have admitted no one in the car, which contained five people, was armed. Greene and Jordan have been placed on routine administrative leave pending the investigation. Hernandez's mother said her daughter made a mistake by 'grabbing' a car that did not belong to her but didn't deserve to pay with her life. She said: 'How much do they need to investigate?' 'It's all done. They did it. They killed her. All I want is justice.' A passenger in the car, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of safety concerns, said Hernandez lost control of the vehicle because she was unconscious after being shot. The passenger said officers came up to the car from behind and fired four times into the driver's side window as they stood on the side of the car, narrowly missing others inside. Mrs Hernandez criticized the way police handled her daughter after she was shot. She said: 'They dragged her on the floor and threw her down like a piece of garbage,' Mrs Hernandez held her four-year-old son Kevin while she talked with reporters in her home in Thornton. A shrine in remembrance of Jessica's life was set up at her family's home. She leaves behind five siblings. A passenger in the car said Jessica (pictured left and right) lost control of the vehicle after being shot. The shooting occurred amid a national debate about police use of force fueled by racially-charged episodes in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City. Investigators in the Denver case will be relying on witnesses and police accounts because the department has only just started to buy body cameras for its officers and Jordan and Greene were not yet outfitted. Denver does not use in-car dashboard cameras. Prosecutors promised a thorough probe of the shooting as a group of angry protesters demanded swift answers and called for a special prosecutor to investigate the death earlier this week. A vigil in the alleyway in which the teenager was shot dead was also held. Protester Bruce Young waves a sign before a meeting with officials from the Denver District Attorney's office. Doug Jackson (center) and Lamar Sims (right), senior chief deputy district attorneys with the office of the Denver District Attorney, talked to Jose Castaneda (left) and other activists on Tuesday. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that officers may not use deadly force to stop a fleeing suspect unless the person is believed to pose significant physical harm. Policies vary and some departments have banned or discouraged the practice. The police department and independent monitor Nicholas Mitchell are both looking at how national standards compare to Denver's policy. The city currently allows officers to fire at moving cars if they have no other reasonable way to prevent death or serious injury. Denver's policy urges officers to try to move out of the way rather than fire. It states: 'An officer threatened by an oncoming vehicle shall, if feasible, move out of the way rather than discharging a firearm.' Experts say shooting and disabling a driver can send a car out of control. Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, said: 'If you were to shoot at the driver you would have an unguided missile, basically.' Candles and bouquets were left near the scene of the fatal police shooting in an alleyway in northeast Denver. Flowers were put out, candles were lit and a rosary was draped over a portrait of Jessica at her home. Highlights:","completion":"- Jessica Hernandez, a 17-year-old girl, was shot and killed by Colorado police on Monday, the fourth time in seven months a Denver officer fired at a vehicle perceiving it as a threat. - Laura Sonya Rosales Hernandez, Jessica's mother, is calling for an independent autopsy as she doesn't trust the official investigation. - Separate investigations are underway into policies regarding officers shooting at moving vehicles by the Denver Police Department and an independent city official who monitors the agency. - Two officers involved in the shooting, Daniel Greene and Gabriel Jordan, have been placed on routine administrative leave pending the investigation. - Hernandez's mother said her daughter made a mistake by driving a stolen car but didn't deserve to pay with her life and demands justice. - The shooting raises further concerns over police use of force, with national debates ongoing due to several incidents in the US. - The Denver Police Department and independent monitor Nicholas Mitchell are examining how national standards compare to Denver's policy on officers firing at moving cars."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Background: Drescher was born in Kew Gardens Hills, New York, the daughter of Sylvia, a bridal consultant, and Morty Drescher, a naval systems analyst. Her family is from Southeast and Central Europe. Her maternal great-grandmother Yetta was born in Focsani, Romania, and emigrated to the United States, while her father's family came from Poland. She has an older sister, Nadine. Context: In January 1985, two armed robbers broke into Drescher and Jacobson's Los Angeles apartment. While one ransacked their home, Drescher and a female friend were raped by the other at gunpoint. Jacobson was also physically attacked, tied up, and forced to witness the entire ordeal. It took Drescher many years to recover, and it took her even longer to tell her story to the press. She was paraphrased as saying in an interview with Larry King that although it was a traumatic experience, she found ways to turn it into something positive. In her book Cancer Schmancer, the actress writes: \\"My whole life has been about changing negatives into positives.\\" Her rapist, who was on parole at the time of the crime, was returned to prison and given two life sentences. After separating in 1996, Drescher and Jacobson divorced in 1999. They had no children. Drescher stated, \\"I would have been able to conceive but not hold on.\\" Drescher has worked to support LGBT rights issues after her former husband came out. Drescher has stated that the primary reason for the divorce was her need to change directions in life. Drescher and Jacobson remain friends and business partners.

Step 2: Analyze the role of Standing Order 38 in keeping the government accountable This procedure aids in ensuring accountability as MPs can question government policies and actions, thus fostering transparency and encouraging a comprehensive discussion of pressing issues. However, we must be cautious not to overstate the role of Standing Order 38 in this matter. Step 3: Consider alternative ways the government is held accountable Parliamentary systems usually employ a variety of other tools to maintain government accountability. Some of these include: 1. Question Period: A daily (or regular) opportunity for MPs to question the government and its ministers on their policies and conduct. 2. Parliamentary committees: MPs work in committees to scrutinize government policies, actions, and budgetary allocations. 3. Debates: MPs debate proposed legislation, which can lead to amendments or rejection of the bill. 4. Votes of confidence and censure motions: MPs can express their support or disapproval of the government through these mechanisms, which could result in the dissolution of the government. 5. Media and public opinion: The government is held accountable by the media, which often scrutinizes and reports on their actions. Public opinion also plays a crucial role in shaping government decisions. Step 4: Evaluate the original statement Considering the alternative ways through which the government is held accountable, it would not be accurate to say that, without Standing Order 38, there would be no way to keep the government accountable for its policies. Although Standing Order 38 is an essential tool for maintaining transparency and accountability, it is just one of several mechanisms available within the parliamentary system. In conclusion, we cannot infer that \\"if it were not for Standing order 38, there would not be any way to keep the government accountable for its policies\\" because there are multiple other ways the government is held accountable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Building upon this foundation, Dr. Moustakas at Boston University patented a method for producing high-brightness blue LEDs using a new two-step process. Two years later, in 1993, high-brightness blue LEDs were demonstrated again by Shuji Nakamura of Nichia Corporation using a gallium nitride growth process similar to Dr. Moustakas's. Both Dr. Moustakas and Mr. Nakamura were issued separate patents, which confused the issue of who was the original inventor (partly because although Dr. Moustakas invented his first, Dr. Nakamura filed first).[citation needed] This new development revolutionized LED lighting, making high-power blue light sources practical, leading to the development of technologies like BlueRay, as well as allowing the bright high resolution screens of modern tablets and phones.[citation needed] What technology was made possible by high-power blue light sources? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"High-power blue light sources, made possible by key breakthroughs in GaN epitaxial growth and p-type doping, effectively transformed the landscape of optoelectronics and solid-state lighting. This technology facilitated the creation of high-brightness blue LEDs, which had a profound impact and enabled a series of technological advancements. Among the most notable applications and technologies that were made possible by high-power blue light sources include: 1. Blue-Ray Technology: The development of high-power blue light sources played a critical role in the creation of Blu-ray technology. Blu-ray discs, which superseded DVDs, offer a significantly larger storage capacity due to the ability of blue light to read and write data at a much smaller scale than the red light used in DVDs. This ability comes from its shorter wavelength, allowing data to be packed more densely onto the disc. Hence, the mastering of blue LEDs was an essential stepping stone to the development of Blu-ray disc technology. 2. High resolution screens: The introduction of high-brightness blue light sources paved the way for the development of modern, high resolution screens. This includes screens used in smartphones, tablets, computers, and TVs. Through the utilization of blue LEDs, along with red and green for full-color displays, manufacturers could produce screens capable of displaying images and videos of significantly higher quality, vibrancy, and sharpness. This technology also contributed to the development of more energy-efficient displays, which are now a standard feature in most digital devices. 3. White LED Lights: High-brightness blue LEDs have also been used to produce white light in LED lamps and bulbs. By using blue LEDs with phosphor coatings, it became possible to convert some of the blue light to other colors to create a fuller, 'whiter' light. This innovation led to the creation of white LED lights which are more energy-efficient, longer lasting, and environmentally friendly compared to traditional incandescent and fluorescent lighting. 4. Medical applications: High-power blue LEDs found significant applications in the medical field too. For instance, they've been used in phototherapy for newborns with jaundice or in skin treatments for conditions such as acne. The blue light emitted by LEDs can destroy the bacteria that cause the acne, without harming the skin. 5. Optical Storage: Beyond Blu-ray technology, blue LEDs also facilitated the development of superior optical storage technologies. With the capacity to read and write smaller pits, these high-powered blue LEDs broaden the spectrum of data storage solutions. 6. Industrial Applications: Blue LEDs have been employed in various industrial applications as well, such as curing of adhesive materials quickly and efficiently. Overall, the development of high-power blue light sources significantly accelerated the pace of technological advancements in a wide array of sectors, ranging from consumer electronics to the medical field."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Long queues at cinemas buying hot tickets for blockbusters will become rare as Beijing residents will be able to order film tickets via cell phone networks in a month. Film ticket circulation service on cell phone, also called the \\"Green channel of film tickets ordering\\", is aiming at lowing the cost of ticket circulation and easing the ticket distribution pressure on such popular film-watching days as summer and winter vacations or Valentine's Day. \\"People log onto the net through cell phones, then choose cinema seats, _ , browse information for new films and read cinema introductions,\\" said Guan Zheng, the publicity chief of Xingmei Digital Media Company Ltd., the service provider. \\"Film fans can enjoy various discount prices if they order tickets via cell phones,\\" Guan said. Meanwhile, the cell phone ticket circulation platform provides subscribers general mobile phone services like jokes, videos, flashes, phone ring downloads and games. The service is about to be put into trial at the Beijing-based Xingmei International Cinema for a month before being putting into use at other cinema chains both in and outside Beijing, as the service is going to be improved through gradual expansion, said Guan. China's film industry that is being restored has seen more and more enthusiastic moviegoers. Up to the end of 2009, China has had more than 5,000 specialized cinemas, among which there are 2,243 modern cinemas with 3, 668 silver screens and 56 cinema chains. Currently, many people buy film tickets on the Internet or by phoning the cinema's ticket office or simply queuing at the cinema gate. More people want to buy tickets on popular days like May Day holiday, National Day holiday or Valentine's Day. Yet the inefficient ticket circulation system contributes the most to the failure.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? love and bloodletting","completion":"Based on the exceedingly brief review provided, \\"love and bloodletting,\\" it is extremely difficult to determine definitively whether it expresses a positive or negative opinion of the movie. The review is quite neutral as it does not provide any direct evaluation or descriptors regarding the movie. Therefore, a long and detailed explanation is not possible here. However, it's crucial to understand that the interpretation depends significantly on the tone and context. If you look at it from one perspective, it seems as if the reviewer is describing the central themes or elements of the movie, namely \\"love\\" and \\"bloodletting.\\" \\"Love\\" is generally viewed as a positive aspect, while \\"bloodletting\\" can have a more negative connotation as it usually refers to violence or suffering. However, the use of this term isn't inherently negative. Many highly-praised films have elements of violence or conflict within them. For lovers of intense thrillers, action, or dramatic movies, such a review could actually be viewed positively as it indicates the presence of action, suspense, or intense emotional dynamics. On the other hand, if the reviewer was trying to express a particular sentiment about the movie as a whole, we lack information to say for sure what their stance is. They might be appreciating the film's exploration of juxtaposed themes - love and violence. Or, they might be critiquing it for the same. They could feel like the two elements did not blend well, or it might be too violent or not suitable for sensitive viewers, thus expressing a negative opinion. In summary, without more information such as specific details or an explanation, it is challenging to determine if this review is positive or negative. This statement, \\"love and bloodletting,\\" stands more as a description of the movie's content, which might attract or disinterest potential viewers based on their personal preferences. Hence, some people might interpret it positively, while others might see it negatively. It immensely depends on the viewer's perspective, taste in genre and content, and assumptions about the reviewer's intent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It says 80% of parents are concerned about kids meeting bad people online. That's because young people who largely have grown up with the Net think of it as a social outlet , say the researchers.

Aliens Shill For Chevy Volt In Super Bowl Ad Apparently earthlings aren’t the only ones still trying to get a handle on the Chevy Volt. Ahead of the big game, Chevrolet has released its upcoming Super Bowl advertisement for the plug-in hybrid on the internet, in which a man in a bathrobe goes out to his garage in the middle of the night and discovers a group of little cone-headed green and purple creatures inspecting a Volt. Exasperated by what seems to be a recurring event, he tells them, “I’ll say it again, it’s electric, but when I need to go farther it uses gas. Please tell me you understand.” Just to drive the point home, the voice of Tim Allen closes the ad saying, “advanced technology, really advanced.” The Volt is what Chevy refers to as an extended-range electric car. After its battery pack has been depleted a small internal combustion engine turns on to generate electricity to power the car. Several other automakers, including Ford and Toyota, are introducing cars this year that work in a similar way.

A: Choose from: i. emergence ii. intelligent design iii. generation iv. evolution Answer:","completion":"Fossils provide a window into the past. They are evidence for evolution. Fossils are the remains or impressions of prehistoric organisms preserved in petrified form or as a mold or cast in rock. These preserved remnants of ancient creatures give us insight into how life has developed on Earth over millions of years. Paleontologists, scientists who study fossils, can analyze these fossils to unravel the history of life on our planet, providing crucial information about the course of evolution. In answer to your question, fossils serve as evidence for: Answer: iv. Evolution Evolution is a process that involves the gradual change in the characteristics of a species over several generations, eventually leading to the diversification and development of new species. It is driven by the mechanisms of natural selection and genetic drift, where organisms with favorable traits or random genetic changes have better chances of survival and reproduction. As a result, these advantageous traits are passed down through successive generations, leading to the emergence of distinct species over time. Fossils provide concrete evidence for evolution in various ways: 1. Comparative Anatomy: Fossils reveal the similarities and differences in the anatomical structures of various organisms. These comparisons allow scientists to determine the relationships between different species and how they evolved from a common ancestor. 2. Transitional Forms: Fossils showcase transitional forms of organisms, which are crucial in understanding the progression of evolution. For example, the fossil of Archaeopteryx, a creature with both bird-like and reptilian features, demonstrates a transitional form between dinosaurs and modern birds. 3. Age and Distribution of Fossils: Fossils help in understanding when and where various organisms lived. It aids in constructing a comprehensive picture of the timeline of life on Earth. The dating of fossils can be achieved through radiometric dating techniques or by analyzing the geological layers containing the fossils. 4. Extinct Species: Fossils provide evidence for species that no longer exist on Earth, allowing insight into the diversity of life and ecological factors that contributed to the evolution and eventual extinction of these species. In conclusion, the variety of fossil evidence plays a vital role in enhancing our understanding of the long and complex process of evolution. Fossils demonstrate the incremental changes that occurred over millions of years, leading to the intricate web of biodiversity that we see today. They serve as crucial evidence for the theory of evolution, as they unveil the history of life on Earth and the changes experienced by organisms to adapt and thrive in their environments."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Video of The World’s Best Universities: Times Higher Education 2014-2015 results Browse the full rankings portfolio ||||| Oxford 4th, Cambridge 6th in university rankings LONDON — US and British institutions once again dominate an annual worldwide league table of universities published Thursday, but there is a fresh name at the top, unseating long-time leader Harvard. California Institute of Technology (Caltech) knocked the famous Massachusetts institution from the summit of the Times Higher Education (THE) league table for the first time in eight years, with US schools claiming 75 of the top 200 places. There was also change at the top in Britain where Oxford sneaked into fourth spot, overtaking Cambridge, which slipped to sixth. Britain boasts 32 establishments in the top 200, but an overhaul in the way in which the country's universities are funded has raised concerns over its continuing success. Asia's increasing presence in the annual table has stalled, with 30th placed University of Tokyo leading the continent's representation. China's top two universities hold on to their elite status, but no more institutions from the developing powerhouse managed to break into the top 200. THE attributed Caltech's success to \\"consistent results across the indicators and a steep rise in research funding\\". Caltech specialises in science and engineering and has its main campus a short distance north of Los Angeles. 365-year-old Harvard, which loses the top spot for the first time since THE began publishing a global university ranking, shares second place with Californian university Stanford. The turnabout between Cambridge and Oxford can be put down to a greater emphasis being put on the arts, humanities and social sciences in this year's study, THE explained. David Willetts, British minister of state for universities and science, said: \\"Relative to our size and smaller per capita resources, we have -- according to some measures -- the world's best-performing higher education sector.\\" The top 10 places are mainly occupied by US universities, including Princeton, Berkeley and Chicago. Only two universities from outside the United States and Britain -- Switzerland's Federal Institute of Technology in 15th spot and Canada's University of Toronto in 19th -- make it into the top 20. Israel is the only Middle Eastern country to break the top 200 with Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 121st place and Tel Aviv University in 166th place. For the first time, the study also ranked countries according to their relative GDP with Hong Kong and the Netherlands coming out on top. Ann Mroz, editor of Times Higher Education, said: \\"New powers are emerging, traditional hierarchies are facing challenges, the global competition for talent is heating up and these league tables help us understand this rapidly changing situation.\\" The data ranked universities on 13 performance indicators within the fields of research, teaching, knowledge transfer and international activity.

On Thursday, the White House said President Barack Obama would not meet the prime minister when he comes to the U.S. to address a joint session of Congress. The decision comes just one day after GOP lawmakers blindsided Obama, announcing to the public that Netanyahu would visit Washington on March 3 -- just two weeks before the Israeli election -- rather than the original February date, without giving the Obama administration so much as a heads up. Prime Minister: President Barack Obama (right) is withholding an invitation for Oval Office talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) during his March 3 visit to Washington because the administration does not want to appear to be taking sides with the Israeli election falling so close to the visit Warnings: OPTIONS: - Barack Obama has vigorously warned that threatening Iran with new economic sanctions could upend the negotiations and has vowed to veto any measure that lands on his desk - Benjamin Netanyahu has vigorously warned that threatening Iran with new economic sanctions could upend the negotiations and has vowed to veto any measure that lands on his desk - Congress has vigorously warned that threatening Iran with new economic sanctions could upend the negotiations and has vowed to veto any measure that lands on his desk - GOP has vigorously warned that threatening Iran with new economic sanctions could upend the negotiations and has vowed to veto any measure that lands on his desk - Israeli has vigorously warned that threatening Iran with new economic sanctions could upend the negotiations and has vowed to veto any measure that lands on his desk - Netanyahu has vigorously warned that threatening Iran with new economic sanctions could upend the negotiations and has vowed to veto any measure that lands on his desk - Obama has vigorously warned that threatening Iran with new economic sanctions could upend the negotiations and has vowed to veto any measure that lands on his desk - Oval Office has vigorously warned that threatening Iran with new economic sanctions could upend the negotiations and has vowed to veto any measure that lands on his desk - Republicans has vigorously warned that threatening Iran with new economic sanctions could upend the negotiations and has vowed to veto any measure that lands on his desk - U.S. has vigorously warned that threatening Iran with new economic sanctions could upend the negotiations and has vowed to veto any measure that lands on his desk - Washington has vigorously warned that threatening Iran with new economic sanctions could upend the negotiations and has vowed to veto any measure that lands on his desk - White House has vigorously warned that threatening Iran with new economic sanctions could upend the negotiations and has vowed to veto any measure that lands on his desk","completion":"- Barack Obama has vigorously warned that threatening Iran with new economic sanctions could upend the negotiations and has vowed to veto any measure that lands on his desk.

The DJ drew 9.01m listeners a week between April and June 2017, down from 9.47m over the same period in 2016, according to figures by audience research body Rajar. He was paid between £2.2m and £2.25m during that same year. The figures show Evans lost 370,000 listeners between the first and second quarter of this year - before his salary was published. It's better news for Nick Grimshaw - whose breakfast show on Radio 1 saw its weekly audience rise by 350,000 listeners on the previous quarter to reach 5.5m. It is also an increase on the 5.43m listeners who tuned in during the same period in 2016. Radio 1 as a whole saw its audience jump by nearly half a million between April 3 and July 25 - with 9.6m listeners compared with 9.1m in the first three months of 2017. The figures show Radio 4's Today programme has increased its weekly listeners to reach a record high - with 7.66m tuning in during the second quarter, compared to 7.13m three months earlier. Radio 4 itself also reached its biggest audience since records began in 1999 - with 11.55m listeners every week. Bob Shennan, director of BBC radio and music, said Radio 4 was \\"as vital as ever as it approaches its 50th anniversary\\". The BBC's figures overall were \\"fantastic news for radio, illustrating its enduring appeal in a crowded digital marketplace\\", he added. LBC's audience also increased, with 2m listeners a week between April and June 2017, compared to 1.7m over the same period in 2016. The station's parent company Global said it was an all-time high for LBC, with presenters Nick Ferrari and James O'Brien both reaching record audiences. Radio X, which was rebranded from XFM in 2015, also reached its best weekly audience yet with 1.4 million. Alan Brazil's breakfast show on talkSPORT lost about 400,000 listeners, with 1.6m a week in the 2016 period down to 1.2m in 2017. The figures show the morning slot on Kiss saw its weekly audience drop slightly to 2m in the last quarter from 2.1m. But the programme, hosted by Rickie, Melvin and Charlie, remains the most popular commercial breakfast show in the UK. Classic FM's symphonies struck the right chords as its weekly audience increased by over 200,000. And Heart 80s - a new station that launched in March and plays exclusively eighties music - attracted 850,000 listeners in its first Rajar quarter.

Does the sentence \\"The Sultan was the highest position in the system.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What was the highest ranked person in the Ottoman Empire until the 19th century?\\"","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"The Sultan was the highest position in the system\\" does provide a valid answer to the question \\"What was the highest ranked person in the Ottoman Empire until the 19th century?\\" However, there is much more contextual and historical detail that can be provided to create a more comprehensive understanding. The Ottoman Empire, one of the most powerful states in the world during the 15th and 16th centuries, was a complex system of sociopolitical organization. The topmost rank in this hierarchy, with absolute political, legal, and religious authority, was indeed the Sultan. The term Sultan derives from the Arabic word, meaning \\"authority\\" or \\"power\\". The Sultan was not only the supreme ruler but also the upholder of the Shari'ah, or Islamic law, and was therefore considered the protector of Islam as well as the empire's geographical dominions. This religious aspect of the Sultan's rule intertwined seamlessly with the political and military characteristics of the role. The Sultan was regarded as representing God on Earth by the Ottoman subjects and indeed was often viewed as a quasi-divine figure. He had the final say in all state and government matters, which ranged from appointing or dismissing high officials, creating and implementing laws, to declaring war or peace with other states. Sultan Mehmed II, also known as Mehmed the Conqueror, even articulated a political theory of sovereignty, known as the \\"Circle of Justice,\\" foregrounding the sultan as the fulcrum of a balanced and orderly state. According to this theory, the sultan secured justice for all of his subjects, regardless of their social or economic status. Further, the Sultan also reigned over a vast bureaucracy and military structure. The various roles within this hierarchy, such as the Grand Vizier (the high executive officer), the Beylerbeyis (governors), and the Janissaries (the elite infantry units), all answered to the Sultan. The Ottoman Empire saw tremendous growth and expansion under the leadership of these powerful Sultans right from its inception in 1299. However, even within the Sultans, there was variance in rule and control over the empire. The absolute power of the Sultan began to change by the 17th century as the Empire reached its peak and then gradually started declining. Over time, the Sultan's power was checked and counterbalanced by military corps like the Janissaries and also the ulema, religious scholars who gained significant political influence. So, in conclusion, saying that \\"The Sultan was the highest position in the system\\" in the context of the Ottoman Empire until the 19th century is accurate, albeit a simplified explanation of a complex, sophisticated system of imperial authority, administration, and governance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Lawrence Harvey Brown (born September 14, 1940) is an American basketball coach, who was most recently head men's basketball coach at Southern Methodist University. He is the only coach in basketball history to win both an NCAA national championship (Kansas Jayhawks, 1988) and an NBA title (Detroit Pistons, 2004). He has a 1,275-965 lifetime professional coaching record in the American Basketball Association (ABA) and the National Basketball Association (NBA) and is the only coach in NBA history to lead eight different teams to the playoffs. He also won an ABA championship as a player with the Oakland Oaks in the 1968-69 season, and an Olympic Gold Medal in 1964. On April 17, 2012, ESPN reported that Brown was to be named the new head coach of the SMU Mustangs, replacing Matt Doherty, who had been fired from SMU earlier in March. Tim Jankovich, the head coach of Illinois State, was hired as the coach-in-waiting. After a rebuilding season in 2012-2013 (15-17), Brown brought SMU into the national conversation the following year and led the team to a 27-10 record in the 2013-2014 season. SMU swept the eventual National Champion University of Connecticut Huskies in conference play and was the most notable team not to be let into the NCAA Tournament field of sixty-eight. SMU went on to be the overall number one seed in the National Invitational Tournament, losing in the final game of the tournament to Minnesota. For the 2014-2015 season Brown secured the services of the top ranked point guard in the nation, Emmanuel Mudiay, over the likes of the Kentucky and Kansas. Before ever playing a game for the Mustangs, Mudiay elected to play professionally in China and forgo his amateur status. On September 29, 2015, Brown was suspended by the NCAA for 30% of the Mustangs' games in the upcoming 2015-2016 season, and the team was banned from 2016 post-season play, placed on probation for 3 years, and lost 9 scholarships over a 3-year period, due to a lack of head coach control. The NCAA found that Brown failed to report violations when a former administrative assistant committed academic fraud on behalf of a student-athlete and he initially lied to enforcement staff about his knowledge of the potential violations. Brown was the faculty advisor for the SMU student spirit group that supports campus athletics programs named \\"The MOB\\", as Brown is known as \\"The Godfather\\".

Coinciding with the financial crisis of 200708, prices began to fall. In 2013, Raj Badiani, an economist at IHS Global Insight in London, estimated that the value of residential real estate has dropped more than 30 percent since 2007 and that house prices would fall at least 50 percent from the peak by 2015. According to Alcidi and Gros note, If construction were to continue at the still relatively high rate of today, the process of absorption of the bubble would take more than 30 years. - Melilla ( \\"Maliliyyah\\") is a Spanish autonomous city located on the north coast of Africa, sharing a border with Morocco with an area of .

Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given a list of integers. A list contains numbers separated by a comma. You need to round every integer to the closest power of 2. A power of 2 is a number in the form '2^n', it is a number that is the result of multiplying by 2 n times. The following are all powers of 2, '2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096'. If an integer is exactly in equally far from two different powers of 2 then you should output the larger power of 2. The output should be a list of integers that is the result of rounding each integer int the input list to the closest power of 2. The output should include a '[' to denote the start of the output list and ']' to denote the end of the output list. Q: [103, 400, 1146, 2632, 7, 72, 3, 66, 1384, 4958, 407, 20, 60] A:","completion":"[128, 512, 1024, 2048, 8, 64, 4, 64, 1024, 4096, 512, 16, 64] To find the answer, I followed these steps: 1. Read the given list of integers, which are [103, 400, 1146, 2632, 7, 72, 3, 66, 1384, 4958, 407, 20, 60]. 2. Based on the definition of rounding to the closest power of 2, find the nearest power of 2 to each integer by calculating the difference between the integer and the powers of 2. 3. If the integer is exactly halfway between two powers of 2, choose the larger power of 2. 4. Replace each integer in the list with its rounded value. Here's a breakdown of each number: - 103 is closer to 128 than to 64, so it rounds to 128. - 400 is closer to 512 than to 256, so it rounds to 512. - 1146 is closer to 1024 than to 2048, so it rounds to 1024. - 2632 is closer to 2048 than to 4096, so it rounds to 2048. - 7 is closer to 8 than to 4, so it rounds to 8. - 72 is closer to 64 than to 128, so it rounds to 64. - 3 is closer to 4 than to 2, so it rounds to 4. - 66 is closer to 64 than to 128, so it rounds to 64. - 1384 is closer to 1024 than to 2048, so it rounds to 1024. - 4958 is closer to 4096 than to 8192, so it rounds to 4096. - 407 is closer to 512 than to 256, so it rounds to 512. - 20 is closer to 16 than to 32, so it rounds to 16. - 60 is closer to 64 than to 32, so it rounds to 64. Finally, the output list is created by placing brackets around the rounded values: [128, 512, 1024, 2048, 8, 64, 4, 64, 1024, 4096, 512, 16, 64]."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As a newly appointed chief constable, Dave Jones could be forgiven for not wishing to chase suspected criminals around town centre streets in the early hours of the morning. But within hours of working his first shift as the top policeman in north Yorkshire, that is exactly what he did. The new chief constable of North Yorkshire Police was visiting Catterick Garrison Police Station as part of a tour of the county, when the force received reports of a man being assaulted. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Mucking in: The new chief constable of North Yorkshire Police, Dave Jones, was just hours into his first shift when he ended up joining his officers in chasing a suspected criminal through a town centre streets. On foot: The man, suspected of carrying out an assault, is pictured running through Richmond town centre with Mr Jones and his officers chasing behind. Foolish: The suspect thinks he is being clever by hiding in this alleyway, but he did not realise his every move was being monitored by CCTV operators. Mr Jones decided to 'muck in' and join his officers in Richmond town centre at about 12.50am on Monday. As this CCTV footage shows, one of the suspects ran off, with police officers - including Mr Jones - following swiftly behind. Unfortunately for the suspect, his every move was being monitored by CCTV operators who directed the police to his location. During a search the suspect was spotted down an alleyway climbing over a wall. Found: Mr Jones and his officers are easily directed to the alleyway where they begin the hunt for the man. Held: Just hours into his first shift as the chief constable, Mr Jones helps to detain the man and bring about a successful arrest. Happy: Chief Constable Dave Jones, pictured centre, said it was 'great to get involved' and be with his officers on the front line. Mr Jones went after him with another officer who arrested him on suspicion of affray. Mr Jones said: 'It was important for me to get out and see the officers on the ground and good to be able to muck in with them so soon into my first shift. 'It was great to get involved, and good to be out there with them on the front line. 'Fortunately, the rest of my first shift was a bit quieter and I was able to get around the rest of the county and meet some of the officers and our partners who help to make North Yorkshire one of the safest places in the country.' Three men in their 20s were arrested by officers and have been released on police bail pending enquiries. The victim of the alleged assault suffered minor injuries and did not require hospital treatment.

The hip-hop group hopes to revive a lawsuit alleging its fans suffered harassment and discrimination after being painted as a criminal gang in a government report. On Tuesday, the Insane Clown Posse and four of their \\"Juggalo\\" fans asked the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to review a judge's ruling late last month rejecting the hip-hop group's lawsuit against the Justice Department. LIST The Hollywood Reporter Reveals Hollywood's 100 Favorite Films The dispute emanated from a 2011 gang threat assessment issued by the National Gang Intelligence Center. The report was intended to examine emerging trends and threats posed by criminal gangs throughout the United States. In a section on \\"non-traditional gangs,\\" the authors flagged some Juggalos as \\"forming more organized subsets and engaging in more gang-like criminal activity, such as felony assaults, thefts, robberies, and drug sales.\\" The report eventually led to a lawsuit from Insane Clown Posse members Joseph Bruce (aka Violent J) and Joseph Utsler (aka Shaggy 2 Dope), along with four fans who reported various forms of harassment. One Juggalo, for instance, was stopped by a state trooper and asked whether he had any axes, hatchets or other chopping instruments in his truck. Another visited a U.S. Army recruiting station and was told that he would have to remove or permanently cover his tattoos in order for his application to be considered. The ACLU represented the band and its fans and alleged in Michigan federal court that the DOJ and FBI had committed constitutional violations under the Administrative Procedure Act. Specifically, the plaintiffs identified the First Amendment's freedom of association and freedom of expression as well as the Fifth Amendment's right of due process. PHOTOS Penny Lane's Coat, 'Terminator' Skull: Iconic Movie Props From the Top 100 Films But in a ruling dismissing the lawsuit on June 30, U.S. District Judge Robert Cleland identified the failings of the claims. \\"Five of the six Plaintiffs complain of independent actions by third-parties who are not currently before the court,\\" wrote the judge. Judge Cleland added that there wasn't any indication that either the FBI or DOJ directed state police to detain and question the plaintiff-juggalos nor participated in the U.S. Army's treatment of the applicant-juggalo. And as for Bruce and Utsler, who attempted to allege injury on the basis that a Royal Oak, Mich., concert was canceled at the local police department's request, they too failed for lack of any allegation that federal authorities had directed the cancelation. \\"The court’s review of the NGTA illustrates the voluntary nature of this conduct by independent actors,\\" concluded the judge. Here's the judge's full opinion, which will now have juggalos in attendance at a federal appeals court at a to-be-determined date. Twitter: @eriqgardner ||||| DETROIT, MI -- U.S. District Judge Robert Cleland last week dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Insane Clown Posse against the FBI, and the Detroit music duo on Tuesday filed notice of intention to appeal the decision. ICP, known for explicit lyrics, face paint and a diehard following that created the \\"Juggalo\\" subculture, claimed a 2011 FBI report caused their fans to be detained, questioned and harassed by law enforcement agencies across the country. (View the complaint here.) The American Civil Liberties Union filed the lawsuit in January on behalf of performers Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope -- whose real names are Joseph Bruce and Joseph Utsler -- along with four ICP fans. After hearing arguments from either sides in June, Cleland last week granted the government's motion to dismiss the case. (View the full ruling here.) The lawsuit claimed violations of \\"First Amendment rights to express their identity as Juggalos.\\" Plaintiff Scott Gandy was forced to turn his Juggalo tattoo into a fish in order to apply to join the Army, \\"compelled to say 'I like fish,' instead of 'I like ICP,'\\" his lawyer Saura Sahu said in a June hearing, The FBI's 2011 National Gang Threat Assessment report described Juggalos as \\"a loosely-organized hybrid gang\\" that was \\"rapidly expanding into many US communities.\\" (View that full document here.) U.S. Justice Department attorney Amy Powell argued that the report did not compel or condone any action by any agency, and did not label all Juggalos as gang members. She argued that the police agencies who stopped, detained, searched or questioned Juggalos acted independently, and Cleland agreed. \\"Because any adjudication on the merits would involve speculation about the decisions of these independent actors, the court finds that Plaintiffs have not properly alleged constitutional standing to bring their claims before the court,\\" the judge ruled. He also noted that a new 2013 FBI report on emerging trends, published two months after the lawsuit was filed, does not mention Juggalos. \\"An injunction mandating the retraction of the 2011 NGTA, even if warranted, would not compel or enjoin any action by the various independent actors who allegedly caused Plaintiffs’ injuries, and who are not parties to this action,\\" Cleland wrote. \\"The court finds that it is 'merely speculative' to assert that Plaintiffs’ alleged injury would be redressed by a decision in their favor.\\" The case will move on to the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals. ||||| DETROIT (AP) — The federal government can't be blamed for any fallout from a 2011 FBI report that put a gang tag on fans of the music group Insane Clown Posse, a judge said. U.S. District Judge Robert Cleland dismissed a lawsuit by the rap-metal duo and fans, known as Juggalos, who said they've been targeted by police because they have jewelry or tattoos with the group's symbol, a man running with a hatchet. Cleland said the U.S. Justice Department is not responsible for how authorities use a national report on gangs. The report \\"does not recommend any particular course of action for local law enforcement to follow, and instead operates as a descriptive, rather than prescriptive, assessment of nationwide gang trends,\\" Cleland said in a 14-page opinion last week. The American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan filed a lawsuit on behalf of Juggalos and the group, claiming their constitutional rights to free speech and due process were violated by the report. The FBI report labeled the Juggalos as a \\"loosely organized hybrid gang.\\" It said those who identify as Juggalos have committed assaults and vandalism, and a \\"small number\\" of them have engaged in more serious crimes. There is no mention of them in the latest report. The ACLU said it will appeal Cleland's decision. \\"This is not the end. We'll keep fighting to clear the Juggalo family name,\\" Insane Clown Posse member Joseph Bruce, known as Violent J, said in a statement released by the ACLU. \\"While it is easy to fear what one does not understand, discrimination and bigotry against any group of people is just plain wrong and un-American,\\" he said. ___ Follow Ed White at http://twitter.com/edwhiteap ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Insane Clown Posse, a hip-hop group, and their fans, known as \\"Juggalos\\", have asked the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to review a judge's ruling that dismissed their lawsuit against the Justice Department.

Aspen, cottonwood, and poplar trees belong to the genus Populus, which is part of the Salicaceae family. These deciduous trees are native to various regions across the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and Asia. There are around 25 to 35 species within the Populus genus, which are generally divided into six sections: Populus (aspen), Aigeiros (black poplars), Tacamahaca (balsam poplars), Turanga (Euphratic poplars), Leucoides (white poplars), and Abaso (Mexican poplars). The discussion about walnut and cherry trees is unrelated to the Populus genus and its species. Walnut trees belong to the Juglans genus under the Juglandaceae family, and cherry trees are part of the Prunus genus under the Rosaceae family. While some species within these genera may exhibit intermediate features between different classifications, they are not the focus of the original question. To summarize, aspen, cottonwood, and poplar trees belong to the genus Populus, which comprises around 25 to 35 species. An example of an aspen tree species is Populus tremuloides (Quaking Aspen); a cottonwood tree species is Populus deltoides (Eastern Cottonwood); and a poplar tree species is Populus nigra (Black Poplar).

Recently every time I'm at the gym, there is always the same dude present. This dude is always coming up to me to ask how many sets I got left. I tell him a number, he gives me a blank stare, leaving me no choice but to ask him, if he wants to work in. I don't have a problem with people working in, I get it, it's full and not wanting to wait. But this dude doesn't follow the unspoken gym etiquettes. Like he takes really long pauses between sets, like 3 to 4 min even when warming up and me asking him, if he could speed up. Since I usually workout 1-2 hours before closing time, means that I have to speed up my training to leave on time. He is also weak (nothing wrong with that), so I have to rearrange the weights, which he ask me to help. But when it's my set, he pisses off without helping putting them back on. So yesterday, when he asked me again, how many sets I've left, I just told him that without asking him, if he wants to work in. So he asked me, if he could work in, to which I responded with \\"no, but I'm going to speed up\\". Instead how just saying okay, he started to argue with me. To sum up what he said: \\" why not?

I responded with a quote from a YouTuber:\\" my body does more work while resting than yours while working out\\". He just said fuck you and went away.

The New Jersey teen who sneaked past a sleeping security guard to reach the roof of the World Trade Center building made his first court appearance Wednesday. Justin Casquejo, 16, was initially charged with trespassing, but now faces actual jail time since the judge slapped him with another charge of BASE jumping - a class A misdemeanor. If convicted, the Weehawken, New Jersey native could end up behind bars for up to a year. Scroll down for video. Head down: 16-year-old Justin Casquejo made his first court appearance Wednesday as he faces trespassing charges for sneaking to the top of the World Trade Center last month. Serious crimes: Casquejo was hit with an additional charge of base jumping today, which could land him in jail for up to a year if convicted. Sly: Casquejo, of Weehawken, New Jersey, was. able to make it to the top of 1 WTC by slipping through a square-foot. hole in a fence surrounding the site. The judge also ordered Casquejo be assessed in a program for youth offenders. He is due back in court on April 20. Casquejo and his lawyer declined to comment outside the court house. The daredevil teen successfully made it to the top of 1 WTC on March 16, by slipping through a square-opening in the fence surrounding the site around 4am. Dressed as a construction worker, Casquejo eluded security and was able to take an elevator to the 88th floor. Daredevil: Casquejo sneaked into the WTC site and spent almost two hours on the roof of the nearly completed Freedom Tower before he was arrested by Port Authority police trying to leave. He is pictured at right on top of a construction crane in nearby Hoboken. From there he took the stairs all the way to the 104th floor and walked right past a sleeping security guard to access the roof. He spent about two hours on the roof before coming down and getting caught by Port Authority Police. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the site, is reevaluating their security measures. Since Casquejo's arrest last month, six others have also been arrested for sneaking in or attempting to sneak into the World Trade Center unauthorized. Thrillseeker: Casquejo, pictured on a construction crane in Hoboken, appears to love sneaking into tall buildings under construction. Two CNN journalists were arrested late last month trying three times to sneak past security and into the building in broad daylight. 'If a 16-year-old can get on the site, we should be able to get in as well,' one of them allegedly told the officer. Four other men were charged last month as well, for organizing a base jump off the building in September. 'We were a little bit shocked that they spent that much time and energy continuing to pursue something that they knew was not a terroristic act,' one of the jumpers, Andrew Rossing, told Good Morning America. 'Our intent was never for this to go public. We never posted the video footage. People didnâ€™t know about it. We kept things quiet. As far as we were concerned, no one ever needed to know,' he added. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said that 'both City Hall and 1 Police Plaza are concerned about' the recent break-ins.","completion":"New Jersey teen sneaks past sleeping security guard at World Trade Center: - 16-year-old Justin Casquejo makes first court appearance, facing trespassing and BASE jumping charges - Casquejo slipped through a hole in the fence surrounding the WTC site and reached the roof - If convicted, he could face up to a year in jail - Casquejo caught by Port Authority Police after 2-hour rooftop venture - 6 other individuals have been arrested for unauthorized access to WTC site since Casquejo's incident - New York City Mayor and 1 Police Plaza express concern over recent security breaches"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jessica and Milly are two politicians currently in the running for governor of their city. They are in the process of having a debate that is being broadcast on local television. Mike, an avid environmentalist who is trying to decide who to vote for, has been watching the entire debate. He feels the most important issue when voting is saving the planet and the animals on it. The question that was just asked by the moderator was \\"what do you think should be done with the Earth's atmosphere?\\" Jessica responds that she thinks we should emit more anthropogenic gases. She believes that will lead to the best outcome for the world. Milly states that we need to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will the number of animals increase or decrease under Milly's plan? Hint: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The number of animals is likely to increase under Milly's plan. By decreasing the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, Milly's plan aims to address the issue of global warming and climate change, which is responsible for the extinction of natural habitats and reduction in wildlife population. By mitigating these adverse effects, Milly's plan may lead to an increase in the number of animals on the planet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

How to Score College Scholarships - Even if You're Not a 'Genius' The first day Kristina Ellis started high school, her mother — a widow and a hairdresser — told her daughter she didn't have the resources to pay for college. \\"My mom said, 'I love you. I believe in you. But you are going to be on your own after graduation,'\\" Ellis told NBC News. \\"You have four years to start planning how you will stand out.\\" Ellis took her mom's words to heart, and by senior year at her Indiana high school, she had racked up 500,000 in scholarships, including ones from the Gates Foundation and Coca Cola. With many colleges charging more than 50,000 a year just for tuition and room and board, families are feeling the crunch. But Ellis, now 28 and author of \\"Confessions of a Scholarship Winner,\\" says the money is there — you just have to look for it. Special section: Get more tips and advice about college at College Game Plan \\"I never want to mislead students into thinking it's a totally easy process,\\" she said. \\"It takes hard work to get a stand-out application. But if you are motivated, you can be really successful.\\" She says she was no \\"genius,\\" but kept her grades up, embraced leadership roles and logged 1,000 hours of volunteer service. Through a combination of local and national scholarships plus financial aid, Ellis graduated debt-free from Vanderbilt University, as well as from Belmont University in Nashville, where she got her master's degree from. Kristina Ellis graduated from Vanderbilt University in 2010 debt-free after collecting 500,000 in scholarships. Mark Ellis Experts say national scholarships are fiercely competitive. And while local scholarships can help pay for books and incidentals, the big money comes from the institutions themselves. But, says Edward de Villafranca, an educational consultant for New Jersey-based Edvice Princeton, \\"Stay away from the Ivies,\\" which provide generous financial aid, but offer no merit scholarships. The good news: Many stellar schools outside the Ivy League are courting deserving students who may not qualify for financial aid with merit scholarships. Related: Pay Attention to Changes in Federal Student Financial Aid Program \\"Say you have good grades, you test well and are a good citizen, but not a recruited athlete or actress — a lot of schools have incentives for discounting your education,\\" de Villafranca told NBC News. Such was the case with Cathy Forinash of Seattle, whose three children received a total of 75,000 in merit scholarships from their colleges. \\"That's where the best money is,\\" she told NBC News. \\"We don't qualify for financial aid, but we made it a priority to send our kids to college,\\" said Forinash, 50, who works in sales for a tech company.

Now, she is in a fully funded master's program from the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center at Oregon State University. And Simon Forinash, 18, has been promised 20,000 to study math at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington, and is hoping for even more if he gets into the honors program. Forinash said her children worked hard in high school, getting good grades. But she worked hard, too, to find the scholarships. \\"I educated myself and asked a lot of questions,\\" she said. \\"It's all we did from August through applications in December. I was the project manager.\\" College adviser de Villafranca tells students and parents to start the process early. Talk first with your guidance counselors, but don't assume they know about every program. \\"Reach out to your local library and your town hall,\\" he said. \\"Stay away from an organization that says, 'Hey, for 50, I'll find you a scholarship.' You can Google that yourself.\\" When you have your list, ask each college about what scholarships they offer. With several acceptance letters in hand, you can sometimes negotiate. \\"With some diplomacy, you can \\"move the needle a little bit,\\" de Villafranca said. \\"It's worth having the conversation.\\" What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article outlines strategies for securing college scholarships, despite not being a so-called \\"genius.\\" It shares the success story of Kristina Ellis, who earned 500,000 in scholarships by maintaining good grades, assuming leadership roles, and volunteering.

A straightforward question for many of us, but in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte there's seldom a simple answer where garbage is concerned. That's because the catadores (trash collectors) of the ASMARE cooperative are adept at transforming any old disused material into furniture, jewelry or even works of art. \\"I have two jobs,\\" explained 39-year-old collector Edimar Ferreira. \\"I go and collect the trash and then I transform it into art. I make small sofas, wooden benches, tables, and other plastic adornments.\\" \\"We have a phrase (at ASMARE): 'o seu lixo e o meu luxo,' (roughly translated as 'your trash is our luxury,')\\" he cheerily added. See also: Brazil's middle class boom. Catadores like Ferreira are a familiar sight in towns and cities across Brazil -- a motley collection of individuals who sift through mountains of street trash or landfill to locate paper, cans, bottles, metals and other types of recyclable materials. A 2010 estimate by the Business Commitment for Recycling (CEMPRE) association stated that there were roughly one million catadores in Brazil, although only a small number work officially for cooperatives and organizations like ASMARE. Many are the formerly homeless, ex-convicts or individuals who have stumbled upon hard times, selling what they find to recycling companies. Arts and crafts. In recent years, however, the cash return for many of Belo Horizonte's catadores has become too inconsistent to ensure a stable income. The solution that ASMARE -- a professional group representing nearly 200 pickers-- came up with was to get creative with the one material they have plenty of -- trash. Recruiting the help of local artists and volunteers, ASMARE has run an arts program for the best part of a decade where workers are taught how to transform the recyclable items they find during their daily collections. \\"The art center started with the purpose of us being able to make our own carts, and then for the catadores' children to learn how to make crafts and other art pieces with the material collected,\\" said Dona Geralda, founder and president of ASMARE. \\"The main benefits are the generation of employment and income for the catadores and their children. We (have now) started to implement the culture of 'garbage that is not garbage,'\\" added the 63-year-old, who has herself been a catadore since she was eight. See also: Brazil's thriving African culture. All items created at ASMARE are sold in a shop near the organization's headquarters, with profits shared equally amongst the catadores. Combining art sales and the money accumulated from selling on recycled materials, an ASMARE worker's monthly income now averages out a respectable 1,700 Brazilian Reais (about 800). Branching out. Yet although it was one of the first to introduce creative programs (as well as claiming to be the first catadore cooperative in Brazil), the Belo Horizonte outfit is far from alone in its aesthetic endeavors. Other organizations and artists have adopted similarly imaginative tactics in undertaking creative projects with catadores in recent years. In Sao Paolo, a street project called \\"Pimp My Carroca\\" has been adding colorful graffiti to the wooden carts used by many catadores since last summer. The 2010 Oscar-nominated film Wasteland documented the catadores of Rio de Janeiro's now closed Jardin Gramacho landfill as they became subjects of works by the Brazilian artist Vik Muniz. The artworks eventually sold for tens of thousands of dollars each. See also: Does Brazil deserve its B for BRIC. According to Mauricio Soares, an artist who heads the ASMARE creative program, helping catadores to produce art is about much more than just the obvious financial or creative benefits. \\"In Brazil the catadore is often discriminated against because of their origin,\\" Soares said. \\"Therefore, linking art to recycling allows them to go to places that they have never been before and they end up having better acceptance because their creative work gives them a good visibility,\\" he added. Recycling attitudes. Soares also sees the potential to promote the possibilities of recycling across the country. \\"Art through recycling aims to arouse people's consciousness to think about what trash is or is not,\\" Soares said. \\"This new consciousness will help us to promote waste reduction. \\"When people see a recycled art piece, for instance, on a woman's neck they may begin to understand that it is not (just) trash,\\" he added. See also: Send us your favorite pictures of Brazil. This is something that Ferreira strongly agrees with. He points to what he has learned since he began the ASMARE program two years ago as an example of how attitudes to trash can change. \\"This experience has made me look at recycling in a different way,\\" he said. \\"There are materials that I used to throw away that now I keep, because I can already envision making some nice piece with it later. I don't see the material only as trash anymore.\\" Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"In Belo Horizonte, Brazil, the catadores (trash collectors) of the ASMARE cooperative are known for turning trash into furniture, jewelry, and art pieces.

Jedd has recently decreased the amount of fertilizer he uses because his products aren't wanted as much by the people in his town. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who will be more likely to cause excess growth of algae in their respective lakes? Hint: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. Answer:","completion":"Given the information provided, it would be Jimbo who is more likely to cause excess growth of algae in his lake. This is because he has been using very high amounts of fertilizers on his farms. When it rains, runoff can carry these excess nutrients from the fertilizers into the water sources downstream, such as his lake. These nutrients can cause an explosion of growth in water plants and algae, a phenomenon known as algal bloom. When those plants and algae die, their decomposition can consume large amounts of oxygen, leading to \\"dead zones\\" where aquatic life cannot survive due to lack of oxygen.

Tellis shoots and kills the dealer before he can hurt the child, however a stray bullet hits the child's pregnant mother, causing her to miscarry. Eighteen months later, the Detroit Police Department asks Tellis to investigate the murder of an undercover narcotics officer called Michael Calvess. Tellis is initially reluctant, as there is little else he can do for a living however, he reads the investigation files and agrees to take the case, on two conditions. The first: he will get a desk job if he secures a conviction. The second: he is partnered with detective Henry Oak (Ray Liotta), whom Tellis is aware of through reading the files on Calvess' death. Tellis' reason for wanting Oak is his opinion that the only useful evidence in the investigation came from him. The department chief informs Tellis of Oak's reputation as a driven and effective policeman, but also warns him about his instability. Despite his reservations, Oak is assigned to the case. The two build a rapport during a violent investigation. Oak is a dedicated but haunted cop who uses brutal force on criminals, who believes the department want the case buried.

This substantial area dedicated to a national park signifies Aruba's commitment to protecting and preserving its natural environment, geological formations, and unique flora and fauna. Arikok National Park serves as a critical conservation area that encompasses diverse landscapes and habitats, such as rugged hills, dry riverbeds, and coastal shores. Its three primary geological formations – the Aruba lava formation, a quartz diorite formation, and a limestone formation extending inland from the coast – have played a significant role in shaping the island's human settlement patterns and the development of its ecological wonders. These geological formations provide habitats for many endemic and rare species of plants and animals, adding to the value of the protected area. Moreover, significant cultural, historical, and archaeological sites can be found within the park, emphasizing the interplay of human and natural forces that have shaped this distinct island over time.

I just couldn't get over the fact that he technically hit me! I started to consider things like, “Is he really sorry?” “Will he do it again?” “Should I leave him?” And gave myself reasons like “He didn't mean to!” “He's been apologizing all day!” “He was just playing!” “He meant to have fun, He's sorry!” Yet countered it with one simple statement, “Yeah that's what all abused women say.” In the end, I felt the question that should determine whether or not I should leave is: “If I stop talking to him tomorrow and can never see him or speak to him again, will I be okay with that?” and the answer was “No”, so obviously I shouldn't leave him. He is very well aware that I was considering leaving him, (I have a very strict 0 tolerance policy of abuse in my relationships, as I was abused terribly growing up,) and he still apologizes to this day, but he has certainly made it a point to never do that again. I definitely trust him, and he actually was being playful, but otherwise that has been the only “real” hitch we have come across.

Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Some futurologists have assumed that the vast upsurge of women in the workforce may mean a rejection of marriage. Many women, according to this hypothesis, would rather work than marry. The converse of this concern is that becoming a multi-paycheck household could encourage marriage. In the past, only the earnings and financial prospects of the man counted in the marriage decision. Now, however, the earning ability of a woman can make her more attractive as a marriage partner. Data show that economic downturns tend to put off marriage because the parties cannot afford to establish a family or are concerned about rainy days ahead. As the economy comes to life, the number of marriages also rises. The increase in divorce rates follows to the increase in women working outside the home. Yet, it may be wrong to jump to any simple cause-and-effect conclusions. The impact of a wife's work on divorce is no less cloudy than its impact on marriage decisions. The realization that she can be a good provider may increase the chances that a working wife will choose divorce over an unsatisfactory marriage. But the reverse is equally plausible . Tensions grounded in financial problems often play a key role in ending a marriage. By raising a family's standard of living, a working wife may strengthen her family's financial and emotional stability. Psychological factors also should be considered. For example, a wife blocked from a career outside the home may feel caged in the house. She may view her only choice as seeking a divorce. On the other hand, if she can find fulfillment through work outside the home, work and marriage can go together to create a stronger and more stable union. Also, a major part of women's inequality in marriage has been due to the fact that, in most cases, men have remained the main breadwinners. A working wife may rob a husband of being the master of the house. Depending upon how the couple reacts to these new conditions, it could create a stronger equal partnership or it could create new insecurities. Question: If women find fulfillment through work outside the home, _ . Options: A: they are more likely to dominate their marriage partners B: their husbands are expected to do more housework C: their marriage ties can be strengthened D: they tend to put their career before marriage Answer:","completion":"C: their marriage ties can be strengthened"},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that moved to London in 1969? , can you please find it? Drake ended his studies at Cambridge nine months before graduation, and in autumn 1969 moved to London. His father remembered \\"writing him long letters, pointing out the disadvantages of going away from Cambridge ... a degree was a safety net, if you manage to get a degree, at least you have something to fall back on; his reply to that was that a safety net was the one thing he did not want.\\" Drake spent his first few months in London drifting from place to place, occasionally staying at his sister's Kensington flat but usually sleeping on friends’ sofas and floors. Eventually, in an attempt to bring some stability and a telephone into Drake's life, Boyd organised and paid for a ground floor bedsit in Belsize Park, Camden. On 5 August 1969, Drake recorded five songs for the BBC's John Peel show (\\"Cello Song\\", \\"Three Hours\\", \\"River Man\\", \\"Time of No Reply\\" and an early version of \\"Bryter Layter\\"), three of which were broadcast on the following night. A month later, on 24 September, he opened for Fairport Convention at the Royal Festival Hall in London, followed by appearances at folk clubs in Birmingham and Hull. Folk singer Michael Chapman said of the performances:The folkies did not take to him; [they] wanted songs with choruses. They completely missed the point. He didn't say a word the entire evening. It was actually quite painful to watch. I don't know what the audience expected, I mean, they must have known they weren't going to get sea-shanties and sing-alongs at a Nick Drake gig! The experience reinforced Drake's decision to retreat from live appearances; the few concerts he did play around this time were usually brief, awkward, and poorly attended. Drake seemed reluctant to perform and rarely addressed his audience. As many of his songs were played in different tunings, he frequently paused to retune between numbers. The answer is:","completion":"The full name of the person that moved to London in 1969 is Nick Drake."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"who influenced wolfgang amadeus mozart?\\" Answer:","completion":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, a prolific and genius composer of the Classical era, was influenced by a range of sources throughout his life. These influences varied from his personal relationships with family and mentors to the works of contemporaries and composers from the Baroque era. While the list of those who significantly influenced Mozart is extensive, some key figures are: 1. Leopold Mozart: Wolfgang's father, Leopold, was his first and foremost influence. As a successful composer and respected musician in his own right, Leopold recognized Wolfgang's prodigious talent from a young age and began teaching him music at the age of four. Through rigorous practice and guidance, Leopold had a tremendous impact on Mozart's successful musical career and perspective towards his compositions. 2. Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel: As an admirer of the Baroque era's music, Mozart was profoundly influenced by the works of J.S. Bach and G.F. Handel. Their timeless counterpoint technique and intricate harmonic structures inspired Mozart to develop and refine his own distinctive musical style, merging the beauty of Baroque with the clarity of the Classical era. 3. Josef Haydn: Early in Mozart's career, he befriended Haydn, an eminent composer of the time. The two often performed together and would play their compositions for one another. Haydn's inventive and sophisticated approach to music, such as his developments in the string quartet and symphony, had a significant impact on Mozart, pushing him to take his compositions beyond the limits of friendlier Classical conventions. That said, their friendly rivalry also encouraged Mozart to explore new musical territories, especially in chamber music. 4. Johann Christian Bach: During a stay in London, young Mozart met J.C. Bach, the youngest son of J.S. Bach. J.C. Bach played an important role in introducing Mozart to the \\"galant\\" style that dominated the pre-Classical period. Mozart's long-term fascination with the opera seria and opera buffa genres can largely be traced back to his time with J.C. Bach and the music of that era. 5. Christoph Willibald Gluck: Gluck, a pioneer of Classical opera, was another major influence on Mozart's development as a composer. His \\"reform operas,\\" such as Orfeo ed Euridice and Alceste, which aimed to return opera to its dramatic roots by simplifying the genre, resonated with Mozart. This influence is evident in works like Idomeneo and The Abduction from the Seraglio, where Mozart adopted and expanded upon Gluck's ideas. 6. Antonio Vivaldi and Arcangelo Corelli: As violin virtuosos and composers, Vivaldi and Corelli also played an important role in shaping Mozart's musical style. Their expertise in handling string instruments, evident from their extensive and innovative contributions to the violin concerto and chamber music genres, provided Mozart with inspiration for his own concertos and chamber pieces. 7. The Mannheim School of composers: Mozart was highly influenced by the innovative orchestral techniques emerging from the Mannheim School during his visits to the region. Composers such as Johann Stamitz and Ignaz Holzbauer are known for their unique approach to dynamics and orchestration. This experience left a lasting impact on Mozart, which can be observed in his later compositions, particularly his symphonies and orchestral works. In conclusion, a diverse range of influences shaped the music and style of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. From prominent figures like his father Leopold, the genius J.S. Bach, and contemporaries such as Haydn, to the innovative orchestration techniques of the Mannheim School, all these influences played a critical role in forming the prodigious composer we celebrate today. Undoubtedly, Mozart absorbed and synthesized these various inspirations to create a musical legacy that is admired across generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Many thousands of Chinese are studying at schools in the United States. And writer Liel Leibovitz says the students are following an example that began in the eighteen seventies. Mr. Leibovitz and writer Matthew Miller joined forces to tell the story of the students in their book, \\"Fortunate Sons.\\" The book says China sent one hundred twenty boys from 1872 to 1875 to America to learn about developments that could help modernize their country. Mr. Leibovitz got the idea for the book about the boys a few years ago when he was traveling with his wife in China. Mr. Leibovitz learned that Qing government sent a whole delegation of boys to learn the ways of the West. The goal was for them to return to China and help their country. The book says the boys received their American training in Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. It must have been a very good education. Mr. Leibovitz says the first prime minister of the Chinese Republic completed this program. And so did the first engineer to build a large-scale railroad without foreign help. The same was true of the fathers of Chinese education, diplomacy and the Navy. The book-writers had only to open some boxes containing the writings of these men to learn about them. Their notebooks, journals, letters and postcards were in English. Mr. Leibovitz said he was lucky to have so much information from events that took place long ago. The students returned to China after about nine years. They no longer spoke Mandarin well enough to answer questions. Police welcomed them home by putting them in jail. The young men were released after about a week. But they were given low-level jobs. Mr Leibovitz says it took about ten years for them to rise to higher positions. He said their story continues today with large numbers of Chinese studying in the United States. Options: A Many thousands of Chinese are studying at schools in America.

Arthur Irwin was born in 1858 in Toronto, Ontario, to an Irish blacksmith and a Canadian mother. As a child, he moved with his family to Boston and attended school there. He played local amateur baseball from 1873 until he was recruited by the Worcester Ruby Legs of the National Association in 1879. In late 1879, manager Frank Bancroft took Irwin and most of the other Worcester players on a baseball tour which included visits to New Orleans and Cuba. Irwin's major league career began when the Ruby Legs moved into the National League (NL) in 1880. He led the league in assists in his rookie season, and remained with the team through 1882, when it folded due to poor attendance. Irwin next spent three seasons with the Providence Grays, and was captain and starting shortstop of the 1884 Providence team that became world champions. The 1884 Grays featured star pitchers Charles Radbourn and Charlie Sweeney; the two hurlers did not get along well, and Sweeney left the team in the middle of the season. The club folded after a fourth-place finish in 1885. Irwin moved on to the newly formed Philadelphia Quakers in 1886. Tragedy struck the Philadelphia squad in 1888 when pitcher Charlie Ferguson developed typhoid fever, dying at Irwin's home. During the 1889 season, Irwin went to the Washington Nationals for his first opportunity as player-manager, although the team folded at the end of the season. He next played for the Boston Reds in the Players' League in 1890. That same year, Irwin coached the baseball team at Dartmouth College. While Irwin served as a player-manager for Boston in 1890, he was able to focus on the managerial role for the team in 1891. That year the team signed his brother, John Irwin, on May 21. Newspapers brought accusations of nepotism and criticized John's mediocre play. John Irwin was released by Boston on July 16, and his major league playing career was over by the next month. Although Irwin's regular playing career ended after the 1890 season, he appeared in six games while managing the Boston team after it moved to the American Association in 1891. He also played in one game while managing the 1894 Philadelphia Phillies. A left-handed hitter, Irwin finished his playing career with 1,015 games played and batted .241 in 4,190 plate appearances. He tallied 396 runs batted in and 552 runs scored. Stolen bases were not awarded until 1886, but Irwin tallied 93 stolen bases in his last 532 games. He recorded an .878 career fielding percentage, committing 647 errors in 5,317 fielding chances. Irwin played 947 games at shortstop and 56 games at third base.

Would \\"The team was originally a member of the Northern League from 1993 to 2010.\\" be a reasonable answer? The answer is:","completion":"No, \\"The team was originally a member of the Northern League from 1993 to 2010.\\" would not be a reasonable answer to the question about professional baseball pitchers who were on the Schaumburg Flyers. Instead, a more appropriate answer would provide a list of notable pitchers who played for the team. Here's a more detailed answer: The Schaumburg Flyers were an independent professional baseball team that played in the Northern League from 1999 to 2010. Several professional baseball pitchers played for the team during its existence. Some notable pitchers include: 1. Kyle Ruwe - Played for the Flyers from 2004 to 2005. He later played in the Milwaukee Brewers organization. 2. Al Levine - A former Major League Baseball player who joined the Flyers in 2009 after spending time with various MLB teams, including the Chicago White Sox and Los Angeles Angels. 3. Jim Bullard - Played for the Flyers in 2004-2005 and went on to play in the Mexican League. 4. John Salles - Played for the Flyers in 2000. He was a 3rd round MLB draft pick in 1992 and had minor league experience before joining the team. These are just a few of the many professional baseball pitchers who were part of the Schaumburg Flyers during their existence in the Northern League. The team provided opportunities for many talented athletes to showcase their skills and further their baseball careers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

News article: Supreme Court says Secret Service agents are immune in Bush protest lawsuit There is no precedent that says agents engaged in crowd control have a First Amendment obligation to ensure that crowds with different viewpoints be kept at comparable distances, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court. “Nor would the maintenance of equal access make sense in the situation the agents confronted,” Ginsburg wrote. The agents’ job was complicated by an impromptu decision Bush made to dine alfresco in October 2004. Two groups were assembled by the Jacksonville Inn. Between 200 and 300 people who were unhappy with the president gathered in their assigned spot on the street and sidewalks immediately adjacent, while a group of Bush supporters collected a block away. About 15 minutes after the president was seated and a noisy protest began, the anti-Bush crowd was moved farther away, while the supporters were left where they were. When the motorcade departed, Bush drove past the supporters, but the protesters were not on the route. Seven protesters sued Secret Service agents Tim Wood and Rob Savage, saying the unequal treatment violated free speech rights. Represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, the protesters allege that it was one of more than a dozen instances in which demonstrators were treated differently based on whether they supported or opposed Bush. But Ginsburg said it was clear from maps and diagrams of the incident that the pro-Bush supporters could not have endangered the president from their vantage point. The protesters, on the other hand, “were within weapons range, and had a largely unobstructed view, of the president’s location.” A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled in 2012 that the lawsuit could go forward. The judges said the protesters deserved the chance to prove their allegations that it was a regular practice of Secret Service agents to put the president’s critics farther away than his supporters. In addition, they expressed concern about a “presidential advance manual” that told White House staff members to work with agents to set up protest areas that were “preferably not in view of the event site or motorcade route.” The full appellate court declined to reconsider the decision, but seven judges signed on to a blistering dissent from Circuit Judge Diarmuid O’Scannlain that said the decision would turn the Secret Service into “concern ushers” who had to ensure everyone got an equal seat at the show. The ACLU called the court’s decision Tuesday unfortunate. “No one disputes that the Secret Service has an overriding interest in protecting the president, but that does not include the right to shield the president from criticism,” said the group’s legal director, Steven R. Shapiro. The case is Wood v. Moss . The court was also unanimous in holding that West Memphis, Ark., police officers had not acted unreasonably in shooting and killing a man who had led police on a wild, high-speed chase in two states. The justices were reviewing a lawsuit brought on behalf of the daughter of Donald Rickard against six police officers. They had pursued Rickard and passenger Kelly Allen in 2004 after Rickard took off when police had stopped him for a nonworking headlight. A chaotic chase, captured on video cameras in the police cars, ended with 15 shots from police, 12 of which came as Rickard began driving away when police had surrounded his vehicle. Both Rickard and Allen were killed. Rickard’s lawyer had received tough questioning from the justices when the case was argued in April, and some mentioned having watched the video. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., writing for the court, said it was “beyond serious dispute that Rickard’s flight posed a grave public safety risk.” He said police “acted reasonably in using deadly force to end that risk.” Alito said the court was not passing judgment on whether Allen’s family might be able to bring a claim. The case is Plumhoff v. Rickard . What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"1.

Question: Article: Violent winds swept the ocean, and waves thundered to shore, shaking the lookout tower at Pea Island Rescue Station. Surfman Theodore Meekins was on watch that evening of 11 October 1896. A hurricane had struck the Outer Banks of North Carolina, and the tide was so strong that beach patrols had been canceled. Still, Meekins paid close attention to the horizon. This was the type of weather that could blow ships hundreds of miles off course. Offshore, the ship E.S. Newman was caught in the storm. The captain, whose wife and child were on the ship, feared the Newman would soon break up. He made the decision to beach his ship, then fired a signal, praying that someone onshore would see it. Meekins, whose eyes were trained to cut through rain and surf mists, thought he saw the signal, but so much spray covered the lookout windows that he could hardly make sure. Still, he took no chances. After summoning the station keeper, Captain Richard Etheridge, Meekins set off a coston signal, a signal made by using lamps of different colors. Together, the two men searched the darkness for a reply. A few moments later, they saw a flash of light to the south and knew a shop was in distress . Even before the return signal burned out, Etheridge had summoned his men and begun rescue operations. For the lifesavers, the rescue of the Newman was nothing unusual. Over the years, so many ships had off the Outer Banks that sailors called the region the Graveyard of the Atlantic. Noting the dangerous surf and wind conditions, Captain Etheridge quickly decided the surf boats would be impossible to control. Instead, he decided to use another way to help the survivors. The crew set off on the long journey down the beach to the scene of the wreck . Captain Etheridge hoped to fire a line from a gun to the ship's mast . After the ship's crew dragged the line onboard, the surfmen would fire a second line and carry survivors safely to shore. The surfmen crossed three miles of sand to reach the ship Newman.

Summarize: You can do this either by email or phone, and tell them specifically what you're looking for in order to find out of they can supply a container that meets your needs. If you have found several potential dealers, you should consider contacting all of them to see who will give you the best deal. If there is one who will allow you to see the container, it might be wise to go with them simply because you will get a chance to inspect the quality. Ask the seller to give you a chance to examine the container. However, be aware that this may not always be possible as some sellers may have thousands upon thousands of containers in the depot. If the seller will allow you to, examine the container you will be purchasing carefully. If you need the container to be wind and water tight, go inside the container and shut the door. It will be dark, so you should look for any places where light shines through. If you find a place, this means that it may not be able to protect you or your things from the elements. Make sure the doors close properly, and that there are no huge dents in the container. Containers tend to rust a bit, especially if they are not “new”, but you should look for areas where the container is rusted through. If you need to have your container shipped to you, it is recommended that you do your best to request delivery via a tilt bed roll off truck. Remember though, that unloading, especially if you are having the delivery person place it in a specific way, will cost extra. The price may be included, but it may not be, and it can vary greatly. Make sure you negotiate this cost with the seller. Containers weigh, depending on size, approximately 5,000 pounds (2,268 kilos), so you definitely can’t manage it alone! If you want to have your shipping container placed in an area that doesn't have much cleared space, then you may have to hire someone with a crane to lift the container into the desired position. In countries such as the US, most dealers have many more containers than they need, so it is in their interest for you to purchase one. This gives you the power to negotiate the price with the dealer! If they won’t budge on the price, try asking for free delivery. Although you should negotiate the price, avoid taking advantage of the seller. He or she will know that you are, as they know the going rate. They will be less likely to work with you if they feel you are trying to take unfair advantage over them.","completion":"To find a suitable shipping container, contact potential dealers via email or phone and provide your specific requirements. If possible, visit the dealer to inspect the container's quality. Check for any holes, rust, and door functionality. Negotiate delivery and unloading costs with the seller, and consider using a tilt bed roll-off truck for delivery. If limited space, hire a crane to place the container.

Hill farm grown coffee conventionally, while Valley farm is into shade-grown coffee production. Which farm had more overstory trees with fairly open canopies?","completion":"Since you've mentioned that Hill farm used conventional methods and Valley farm used shade-grown methods for coffee production, I can deduce which farm had more overstory trees with fairly open canopies. To determine this, I'll consider the characteristics of both coffee farming methods: Step 1: Compare conventional coffee farming to shade-grown coffee farming. - Conventional coffee farming typically involves planting coffee plants in full sunlight, with little to no reliance on trees for shade or support. This method prioritizes maximizing production and may require more synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. - Shade-grown coffee farming, on the other hand, integrates coffee plants with other tree species. The trees act as a natural canopy, providing shade to the coffee plants and promoting biodiversity. This method is more environmentally friendly, as it preserves natural habitats and helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem. Step 2: Determine which farming method is associated with overstory trees and open canopies. Considering the characteristics mentioned above, it is apparent that shade-grown coffee farming relies on overstory trees with fairly open canopies to provide the required shade and habitat for the coffee plants and surrounding ecosystem. Conventional coffee farming does not emphasize the presence or maintenance of overstory trees. Based on this information, it is clear that Valley farm, with its shade-grown coffee production method, would have more overstory trees with fairly open canopies compared to Hill farm that uses conventional methods."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Here's a breakdown of the translation process: 1. 'some motorcycle riders' - This phrase refers to a group of people riding motorcycles. The translation for 'motorcycle' in Gujarati is 'મોટરસાઇકલ' (motorsaikal), and 'riders' is 'રાઇડર્સ' (raidars). So, the Gujarati translation for 'some motorcycle riders' becomes 'કેટલીક મોટરસાઇકલ રાઇડર્સ' (ketlik motorsaikal raidars). 2. 'and some other people' - This phrase refers to an additional group of people. The word 'and' is translated to 'અને' (ane) in Gujarati, 'other' becomes 'બીજી' (biji), and 'people' is translated to 'વ્યક્તિઓ' (vyaktio). Therefore, the phrase 'and some other people' in Gujarati is 'અને બીજી કેટલીક વ્યક્તિઓ' (ane biji ketlik vyaktio). 3. 'in the back of a red truck' - This phrase indicates the location of the people mentioned previously. 'in the back of' is translated to 'પાછલા ભાગમાં' (pachhala bhagman) in Gujarati, 'red' becomes 'લાલ' (lal), and 'truck' is translated to 'ટ્રક' (trak). So, the Gujarati translation for 'in the back of a red truck' is 'લાલ ટ્રકના પાછલા ભાગમાં' (lal trakna pachhala bhagman). By combining these translations, we get the final Gujarati translation for the given English sentence: 'કેટલીક મોટરસાઇકલ રાઇડર્સ અને લાલ ટ્રકના પાછલા ભાગમાં બીજી કેટલીક વ્યક્તિઓ' (ketlik motorsaikal raidars ane lal trakna pachhala bhagman biji ketlik vyaktio)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. To print on a t-shirt using a stencil, you only need a few basic supplies. You may have most of them around your house. If not, you'll find what you need at a craft or art store. Round up the following materials: A t-shirt. A plain, basic cotton t-shirt is fine. Know that some paints and inks will bleed through thin cotton, so if this is a concern for you, you might want to choose a thicker blend. The color you choose should be light enough (or dark enough) that the paint colors will show up well. A stencil. You can buy a pre-made stencil from a craft store or make your own using cardboard. Paint or ink. Acrylic fabric paint is a good choice for printing on t-shirts. You could also go with a fabric ink or stain. Look for a type that won't come out in the washing machine. A small paint roller and paint tray. You'll need this to apply the paint to the t-shirt evenly. If you don't have a roller, you can use a wide paintbrush. Tape. This is to hold the stencil in place while you apply the paint. Masking tape works well for this purpose. Cotton t-shirts shrink in the wash, so it's important to run them through the washer and dryer before you print on them. If you wait until after you print, the design might end up getting warped. When the t-shirt is dry, iron it to remove any wrinkles. Lay out some butcher paper or scrap paper on a hard, flat surface. Place the t-shirt on the surface and straighten it out so that it has no folds or wrinkles. Place the stencil on the part of the t-shirt where you want to print the design. Tape the edges of the stencil to the t-shirt to hold it in place. If you're worried the paint is going to bleed, place a piece of cardboard inside the t-shirt; this will prevent the paint from seeping through the shirt to the other side. To prevent paint splatters from getting on your nice clothes, you might want to put on an old t-shirt before you start painting. Pour the paint into the tray. Roll the roller over the paint a few times so that it is distributed evenly around the roller. Do a little test roll on a piece of paper. Using firm, steady strokes, use the roller to fill in the design in the stencil. Cover the entire design and overlap the stencil by an inch or two. Take care not to accidentally apply paint to areas outside the stencil. Carefully lift the stencil from the t-shirt and set it aside. Now wait for the paint to dry completely before touching the t-shirt again. Once the paint is totally dry, place a clean cloth (such as a thin dishcloth) over the design. Set the iron to high and iron over the painted area of the t-shirt. This helps set the paint in place so that it won't easily come off. You're now free to wear your new t-shirt. Wash it by itself using cold water the first few times it gets dirty. With time you should be able to throw it in with the rest of your laundry. Summary:","completion":"To print on a t-shirt using a stencil, first gather the necessary materials: a t-shirt, a stencil, paint or ink, a small paint roller, a paint tray, and tape. Ensure the t-shirt is pre-washed and ironed to prevent shrinking and warping. Lay the t-shirt flat on a covered surface and place the stencil in the desired location, taping the edges to the shirt. You may also insert a piece of cardboard inside the shirt to prevent paint from seeping through. Pour paint in the tray and evenly coat the roller. Apply paint firmly and steadily over the stencil design, overlapping the stencil edges slightly. Carefully remove the stencil and wait for the paint to dry. Once dry, place a clean cloth over the design and iron it to set the paint.

Ray pretended to consult his admission log, just as he always did. The nightly hospital call meant one of three things: the chemical dependency floor was full (highly unlikely), the individual in question had fallen under the hospital's \\"one treatment episode every three months\\" sanction (also known as the Black List, and only moderately unlikely), or the prospective client had no insurance (in Ray's experience, very likely). The folks at the hospital knew, as did Ray, that federal law prohibited him from turning away individuals requesting detoxification services if he had an open bed. The hospital was generous enough to spring for a cab voucher for the intoxicate. In Ray's experience as well, overnight admissions were less interested in detox than in free food, a free bed and complimentary meds. For his two hour paperwork investment and aggravation, he would receive the benefit of knowing the client slept until noon then slipped out the side door and into another binge. Any bills for service generated for the brief stay would return in a week or so stamped \\"No Such Address\\" or simply \\"Return to Sender\\". On average, the clients of addictions services managed to muster a raging 25% of them who would ever pay a dime toward their bill.

Article: Dogs can be worried and pessimistic just like people, researchers report in a new study in Current Biology. And they aren't talking about basset hounds : those dogs just look as if they expect the worst. What the scientists say is that dogs that exhibit anxiety when left home alone by their owners may have bigger problems -- they may be in a permanent bad mood. This pessimistic outlook may not otherwise be easily apparent in a dog's other characteristics, like running speed or learning ability, the study reports. Dogs are similar to humans in the role that emotional state plays in decision making, said Michael Mendel, a veterinary scientist at the University of Bristol and the study's lead author. The study's researchers looked at 24 dogs in shelters in Britain. They placed the dogs in isolated settings and observed their reactions -- many barked, jumped on furniture and scratched at the door. Then they placed bowls in two rooms. One bowl contained food, while another was empty. After training the dogs to understand that bowls can sometimes be empty, and sometimes full, they began to place bowls in ambiguous locations. Dogs that quickly raced to the locations were more optimistic, and in search of food. Those that did not were deemed pessimistic. The more separation anxiety a dog expressed while in isolation, the more likely the dog was to have a pessimistic reaction, the researchers found. The study carries an important message for dog owners, Dr. Mendel said. Dogs that express serious anxiety when alone may need treatment, as it could be a sign of unhappiness and instability. Question: According to Dr. Mendel, which statement is true? Options: A: Like humans, dogs are good at decision making. B: Dog owners should train dogs to find food. C: Emotional state works sometimes when humans make decision. D: Dogs can always find the bowl with food quickly. The answer is:","completion":"A: Like humans, dogs are good at decision making. The article highlights a study that shows dogs can exhibit anxiety and pessimism, similar to humans. The study found that the emotional state of dogs can play a significant role in decision making, just like in humans.

The video shows the militants hurriedly setting up the rocket launcher and camouflaging it with a blue tent, making it nearly invisible from the ground and air. This tactic is commonly used by Hamas militants to avoid detection and airstrikes by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). The alleged Hamas manual, titled \\"Urban Warfare,\\" was reportedly found by the IDF during Operation Protective Edge in 2014. The manual allegedly provides insight into the tactics used by Hamas, including the use of civilian populations as cover for military operations and the exploitation of civilian casualties for propaganda gains. According to Israeli officials, the manual highlights Hamas' understanding that civilian deaths can contribute to gaining sympathy and support from the international community, which would put pressure on Israel to halt its military operations. This disturbing strategy, claims Israel, further validates its longstanding assertion that Hamas deliberately uses its own people as human shields. The manual allegedly offers guidance on constructing tunnels, hiding weapons, and preparing ambushes within densely populated areas. The use of human shields not only draws criticism and condemnation for Israel's military actions but also serves to limit the effectiveness of Israeli airstrikes due to the risk of causing significant civilian casualties. Israel has repeatedly urged the international community to recognize that its actions in Gaza are aimed at defending its citizens and targeting the infrastructure that enables Hamas to carry out acts of terror. However, the high civilian death toll has led to criticism of Israel's military tactics, with opponents accusing the country of using disproportionate force in its operations. While the authenticity of the alleged Hamas manual cannot be independently verified, the footage captured by the Indian television crew demonstrates some level of corroboration for Israel's claims. If proven accurate, the revelations in the manual could potentially shift global public opinion regarding the motivations and methods employed by Hamas. The Israeli government hopes that exposing these tactics will help drive international pressure on Hamas to cease using its civilian population as pawns in its conflict with Israel, thereby enabling a more long-term peace in the region. Yet, despite ceasefires and peace talks, the ongoing tensions between Israel and Hamas continue to cause suffering for innocent civilians on both sides of the border. Ultimately, achieving a lasting peace in the region requires a comprehensive solution addressing the core grievances of both Israelis and Palestinians. This includes tackling issues such as borders, security, refugees, and the status of Jerusalem. Until these underlying issues are addressed, it seems unlikely that the cycle of violence between Hamas and Israel will cease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

To protect the dye from staining your face, apply a thick lotion or a layer of petroleum jelly around your hairline before you begin. You can use a hairdresser's cape instead of a towel if you have one. Start in the front of your hair and work with one section of hair at a time. Pull a chunk of your hair out of the clip and apply the black dye to the section, taking care to saturate your hair with the dye from root to tip. Use bobby pins or hair clips to pin the finished sections out of the way so you can easily get to the rest. If you have thick hair, you may need to separate the sections into smaller sections that are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. You can twist each completed section into a mini-bun and pin the sections like that, if you like. Pin the sections up as you finish them so that they are kept away from the bottom layer of your hair. Follow the directions included with the box of dye and leave it on your hair for the recommended length of time. Keep a towel wrapped around your shoulders in case the dye drips onto your skin. As soon as you finish applying the dye, set a timer for the time span the product recommends. Before you rinse the dye out, gather the bottom layer of your hair and secure it in a low ponytail.

His best-known works include Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso (1863), the Second Piano Concerto (1868), the First Cello Concerto (1872), Danse macabre (1874), the opera Samson and Delilah (1877), the Third Violin Concerto (1880), the Third (\\"Organ\\") Symphony (1886) and The Carnival of the Animals (1886). Saint-Saëns was a musical prodigy; he made his concert debut at the age of ten. After studying at the Paris Conservatoire he followed a conventional career as a church organist, first at Saint-Merri, Paris and, from 1858, La Madeleine, the official church of the French Empire. After leaving the post twenty years later, he was a successful freelance pianist and composer, in demand in Europe and the Americas. As a young man, Saint-Saëns was enthusiastic for the most modern music of the day, particularly that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner, although his own compositions were generally within a conventional classical tradition. He was a scholar of musical history, and remained committed to the structures worked out by earlier French composers. This brought him into conflict in his later years with composers of the impressionist and dodecaphonic schools of music; although there were neoclassical elements in his music, foreshadowing works by Stravinsky and Les Six, he was often regarded as a reactionary in the decades around the time of his death. Saint-Saëns held only one teaching post, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris, and remained there for less than five years. It was nevertheless important in the development of French music: his students included Gabriel Fauré, among whose own later pupils was Maurice Ravel. Both of them were strongly influenced by Saint-Saëns, whom they revered as a genius. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The pupils who revered Charles-Camille Saint-Saëns as a genius were Gabriel Fauré and Maurice Ravel. Gabriel Fauré was a direct student of Saint-Saëns at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris, and Maurice Ravel was among Fauré's own later pupils. Both of these individuals were heavily influenced by Saint-Saëns and considered him a genius."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

By the time Douglas moved to Chester, the black-and-white revival using half-timbering was well under way, and Douglas came to incorporate this style in his buildings in Chester and elsewhere. The black-and-white revival did not start in Chester, but it did become Chester's speciality. The first Chester architect involved in the revival had been Thomas Mainwaring Penson, whose first work in this genre was the restoration of a shop in Eastgate Street in the early 1850s. Other early Chester architects involved in the revival were T. A. Richardson and James Harrison and it came to be developed mainly by T. M. Lockwood and by Douglas. Part of Douglas's earliest work for the Grosvenor family, the entrance lodge to Grosvenor Park, used half-timbering in its upper storey; this is the first known use by Douglas of black-and-white. Other vernacular motifs were taken from earlier styles of English architecture, in particular, the Tudor style. These include tile-hanging, pargetting and massive brick ribbed chimney stacks. In this style, Douglas was influenced by the architects Nesfield and Shaw. Douglas also used vernacular elements from the continent, especially the late medieval brickwork of Germany and the Low Countries.A characteristic of Douglas's work is his attention to both external and internal detailing. Such detailing was not derived from any particular style and Douglas chose elements from whichever style suited his purpose for each specific project. His detailing applied particularly to his joinery, perhaps inspired by his experience in his father's workshop, and was applied both to wooden fittings and to the furniture he designed. A further Continental influence was his use of a Dutch gable. The most important and consistently used element in Douglas's vernacular buildings was his use of half-timbering, which was usually used for parts of the building. However, in the cases of Rowden Abbey and St Michael and All Angels... answer the following question: Who showed a Continental influence in his use of the Dutch gable?

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep. Tim Murphy’s sex scandal is coming down to the wire between Republican candidate Rick Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb. Saccone’s campaign endorsed Trump’s tariff plan in a statement, saying “If other countries aren’t playing by the rules and tariffs are needed to protect steel and aluminum jobs in Southwestern Pennsylvania,...

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -14*z + 294 = 196 for z.","completion":"To solve the equation -14*z + 294 = 196 for z, we need to isolate the variable z on one side of the equation. We can do this by following these steps: Step 1: Move the constant term (294) to the other side of the equation. To do that, we subtract 294 from both sides of the equation: -14*z + 294 - 294 = 196 - 294 Now, the equation becomes: -14*z = -98 Step 2: Solve for z. Now we need to isolate z by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient -14: -14*z / -14 = -98 / -14 The signs cancel each other on the right side of the equation (i.e., a negative number divided by a negative number is a positive number), and on the left side, we are left with the variable z: z = 7 So, the solution to the equation -14*z + 294 = 196 is z = 7."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Process: - An egg is laid by a mother bird - A baby bird forms within the egg if it is fertilized - The baby bird begins pecking out of the egg - The baby bird is unable to fly to get food - The mother bird must feed the baby bird food - The bird grows stronger and grows wings - The bird is able to fly - The bird is able to leave the nest and find food - The bird is able to reproduce. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose safe environment for mother bird happens, how will it affect mother bird dies. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation will have an indirect effect on the process. In the hypothetical scenario where a mother bird dies in a safe environment, the process of the baby bird's growth and development will be negatively impacted, specifically in the stages where the mother bird is directly involved. Here is a breakdown of how the process would be affected at different stages: 1. An egg is laid by a mother bird - Unaffected, as the egg has already been laid before the mother bird's death. 2. A baby bird forms within the egg if it is fertilized - Unaffected, as this process occurs internally within the egg. 3. The baby bird begins pecking out of the egg - Unaffected, as this is a natural instinct of the baby bird. 4. The baby bird is unable to fly to get food - Affected. The mother bird's role in feeding the baby bird is crucial at this stage. If the mother bird dies, the baby bird will not have a source of food. 5. The mother bird must feed the baby bird food - Affected. Since the mother bird is dead, she will not be able to feed the baby bird. 6. The bird grows stronger and grows wings - Affected. Without the mother bird feeding the baby, it may not receive proper nourishment, potentially leading to delayed growth or, in extreme cases, death due to starvation. 7. The bird is able to fly - Affected. If the baby bird does not receive adequate nourishment or dies due to not being fed, it will not make it to this stage. 8. The bird is able to leave the nest and find food - Affected. Assuming the baby bird has survived without its mother and grown enough to leave the nest, it may need to rely more on instinct and may suffer some difficulty due to lack of guidance and support from its mother. 9. The bird is able to reproduce - Affected. If the baby bird manages to survive and grow despite the mother bird's death, it can still reproduce eventually. However, this stage may take longer to reach due to potential developmental delays caused by the mother bird's absence. Overall, the perturbation of the mother bird's death in a safe environment will have an indirect effect on the process, mainly affecting those stages where the mother bird plays a critical role, such as feeding and nurturing the baby bird."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As of the 2010 census, the city population was 5,704. Iola is the county seat of Allen County. It is named in honor of Iola Colborn. Hypothesis: Lola is a small town.","completion":"After analyzing the given paragraph, we can infer whether or not the hypothesis that \\"Lola is a small town\\" is true. Firstly, it is crucial to point out that the name of the city is Iola, not Lola. The paragraph provides information about Iola, a city in Allen County, Kansas, which is located in the Central United States. Iola is situated along the Neosho River and is the county seat of Allen County. The city is named in honor of Iola Colborn. As mentioned in the paragraph, Iola had a population of 5,704 as per the 2010 census. Determining whether the hypothesis \\"Iola is a small town\\" is true or not requires us to evaluate what constitutes a small town. In general, the definition of a small town can be subjective and vary depending on factors such as geographical location, population density, and regional perceptions. However, one common way to understand this term is by considering population size. Given the population of 5,704 in 2010, Iola can generally be considered a small town. In the context of the United States, cities with populations under 20,000 or 10,000 are often referred to as small towns or rural communities, though the distinction may vary depending on factors previously mentioned. It is important to note that while Iola is called a \\"city,\\" this does not necessarily contradict the hypothesis that it is a small town. In the context of this paragraph, the term \\"city\\" is used to indicate the legal and administrative status of Iola as a municipality. It is not uncommon for legally designated cities to have relatively small populations that might otherwise characterize them as towns in the popular imagination. Taking all this information into account, we can conclude that although there could be differing definitions of a small town, by generally accepted population-based criteria, the hypothesis \\"Iola is a small town\\" holds true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I had drunk too much, I confess, though we all had. Somehow, Tasha and I began to argue the worth of Solevgrad jazz, as inconsequential a topic as I can imagine. She had studied it in school, so she thought herself as an expert. I once had a neighbor who played it constantly, loudly, and badly, so I thought I knew it better. Malaquez tried to mediate, but I saw him as siding with Tasha. So, I think, did she. The subject shifted from music to Tasha's obsession with fame, undoubtedly by a leap that I made. She had no choice but to follow. (I do not remember any of this well, just now, nor do I care to. Those who are truly curious may look at the last act of \\"Captured Moments.\\") I remember suggesting, with characteristic tact, that she add Emil to her small list of major accomplishments. Malaquez glanced away, embarrassed. Tasha looked at me as if to say, \\"I will.\\" She said, \\"I feel sorry for you, Nardo. I'll see Emil home.\\" \\"Yes,\\" I said, \\"Do that,\\" and did not care what she did, or why. Emil asked, \\"You're all right?\\" I muttered something he must have interpreted as assent. They both walked up to Emil's home while I watched the scarlet moonlight ripple on distant waves.

As many of Jacobâs comrades are killed or wounded, others exhibit abnormal behavior, including catatonia and a bloody seizure. A terrified Jacob flees into the jungle, only to be bayoneted in the gut. Jacob awakens in 1975, on a New York City Subway, with the novel The Stranger. Despite having a PhD, Jacob works as a postal clerk and lives in a rundown apartment in Brooklyn with his seductive girlfriend, Jezzie. Jacob misses his wife and their three sons, especially the youngest, Gabe, who died before the war. He is increasingly beset by disturbing experiences, including inexplicably locked subway exits, faceless vibrating people, a car trying to run him down, a nurse with grotesque teeth on the top of her head, and a bat-like monster penetrating Jezzie at a party, where Jacob collapses with a dangerous fever. The comrade who had gone catatonic, Paul, contacts him to reveal having had similar terrifying experiences, but is immediately killed when his car explodes. Commiserating after the funeral, the platoon-mates confess that all but one have also been living a nightmare. Jacob explains that the army must have done something to them, and they hire a lawyer to investigate. The lawyer backs out after reading military files documenting that the soldiers were never in combat and were discharged for psychological reasons. Jacobâs comrades also back out, looking scared, as Jacob demands they tell him who got to them. Jacob himself is later thrown into a car with intimidating men in suits who tell him to stop nosing around in military business, but he is able to jump from the moving car. Taken to the hospital, he finds himself strapped to a stretcher being wheeled over bloody body parts, past demented, disfigured inmates. Trapped with doctors wielding barbaric metal instruments, he is told he is already dead, but...
