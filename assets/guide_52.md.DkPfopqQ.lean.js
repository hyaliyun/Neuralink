The first step is to isolate 'q' on one side of the equation. To achieve this, we need to get rid of 8143 from the left-hand side of the equation. To do this, we subtract 8143 from both sides of the equation, which results in: 307q + 8143 - 8143 = -3830 - 8143, which simplifies to: 307q = -11973. Now, to isolate 'q', we need to get rid of 307.

Dripping with chandeliers and lined with gold, this - of course - was Joan Rivers' home. A dazzling gem of old-school showbusiness, it seems only right that her living room ceilings scaled 30ft-high, and velvet drapes framed the vast windows. The 5,000-square-foot penthouse is held up by gold pillars. And in every corner of the opulent New York apartment sit stacks of index cards with jokes spanning her entire career. Scroll down for video. Opulent: The drawing room in Joan Rivers's Upper East Side condo is a sea of pink and gold velvet, with a piano in the corner, lit by three glittering chandeliers. The money shot: Stacks of the biting and controversial jokes that made Joan Rivers a star are scattered around the apartment. In progress: Among her extensive archive there were files of uncompleted jokes ready to be worked on. The comedienne, who died last week at the age of 81, once described the Upper East Side condo as 'where Marie Antoinette would have lived if she had the money'. The limestone mansion was built in 1910 for society figure John R Drexel and his socialite wife. In 1959, it welcomed Ernest Hemingway as a tenant in one of the one-bedroom apartments. He installed a study and hoped to write but found they city too oppressive and soon left. Tributes: Bouquets of flowers have been lain across the marble stairs outside the cast iron front door of the Manhattan apartment following Rivers's death. A pillar of showbusiness: Like Rivers, who died last week at 81, the New York apartment lined with pillars and mirrors is a star of the city, valued at around 35million. Renaissance style: Rivers once described her home with marble statues and cast-iron décor as 'where Marie Antoinette would live if she had the money' Sweeping: To get up to the glittering penthouse, next door to Bette Midler's home, the star would have to scale this vast marble staircase helped by a carved iron rail. Finally, in the 1980s, Rivers descended on the lavish property, called in developers to strip away layers of paint and coat it with gold. The Renaissance-themed bedroom has a four poster bed draped in white lace, surrounded by vases of white lilies and demure paintings. But the soft style is vamped up in one of the numerous living spaces, which has leopard-print carpet and deep red chairs. And the gregarious performer treated every day like a show as her bathroom looks like the backstage of a theatre. Elegant: The bedroom, complete with a four poster bed and lacy drapes and a permanent stock of fresh lilies, is 'as elegant and beautiful as she was', the realtor said. Backstage: She prepared for every day as if she was going to perform, starting in this bulb-lined bathroom which resembled backstage at a theatre. Painstaking: Never one to emerge without a made up face, Joan had an extensive collection of eyeliner, lip liner, eyelash curlers and mascara in little silver pots. Rivers had tried to sell the property a number of times. She first listed it on the market in 2009, when she planned to move to the West Coast to be closer to her daughter, Melissa Rivers. The latest attempt was in 2012 went it was listed with an asking price of 29.5 million. Now, it may be worth considerably more, with similar-sized apartments in the area on the market for 35 million. Cosy: This off-shoot of the vast living area is much smaller but still a treasure trove of silver, gold and pink, with a potted orchid and a mahogany table. Fashion police officer: This is a sneak peek inside the decadent wardrobe of the Fashion Police presenter, who revelled in slating other stars' sartorial mishaps. Exquisite: The living room, with a flat screen TV tucked into a book case, boasts a wood fire, framed artworks, and an oriental rug. Gregarious: The comedienne who entertained the world with her risque jokes spent her time in this leopard print room with stacks of books. In demand: In 2009, Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi allegedly asked to rent the penthouse of the limestone mansion with a cast-iron front door (right) One notable offer allegedly came from the Libyan dictator Muammur Gaddafi in 2009.

To understand the reasons behind this, let's break down the sentence and analyze its different components: 1. The sentence starts with \\"an encyclopedia of cliches,\\" which implies that the subject contains repetitive, unoriginal, or overused elements. This is considered a negative aspect as it does not provide any fresh or innovative content to the audience. 2. The phrase \\"shoplifts shamelessly\\" further emphasizes a negative sentiment, as the word \\"shamelessly\\" indicates a lack of restraint or remorse in reproducing material from other sources. This suggests that the subject is not only unoriginal but also does so without any sense of guilt or acknowledging its lack of creativity. 3. The sentence mentions \\"farewell-to-innocence movies\\" such as \\"The Wanderers\\" and \\"A Bronx Tale\\" as sources from which the subject \\"shoplifts.\\" By referencing these movies, the writer implies that the subject attempts to replicate the success of these well-regarded films but fails to do so. 4. The phrase \\"without cribbing any of their intelligence\\" serves as a final critique by highlighting that the subject not only borrows aspects from more successful films but also misses out on the intelligence and depth that made those movies worth watching. By stating this, the writer confirms that the subject is indeed inferior in comparison.

We want to find out what \\"b\\" is. Here's our problem: 4*b + 0*b + 56 + 54 = 9*b First, let's simplify what we can: 0*b equals to 0 (since anything multiplied by 0 is 0, imagine if you had 0 apples, no matter how many times you multiply it, you will not have more apples) 56 + 54 can be added together which will give us 110 (you can double check by adding the numbers to each other) Now our problem looks like this: 4*b + 110 = 9*b To solve for b, we want the b's on one side and the numbers on the other side. Let's move the 4*b from the left side to the right side by subtracting 4*b from both sides: 110 = 9*b - 4*b Now, subtract 4*b from 9*b: 110 = 5*b Almost there! Now we need to find out what b is.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: For centuries, the body's blood has been linked closely with the emotions.People who show no human emotions or feelings, are said to be cold-blooded killer.For example, the police are searching for a cold-blooded killer.He seems to kill for no reason, and no emotion, as if taking someone's life as nothing. Cold can affect other parts of the body.The expression \\"get cold feet\\" has nothing to do with cold or your feet.The expression means being afraid to do something you have decided to do.For example, you agree to be president of an organization.But then you learn that all the other officers have resigned, and all the work of the organizations will be your responsibility.You are likely to get cold feet about being president when you understand the situation. The expression \\"give someone the cold shoulder\\" probably comes from the physical act of turning your back toward someone, instead of speaking to him face to face.You may give a cold shoulder to a friend who has not kept a promise he made to you.Or, to someone who has lied about you to others. A cold fish is not a fish.It is a person.But it is a person who is unfriendly, unemotional and shows no love or warmth.A cold fish does not offer much of himself to anyone.Someone who is a cold fish could be cold-hearted.Now a cold-hearted person is someone who has no sympathy.Several popular songs in recent years were about cold-hearted men or cold-hearted women who, without feelings, broke the hearts of their lovers. \\"Out in the cold\\" means not getting something that everybody else got.A person might say that everybody but him got a pay raise----he was left out in the cold.And it is not a pleasant place to be.

Albrecht Durer (/'dU@r@r, 'djU@r@r/; German: ['albRect 'dy:Ra]; 21 May 1471 - 6 April 1528) was a painter, printmaker and theorist of the German Renaissance. Born in Nuremberg, Durer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties, due to his high-quality woodcut prints. He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci, and from 1512 he was patronized by emperor Maximilian I. His vast body of work includes engravings, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, watercolours and books. The woodcuts, such as the Apocalypse series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work. His well-known engravings include the Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514) and Melencolia I (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium. Durer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance. This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, perspective and ideal proportions. After reading the above, is \\"European 1498\\" the correct answer to the question \\"In what town and in what year was Durer born?\\"?","completion":"No, \\"European 1498\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"In what town and in what year was Durer born?\\".

The sale fell though so Robin had put the cart before the horse. And I was wondering Due to this Robin will feel how? A:","completion":"Due to the situation, Robin is likely to experience a range of emotions and feelings. Here's a detailed breakdown of what she might be going through: 1. Disappointment: Robin was certain that she would make the sale, which is why she spent her commission prematurely. When the sale falls through, the first feeling she might experience is disappointment in herself for not being able to close the deal. This disappointment could be intensified by the fact that she was already counting on the money from the commission. 2. Frustration: Besides disappointment, Robin might also experience a sense of frustration. This could be directed towards herself for spending the commission ahead of time, or towards external factors that contributed to the sale falling through. This frustration might make her question her abilities or blame external circumstances for her failure. 3. Anxiety: As Robin spent her commission before making the sale, she might now be facing financial difficulties or struggling to make ends meet. This can cause anxiety about her financial stability, which could lead to stress and panic in her personal and professional life. 4. Regret: Robin will likely feel regret after realizing that she put the cart before the horse by spending her commission too soon. This regret might make her question her decision-making skills and create self-doubts in her abilities and judgment. 5. Embarrassment: The fact that others might be aware of Robin's premature spending could result in her feeling embarrassed about the situation. She might feel ashamed for being overly confident or too quick with her actions, leading to a hit on her self-esteem. 6. Determination: Despite the setback, Robin might also feel motivated and determined to overcome this failure and prove herself in future sales opportunities. This determination could push her to work harder, hone her skills and be more careful with her finances in the future. 7. Lesson Learned: Eventually, Robin may come to accept the situation as a valuable lesson learned. She might recognize the importance of not counting chickens before they hatch and strive to avoid such mistakes in the future. This realization can lead to personal growth and improved decision making in her career and personal life. In summary, Robin will likely experience a mix of emotions, including disappointment, frustration, anxiety, regret, embarrassment, determination, and personal growth. The extent of these feelings and the order in which they arise may vary depending on her personality and circumstances. However, it's essential for Robin to learn from this experience, manage her emotions effectively, and apply the lessons learned to prevent similar situations in the future."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Yet fishermen from both sides say boats lack navigational tools to let them know when they've crossed the frontier, which still is subject to a bilateral dispute dating to the 1965 war between the countries. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? There is a territorial waters dispute.","completion":"Yes, the next sentence, \\"There is a territorial waters dispute,\\" does indeed follow from the provided text. From this text, we understand that there is a lingering dispute, a consequence of the 1965 war, over the demarcation of the maritime boundary. This conflict is expressed through the problems that fishermen from both sides of this unspecified boundary are currently experiencing. The inability of the fishing boats to determine when they have crossed into the other country's territory due to the lack of navigational tools reflects that the boundary in question is poorly defined on the field. Hence, this assertion is based on the fact that the maritime boundary dispute has not yet been definitively resolved. Moreover, this boundary dispute puts these fishermen potentially at risk as the inadvertent crossing of a maritime boundary might be interpreted as an intrusion into the other side's territory. This could lead to several problems, including detention of fishermen, confiscation of their boats, or international diplomatic incidents. This challenge that fishermen face emphasizes the complexities arising from the territorial waters disputes. However, without more specific context from the previous sentence, it's difficult to know who the \\"both sides\\" are and what specific part of the territorial waters are in dispute. The 1965 war reference could be between many different sets of countries, so the particular case in reference isn't lucid. In conclusion, while more information helps to fully comprehend the context of the dispute, the next sentence about the territorial waters dispute certainly follows from the given text.

One way to produce more food is by growing stronger plants.For thousands of years,farmers have made plants better.Every season,they pick the best plants for the next season.It works very slowly.Since1983 scientists have been able to change plants more quickly by changing their genetic material. Foods from plants grown in this way are called genetically modified foods ,or GM foods. By changing the genetic material of a plant,it is possible to make new plants. They make plants which are strong against plant diseases. They can also help in our diseases:a kind of rice is being prepared,for example,which stops people from becoming blind.Rich countries produce GM foods because they are easy to grow and they bring in more money.Poor countries are interested in them because they help produce more food. GM plants are not natural.No one knows how good or bad they are.Making GM foods is only one way of feeding people in 2050.But there are strong feelings against them,because they are unnatural.

The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.

This is because Russia was practicing conventional agriculture and using fertilizers, which are known contributors to marine pollution as described in your initial background.

Region A was favorable for sulfate-reducing bacteria and nitrogen fixing bacteria, while region B was more favorable for the developement of Non-respiratory anaerobes and facultative anaerobes. But I can use this background: In many ways, bacterial metabolism provides traits that are useful for ecological stability and for human society. One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves. What is an answer for this question: Which region had more sulfate reduction? The answer is:","completion":"Region A had more sulfate reduction.

Both regions indeed have the traits that contribute to ecological stability and the well-being of human society. However, the primary focus of the question is to determine which region exhibited more sulfate reduction. Sulfate reduction is a critical function provided by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). These specific bacteria facilitate an anaerobic reduction process where sulfate (SO4²⁻) serves as the terminal electron acceptor. Consequently, they break down organic matter in the absence of oxygen, producing hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as a side product. This metabolic process plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of sulfur and carbon cycles in various ecosystems, such as aquatic environments, sediments, and soils. Additionally, as mentioned in the background information, the activities of SRB are known to help produce highly toxic forms of mercury, which are relevant to pollution responses. As Region A is specifically described as favoring sulfate-reducing bacteria, it stands to reason that this area had a higher concentration of these organisms, thus leading to more extensive sulfate reduction. Their presence and the metabolic processes they carry out greatly contribute to the environmental conditions of the region, making it particularly rich in sulfate reduction. On the other hand, Region B's environment is better suited for non-respiratory anaerobes and facultative anaerobes. These bacteria, although ecologically significant, do not directly contribute to sulfate reduction like the SRB in Region A. Instead, they engage in fermentation processes to generate energy and reducing power under specific conditions or can switch their metabolic pathways depending on the environment – like obtaining energy from nitrate in lieu of oxygen. In conclusion, due to the optimal environmental conditions and the prevalence of sulfate-reducing bacteria, Region A had more sulfate reduction compared to Region B, whose conditions were more conducive to the growth and metabolic activities of non-respiratory anaerobes and facultative anaerobes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

PUBLISHED:. 11:40 EST, 12 April 2013. |. UPDATED:. 11:44 EST, 12 April 2013. After years of iPhone and iPod owners getting turned away for replacements because their devices indicated water damage, and thus a voided warranty, Apple has agreed to pay out 53 million in a class action suit. Settled: Apple has agreed to pay 53 million in class action suit that said it unfairly denied customers replacement devices. The settlement could affect hundreds of thousands of customers who brought their malfunctioning devices to Apple, only to be told they were no longer covered by warranties because a little sticker inside had turned a shade of pink or red. No matter the problem, the company refused to replace any device with a pink or red sticker and must now pay what amounts to about 200 per claimant in the suit. Only owners of original, 3G, and 3GS iPhones as well as first, second, and third generations of the iPod Touch are affected by the settlement. So, who’s to blame? Not us, says Apple. Signed Wednesday, the tech giant admitted to no wrongdoing in the settlement. The company that makes the ‘Liquid Indicator Strips,’ meanwhile, said their product may have been the culprit in so many voided warranties. Though Apple owns the patent to the strips, maker 3M indicated that humidity and not water contact could have turned some of the white stickers pink, misleading customer service representatives who examined the devices. Apple, nonetheless, may have learned of the issue years ago. Denied: For years, Apple routinely voided warranties to customers whose devices indicated water damage. According to a report in The Atlantic, the company ‘quietly tweaked’ its water damage policy in 2011 to be a little more giving. The policy now indicates that devices with an activated LCI may still be replaced ‘if a customer disputes’ that water made contact with the device as long as there are no signs of corrosion. However, the policy stopped short of faulting the indicator strips, which the policy says ‘are designed not to be activated by temperature or humidity that are within the product's operating requirements.’ That means newer devices were not covered in the suit, payouts for which could go up or down depending on number of claims submitted. Blame: Apple claimed no wrongdoing in the suit while makers of the 'Liquid Contact Indicator' strips admitted they may have been misleading. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"1.

Plot title: Beneath the Planet of the Apes Movie plot: Following the events of Planet of the Apes, time-displaced astronaut Taylor (Charlton Heston) and the mute Nova (Linda Harrison) are riding on horseback through the desert of the Forbidden Zone. Without warning, fire shoots up from the ground and deep chasms open. Confused by the strange phenomenon, Taylor investigates a cliff wall and disappears before Nova's eyes. Elsewhere in the Forbidden Zone, a second spaceship has crash landed after being sent to search for Taylor and his crew. Like Taylor's ship, it has traveled into Earth's distant future. However, surviving astronaut Brent (James Franciscus) believes he has traveled to another planet. He encounters Nova and notices she is wearing Taylor's dog tags. Hoping Taylor is still alive, he rides with her to Ape City, where he is shocked to discover the simian civilization. He observes the gorilla General Ursus (James Gregory) leading a rally calling for the apes to conquer the Forbidden Zone and use it as a potential food source, against the objections of the orangutan Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans). Brent is wounded by a gorilla soldier and taken by Nova to the home of the chimpanzees Cornelius (David Watson) and Zira (Kim Hunter), who treat his wound and tell him of their time with Taylor. The humans hide when Dr. Zaius arrives and announces that he will accompany Ursus on the invasion of the Forbidden Zone. Attempting to flee the city, Brent and Nova are captured by gorillas. Ursus orders they be used for target practice, but Zira helps them escape. They hide in a cave which Brent soon discovers is the ruins of the Queensboro Plaza station of the New York City Subway, making him realize that he has traveled through time to Earth's post-apocalyptic future. After following a humming sound deeper into the underground tunnels, Brent begins to hear voices telling him to kill Nova. Entering the remains of St. Patrick's Cathedral, he finds a population of telepathic humans who worship an ancient nuclear bomb. Brent and Nova are captured and telepathically... My question: Where was the cave located which Brent and Nova hid after their escape? Answer:","completion":"The cave where Brent and Nova hid after their escape was located in the fictional universe of the film, in the Forbidden Zone. It's important to note, however, that upon exploration within the cave, Brent discovers that it is, in fact, the ruins of the Queensboro Plaza station of the New York City Subway. This revelation is crucial as it makes him realize that he has traveled through time to Earth's post-apocalyptic future, rather than a different planet as he initially believed. The transformation of the bustling and iconic Queensboro Plaza station into an eerie, desolate, and unrecognizable cave is a poignant testament to the cataclysmic events that led to the resurgence of a newfound civilization run by apes on Earth. As such, while the cave is initially a mere hideout for Brent and Nova, its ultimate discovery as a relic of a bygone era effectively ties into the overarching narrative of the movie and reveals in no uncertain terms to Brent where and when he truly is."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In order to solve for 'r,' we need to combine like terms on the left-hand side of the equation. Since both terms have 'r' as their variable, we can combine them by subtracting 27*r from 35*r: (35 - 27) * r = -32 3. Simplify the expression within the parentheses: 8 * r = -32 4.

Even if that's an overstatement , it's close to the truth. Scientists say teens should sleep nine hours each night. But that's hard. Some are even \\"pulling all-nighters\\" . These students must hand in their homework the next day but they haven't done it. In the morning they don't look healthy and you can tell who's been doing it. One of my classmates did a survey on the topic. She found that most kids pull all-nighters to finish homework, but some do it for other reasons, such as playing computer games! Maybe our lack of sleep is because of laziness -- I think I'm a rather lazy student -- or maybe it's because we have too much to do in American high schools. I usually go to bed around midnight. If I stayed up past 1:30 am, I wouldn't get any work done. I'd be falling asleep at my computer. My classes begin at 7:30 am. I'm partly awake in my first class. By the second, I'm a little sleepy. By my third class, I'm sleepy. By midday I'm finally fully awake. But by 3:00 pm, I'm slowing down again. Yet I get more sleep than usual students. Most American high schools seem to have a similar problem with sleepy students. High school classes start at 7:30 am, so students have to get up one and a half hours before that to get ready and catch the bus. It's believed that lack of sleep can be bad for both grades and health. Some schools are paying attention. Classes in those schools start at 8:30 am.

Peter Hall directed the Bayreuth Ring after Chéreau. His version, staged 1983–86, portrayed the natural innocence of the Rhinemaidens in the simplest of ways; they were naked. Keith Warner adapted this feature in his Ring production for the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, first staged 2004–06. A Covent Garden spokesman explained \\"The maidens are children of innocence, a vision of nature – and as soon as someone appears they hastily throw on some clothes to protect their modesty.\\" While Warner relies on lighting to achieve an underwater effect, Hall used a Pepper's ghost illusion: mirrors at a 45° angle made the Rhinemaidens appear to swim vertically when the performers were in fact swimming horizontally in a shallow basin.Although the roles of the Rhinemaidens are relatively small, they have been sung by notable singers better known for performing major roles in Wagnerian and other repertoire. The first person to sing the part of Woglinde in full was Lilli Lehmann at Bayreuth in 1876. In 1951, when the Bayreuth Festival re-opened after the Second World War, the same part was taken by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. Other Bayreuth Rhinemaidens include Helga Dernesch who sang Wellgunde there between 1965 and 1967. Lotte Lehmann played Wellgunde at the Hamburg State Opera between 1912 and 1914 and the Vienna State Opera in 1916. Recorded Rhinemaidens have included Sena Jurinac for Furtwängler and RAI, Lucia Popp and Gwyneth Jones for Georg Solti, and Helen Donath and Edda Moser for Karajan.

Some bird species undertake shorter migrations, travelling only as far as is required to avoid bad weather or obtain food. Irruptive species such as the boreal finches are one such group and can commonly be found at a location in one year and absent the next. This type of migration is normally associated with food availability. Species may also travel shorter distances over part of their range, with individuals from higher latitudes travelling into the existing range of conspecifics; others undertake partial migrations, where only a fraction of the population, usually females and subdominant males, migrates. Partial migration can form a large percentage of the migration behaviour of birds in some regions; in Australia, surveys found that 44% of non-passerine birds and 32% of passerines were partially migratory. Altitudinal migration is a form of short distance migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes elevations and move to lower ones during suboptimal conditions. It is most often triggered by temperature changes and usually occurs when the normal territories also become inhospitable due to lack of food. Some species may also be nomadic, holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability. Parrots as a family are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be dispersive, irruptive, nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrations.

Grape farm had depleted soils and a low crop production, while Fruit farm, having parcels with depleted soils in the past, established an agroforestry system starting a decade ago which helped stabilize soil and increase production. Which farm didn't obtain cleaner water as a result of their farming methods? Hint: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth: A:","completion":"Grape farm didn't obtain cleaner water as a result of their farming methods. Their depleted soils and low crop production indicate that they likely have not implemented agroforestry systems with groundcover plants to help prevent soil erosion and increase soil cover, leading to reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff for cleaner water."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Womb Movie plot: The film commences with a pregnant woman (Eva Green) telling her unborn child that the father has departed for good, but that together they will start a new life. A love story is then told between two children, Rebecca and Tommy, who swear each other eternal love. When Rebecca departs suddenly for Japan with her mother, the two are separated. Twelve years later, Rebecca returns as a young woman to find that Tommy (Matt Smith) not only remembers her, but still cares deeply for her. The two begin a new relationship. Tommy is a political activist fighting against the biotech corporations, who plan to open a new natural park populated by animals artificially created by cloning. Tommy plans to spoil the inauguration ceremony by letting loose rucksacks filled with cockroaches. Rebecca, herself a computer programmer of leak detection sonar software for underground storage containers, insists on accompanying Tommy. Driving to the site of the new natural park through a lonely wilderness, Rebecca asks Tommy to stop the car so that she can relieve herself at the side of the road. Meantime, Tommy leaves the car and is struck and killed suddenly by a passing vehicle. Rebecca and Tommy's parents are stricken with grief. Rebecca wants to use new scientific advancements to have Tommy cloned and thereby bring him back to life. She offers to be impregnated using Tommy's DNA. Though Tommy's mother objects, his father agrees to give Rebecca Tommy's cell material, but urges her to think through her decision carefully before proceeding. Rebecca, however, continues and gives birth to a new Tommy by Caesarean section. Tommy is now raised as Rebecca's son, and the two have a close relationship. Rebecca presents to him a pleo, an artificial living animal created using new biotechnology. Tommy and his playmates observe a neighbourhood girl and try to determine if she has a \\"copy smell\\" as the girl is a clone.

When Rebecca returns to their hometown after twelve years apart in Japan, she discovers that Tommy not only remembers her from their childhood but still has deep feelings for her. After reuniting, the two of them begin a new romantic relationship. It's evident from their interactions and Tommy's affection for her that he genuinely cares for her. Moreover, after Tommy's sudden death, it's notable how his parents, especially his father, show care for Rebecca as well. While Tommy's mother objects to the idea of cloning Tommy, his father is more understanding. He allows Rebecca to use Tommy's cell material for cloning but advises her to consider her decision thoroughly. He doesn't flatly dismiss her emotional pain but grants her permission while expressing concern for her decision-making process. This concern also reflects certain degree of care for Rebecca. However, the most profound care and love for Rebecca are shown by Tommy, who remained devoted to her from their childhood until his premature death."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and answer the question.

There are several factors that contribute to their dissatisfaction, as outlined below: 1. Damaged condition of the product: The customer mentioned that they received the DVD with a cracked case and a damaged DVD holder. The fact that the holder is unable to firmly hold the DVDs can be seen as a serious issue, as it can lead to further damage of the DVDs or make them difficult to access. 2. One of the DVDs itself was damaged: Adding to the previous issue, the customer also described one of the DVDs as having a crack in the center. This can compromise the playback quality or prevent the DVD from being played at all, which is a major source of disappointment. 3. Difficulty in returning the item: The customer expressed that they cannot easily return the item due to living outside the US. This adds to their frustration, as they cannot easily exchange the damaged product for a better-quality one. If the return process was convenient, their dissatisfaction might have been tempered by the prospect of receiving a replacement. 4. Packaging by Amazon was not the issue: The customer acknowledged that the packaging by Amazon appeared fine, which suggests that the damage to the product most likely occurred at the seller's facility or even earlier. This shifts the blame toward the seller, which contributes to their overall dissatisfaction. 5. Wonderful content, but overshadowed by negative experience: The customer did mention that the content of the DVDs is \\"wonderful,\\" which indicates that they might have been satisfied if the product itself was not damaged. However, the wonderful content couldn't compensate for the negative aspects resulting from the physical condition of the product. In conclusion, the customer is clearly dissatisfied with their purchase due to the damaged condition of the product, the difficulty in returning or exchanging it, and the fact that Amazon's packaging was not the issue.

In one study,researchers in the United States examined information on more than 1000 people.The people had taken part in a long-term study of sleep disorders. Some people slept less than five hours a night.They had 15 percent higher blood levels of a hormone called ghrelin than people who slept eight hours.And they had 15 percent less of the hormone leptin.Experts say ghrelin helps make people feel hungry;leptin makes you feel full. The scientists say these hormonal changes may be a cause of obesity in Western societies.They note the combination that limitation is common and is widely available. The results were not affected by how much people exercised.People who are awake longer have more time to burn energy.But the researchers say loss of sleep may increase hunger especially for high-calorie foods,so people gain weight.It seems that,for survival,the body may be designed to store more fat during times with less sleep. Researchers from Stanford University in California and the University of Wisconsin did the study.They found that the best amount of sleep for weight control is 7.7 hours a night.

By Barbara Starr Just days before he leaves office, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta is recommending military pay be limited, effectively decreasing troop salaries next year. Panetta will recommend to Congress that military salaries be limited to a 1% increase in 2014. The Pentagon has calculated that the Labor Department's 2014 Employment Cost Index is expected to be above 1% but wants to still cut back on pay because of \\"budget uncertainties,\\" a department official told CNN. In 2013, a 1.7% increase was approved, based on the index, which has been the basis for military pay for the last several years. Three Pentagon officials have confirmed details of the plan to CNN. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have also agreed to Panetta's proposed pay plan. Final approval for the pay would come from Congress in the form of the 2014 budget. The recommendation is tied to the Defense Department's 2014 budget recommendation, which was expected to be sent to Congress this month, one of the officials said. But the officials acknowledge it is going to be seen as an effort to push Congress to stop the automatic budget cuts that could go into effect if no deal is reached on spending reductions. ALSO: Panetta warns spending cuts will degrade military readiness The decision comes as the secretary is stepping up the rhetoric about dire cuts at the Pentagon if sequestration goes into effect. President Obama in 2012 walled off military pay from cuts, so if this current pay plan goes into effect, it's widely seen as \\"cutting our pay,\\" one military officer familiar with the plan told CNN. \\"It's a smart move, it puts it in Congress' hands,\\" he said. Panetta, in one of his last official speeches as secretary of defense, told an audience at Georgetown University on Wednesday that the Pentagon faced \\"the most serious readiness crisis in over a decade.\\" The defense secretary outlined a series of possible cuts should the Pentagon be forced to find half a trillion dollars more in savings. He warned that 800,000 civilian workers could furloughed for 22 days and that the Army would need to cut back on training and maintenance, putting two-thirds of combat teams at \\"reduced readiness levels.\\" Pacific naval operations could be cut by as much a third, and Air Force flying hours and weapons maintenance could be cut. CNN has also learned that this week, the Navy is expected to announce it does not have the money to pay for refueling and maintenance of the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln. That will essentially mean the Navy is short a carrier and overseas deployments will be cut. \\"No good options exist,\\" Panetta said. ||||| Washington (CNN) -- Furloughed workers, reduced combat readiness, shrunken naval operations and cuts to Air Force flying hours and weapons maintenance. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta listed those consequences as he provided a stark warning on Wednesday about the effects of impending budget cuts on the military unless Congress acts to avert them. The result, he said, would be \\"the most serious readiness crisis\\" faced by the armed services in over a decade. Panetta's address at Georgetown University, which he called \\"hopefully one of my last speeches as secretary of defense,\\" included the first details of how the Pentagon would deal with the automatic spending cuts -- or sequestration in congressional jargon -- set to trigger March 1 across federal agencies. For the Pentagon, sequestration would mean almost 500 billion in cuts over 10 years. For 2013 alone, some 46 billion in reduced spending would result in \\"a serious disruption in defense programs and a sharp decline in our military readiness,\\" Panetta said. Opinion: How to avoid job-killing budget cuts \\"There are no good options\\" to deal with the situation, he continued, saying 46,000 department jobs would be at risk and more damaging measures in coming months could include: -- Furloughing as many as 800,000 civilian workers for up to 22 days; -- Cutting back on Army training and maintenance, which would reduce readiness of combat brigades outside Afghanistan; -- Shrinking naval operations; and, -- Reducing Air Force flying hours and weapons systems maintenance. \\"This is not a game. This is reality,\\" Panetta said, his voice rising. \\"These steps would seriously damage a fragile American economy and they would degrade our ability to respond to crisis precisely at a time of rising instability across the globe.\\" His comments sought to increase pressure on Republicans and Democrats to reach agreement on deficit-reduction steps, thereby avoiding the across-the-board spending cuts of sequestration that were part of a 2011 deal that raised the federal debt ceiling. On Tuesday, President Barack Obama called for a short-term deal to put off the cuts so Congress could continue work on a permanent fix that provides desired reductions in the federal deficit. Obama made clear that he still wants a broader deficit-reduction agreement with Republicans that includes spending cuts, some entitlement reforms and increased revenue from eliminating some tax breaks. However, Obama said, with time running out before the sequestration cuts slash government spending and result in job losses and economic slowdown, Congress should pass a temporary fix that would allow time for further negotiations on a broader plan. By the numbers: Recent defense spending \\"Compromise is a way to achieve it,\\" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Wednesday, noting that Obama continued to offer proposals to cut spending and increase revenue that shifted to the middle from his original stances. However, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, accused Obama and Democrats of avoiding needed spending cuts and trying to put off tough decisions instead of facing their responsibilities as elected leaders. Deficit reduction should focus on cutting government spending and must include savings from popular entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, Boehner insisted on Wednesday. \\"At some point, Washington has to deal with its spending problem,\\" he told reporters. \\"I've watched them kick this can down the road for 22 years. I've had enough of it. It's time to act.\\" Boehner also echoed Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky in opposing Obama's call for including more tax revenue in the mix. Opinion: Republicans, be smart about defense cuts Also Wednesday, GOP legislators proposed 85 billion in reduced spending through attrition -- or not filling all vacated government jobs -- and freezing congressional pay as an alternative to the sequestration this year. They said the plan achieves the same amount of deficit reduction without more tax revenue sought by Obama and Democrats. The debate continues the ideological showdown between Republicans and Democrats over the size and role of government. Republicans driven by their conservative base want to reduce government and taxes to fund it, arguing that is the best way to grow the economy. Democrats promote a strong government safety net through entitlements and support programs that they say bolsters middle-class opportunity necessary for economic growth. Congress and the White House agreed to the sequestration cuts as part of the 2011 debt ceiling deal that ended a showdown over whether to increase the federal government's borrowing limit to meet its obligations. The automatic spending cuts never were intended to become law, but instead were designed to be so unwieldy and overbearing that Congress would reach a broader deficit reduction deal to avoid them. Military pay in play in game of political poker Deep partisan divisions prevented such an agreement from happening in 2012, an election year. Initially the cuts were to go into effect on January 2, but the government delayed the impact of sequestration for the first two months of 2013. In his speech, Panetta referred to what he described as \\"partisan dysfunction in Congress\\" that he said threatens the quality of life and national security of the nation. Instead of making tough decisions to resolve problems, political leaders from both parties let issues become crises that require immediate but insufficient responses, he said. \\"It's the easy way out,\\" Panetta said, adding that there is a price to be paid for such an approach. \\"You lose the trust of the American people,\\" he said. \\"You create an aura of constant uncertainty that pervades every issue and gradually undermines the very credibility of the nation.\\" CNN Explains: Sequestration In another effort to stoke public alarm over the pending cuts, Carney told reporters that top defense contractors met at the White House with senior administration officials to discuss the impacts on their industry. According to Carney, those impacts would be overwhelmingly negative. \\"It's not just a parlor game here in Washington,\\" he said of the issue. \\"These are real-world decisions that significantly affect the economy and the American people.\\" Obama said Tuesday that he still supports a broader deficit deal and made clear that revenue from tax reform measures previously agreed to by Republicans -- such as eliminating some loopholes to increase revenue for the government -- should be part of it. Boehner, however, reiterated the GOP call for replacing the sequester plan with spending cuts and reforms -- a reference to changes in entitlement programs. A last-second agreement in the previous Congress that passed in the first days of 2013 raised tax rates on top income earners as part of a limited deficit-reduction package. That measure followed weeks of tough negotiations involving Obama and Congress in which other steps to increase government revenue, such as eliminating some tax breaks for corporations, were considered but not included in the final deal. How our tribes cause gridlock in Congress Obama and Democrats now want such revenue-raising steps to be part of a package that would replace the mandated deficit reduction of the sequester cuts. McConnell expressed his opposition to such a move Tuesday, saying, \\"The American people will not support more tax hikes in place of the meaningful spending reductions both parties already agreed to and the president signed into law.\\" CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Defense Secretary Leon Panetta suggests limiting military pay in 2014 due to \\"budget uncertainties.\\" This would involve decreasing the salary of troops next year.

A potential customer can apply for an organ, which is sold on credit, at high interest. If a customer is unable to maintain payments, after three months, a repo-man is sent after the customer to 'reclaim' Union property. The process of the repossession is bloody & brutal, and often results in the death of the customer.Remy is one of the Union's top repo-men, who partners with his childhood friend, Jake, to collect on past due accounts. Remy is highly regarded within The Union as their top performer, though his occupation causes problems with his wife, who sees it as unsavory. After she leaves Remy when Jake commits a repossession in front of their home, Remy decides to transfer to a sales job, much to Jake's chagrin.As his final repossession job, Remy is sent to the residence of a music producer, whose work he happens to admire. After allowing the man enough time to complete a song, Remy prepares to repossess his heart. When he attempts to use a heart defibrillator to stop the unit, the defibrillator malfunctions, sending a large electrical shock through his body and knocking him into a coma. When Remy awakens from his coma, he is informed by Jake and Frank, his co-workers, that the shock severely damaged his heart. He can be fitted with an artificial heart, or die. After Remy attempts to flee the hospital, he reluctantly agrees to the procedure.Remy goes back to work, but is unable to perform his job, because he is just like the people he is repossessing from. He attempts to transition into sales, but quickly finds himself behind in payments. Jake takes Remy to the outskirts of the city to a nest, which is a collection of people who have past due accounts with the Union, but are fleeing to avoid being repossessed. Remy is again unable to perform a repossession, after which he is abandoned by Jake until he can perform his job. Remy is attacked by a pair of men from whom he was...

A: Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the question The question asks about the greatest contribution of arthropods to the human food supply. We need to determine which of the given options (vegetation, reproduction, hibernation, or pollination) has the most significant impact on the human food supply. Step 2: Consider the importance of each option - Vegetation: Arthropods play a role in maintaining plant life through predation and decomposition. However, this indirect contribution does not have a major impact on the human food supply. - Reproduction: Arthropods reproduce at a high rate, but this would benefit humans primarily through the consumption of arthropods, such as insects or crustaceans, which have a minor presence in our food supply compared to other sources. - Hibernation: This refers to the period of inactivity for some arthropods during unfavorable conditions. This does not directly affect human food supply. - Pollination: Many arthropods, especially insects such as bees, play a crucial role in the pollination of a wide variety of plants. Pollination is required for plants to produce fruits, seeds, and vegetables, which are essential components of the human diet. Step 3: Choose the most significant contribution Based on the impact of each option, pollination (option D) has the greatest contribution to the human food supply, as it allows for the growth and development of a vast array of plant-derived food sources.

(1). different meanings (2). the same meaning","completion":"The correct answer is (1). Change has different meanings in these two sentences. In the first sentence, the product is undergoing a change in order to improve it. The word 'change' in this context means a transformation or modification in the product's design, features, or functionality. This change is purposefully being made to enhance the product and make it better than before, ultimately benefiting the users and the company behind the product. The use of the word 'change' in this context suggests a positive connotation, as it delivers beneficial results. On the other hand, the second sentence states that the storm is a change for the worse. In this context, the 'change' refers to a shift in conditions or circumstances caused by the storm. Contrary to the positive use of 'change' in the first sentence, its use in this sentence carries a negative connotation. The word 'worse' explicitly implies that the change caused by the storm leads to unfavorable outcomes, likely resulting in damage, danger, or disruption for those affected by the storm. In conclusion, the word 'change' in the two sentences carries different meanings. While the first use signifies a positive transformation made to improve a product, the second use points to a negative shift in circumstances caused by an unfavorable event (the storm)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Many young ladies fell in love with him including the nymph : Echo. Nymphs were lively spirits who lived near streams and lakes and protected trees in the forest. Echo had upset the Queen of the Gods; Hera. As a punishment Hera made Echo unable to speak except to repeat the last three words of the person she was talking to. Poor Echo fell in love with Narcissus but could never tell him how she felt. Narcissus teased her and she ran away with tears pouring down her face. Aphrodite, the goddess of love saw what happened and decided to punish Narcissus. As he came to a pool of water Narcissus saw his reflection and fell in love with the vision he saw. It was of course his own reflection. Poor Narcissus watched his own reflection, every time he tried to touch the face of the vision he loved it broke up on the shimmering surface of the water. Narcissus stopped eating, lost his beautiful looks and desired to get his love. In the end he anguished gradually and died.

Several factors can contribute to the low number of accidents in this busy area, including: 1. Effective traffic management: A well-designed and efficiently managed traffic system can reduce traffic congestion and prevent accidents. This may include the proper placement of traffic signs, traffic signals, and pedestrian crossings. Moreover, well-maintained roads and infrastructure can also reduce the risk of accidents. 2. Driver education and awareness: Good driver education and awareness programs can ensure that all drivers are knowledgeable about safe driving practices and are aware of the traffic rules and regulations. This can lead to responsible driving behavior, reducing the likelihood of accidents in busy areas. 3. Law enforcement: Stringent law enforcement can discourage risky driving behavior and ensure adherence to traffic rules. This may include regular patrolling and swift action against traffic offenders, making the area safer for all road users. 4. Pedestrian safety measures: To help maintain a low accident rate in busy areas, pedestrian safety is crucial as well. This can be achieved by providing well-marked pedestrian crossings, pedestrian-only zones, and ample sidewalk space for people to walk. 5. Public transportation system: In busy metropolitan areas, having an efficient public transportation system can ease traffic congestion and reduce the number of vehicles on the road, which in turn lowers the chances of accidents. Encouraging the use of public transportation by making it accessible, affordable, and punctual can contribute to the safety of all road users. 6. Technology integration: The use of modern technological advancements such as smart traffic signals, surveillance cameras, and real-time monitoring systems can help efficiently manage traffic, identify potential traffic problems, and prevent accidents. 7. Accident reporting and data analysis: A proactive approach to accident reporting and analyzing collected data can help identify trends, pinpoint accident-prone areas, and take necessary corrective measures to reduce the risk of accidents in the future. In conclusion, while it does appear that there are few accidents in the busy area you described, it is essential to understand the multiple factors that can be in place to support and maintain such a low accident rate. Ensuring the efficient functioning of traffic systems, law enforcement, public transportation, pedestrian safety measures, and technology integration can be effective measures for maintaining low accident rates in busy areas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What Republics did the Rova compound remained largely closed to the public, except on special occasions? Answer the above question based on the context below: The 1896 French colonisation of Madagascar brought an end to the rule of the Merina sovereigns. The Rova of Antananarivo was converted into a museum the following year, and the Fitomiandalana tombs were excavated and moved to a new location behind the tombs of Radama I and Rasoherina. The bodies of sovereigns previously interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga were exhumed and transferred to the tombs in the Rova grounds, a sacrilegious move that degraded the status of Ambohimanga as a site of sacred pilgrimage. According to Frémigacci (1999), French colonial administrator General Joseph Gallieni undertook this desacralisation of the Rova in an attempt to break popular belief in the power of the royal ancestors. By the same token, his actions relegated Malagasy sovereignty under the Merina rulers to a relic of an unenlightened past. The desecration of the two most sacred sites of Merina royalty represented a calculated political move intended to establish the political and cultural superiority of the colonial power.Following independence the Rova compound remained largely closed to the public throughout the First (1960–1972) and Second (1975–1992) Republics except on special occasions. In 1995, three years into the Third Republic (1992–2010), the Rova compound was destroyed by fire. The tombs, chapel, exterior of Manjakamiadina and two traditional wooden houses (Besakana and Mahitsy) have since been restored with further restorations planned to continue until at least 2013.

Information: - Iran (, also , ; ' ), also known as Persia, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran (' ), is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered to the northwest by Armenia, the \\"de facto\\" Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Azerbaijan; to the north by the Caspian Sea; to the northeast by Turkmenistan; to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan; to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; and to the west by Turkey and Iraq. Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center. - Khwja Shams-ud-Dn Muammad fe-e Shrz, known by his pen name Hafez (\\"fe\\" 'the memorizer; the (safe) keeper'; 1325/261389/90), was a Persian poet who \\"lauded the joys of love and wine but also targeted religious hypocrisy.\\" His collected works are regarded as a pinnacle of Persian literature and are to be found in the homes of most people in Iran, who learn his poems by heart and still use them as proverbs and sayings. His life and poems have been the subject of much analysis, commentary and interpretation, influencing post-14th century Persian writing more than any other author. - Shiraz (\\"Šrz\\", ) is the sixth most populous city of Iran and the capital of Fars Province (Old Persian as Pârsâ). At the 2011 census, the population of the city was 1,460,665 and its built-up area with \\"Shahr-e Jadid-e Sadra\\" (Sadra New Town) was home to 1,500,644 inhabitants. Shiraz is located in the southwest of Iran on the \\"Roodkhaneye Khoshk\\" (The Dry River) seasonal river. It has a moderate climate and has been a regional trade center for over a thousand years. Shiraz is one of the oldest cities of ancient Persia. - Qazvin (, also Romanized as \\"Qazvn\\", \\"Caspin\\", \\"Qazwin\\", or \\"Ghazvin\\") is the largest city and capital of the Province of Qazvin in Iran. Qazvin was an ancient capital in the Persian Empire and nowadays is known as the calligraphy capital of Iran. It is famous for its Baghlava, carpet patterns, poets, political newspaper and pahlavi (Middle Persian) influence on its accent. At the 2011 census, its population was 381,598. - Fars Province (\\"Ostn-e Frs\\") also known as Pars or Persia in historical context, is one of the thirty-one provinces of Iran and known as the cultural capital of Iran. It is in the south of the country, in Iran's Region 2, and its administrative center is Shiraz. It has an area of 122,400 km². In 2011, this province had a population of 4.6 million people, of which 67.6% were registered as urban dwellers (urban/suburbs), 32.1% villagers (small town/rural), and 0.3% nomad tribes. The etymology of the word \\"Persian\\" (From Latin \\"Persia\\", from Ancient Greek (Persis)), found in many ancient names associated with Iran, is derived from the historical importance of this region. Fars Province is the original homeland of the Persian people. - Nezam od - Din Ubeydollah Zâkâni ( Persian : ) , or simply Ubayd - i Zkni ( Persian : c. 1300 -- 1371 CE ) , was a Persian poet and satirist of the 14th century ( Mongol Period ) from the city of Qazvin . He studied in Shiraz , Iran under the best masters of his day , but eventually moved back to his native town of Qazvin . He however preferred Shiraz to Qazvin , as he was a court poet in Shiraz for Shah Abu Ishaq , where a young Hafez was present as well . His work is noted for its satire and obscene verses , often political or bawdy , and often cited in debates involving homosexual practices . He wrote the Resaleh - ye Delgosha , as well as Akhlaq al - Ashraf ( \`\` Ethics of the Aristocracy '' ) and the famous humorous fable Masnavi Mush - O - Gorbeh ( Mouse and Cat ) , which was a political satire . His non-satirical serious classical verses have also been regarded as very well written , in league with the other great works of Persian literature . He is one of the most remarkable poets , satirists and social critics of Iran ( Persia ) , whose works have not received proper attention in the past . His books are translated into Russian , Danish , Italian , English , and German ( by Joachim Wohlleben , 2009 : seemingly the first translation of the complete work into a Western language ) . - The Old Persian language is one of the two directly attested Old Iranian languages (the other being Avestan). Old Persian appears primarily in the inscriptions, clay tablets, and seals of the Achaemenid era (c. 600 BCE to 300 BCE). Examples of Old Persian have been found in what is now present-day Iran, Romania (Gherla), Armenia, Bahrain, Iraq, Turkey and Egypt, the most important attestation by far being the contents of the Behistun Inscription (dated to 525 BCE). Recent research into the vast Persepolis Fortification Archive at the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago have unearthed Old Persian tablets (2007). This new text shows that the Old Persian language was a written language in use for practical recording and not only for royal display. - Shah (pronounced , \\"king\\") is a title given to the emperors, kings, princes and lords of Iran (historically also known as Persia). It was also adopted by the kings of Shirvan (a historical Iranian region in Transcaucasia) namely the Shirvanshahs, the rulers and offspring of the Ottoman Empire (in that context spelled as \\"eh\\"), Mughal emperors of the Indian Subcontinent, the Bengal Sultanate, as well as in Georgia and Afghanistan. In Iran (Persia and Greater Persia) the title was continuously used; rather than King in the European sense, each Persian ruler regarded himself as the \\"Šhanšh\\" (King of Kings) or Emperor of the Persian Empire. - Middle Persian is the Middle Iranian language or ethnolect of southwestern Iran that during the Sasanian Empire (224654) became a prestige dialect and so came to be spoken in other regions of the empire as well. Middle Persian is classified as a Western Iranian language. It descends from Old Persian and is the linguistic ancestor of Modern Persian. - Persian literature is one of the world's oldest literatures. It spans two-and-a-half millennia, though much of the pre-Islamic material has been lost. Its sources have been within Greater Iran including present-day Iran, Iraq, the Caucasus, and Turkey, regions of Central and South Asia where the Persian language has historically been either the native or official language. For instance, Rumi, one of best-loved Persian poets, born in Balkh or Vakhsh (in what is now Afghanistan), wrote in Persian, and lived in Konya, then the capital of the Seljuks in Anatolia. The Ghaznavids conquered large territories in Central and South Asia and adopted Persian as their court language. There is thus Persian literature from Iran, Mesopotamia, Azerbaijan, the wider Caucasus, Turkey, western parts of Pakistan, India, Tajikistan and other parts of Central Asia. Not all Persian literature is written in Persian, as some consider works written by ethnic Persians in other languages, such as Greek and Arabic, to be included. At the same time, not all literature written in Persian is written by ethnic Persians or Iranians, as Turkic, Caucasian, and Indic poets and writers have also used the Persian language in the environment of Persianate cultures.

The current increases exponentially as the junction forward voltage is increased. The values given in the table are typical for a current of 1 mA (the same values apply to semiconductor diodes). The lower the junction forward voltage the better, as this means that less power is required to \\"drive\\" the transistor. The junction forward voltage for a given current decreases with increase in temperature. For a typical silicon junction the change is −2.1 mV/°C. In some circuits special compensating elements (sensistors) must be used to compensate for such changes. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What is the ideal junction forward voltage?","completion":"The ideal junction forward voltage depends on the specific application and the type of transistor being used. However, in general, a lower junction forward voltage is considered better, as it requires less power to drive the transistor, improving overall efficiency and reducing power consumption. For silicon-based bipolar junction transistors (BJTs), the typical forward voltage at the emitter-base junction is around 0.7 V. This value is considered a good balance between providing adequate power to drive the transistor and minimizing power dissipation. However, for other types of transistors or materials used, the junction forward voltage may be different. It is important to note that the junction forward voltage is not a constant value, and its value varies depending on the device's operating temperature. An increase in temperature will result in a decrease in the junction forward voltage, at a rate of approximately -2.1 mV/°C for silicon junctions. This temperature dependence may need to be taken into account in certain applications and compensated with the use of specialized components such as sensistors. To sum up, the ideal junction forward voltage is application-dependent and should be chosen to optimize the performance of the transistor while minimizing power consumption. For typical silicon BJTs, a value of around 0.7 V is commonly used, while other materials or specific use cases may call for different values."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Global Positioning Systems (GPS) are now a part of everyday driving in many counties.These satellite-based systems provide turn-by-turn directions to help people get to where they want to go. But, they can also cause a lot of problems, send you to the wrong place or leave you completely lost. Many times, the driver is to blame. Sometimes a GPS error is responsible. Most often, says Barry Brown, it is a combination of the two. Barry Brown is with the Mobile Life Centre in Stockholm, Sweden. The center studies human-computer interaction, or HCI, especially communications involving wireless devices. He told us about an incident involving a friend who had flown to an airport in the eastern United States. There he borrowed a GPS-equipped car to use during his stay. \\"And they just plugged in an address and then set off to their destination. And, then it wasn't until they were driving for thirty minutes until they realized they actually put in a destination back on the West Coast where they lived. They actually put their home address in. So again, the GPS is kind of 'garbage in garbage out'.\\" Mr. Brown says this is a common human error. But, he says, what makes the problem worse has to do with some of the shortcomings, or failures, of GPS equipment. \\"One problem with a lot of the GPS units is they have a very small screen and they just tell you the next turn. Because they just give you the next turn, sometimes that means that it is not really giving you the overview that you would need to know that it's going to the wrong place.\\" Question: In most cases, driving to wrong places or being lost is caused by _ . - the driver - GPS - the driver and GPS - strange places","completion":"In most cases, driving to wrong places or being lost is caused by the driver and GPS."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What happened to the college after hostile British forces threatened to raze it? Context: Serious American students of theology and divinity, particularly in New England, regarded Hebrew as a classical language, along with Greek and Latin, and essential for study of the Old Testament in the original words. The Reverend Ezra Stiles, president of the College from 1778 to 1795, brought with him his interest in the Hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient Biblical texts in their original language (as was common in other schools), requiring all freshmen to study Hebrew (in contrast to Harvard, where only upperclassmen were required to study the language) and is responsible for the Hebrew phrase אורים ותמים (Urim and Thummim) on the Yale seal. Stiles' greatest challenge occurred in July 1779 when hostile British forces occupied New Haven and threatened to raze the College. However, Yale graduate Edmund Fanning, Secretary to the British General in command of the occupation, interceded and the College was saved. Fanning later was granted an honorary degree LL.D., at 1803, for his efforts.

He always complains about how fast things have changed, and he often says that life was better in the past than today. Now cities are full of cars. Some families even have two or more cars, so parking is becoming a big problem. The traffic in some cities is very bad. Some car drivers drive too fast, so there are more traffic accidents.

Some sports historians believe that the game of soccer began in England in the third century, however. They say that early English warriors kicked around the head of a killed enemy. This may or may not be true, but it is certain that soccer is an ancient sport. Without doubt, the English played soccer during the times of King Edward I in the 1300s. In fact, the king passed a law against playing it. The law said, \\"There is great noise ... caused by kicking large balls from which many ghosts may appear.\\" Anyone caught playing soccer at that time was put into prison. Two hundred years later, Queen Elizabeth I still had people put into prison for playing this \\" _ \\" sport. Although there were such laws, soccer grew more popular. In 1681 it became an official sport in England. By the 1800s, people throughout the country played soccer. By the 18th century, upper-class boys played it at schools. Its popularity grew among all English people. At a meeting held in an English school in 1843, the first rules were suggested. In 1863 the heads of English soccer teams met in London to agree on some official rules. They organized an English football association . By 1871 all of the English clubs were following these rules. Today all soccer teams play by them. Soccer is called \\"football\\" everywhere but in the United States. The game is played mostly with feet. No players except the goalie ( ) may touch the ball with their hands. They may control the ball with any part of the body except their hands. Soccer is by far the world's most popular sport.

The term \\"Moors\\" refers primarily to the Muslim inhabitants of the Maghreb, the Iberian Peninsula, Sicily, and Malta during the Middle Ages. The Moors initially were the Berber autochthones of the Maghreb. The name was later also applied to Arabs. Moors are not a distinct or self-defined people, and the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica observed that \\"The term 'Moors' has no real ethnological value.\\" The first Muslim conquest of Sicily began in 827, though it was not until 902 that almost the entire island was in the control of the Aghlabids, with the exception of some minor strongholds in the rugged interior. During that period some parts of southern Italy fell under Muslim control, most notably the port city of Bari, which formed the Emirate of Bari from 847-871. In 909 the Aghlabid dynasty was replaced by Shiite Fatimids. Four years later, the Fatimid governor was ousted from Palermo when the island declared its independence under Emir Ahmed ibn-Kohrob. The language spoken in Sicily under Muslim rule was Siculo-Arabic. In 1038, a Byzantine army under George Maniaces crossed the strait of Messina. This army included a corps of Normans that saved the situation in the first clash against the Muslims from Messina. After another decisive victory in the summer of 1040, Maniaces halted his march to lay siege to Syracuse. Despite his success, Maniaces was removed from his position, and the subsequent Muslim counter-offensive reconquered all the cities captured by the Byzantines. The Norman Robert Guiscard, son of Tancred, invaded Sicily in 1060. The island was split between three Arab emirs, and the Christian population in many parts of the island rose up against the ruling Muslims. One year later, Messina fell, and in 1072 Palermo was taken by the Normans. The loss of the cities, each with a splendid harbor, dealt a severe blow to Muslim power on the island. Eventually all of Sicily was taken. In 1091, Noto in the southern tip of Sicily and the island of Malta, the last Arab strongholds, fell to the Christians. Islamic authors noted the tolerance of the Norman kings of Sicily. Ibn al-Athir wrote: \\"They [the Muslims] were treated kindly, and they were protected, even against the Franks. Because of that, they had great love for King Roger.\\" The Muslim problem characterized Hohenstaufen rule in Sicily under Holy Roman Emperors Henry VI and his son Frederick II. Many repressive measures were introduced by Frederick II to please the popes, who were intolerant of Islam in the heart of Christendom. This resulted in a rebellion by Sicilian Muslims, which in turn triggered organized resistance and systematic reprisals and marked the final chapter of Islam in Sicily. The complete eviction of Muslims and the annihilation of Islam in Sicily was completed by the late 1240s when the final deportations to Lucera took place.

Life seemed pretty normal and well-balanced for Emily, but little did she know she was the mysterious subject of an intense and twisted lesbian obsession by a woman named Andrea Glassen. Andrea had been covertly monitoring Emily's life from a distance, becoming deeply infatuated with her, and was now intent on not only making Emily aware of Andrea’s unwavering love, but making Emily hers - no matter the cost.

Emily, unaware of the danger lurking behind the friendly face of the taxi driver, went about her life as usual, making use of the taxi services provided by Andrea’s accomplice. The taxi driver, after successfully gaining Emily’s trust, presented her with what appeared to be an innocent recording. Unassuming, Emily took the recording not realizing the dangerous and intimate information stored within. This recording had been crafted by Andrea with the purpose of controlling Emily and melding her into Andrea's fantasy. With the carefully planned unfolding of events, Andrea's motives and obsession began to reveal themselves to the authorities. When Emily realized the sinister truth behind the recording, she sought help from the police. To her surprise, they advised her that she needed to get back into that same taxi. This was a ploy by the police to draw Andrea out of hiding and ultimately expose her malicious intentions. Emily, frightened but determined, followed the advice of the authorities and reluctantly reentered the taxi. As the taxi approached its destination, the police, who had been working this case behind the scenes, moved in. With swift precision, they apprehended Andrea Glassen before she could ensnare Emily in her web of obsession and terror. Although it seemed like an impossible task, Emily, now safe and sound, tried to pick up the shattered pieces of her life and move on with newfound strength and resilience. From that moment on, Emily knew she had narrowly escaped a fate too horrid to imagine. She was grateful for the swift response and the support she received from the authorities. Perhaps most importantly, she had learned the importance of remaining vigilant and adaptive in a world filled with unexpected danger. As Emily began to heal and reclaim the pieces of her life, she deeply understood that even in the darkest of times, there were people looking out for her and a light at the end of the tunnel."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The first description, \\"A girl wearing glasses and a brown plaid long-sleeved shirt holds a cup and looks through a book with people photographs and text,\\" provides us with a detailed and vivid image of a girl engaged in a particular activity. The statement indicates that the girl is wearing glasses and a brown plaid long-sleeved shirt, which gives us information about her appearance. Furthermore, the statement also describes her action of holding a cup while looking through a book containing photographs and text. This implies the girl's likely interest in the book's content, as well as her potential engagement in a leisurely or educational pursuit. On the other hand, the statement \\"A guy is drinking at a table.\\" provides a different scene. We are given a more straightforward description of a male individual who is drinking (most likely a beverage) at a table. This provides us with minimal information about the guy's appearance, and reveals nothing about his surroundings, thoughts, or other actions he may be engaged in while drinking. It is a single, self-contained statement that has no apparent relation to the first description. Given the lack of any common elements between the two statements, we cannot conclude that the scenario involving the girl wearing glasses and looking through a book, as described in the first statement, has any link or connection to the scenario involving a guy drinking at a table, as mentioned in the second statement. The two situations are independent of one another and would require additional context and information to establish any potential connection or conclusions between them. As a result, it is not possible to derive the description of the girl wearing glasses and looking through a book based solely on the information provided in the statement about the guy drinking at a table."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Walter Bruce Willis was born on March 19, 1955, in the town of Idar-Oberstein, West Germany. His father, David Willis, was an American soldier. His mother, Marlene, was German, born in Kassel. Willis is the oldest of four children with a sister named Florence and two brothers, Robert (who is deceased) and David. Context: Throughout his film career, Willis has depicted several military characters in films such as In Country, The Siege, Hart's War, Tears of the Sun, Grindhouse, and G.I. Joe: Retaliation. Growing up in a military family, Willis has publicly sold Girl Scout cookies for the United States armed forces. In 2002, Willis's then 8-year-old daughter, Tallulah, suggested that he purchase Girl Scout cookies to send to troops. Willis purchased 12,000 boxes of cookies, and they were distributed to sailors aboard USS John F. Kennedy and other troops stationed throughout the Middle East at the time. In 2003, Willis visited Iraq as part of the USO tour, singing to the troops with his band, The Accelerators. Willis considered joining the military to help fight the second Iraq war, but was deterred by his age. It was believed he offered 1 million to any noncombatant who turns in terrorist leaders Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi; in the June 2007 issue of Vanity Fair, however, he clarified that the statement was made hypothetically and not meant to be taken literally. Willis has also criticized the media for its coverage of the war, complaining that the press were more likely to focus on the negative aspects of the war: I went to Iraq because what I saw when I was over there was soldiers--young kids for the most part--helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get hospitals open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't hear any of that on the news. You hear, 'X number of people were killed today,' which I think does a huge disservice. It's like spitting on these young men and women who are over there fighting to help this country. Willis stated in 2005 that he wanted to \\"make a pro-war film in which American soldiers will be depicted as brave fighters for freedom and democracy.\\" The film would follow members of Deuce Four, the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry, who spent considerable time in Mosul and were decorated heavily for it. The film is to be based on the writings of blogger Michael Yon, a former United States Army Special Forces soldier who was embedded with Deuce Four and sent regular dispatches about their activities. Willis described the plot of the film as \\"these guys who do what they are asked for very little money to defend and fight for what they consider to be freedom.\\" Question: What else is interesting in this section?. Whats the answer?","completion":"In this section, apart from the brief background on Bruce Willis and his connection to the military through his family, there are several interesting points: 1.

He visited Iraq in 2003 as part of the USO tour, performing for the troops with his band, The Accelerators. 3. Although he considered joining the military to fight in the second Iraq war, his age deterred him from doing so. 4. There was confusion regarding his supposed 1 million bounty offer for terrorist leaders, which he later clarified as a hypothetical statement. 5. Willis criticized the media's portrayal of the war, accusing them of focusing mainly on negative aspects and ignoring the good deeds carried out by American soldiers. 6.

Once you've mastered the fundamentals of safe night driving, the experience can actually be a fun, relaxing one, especially if you make the most of entertaining opportunities that also help you drive safely. For instance, if you have a passenger in the car with you while you're driving at night, you may want to partially engage yourself in a light conversation with him or her. Talking to other people is a great way to stave off driving fatigue, and the calm, pitch-black surroundings can often encourage surprisingly intimate conversations. Be sure, however, not to engage yourself too heavily in the conversation. Getting into a heated argument, for example, can distract you from the most important task at hand — driving safely. Driving at night can be a fantastic time to listen to your favorite music on your car's stereo. The relative quiet and calm of night driving makes it easier to hear a song's minor details, making good music especially enjoyable. Some people prefer to listen to slick disco or electronica cuts at night, while others appreciate the thrill of hard rock tracks. There's no \\"right\\" type of music to listen to at night — it's up to you! Below are just a few great night driving tracks from several different genres (there are many, many more): Kavinsky - \\"Nightcall\\" Chromatics - \\"Back From the Grave\\" DJ Shadow - \\"Midnight in a Perfect World\\" Kyuss - \\"Gardenia\\" Allan Kingdom - \\"Evergreens\\" Golden Earring - \\"Radar love\\" Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick, and Tich - \\"Hold Tight\\" Quiet Riot - \\"Party All Night\\" Daft Punk - \\"Contact\\" Charles Mingus - \\"Moanin'\\" Driving at night can sometimes be a way to come into contact with people and things that you wouldn't otherwise see! For instance, most major city centers truly \\"come to life\\" at night and bustle with unique characters enjoying the night life. Even rural areas can have their share of unique late-night \\"flavor\\". Every stretch of road is different, so keep your eyes peeled for attractions as you drive — if you're taking lots of breaks to fight night-driving fatigue, you should have ample opportunities to stop. Below are just a few things you may want to look out for: Late-night diners/hang-outs Bars and nightclubs (note: avoid drinking and driving, especially at night) Truck stops/rest areas Scenic paths and overlooks Camp grounds Drive-in attractions (theaters, restaurants, etc.) Driving at night can be an experience like no other. With the calm, steady hum of the engine and the darkness of your surroundings, driving can be almost like flying through space. Driving at night feels mysterious, fun, and even exciting — for some people, it's one of life's simplest yet most addictive joys. It's perfectly fine to enjoy a good night drive, but don't forget to focus on what's most important of all — your safety and the safety of other drivers. Always remember that getting distracted while driving can be deadly (especially at night), so keep your attention on the road. If you're confident in your safe driving habits, you'll be able to responsibly relax, tune in, and enjoy your ride!","completion":"Mastering safe night driving can lead to a fun and relaxing experience, enhanced by engaging in light conversations with passengers, listening to your favorite music, and exploring unique late-night attractions while maintaining focus on safety and avoiding distractions."},{"prompt":"Question: \\"How do the trials occur?\\" Context: \\"In the United States, new pharmaceutical products must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as being both safe and effective.

The ambiance of 'The Gourmet Haven' is nothing short of marvelous. The tasteful décor – a harmonious blend of contemporary chic and traditional charm – emanates an aura of sophistication and romance, providing the perfect backdrop for any special occasion or a memorable dining experience. As we perused the meticulously curated menu, which showcased a fusion of exotic and classic dishes, our knowledgeable server offered invaluable suggestions that catered to our palates and preferences, making our decision-making process enjoyable and effortless. We commenced our gastronomic adventure with a heavenly assortment of appetizers, including the tantalizing shrimp and avocado tartare, the crisp arugula and pear salad adorned with candied walnuts and blue cheese, and the melt-in-your-mouth chicken and mushroom stuffed puff pastries. It was evident from these stunning starters that the chef's culinary prowess knows no bounds as each dish was immaculately presented and packed with an explosion of flavors. For our entrees, we opted for the succulent pan-seared Chilean sea bass, served on a bed of creamy risotto with a tangy lemon-herb sauce, as well as the mouthwatering filet mignon, impeccably cooked to medium-rare perfection, accompanied by a rich, velvety red wine reduction. It was undeniably apparent that every dish was prepared with exceptional skill and meticulous attention to detail. The pièce de résistance, however, was the outstanding dessert – a decadent chocolate lava cake with a gooey, molten core, perfectly complemented by a luscious raspberry coulis and a velvety scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. This treat was a true testament to the chef's expertise, as it flawlessly concluded our exquisite dining experience. Throughout the evening, the service at 'The Gourmet Haven' remained impeccably attentive and thoughtful. The staff demonstrated a genuine passion and commitment to providing an extraordinary dining experience, which elevated our visit from great to truly unforgettable.

When Cardinal Richelieu discovers that the queen had sent valuable diamonds to the Duke of Buckingham in England, a country enemy of France, the cardinal uses the information to blackmail the queen and create a difficult situation between her and King Louis, who now believes his wife to be in love with the Duke of Buckingham. Nobody knows that the diamonds are in possession of an old woman, Milady, who had stolen the diamonds from the duke and had brought them for Rochefort so that they would be nowhere to be found; Rochefort allows her to hold on to the diamonds in order to ensure this.

Article: Image caption Breivik admits killing all 77 victims, but denies criminal responsibility Anders Behring Breivik called the police to surrender, but then decided to carry on killing \\"till I die\\" when they failed to return his call, he has told his trial in Oslo. He said his plan was to kill as many people as possible. But he said he had tried to spare some of the young people caught up in the killings on Utoeya island who he thought were under 16. Breivik has admitted the Oslo bombing and island shootings that killed 77. The trial will decide whether he is sane. A state psychiatric commission requested further clarification on the second of two psychiatric reports, which concluded he was sane and accountable for his actions. The first report found him legally insane. Breivik said he would do \\"anything to prevent\\" committal to a psychiatric hospital. Earlier, he said he had \\"lost absolutely everything\\" on 22 July 2011, all his family and friends, therefore he understood the loss he imposed on others. But he said the killings were \\"a small barbarian act to prevent a larger barbarian act\\". In July last year, Breivik set off a car bomb near government buildings in Oslo, killing eight, and then massacred 69 participants in a Labour Party youth camp on the nearby island of Utoeya. 'Not sorry' At the scene Anders Behring Breivik apologised for the first time in court on Monday - but not to those he killed, nor the hundreds he injured in his twin attacks. He said he was sorry for those injured in his bomb attack on Oslo government buildings whom he deemed not to be part of what he called Norway's ruling elite. He also said he understood perfectly well the suffering he had caused for those he injured and the families of the ones he killed. Yet to those gathered here to listen, his words most certainly rang hollow. Breivik has been speaking with the same visible lack of empathy he has shown throughout this trial, and he also repeated on Monday he would have done the same again and again. As he continued to describe the events on Utoeya island, Breivik told the court he had made an impromptu call to police with the intention of surrendering. But the police did not call him back, he said. He added that he was thinking: \\"I will carry on until I die.\\" Breivik apologised to those he did not define as his enemies. He also said he did not kill \\"many\\" under the age of 16 and chose not to shoot three people because they appeared to be minors. But he maintained he was not sorry for killing 77 and injuring hundreds of others in the twin attacks last year. And he described walking through the bodies lying on the ground, meticulously shooting each one again to ensure they were dead. For the first time, Breivik apologised not to those he killed, but to some of those he injured in the bomb attack on Oslo government buildings, whom he considered not to represent his self-defined enemy. Later, he said he would have carried out the attacks again \\"even knowing that 40% of the people on Utoeya were under 18 years old\\". He added there were many others in Norway \\"who deserve to be executed, eg journalists and members of parliament\\". During his five days of giving evidence, Anders Behring Breivik has usually answered questions from both prosecution and defence in a polite manner, reports Lars Bevanger in Oslo. On Monday, however, he appeared defiant on several occasions, especially when the prosecution team asked him about details of his so-called manifesto. He repeatedly interrupted and said they were out to \\"ridicule\\" him. Breivik said he understood his actions would lead to sympathy for the Labour party, but believed that sympathy could be eroded in two to three years. He again drew comparisons to al-Qaeda, arguing the Madrid train attacks in 2004 led to a change of government and the pull-out from Afghanistan. \\"Militant nationalists have a lot to learn from [al-Qaeda],\\" he told the court. Planned video Image caption Breivik's second target was a Labour Party summer youth camp on Utoeya In his other evidence on Monday, Breivik said he: believed political leaders would be \\"emotionally unstable\\" and would instruct police to execute him after his arrest at Utoeya told police he believed his family might be executed after his actions considered at one stage stealing a small plane from a nearby airfield to flee after his actions planned to make a video recording of himself decapitating former PM Gro Harlem Brundtland while reading a prepared text spelling out her \\"crimes\\" repeatedly replied \\"no comment\\" to any questions about other members of an anti-Muslim network called the Knights Templar, which Breivik says he belongs to. Although several organisations use that name, prosecutors believe Mr Breivik's group does not exist Breivik denies criminal responsibility for killing the 77 victims, saying he was defending Norway from multiculturalism. He said he had envisaged the most important attack as being the Oslo bombing, but Utoeya \\"became the most important attack when the government building did not collapse\\" as planned. Depending on whether he is found sane or not, he faces either prison or committal to a psychiatric institution. Breivik himself maintains he is sane, but a practitioner of political extremism. Breivik has been allocated five days in total to give evidence, with the entire proceedings expected to last 10 weeks. Monday was expected to be his last day of evidence, but he may return to the stand on Wednesday when his psychological state is discussed. ||||| OSLO — Anders Behring Breivik , the self-described anti-Islamic militant who admitted killing 77 people in a bombing and shooting rampage last summer, sought Monday to include himself among the victims, telling a court that he was able to undertake the “gruesome” murders of scores of youths because they were “necessary” and telling bereaved families that he too had paid a high price. Describing how he stalked and executed teenagers attending a political youth camp on the wooded island of Utoya, Mr. Breivik, 33, said: “I have never experienced anything so gruesome. It was probably even more horrendous for those I was hunting. But it was necessary. Yes, it was necessary. The July 22 operation was necessary.” “When people say they have lost their most beloved, I also lost my entire family, I lost my friends,” he also said. “It was my choice. I sacrificed them, but I lost my entire family and friends on 22 July. I lost everything. So to a certain extent, I understand.” Monday was the last scheduled day of testimony from Mr. Breivik, who maintains that he acted out of a dedication to fight political acceptance of the “Islamic colonization of Norway.” The court will now begin to hear from witnesses of the shootings on Utoya, which left a total of 69 people dead, and a bomb blast in central Oslo that killed eight more people. With his guilt already established, the trial centers on the question of whether Mr. Breivik was insane at the time of the killings. Two psychiatric reviews have come down on opposite sides of the question. He insists that he was sane, and that efforts to portray him otherwise are part of a campaign to discredit his fight against Muslim immigration. If he is found to have been sane, the presiding judges can sentence him to up to 21 years in prison, with a provision to keep him behind bars longer if he is still considered dangerous. If he is found to have been insane, Mr. Breivik can be kept in forced psychiatric care. Two contradictory psychiatric reports have already been handed to the court, but the final decision will be in the hands of the two professional and three lay judges at the trial. “This case is very simply that I am not a psychotic case and I am sane,” Mr. Breivik told the court on Friday. “I understand that when you see something too extreme, you might think it is irrational and insane. But you must separate political extremism from insanity.” ||||| OSLO (Reuters) - The Norwegian who massacred 77 people to protest against Muslim immigration to Europe said on Monday he had hoped to kill as many as 150 and kept on killing because police failed to respond urgently to his phone call. Breivik has given a detailed account of his car bomb attack at government headquarters in Oslo on July 22, which killed eight people, followed hours later by his shooting of 69 people, mostly teenagers, at a Labour Party island camp. He said on Monday his \\"gruesome\\" actions were to prevent a civil war caused, he said, by a Muslim takeover of Europe. \\"This was a minor barbarity to prevent a larger one\\", he said on the sixth day of a trial that has transfixed Norway. \\"I've never ever experienced such a horrendous ... gruesome act as this. But it was necessary,\\" Breivik said in his usual tone, lacking emotion. \\"It was much more cruel than I expected.\\" Breivik said he thought that at least another 150 people had drowned in a lake as they fled his gunfire so he called police to surrender, only to find himself forced to leave a message. \\"I said 'call me back when you got the right person',\\" Breivik said. \\"I told myself 'I will continue until the phone rings'. I thought, I will continue until I die. What would I have done, sat by the pier waiting?\\" COLD, MATTER-OF-FACT Breivik has denied criminal guilt, insisting his victims were \\"traitors\\" whose multiculturalist views facilitated what he saw as a de facto Muslim invasion of Europe. Most Norwegians have reacted with horror to his testimony, delivered in a cold, matter-of-fact manner, while there is wide public acceptance of his right as a defendant to give it. Breivik has had almost free rein to issue warnings against immigration and explain how he scoured the Internet for bomb-making information while writing a 1,500-page document declaring himself part of a secretive group that is Europe's answer to al Qaeda - a group the police have said likely does not exist. Breivik said he spared some people, including a 10-year-old boy whose father was his first victim, and a Labour Party activist because he looked right-wing. \\"Some people have the type of look that is associated with the leftist movement,\\" Breivik said. \\"This person, (Adrian) Pracon appeared right-wing, that was his appearance. That's the reason I didn't fire any shots at him,\\" said Breivik, 33, whose sanity or lack of it is a prime issue to be determined in the trial. The 22-year-old Labour party youth wing activist earlier told Reuters: \\"I remember him pointing the gun at me for quite a long time before he took it down, turned and walked away.\\" Breivik told how he used a fake police uniform to trick people into coming out of hiding and then shot them at close range. \\"I started with ‘have you seen him, do you know where the shots came from?' ... then I said ‘there's a rescue boat that's going to take you to safety but you need to come out',\\" he said. FIRST APOLOGY Later in the rampage, which lasted more than an hour, Breivik came upon Pracon again as he played dead, and this time shot the son of Polish immigrants through the shoulder. He said he spared the boy's life because \\"I could not understand what such a little boy was doing at a political indoctrination camp.\\" But he said he had no qualms about killing teenagers. His victims were as young as 14. \\"They were not children, under the legal definition only under 14 are children ... they were political activists,\\" he said. Breivik issued his first seeming apology, to innocent bystanders hurt or killed when his 950-kg fertilizer bomb went off in Oslo. More than 200 were injured. \\"To all of those ... I want to say I am deeply sorry for what happened,\\" he said. \\"But what happened, happened.\\" Ahead of the trial, which is expected to last 10 weeks, one court-appointed team of psychiatrists concluded that Breivik was psychotic while a second found him mentally capable. If Breivik is deemed sane, as he hopes to be, he could face a 21-year prison sentence with indefinite extensions for as long as he is considered dangerous. (Editing by Janet Lawrence) |||||Summary:","completion":"Anders Behring Breivik, the individual responsible for killing 77 people in Norway in 2011, has admitted to his actions but denies criminal responsibility. During his trial in Oslo, Breivik revealed that his original plan was to kill as many people as possible, but he attempted to spare those he believed to be under 16 years old. The trial's primary focus is to determine Breivik's sanity, as two previous psychiatric evaluations have drawn opposing conclusions. Breivik claims that he is not a \\"psychotic case\\" and that his actions were taken in defense of Norway against multiculturalism. The trial will decide if he will face prison or be committed to a psychiatric institution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Johnston was born on 23 September 1994 in Dumfries, Scotland, the son of Andrew Johnston and Morag Brannock. He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a \\"stunning building among those extraordinary voices\\". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \\"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral. By the time of his participation in Britain's Got Talent, Johnston was head chorister.In September 2008, after his appearance on Britain's Got Talent but before the release of his first album, Johnston embarked on a tour of Norway with the choir, performing at Stavanger Cathedral and Utstein Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir. Johnston features as head chorister on one of the choir's albums, The Choral Music of F.W Wadely, released in November 2008.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What were the first names of the three members that came from Rage Against the Machine? from the following article ? Audioslave was an American rock supergroup formed in Los Angeles in 2001. The four-piece band consisted of Soundgarden lead singer/rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell and Rage Against the Machine members Tom Morello (lead guitar), Tim Commerford (bass/backing vocals), and Brad Wilk (drums). Critics first described Audioslave as a combination of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, but by the band's second album, Out of Exile, it was noted that they had established a separate identity. Audioslave's sound was created by blending 1970s hard rock with 1990s alternative rock. Moreover, Morello incorporated his well-known, unconventional guitar solos into the mix. As with Rage Against the Machine, the band prided themselves on the fact that all sounds on their albums were produced using only guitar, bass, drums, and vocals. In its six years of existence, Audioslave released three albums, received three Grammy nominations, sold more than eight million records worldwide and became the first American rock band to perform an open-air concert in Cuba. Audioslave disbanded in February 2007 when Cornell issued a statement announcing that he was permanently leaving the band \\"due to irresolvable personality conflicts as well as musical differences.\\" The 2007 Rage Against the Machine reunion and tour involving the rest of the band, as well as solo albums released that same year by Morello and Cornell, cemented the supergroup's permanent demise. On January 20, 2017, three days after announcing their reunion, Audioslave performed together for the first time in over a decade at Prophets of Rage's Anti-Inaugural Ball. In the early hours of May 18, 2017, Chris Cornell was found dead in his hotel room in Detroit, at the age of 52, after playing a Soundgarden show.

Jane was 70 years-old, while Jill was 55. They shared many stories. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which friend had a smaller chance of developing Alzheimer’s disease? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Jill, who is 55 years old, has a smaller chance of developing Alzheimer's disease compared to Jane, who is 70 years old. Age is one of the most significant risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, with the likelihood of developing the condition increasing as one gets older. Although age is not the sole determinant of Alzheimer's risk, it is widely known that the probability of developing the disease doubles every five years after the age of 65. By this measure, Jane, being 70 years old, faces a higher risk of Alzheimer's compared to Jill, who is 55. Other factors that can contribute to the risk of developing Alzheimer's include genetics, family history, and lifestyle choices such as smoking, poor diet, lack of exercise, and social isolation. It is important to note that while Jill has a smaller chance of developing Alzheimer's disease when compared to Jane due to their respective ages, both should still take preventative measures to maintain their cognitive health. These measures can include staying mentally and physically active, maintaining a healthy diet, avoiding smoking, and participating in regular social interactions. In conclusion, while both Jill and Jane can take steps to reduce their risk of Alzheimer's disease, Jill, being younger at 55 years old, has a smaller chance of developing the condition compared to her 70-year-old friend, Jane."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Marlin rode low in the saddle, his shoulders curled against the hungry wind. His hat was pulled down tight and his eyes didn't move as he passed the crude shacks at the edge of town. He tied his horse in front of the saloon, unwinding his long body as if a sudden movement might snap it. He turned down the collar of his greatcoat and checked to make sure his big Army Colt was loose in its holster. The saloon door was a single chunk of white pine, still oozing sap, and he had to put his shoulder to it to force it open. The long room inside was quiet, and not much warmer than the street. Clusters of people sat nursing coffee and drinks, talking quietly if they talked at all. Marlin spotted a few farmers the railroad had brought in from Europe: rounded hats, nervous eyes, skin as red as blood. At the far end of the room a half-dozen cowboys turned over cards with patient boredom. Marlin walked up to the bar. \\"Whiskey,\\" he said, and when the drink came he tossed it straight down and felt it pull his lips into a grimace. He nodded for a refill. When he turned to face the room they were all watching him. \\"I'm looking for a man named Kraamer,\\" Marlin said. \\"Anybody here know of him?\\" One of the cowboys turned casually and rang the spittoon with a stream of tobacco juice. Marlin knew the long, thin face from somewhere, the blond hair that fell limply to his shoulders. He smiled at Marlin and showed his brown-stained teeth.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Upstate New York is the portion of the American state of New York lying north of New York City. The region includes most of the state of New York, excluding New York City and its environs, as well as Long Island, though the precise boundary is debated. Upstate New York includes the major cities of Buffalo, Rochester, Albany, and Syracuse. - Raquette Lake is the source of the Raquette River in the Adirondack Mountains of New York State. It is near the community of Raquette Lake, New York. The lake has 99 miles (160 km) of shoreline with pines and mountains bordering the lake. It is located in the towns of Long Lake and Arietta, both in Hamilton County. - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry. - An inholding is privately owned land inside the boundary of a national park, national forest, state park, or similar publicly owned, protected area. In-holdings result from private ownership of lands predating the designation of the park or forest area, or the expansion of the park area to encompass the privately owned property. In the United States, the main causes of inholdings is that all of the Federal land-management agencies were formed over a century after the government sold and issued land grants to private citizens to fund the administration of the United States. When the park system was formed, many of these now-called \\"in-holdings\\" had been in private ownership for generations and not available for sale when the park was formed. Over the last several decades, conservation groups have lobbied the United States Congress to acquire private residences especially within designated wilderness areas, either by direct purchase or via land exchange which trades the inholding for other federal lands located outside of national parks or wilderness areas. - The Adirondack Park is a part of New York's Forest Preserve in Upstate New York, United States. The park's boundary corresponds to the Adirondack Mountains. Unlike most preserves, about 52 per cent of the land is privately owned inholdings heavily regulated by the Adirondack Park Agency. This area contains 102 towns and villages, as well as numerous farms, businesses, and an active timber harvesting industry. The year-round population is 132,000, with 200,000 seasonal residents. The inclusion of human communities makes the park one of the great experiments in conservation in the industrialized world. - The lake's popularity derives from its remoteness, climate and beauty, as well as its notoriety as the location of the murder of Grace Brown in 1906. Alleged ghost sightings and subsequent media attention have added to the allure. - The Adirondack Mountains form a massif in the northeast of Upstate New York in the United States. Its boundaries correspond to the boundaries of Adirondack Park. The mountains form a roughly circular dome, about in diameter and about high. The current relief owes much to glaciation. - The Pigeon Lake Wilderness Area , an Adirondack Park unit of the forest preserve , lies in the town of Webb , Herkimer County , and the towns of Long Lake and Inlet in Hamilton County . It is bounded on the north by Stillwater Reservoir and large blocks of private land in the vicinity of Rose Pond , Shingle Shanty Pond and Upper Sister Lake ; on the east by a private road from Brandreth Lake to North Point and by Raquette Lake ; on the south by private lands along the Uncas Road ; and on the west by the Big Moose Road , private lands near Big Moose Lake , Thirsty Pond , Twitchell Lake , Razorback Pond , and the Remsen to Lake Placid railroad tracks . The terrain consists of low , rolling hills , with the exception of West Mountain near the eastern boundary . There are many brook trout ponds and streams and a considerable expanse of swampland along the courses of Sucker Brook and Beaver Brook . The forest cover runs to mature or near - mature mixed softwoods and hardwoods , with some dense spruce - balsam types near the summit of West Mountain and in the swamplands .

By 1930, Szigeti was established as a major international concert violinist. He performed extensively in Europe, the United States and Asia, and made the acquaintance of many of the era's leading instrumentalists, conductors and composers. In 1939, to escape the war and Nazi persecution of the Jews, Szigeti emigrated with his wife to the United States, where they settled in California. (A year later, Bartók also fled to America, and just two days after his arrival, he and Szigeti played a sonata recital at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.)During the 1930s, 1940s and into the 1950s, Szigeti recorded extensively, leaving a significant legacy. Notable recordings include the above-mentioned Library of Congress sonata recital; the studio recording of Bartók's Contrasts with Benny Goodman on clarinet and the composer at the piano; the violin concertos of Beethoven, Brahms, Mendelssohn, Prokofiev (No. 1) and Bloch under the batons of such conductors as Bruno Walter, Hamilton Harty and Sir Thomas Beecham; and various works by J.S. Bach, Busoni, Corelli, Handel and Mozart. One of his last recordings was of the Six Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin by Bach; although his technique had deteriorated noticeably by that time, the recording is prized for Szigeti's insight and depth of interpretation.In 1950, Szigeti was detained at Ellis Island upon returning from a European concert tour and was held for several days, officially \\"temporarily excluded\\" from the country.

The gate is still visible with the approximately high grooves in the granite stones for the hinges that are used when opening and closing the access .","completion":"While the two sentences convey similar information, the order of details presented and the emphasis on certain elements in each sentence differ, thus altering the meaning slightly. Let's analyze both sentences to understand these variations: 1. \\"The gate is approximately high, with the still visible grooves in the granite stones for the hinges that are used when opening and closing the access.\\" In this sentence, the focus is on the gate itself, specifically its height. The fact that the gate is approximately high (though exact height is not mentioned, which should ideally have been provided for better clarity) is the primary detail. Afterwards, the grooves in the granite stones that are still visible are mentioned, elaborating on their function: housing the hinges used when opening and closing the access. The significance of the grooves is positioned as a secondary element. 2. \\"The gate is still visible with the approximately high grooves in the granite stones for the hinges that are used when opening and closing the access.\\" In contrast, this sentence initially emphasizes the visibility of the gate, suggesting that it can still be seen despite its age or surrounding environment. It then proceeds to describe the grooves, placing them as the prominent feature offering a clue about the gate's height. This suggests that the height of the grooves could be akin to the approximate height of the gate. Consequently, the gate's height appears as a secondary element in relation to the grooves in the granite stones. In summary, while both sentences express similar notions, sentence 1 accentuates the height of the gate and subsequently highlights the grooves' purpose. On the other hand, sentence 2 initially underscores the gate's visibility and puts more focus on the grooves, inferring the approximate height from them."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The wife of the president of Oral Roberts University is denying allegations of improper behavior, saying the claims \\"sicken\\" her. Richard Roberts and wife Lindsay appear on CNN's \\"Larry King Live\\" last week. Lindsay Roberts, in a statement on the university's Web site, said the allegations against her \\"sicken me to my soul. ... I live my life in a morally upright manner and throughout my marriage have never, ever engaged in any sexual behavior with any man outside of my marriage as the accusations imply.\\" The suit, filed earlier this month, has drawn international attention to the private Christian school in Tulsa, Oklahoma, founded by evangelist Oral Roberts, father of university President Richard Roberts. The new allegations come in an amended version of the wrongful termination suit filed by three former professors, who say they lost their jobs after reporting that Roberts and his family lavishly spent school money for personal expenses. The amended lawsuit, filed Friday, also alleges that the university gave a \\"convicted sexual deviant unrestricted access to students\\" while the man acted as a \\"mentor.\\" The lawsuit also claims the university shredded evidence three days after the suit was filed against the school. The school denies both accusations in a statement on its Web site. The new allegations involving Lindsay Roberts come in a section titled \\"Scandal Vulnerability Assessment.\\" It says that photos show her and an underage male smoking at the president's residence and that she \\"spent the night in the ORU guest house with an underage male on nine separate occasions.\\" It also references 29 photos it says show her and an underage male alone in her car, time-stamped after midnight, despite a citywide 10 p.m. curfew for minors not with their parents. The suit does not allege sexual behavior. The suit says Richard Roberts \\"sought approval from stakeholders for moving the underage male into the family residence,\\" and \\"a longtime maintenance employee was summarily fired so that the same underage male companion could have his position.\\" In her statement, Lindsay Roberts denied all the allegations against her in the lawsuit. \\"The part that grieves me the most is that these accusations are being brought forth in so many areas and being seen and heard through the media when the parties suing have continued to say they don't even know if these allegations are true,\\" she said. \\"I believe it's grossly unfair to allow such speculation to be used against me and attached to a lawsuit in which I am not even named as a party.\\" Other allegations in the amended version of the lawsuit are in a section accusing the ORU board of negligence. It says that this past summer, the Board of Regents allowed the president and the school \\"to give a convicted sexual deviant unrestricted access to the students of the university.\\" The man had previously \\"confessed to crimes\\" in courts in Tulsa and the surrounding area and was convicted, the suit says. \\"In one of these convictions, this 'Mentor' for ORU students -- reportedly hired at the direct personal instruction, and under the direct supervision of President Richard Roberts -- confessed to the facts regarding exposing himself to a 15-year-old boy in a school locker room,\\" the suit says. It also says three days after the initial lawsuit was filed on October 2, the board allowed ORU and Roberts to fire the school's financial comptroller after 26 years of service. Within hours, \\"voluminous materials and documents were shredded and destroyed, constituting spoilation of evidence,\\" according to witnesses, the suit says. Beyond the online posting, university officials did not immediately reply to a request for comment Monday by CNN. The suit was filed by John Swails, Tim Brooker and Paulita Brooker, who accuse Richard and Lindsay Roberts of treating school funds like their own bank account, using them for home renovations, expensive vacations and clothes -- allegations the Robertses and the school have previously denied. After complaining to the school's Board of Regents about university spending, two of the professors were fired from their jobs and the third was thrown into conditions \\"so intolerable\\" that he had no choice but to resign, the lawsuit says. One of the firings, the suit says, was also in retaliation for the plaintiff refusing to drop a sexual harassment complaint that one of his subordinates made against an associate provost, who is named as a defendant. The suit calls for actual damages \\"in excess of 10,000\\" and punitive damages also \\"in excess of 10,000\\" for each plaintiff, as well as attorneys' fees, court costs, \\"and any further relief that the court deems just an equitable.\\" In an interview last week on CNN's \\"Larry King Live,\\" before the latest allegations were added to the suit, Richard Roberts called it \\"the most unusual thing I've ever witnessed in my life.\\" Asked whether someone is out to get him, he responded, \\"It sure seems that way.\\" Lindsay Roberts called the allegations \\"preposterous.\\" The three plaintiffs who filed the lawsuit, meanwhile, accuse school officials of making libelous public remarks about them in an effort to discredit the lawsuit. Last week, before the amended suit was filed, the board vowed to hire an auditor to look into \\"allegations made in regards to Oral Roberts University and certain members of the administration,\\" board Chairman George Pearsons said in an October 7 statement posted on the ORU Web site. \\"The Oral Roberts University Board of Regents is committed to operating the institution in accordance with all ethical, legal and moral standards.\\" E-mail to a friend.

Bowser’s first week as mayor has not gone quite as smoothly as planned. On Tuesday, she handled her first snowfall to mixed reviews, and on Thursday evening, she learned that one of the few concrete goals she laid out in her inaugural speech — winning the right to host the 2024 Olympics — would not come to pass. Less than an hour later, she walked into a packed St. Augustine Catholic Church where she might have been brought even further down to earth. The Washington Interfaith Network gathered hundreds of concerned and churchgoing D.C. residents there to recite the group’s long-standing litany of grievances about a city that may be safer and more prosperous but is also less hospitable to seniors and low-income residents. Bowser heard from anonymous residents of the D.C. General shelter for homeless families. She heard from a MetroAccess driver fighting for better wages from the WMATA contractor she works for. And she heard from a Brooklyn minister organizing a national campaign to end handgun violence by pressuring firearms manufacturers. In the past, WIN’s “actions” have included asking elected officials or candidates to make specific pledges to create jobs, support affordable housing, or take action on other issues. On occasion, the group has taken steps to hold officials accountable for those pledges. But Bowser was not asked to make any pledges this time, and she won sustained applause from the crowd after more than 20 minutes of remarks that included lines like this one, responding to WIN’s new focus on gun violence: “You have a mayor who hates guns,” she said. “If it was up to me, we wouldn’t have any handguns in the District of Columbia. I swear to protect the Constitution and what the courts say, but I will do it in the most restrictive way as possible.” Bowser spent more of her speech, however, promising to make good on her campaign pledges of making the city more hospitable to the poor, the old, and the longtime residents who have felt left out by the city’s growth. She pledged to “to listen, to learn and to also to act.” She said, in her first 100 days, she would establish a “public works academy” to prepare D.C. residents without a college education for blue-collar jobs in the District government, as well as for public sector jobs with Metro or D.C. Water. She said she would create a “strike force” to focus on preserving affordable housing units that might be in danger due to expiring federal tax credits or voucher contracts. And she again pledged to commit at least 100 million yearly to affordable housing subsidy programs: “Today, at my first cabinet meeting, I heard one of my budget people say, ‘We’re gonna try to make the mayor look good with her first budget.’ To which I said, ‘Oh, the mayor’s gonna look good.’ So we’re gonna figure out how to get that 100 million.” Bowser closed her remarks with a plea for support. “When it gets tough, and it will, I need you there,” she said. “So when we have to have tough conversations around building transitional housing, tough conversations about closing D.C. General, tough conversations about revitalizing Barry Farm, I need you there.” “I didn’t get elected to warm the seat. And I only got elected for four years — though I’m going to run again,” she said to laughter. “But I know this, I can’t make decisions thinking about the next election, I have to make decisions that I think are right. And that is why I ran for mayor and that is why I need you every step of the way.” Mike DeBonis covers local politics and government for The Washington Post.

Ten nuclear warheads are loaded onto a train and sent to a separate site for dismantling. However, a high-ranking Russian general, Aleksander Kodoroff, has other plans. Along with a rogue tactical unit, he kills all the soldiers onboard the train and then transfers nine of the warheads to another train. He also sets the timer on the one remaining warhead, then switches tracks to send his train out of harm's way and the transport train on a collision course with a passenger train. Inside a mountain tunnel, Kodoroff kills one of his high-ranking lieutenants who'd had reservations about the mission. A few minutes later the trains collide. The thermonuclear warhead goes off moments later, yielding a blast about 500 kilotons in intensity. The explosion immediately garners the attention of the US government.Even though the detonation was staged to look like an accident, White House nuclear expert Dr. Julia Kelly (Kidman) is not convinced: SS-18 warheads can only be detonated deliberately. She believes that terrorists are behind the incident. Her newly assigned military liaison disagrees with her. He is smooth-talking and irreverent US Army Special Forces officer Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Devoe (Clooney), and he is convinced that the crash and the detonation were both staged, to hide the hijacking of the other warheads on board.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Available choices: -- no; -- yes;","completion":"Answer: -- yes; Both questions are essentially inquiring about efficient learning and memorization techniques in order to retain and understand information quickly and effectively. To answer the underlying question, here's a step-by-step approach to learning and memorizing information quickly and effectively: 1. Break down the material: Divide the information into smaller, manageable chunks. This makes it easier to grasp and retain. 2. Repetition with spaced intervals: The more you repeat something, the more likely you are to remember it. But, spacing out the repetitions over time is more effective than repeating something multiple times in quick succession. This is known as the spacing effect, which helps build stronger memory connections. 3. Create associations and connections: Relate new information to something you already know or to a personal experience. This makes the material more meaningful and easier to remember. 4. Use mnemonic devices: Mnemonics are memory aids that may involve acronyms, rhymes, or visual images. They can help you remember complex information by simplifying it into manageable patterns. 5. Teach someone else the material: Explaining a concept to someone else can help solidify your understanding and reveal any gaps in your knowledge. 6. Active engagement: Engage with the material actively by taking notes, asking questions, and discussing concepts with others, which will further improve your retention and understanding of the topic. 7. Test yourself: Practice recalling the information by taking quizzes, tests, or using flashcards. This form of active retrieval practice reinforces the memory and helps identify areas that need more focus. 8. Sufficient sleep and breaks: Sleep and breaks are crucial for consolidating memories and maintaining focus during the learning process. Make sure you give yourself enough time to rest between study sessions and get a good night's sleep. Overall, learning effectively requires a combination of techniques and strategies tailored to your individual needs and preferences. By incorporating these steps into your study routine, you can improve your ability to retain and understand information more quickly and efficiently."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Given the below context: The travel sketchbook became a popular genre beginning about 1905, as the Meiji government promoted travel within Japan to have citizens better know their country. In 1915, publisher Shōzaburō Watanabe introduced the term shin-hanga (\\"new prints\\") to describe a style of prints he published that featured traditional Japanese subject matter and were aimed at foreign and upscale Japanese audiences. Prominent artists included Goyō Hashiguchi, called the \\"Utamaro of the Taishō period\\" for his manner of depicting women; Shinsui Itō, who brought more modern sensibilities to images of women; and Hasui Kawase, who made modern landscapes. Watanabe also published works by non-Japanese artists, an early success of which was a set of Indian- and Japanese-themed prints in 1916 by the English Charles W. Bartlett (1860–1940). Other publishers followed Watanabe's success, and some shin-hanga artists such as Goyō and Hiroshi Yoshida set up studios to publish their own work.Artists of the sōsaku-hanga (\\"creative prints\\") movement took control of every aspect of the printmaking process—design, carving, and printing were by the same pair of hands. Kanae Yamamoto (1882–1946), then a student at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts, is credited with the birth of this approach. In 1904, he produced Fisherman using woodblock printing, a technique until then frowned upon by the Japanese art establishment as old-fashioned and for its association with commercial mass production. The foundation of the Japanese Woodcut Artists' Association in 1918 marks the beginning of this approach as a movement. The movement favoured individuality in its artists, and as such has no dominant themes or styles. Works ranged from the entirely abstract ones of Kōshirō Onchi (1891–1955) to the traditional figurative depictions of Japanese scenes of Un'ichi Hiratsuka (1895–1997). These artists produced prints not because they hoped to reach a mass audience, but as a creative end in itself, and did not restrict their print media to the woodblock of traditional...

Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. Two farms were situated on opposite banks of a large river flowing into the ocean. Hill farm practiced conventional agriculture, while Dew farm practiced permaculture design within the context of organic farming. Which farm generated more marine litter?","completion":"It is likely that Hill farm, which practiced conventional agriculture, generated more marine litter than Dew farm, which practiced permaculture design within the context of organic farming. Conventional agriculture often relies on the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides, which are more prone to runoff into rivers and eventually contribute to marine pollution. The excess nutrients from these chemicals can promote algal blooms, leading to oxygen depletion and the creation of dead zones in marine ecosystems. Additionally, conventional farming practices may result in greater soil erosion and sedimentation, which can further contribute to marine pollution. On the other hand, permaculture design and organic farming practices, like those employed at Dew farm, focus on sustainable and regenerative methods. This includes minimizing external inputs such as synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, reducing soil disturbance, and implementing practices that work with natural systems to improve soil health and prevent erosion. These practices lead to reduced chances of harmful chemicals and sediments entering waterways and the ocean, thus generating less marine litter and pollution in comparison to conventional agriculture methods like those at Hill farm. However, it should be noted that the specific practices at both the Hill farm and Dew farm, as well as the local environment, would play a crucial role in determining the precise comparative impact of the two farms on marine litter generation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This classification is made on the basis that the text is describing a type of vehicle, specifically a car model called 'Toyota Publica' manufactured by the company 'Toyota'. The description tells about the period of manufacture, its concept and its place in the line of Toyota's small cars. It falls under the category 'mean of transportation' as it is a vehicle which was used to move people from one place to another, essentially serving as a mode of transportation. The category 'mean of transportation' covers all different types of vehicles, machines or systems that are used to move people or goods, which in this case is a car, a widely utilized form of transportation around the globe. Other categories provided for classification such as company, animal, building, etc., do not fit the text as it is not describing a corporation, some living entity or a structure but a model of a car. The references made to the automaker 'Toyota' could suggest it may fall under 'company', however, the main subject of the text is the 'Toyota Publica' thus making 'mean of transportation' the most apt categorization."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"A group of people gathering in front of a clothing store.\\", can we conclude \\"A bunch of people are sitting inside a restaurant.\\"?","completion":"No, we cannot conclude that \\"A bunch of people are sitting inside a restaurant\\" based on the information provided about \\"A group of people gathering in front of a clothing store.\\" The two scenarios describe different situations involving groups of people, and there is no direct correlation between the two. In the first scenario, a group of people is gathering in front of a clothing store. This could be for various reasons, such as waiting for the store to open, participating in a promotional event, or just socializing. However, this information alone gives no indication that these people will later go to a restaurant or that they are planning to dine together. On the other hand, the second statement describes a separate situation, where a bunch of people is sitting inside a restaurant. While both situations involve gatherings of people, they are not necessarily linked, as they occur in different locations and settings. Therefore, to draw a conclusion that connects these two scenarios, we would require additional information or context that establishes a clear link between the groups of people and their activities. For example, if we knew that the clothing store and the restaurant were hosting a joint event, and that the people gathering in front of the store were planning to attend the event at the restaurant, then it would be more reasonable to conclude that these people may eventually be sitting inside the restaurant. In summary, based solely on the information provided about the group gathering in front of a clothing store, one cannot conclude that a bunch of people are sitting inside a restaurant.

Belinda Jo Carlisle was born in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California on August 17, 1958 to Harold Carlisle, a gas station employee, and his wife, Joanne (nee Thompson), a homemaker. Her mother met her father, who was twenty years her senior, at age eighteen, and Carlisle was born nine months later. She was named after her mother's favorite film, Johnny Belinda (1948). Carlisle was the first of seven siblings, with three brothers and three sisters. Carlisle's first venture into music was in 1977 as drummer for the punk rock band the Germs, under the name Dottie Danger. She was recruited into the band by Lorna Doom, whom she had met in an art class while a student at Thousand Oaks High School. However, her time in the band was short due to her contracting mononucleosis, and she never recorded or performed live with the Germs. According to Pat Smear, upon quitting, she introduced her friend, Donna Rhia, who became her replacement. Carlisle does appear on one recording introducing the band at a 1977 performance at the Whisky a Go Go, heard on the live album Germicide (1977). Around this time Carlisle did some back-up singing for Black Randy and the Metrosquad. Soon after leaving the Germs, she co-founded The Go-Go's (originally named the Misfits), with friends and fellow musicians Margot Olavarria, Elissa Bello, and Jane Wiedlin. Olavarria and Bello were soon out of the group and the new line-up included bassist-turned-guitarist Charlotte Caffey, guitarist-turned-bassist Kathy Valentine, and drummer Gina Schock. All five women were largely untrained musicians, and Carlisle recalls having to use tape as fret markers during their initial songwriting: \\"[Charlotte] had to show us how to plug in our amps,\\" she said. The Go-Go's would go on to become one of the most successful American bands of the 1980s, helping usher new wave music into popular American radio, and becoming the first all-female band who wrote their own music and played their own instruments to ever achieve a No. 1 album, Beauty and the Beat, which featured the hits \\"We Got the Beat\\" and \\"Our Lips Are Sealed\\". The Go-Go's recorded two more studio albums on I.R.S. Records, including 1982's Vacation, which went gold. \\"Head over Heels\\", from their 1984 album Talk Show, made it to No. 11. In 1984, Carlisle made a foray into acting in the movie Swing Shift, starring alongside Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell. Ask a question about this article.","completion":"Sure, little buddy!

I read this background article the other day: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth: I am facing a new situation today: Two neighboring farms both had depleted soils due to intensive agricultural practices for decades.

A \\"fatberg\\" is what is created when congealed fat and unflushable items (think sanitary napkins, diapers, wipes, the Independent notes) combine in the sewer to create, well, the stuff of nightmares, and a 1940s-era sewer in London has been broken by an 131-foot-long one weighing roughly 11 tons.

Much of the fat comes from used cooking oil, millions of liters of which are poured down drains in London each year. And the wet wipes (which some people are apparently using instead of toilet paper) come from the one in five Londoners who admit to flushing them. \\"I’d urge people to consider what lurks beneath their feet,\\" says the supervisor. \\"When it comes to getting rid of fat, 'bin it—don’t block it.'\\" The whole messy business, including repairs to the sewer, is expected to cost more than 600,000 and take more than two months, with work finishing in May.

This problem was called a \\"fatberg.\\" A fatberg is a yucky mix of fats, oils, and things that should not be flushed down the toilet like diapers, baby wipes, and napkins. These things combine and create a massive, yucky mess underground, and sometimes they can even break a sewer. In this story, a very old sewer from the 1940s got broken by a fatberg that was bigger and heavier than 18 horses, 3 big cars called Hummer H2s, or 77,000 iPhone 6s. It was 131 feet long and weighed about 11 tons! People who had stores and businesses in a fancy part of London called Chelsea started to smell something really bad. So, they called some workers who take care of water and sewers. When the workers looked, they found the huge fatberg. They couldn't believe how big it was! They told people to think about what's underneath their feet when they pour fats, like from cooking, down their drains or flush things that shouldn't be flushed. To fix this big, stinky problem, they had to spend a lot of money (more than 600,000) and work for two whole months. This wasn't the first time this problem happened in London, and it happens in other places too, like the USA.

Here is a list of some simple questions that you can ask your parents to see if they know the answers. Q: Why is the sky blue? A: You probably know white sunlight is made up of seven colors. While it moves in a straight line when going through space, it starts to divide as it hits \\"raised area\\" in the atmosphere. The ones with longest wavelengths pass through easily. The blue , however , can be taken in by the gas molecules because it has a shorter wavelength , which in turn scatters it in different directions. That's why when you look up at the sky, it appears to be blue. Q:Why does the moon sometimes appear during the daytime? A: The simple answer to that is because just like any other object it is being lit by the sun. As long as it is around 45 degrees or even 90 degrees off the sun, it will receive light and be able to be seen. The only time it is not able to be seen during its 28-day orbit around the earth is when it is right between the earth and the sun. That's because its back , which is not lit by the sun, is facing us. Q: Where do birds/ honeybees go in winter? A: While the bird part is quite easy, since a lot of them get together and travel, the honeybee part is likely to puzzle your parents. It turns out that these busy insects stop being that active when the temperature drops below 50degF. Instead ,they get together in the lower central area of the hive and form a ball around their queen. This helps keep both warm enough to survive the cold winter months. The sky looks blue mainly because the color blue in the sunlight _ . A) has the longest wavelength among all the colors B) cannot be taken in by the gas molecules C) doesn't hit \\"raised area\\" in the atmosphere D) cannot pass through space successfully A:","completion":"The sky looks blue mainly because the color blue in the sunlight: B) cannot be taken in by the gas molecules"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which crop would be less beneficial to farmers, crop A or crop B? Dan studied genetic engineering. He was applying his knowledge of genetic engineering to develop better crops. Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop. Hint: In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Crop B would be less beneficial to farmers. This is because crop B is not tolerant of herbicides, which means that applying herbicides to control weeds could also harm the crop itself. In contrast, crop A has been genetically engineered to be herbicide tolerant, allowing it to grow without being harmed by the herbicides used for weed management. The introduction of herbicide-tolerant crops like crop A has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Then, a student named Jack (John Cusack) comes into the whorehouse and is immediately bewitched by Irmy; he insists on having sex with her, paying 700. On the street, Kleinman walks aimlessly around the city. He stops at a coroner's house, where the doctor (Donald Pleasence) explains that his role in the hunt is purely scientific. They each have a glass of sherry. After Kleinman leaves, the doctor is murdered by the Strangler.

Since leaving the show, Lee and Jasmine's relationship has gone from. strength to strength, with the pair recently holidaying together in. Thailand - and putting on some very public displays of affection. With Jasmine parading her perfectly toned physique on the sun-drenched beaches, it comes as no surprise that Casey may have been feeling a little insecure - and now we can reveal that she paid out nearly £700 for a fat-freezing treatment to help her match her love rival in the bikini body stakes. Slimming secret: Celebrity Big Brother star Casey Batchelor showed off her figure in a tiny pink bikini in Marrakesh earlier this week, and now we can reveal the secret behind her trimmed new physique. The 29-year-old model, who was feeling self-conscious about her stomach after putting on nearly a stone in weight during her time in the CBB house, wanted to shed a few inches before her recent trip to Morocco.

Is it true that can a cow give milk without getting pregnant based on the following text? To maintain lactation, a dairy cow must be bred and produce calves. Depending on market conditions, the cow may be bred with a \`\`dairy bull'' or a \`\`beef bull.'' Female calves (heifers) with dairy breeding may be kept as replacement cows for the dairy herd. If a replacement cow turns out to be a substandard producer of milk, she then goes to market and can be slaughtered for beef. Male calves can either be used later as a breeding bull or sold and used for veal or beef. Dairy farmers usually begin breeding or artificially inseminating heifers around 13 months of age. A cow's gestation period is approximately nine months. Newborn calves are removed from their mothers quickly, usually within three days, as the mother/calf bond intensifies over time and delayed separation can cause extreme stress on both cow and calf.","completion":"Based on the given text, it appears that a dairy cow must be bred and produce calves to maintain lactation. Here is the step-by-step reasoning: 1. The text states that \\"to maintain lactation, a dairy cow must be bred and produce calves.\\" This sentence directly suggests that a cow needs to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk consistently. 2. Dairy farmers breed or artificially inseminate heifers around 13 months of age, and a cow's gestation period is approximately nine months. This information further supports the idea that pregnancy is necessary to enable milk production in cows. 3. Newborn calves are removed from their mothers quickly, usually within three days. This fact implies that the presence of a calf is related to the cow's ability to produce milk. From the information provided in the text, it is true that a cow cannot give milk without getting pregnant.

The machine can be controlled from a distance and can he used to do work that is dangerous for human beings. Roho Sally has two long arms with human-like hands. She can use her fingers to pick up small objects .examine them in detail and do most things that human hands can do Each finger contains a tiny motor capable of squeezing 20 pounds of pinch foree ,.enough to defuse a bomb under the direction of an operator. She sits on a metal base with wheels that let her move around. turn in tight spaces and climb over small objects, . Mike McLoughlin is the main investigator for the Applied Physics Laboratory's Prosthetics Program. \\"The purpose of that program is to develop prosthetic arms that have all the capability of your natural arms .and you do all the complex motions that we can do with the natural arm- with the robot. \\" It was a difficult job. Mr. McLoughlin says the device had to have many small motors to. have the ability to do what a human hand does; It also needs to have human-like strength. The thumb was especially difficult because it permits the hand .to hold objects. And everything had. to fit into a space about the size of a human hand. The next problem .he says .was to figure out how to control the artificial hand. \\" So we had to figure out how to make the connection between the brain and this arm. For search-and-rescue duties.Roho Sally will be operated by a human being using a wire- less machine that is far from the robot. The operator will also wear special gloves and glasses. The glasses permit the operator to see the robot's hands .even though they are far away. Mr. McLoughlin says this kind of robots could be used in what he calls \\"dull , dirty or dan- gerous\\" situations where fine human finger movements are required.

Harvard, being one of the most renowned and prestigious educational institutions in the world, offered Stone numerous opportunities and resources that could have propelled his career forward. Yet, he opted to walk away from it all, guided by personal beliefs, convictions, and the pursuit of his dreams. One of the primary reasons for Stone's departure was his dissatisfaction with the conventional educational system. Stone felt that the existing academic structure at Harvard was too rigid, limiting his creativity and restricting his intellectual growth. He found it challenging to thrive in an environment that demanded adherence to a set curriculum and discouraged independent thinking. Stone yearned for an education that was more aligned with his interests and values, which led to his decision to explore alternative learning opportunities outside the confines of Harvard. Another reason driving Stone's choice was the pursuit of his dreams and passions. He believed that by continuing his education at Harvard, he would be sacrificing his ambitions in favor of a more traditional and predictable life trajectory. Leaving the institution allowed Stone to follow his heart, embrace the uncertainty, and embark on a path that was truly his, regardless of societal expectations or the desire for financial success. Moreover, Stone was inspired by several entrepreneurial role models who had also chosen to leave formal education behind in pursuit of their dreams. He admired their courage, tenacity, and success, despite deviating from the path of traditional education. Their stories served as a source of motivation and validation, cementing his decision to take a leap of faith and carve his own path in life. In addition to his disillusionment with the education system and desire to chase his dreams, Stone was also driven by the prospect of learning from real-world experiences. He believed that the knowledge he would gain from life experiences, challenges, and encounters with professionals in his field held more value than the theoretical knowledge imparted within the walls of a university classroom. Stone saw first-hand the impact that hands-on experience could have on his personal growth and development, ultimately deciding that this style of learning was more suited to his inclination and goals. Lastly, Stone's innate desire to challenge the status quo played a significant role in his decision to leave Harvard. He did not want to follow the beaten path and succumb to societal and academic norms. Instead, he was determined to forge his own way and prove that success could be achieved through unconventional means. This drive fueled his decision to leave behind the comfort and prestige of Harvard, taking the first steps in a bold and daring journey that would ultimately shape his future. In conclusion, Stone's choice to leave Harvard was rooted in his dissatisfaction with the traditional educational system and his unwavering determination to pursue his dreams and interests. By leaving the renowned institution, he sought to forge his own path in life, facilitated by real-world experiences and the inspiration from entrepreneurial role models. By challenging conventional norms and expectations, Stone embarked on a life-changing journey filled with growth, discovery, and the pursuit of his true passions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Denials: Physiotherapist Leith Brown, pictured, says Patient A's husband wants to 'ruin' him A hospital physiotherapist had an affair with a married female patient – and the couple spent nights together while the woman’s husband was sleeping in the same house, a disciplinary hearing has heard. Leith Brown could be struck off the professional register if allegations of misconduct are proved. The affair ended when the husband found out about it and confronted senior managers at the private Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth in North London, which has previously treated Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet, Jerry Hall and Kate Moss. Over a period of six months,","completion":"Mr. Brown and Patient A allegedly engaged in a secret relationship, with many of their encounters taking place while her unsuspecting husband slept in another room. The disciplinary hearing conducted by the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) was informed of numerous instances in which Brown was said to have acted inappropriately and breached professional boundaries. Several witnesses, including colleagues and patients, provided testimonies to support the allegations. It was claimed that Brown and Patient A frequently exchanged intimate and overtly flirtatious text messages, some of which were discovered by the husband on his wife's phone. The alleged affair reportedly began when Patient A consulted Brown for treatment after a severe back injury. As the story continues, Mr. Brown denies all accusations and insists that his relationship with Patient A was strictly professional. He claims that the allegations are nothing more than a calculated attempt by the husband to tarnish his reputation and destroy his career. Despite his denials, further evidence from the disciplinary hearing reveals that Brown occasionally visited Patient A's home for private treatment sessions and that they spent a significant amount of time together outside of the hospital, including at local restaurants and pubs. During the course of the hearing, many of Mr. Brown's colleagues express their shock and disappointment at the alleged behavior. Several patients come to his defense, attesting to his professionalism and expert care. These testimonials paint a conflicting picture of Brown as both an exemplary healthcare provider and a seemingly predatory figure who took advantage of a vulnerable patient. In an effort to gain a clearer understanding of the case, the HCPC committee considers the likelihood of Brown's motives and the impact these allegations have on the reputation of the hospital. Given the hospital's high-profile reputation and a roster of celebrity clientele, the case has drawn significant media attention and scrutiny. After a thorough investigation and deliberation, the HCPC committee reaches its conclusion. Mr. Leith Brown is found guilty of the allegations of misconduct, based on the preponderance of evidence provided by witnesses and recovered text messages. In light of the severity of his actions and the breach of trust that occurred between a healthcare provider and their patient, the HCPC decides to strike Mr. Brown off the professional register. This decision effectively ends Mr. Brown's career as a physiotherapist and serves as a stark reminder to other medical professionals of the importance of maintaining appropriate boundaries in their relationships with patients. As the case becomes widely publicized, the hospital of St. John and St. Elizabeth faces a PR crisis, as patients and the public question the institution's professionalism and integrity. In response, senior management implements stricter guidelines for staff when dealing with patients and initiates a comprehensive review of the hospital's policies to ensure that such a breach of trust never occurs again. Meanwhile, Patient A and her husband attempt to rebuild their relationship, grappling with the lasting emotional effects of the affair. They seek therapy in order to mend their trust and find closure from this emotionally charged experience. In the end, the case of Leith Brown underscores the need for healthcare professionals to continually examine their own behavior and maintain the highest level of conduct when caring for others. The consequences, both personally and professionally, can be devastating when that trust is broken."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given the below context: Janet Jackson was born on May 16, 1966 in Gary, Indiana, the youngest of ten children, to Katherine Esther (née Scruse) and Joseph Walter Jackson. The Jacksons were lower-middle class and devout Jehovah's Witnesses, although Jackson would later refrain from organized religion. At a young age, her brothers began performing as the Jackson 5 in the Chicago-Gary area. In March 1969, the group signed a record deal with Motown, and soon had their first number-one hit. The family then moved to the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles. Jackson had initially desired to become a horse racing jockey or entertainment lawyer, with plans to support herself through acting. Despite this, she was anticipated to pursue a career in entertainment, and considered the idea after recording herself in the studio.At age seven, Jackson performed at the MGM Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. A biography revealed her father, Joseph Jackson, was emotionally withdrawn, and told her to address him solely by his first name as a child. She began acting in the variety show The Jacksons in 1976.In 1977, she was selected to have a starring role as Penny Gordon Woods in the sitcom Good Times. She later starred in A New Kind of Family and later got a recurring role on Diff'rent Strokes, portraying Charlene Duprey from seasons three to six. Jackson also played the role of Cleo Hewitt during the fourth season of Fame, but expressed indifference towards the series, largely due to the emotional stress of her secret marriage to R&B singer, James DeBarge. Jackson later elaborated on her time on the show in an interview with Anderson Cooper, revealing that the cast would occasionally play pranks on her, but she spoke fondly of them.When Jackson was sixteen, her father and manager Joseph Jackson, arranged a contract for her with A&M Records. Her debut album, Janet Jackson, was released in 1982. It was produced by Angela Winbush, René Moore, Bobby Watson of Rufus and Leon Sylvers III, and overseen by her father Joseph.

Why?","completion":"Jeff noticed that the Big Dipper was in a different spot in the sky at 2 am than at 10 pm because of the Earth's rotation on its axis. This rotation makes the stars and other celestial objects appear to move across the sky as the night progresses. To help visualize this, it is important to understand the Earth's rotation, the movement of celestial objects, and how our perception of the sky's motion can change based on the time of night. The Earth rotates on its axis approximately once every 24 hours. This rotation is responsible for the cycle of day and night. As the Earth rotates, the side facing the Sun experiences daytime because it is illuminated by sunlight, while the side facing away from the Sun experiences nighttime because it is in the darkness of space. In addition to this rotation, the Earth also revolves around the Sun in an elliptical orbit, once every approximately 365.25 days. This movement is responsible for the change in seasons over the course of a year. As Jeff observed, the stars, including constellations like the Big Dipper, appear to move across the sky during the night. This is due to the Earth's rotation on its axis. As night progresses, the Earth continues to rotate, causing the constellations and other celestial objects to appear to shift positions in the sky. The movement of these objects is not random; rather, they move in a predictable pattern, following circular paths centered on a point known as the celestial pole. There are two celestial poles: the North Celestial Pole is located close to the star Polaris (also known as the North Star) in the Northern Hemisphere, and the South Celestial Pole is located close to the star Sigma Octantis (also known as the South Star) in the Southern Hemisphere. During the night, the stars appear to rotate around these poles as they make their way across the sky. This apparent motion of stars is a direct result of the Earth's rotation, and the speed at which they appear to move is determined by the rate of the Earth's rotation and their distance from the celestial poles. For example, stars that are closer to the celestial poles will appear to move slower and follow smaller circles in the sky, while stars that are further away from the poles will appear to move faster and follow larger circles. The Big Dipper, which is part of the larger constellation Ursa Major, is located relatively close to the North Celestial Pole. Therefore, as the Earth rotates, the Big Dipper will appear to move in a circular path around the pole as it travels across the night sky. In Jeff's case, the change in position of the Big Dipper between 10 pm and 2 am is a result of the Earth's rotation, which caused the constellation to follow its circular path around the North Celestial Pole. As a result, the position of the Big Dipper in the night sky at 2 am will be different than its position at 10 pm. This celestial dance continues throughout the night as the Earth rotates, providing a constant reminder of the intimate connection between our planet's motion and the apparent motion of the stars in the sky."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mother sat down next to Christopher, sensing his confusion and distress. She proceeded to explain that people have different ways of reacting to situations, and sometimes laughter is a natural response that helps them deal with uncomfortable or embarrassing events. She cited an example from her own life, recalling a time when she had tripped and fallen in front of a large crowd while giving a speech. Instead of feeling humiliated, she chose to laugh at herself and continue with her presentation. This allowed the audience to relax and join in her laughter, diffusing any tension in the room. Christopher looked into his mother's eyes and asked, \\"But why would Joel laugh at me when I was hurt? Shouldn't he have helped me up instead?\\" Mother nodded and told Christopher that it was a valid point, but she also pointed out that Joel might have laughed to hide his own worry or discomfort. \\"Often, people use humor as a coping mechanism,\\" she said. \\"Joel may not have been laughing at you, but rather at the situation, and he probably didn't even realize he was doing it.\\" She continued to say that when we encounter moments of embarrassment, it is important to remember that our actions are not always tied to malicious intent. In fact, sometimes laughter can serve as a powerful tool to unite and uplift those around us. Mother explained that it's vital for Christopher to talk to Joel about his feelings and share how his laughter affected him. It could be an opportunity for both of them to understand each other better and strengthen their bond. As Christopher wiped away his tears, he began to see the truth in his mother's words and realized that perhaps Joel's intentions were not as hurtful as he initially thought. He decided to confront Joel about the incident the following day. When Christopher approached Joel during break time at school the next morning, he noticed a sense of unease in Joel's gaze. It was apparent that Joel had been feeling guilty about laughing at his friend's fall. Christopher mustered the courage to discuss his feelings with Joel, and to his surprise, Joel apologized sincerely and admitted that he had only laughed out of shock and nervousness. He had immediately regretted his reaction but didn't know how to make it right. The two friends talked openly about their emotions and how each of them had interpreted the incident. As they conversed, a newfound sense of understanding and empathy grew between them. They realized that moments of vulnerability could sometimes lead to deeper connections when individuals offered explanations and support to each other. In the end, Christopher and Joel not only mended their friendship but also learned an invaluable lesson about communication, empathy, and the power of laughter. They vowed to always be open about their feelings with each other, ensuring that their bond would only become stronger with time. Mother's wisdom had indeed cast a new light on an otherwise hurtful situation, allowing both Christopher and Joel to grow and mature through their experience.

Samantha decides not to use any UV light and instead just uses lotion to help her skin. and a hint : The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D .

(Associated Press) Surrounded by security, an ambulance with former Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon transports him back to his ranch, Havat Hashikmim, or Sycamore Farm near the Negev town of Sderot, southern Israel,... (Associated Press) Medical teams took the former leader, who has been in a coma since early 2006 and is attached to a respirator, from his room in the long-term care unit of a hospital outside Tel Aviv at dawn Friday. Security crews erected screens so he would not be visible when he was wheeled out of the building and into a waiting ambulance. From the hospital, security guards in SUVs escorted the ambulance to Sharon's family ranch in southern Israel. There has been no change reported in Sharon's condition, and the move is the result of modern medical thinking that prefers to see long-term patients treated \\"in the community\\" rather than in hospitals, said Dr. Shlomo Noi, an official from Tel Hashomer Hospital. While Sharon, 82, showed \\"minimal responses,\\" there was no indication he would emerge from the coma, Noi told Israel Radio on Friday. \\"Beyond that, we have only hope,\\" he said. Sharon, a war hero and politician who was for decades one of Israel's most controversial figures, found popularity as prime minister between 2001 and 2006. He led Israel's successful military response to the Palestinian uprising known as the second intifada, all but ending it by 2004. The next year, he reversed his years of hard-line, pro-settlement policies and pulled all of Israel's soldiers and settlers out of the Gaza Strip. That same year he left the hawkish Likud Party, which he helped found, and formed the centrist Kadima, a party designed to be centered largely on his own personality. But only months later, at the age of 77 and considerably overweight, Sharon suffered a series of strokes that left him comatose. Sharon was kept in the long-term care unit at Tel Hashomer Hospital outside Tel Aviv until Friday. Ahead of his transfer, Dr. Zeev Rothstein, the hospital's director, described Sharon's condition as \\"mini-unconsciousness, meaning he is not unconscious but he is not fully conscious.\\" \\"He needs assistance in all daily activities,\\" the doctor told Israel's Channel 10 TV on Thursday. The former prime minister, who has two sons, will be cared for at home by a medical staff. He is expected to be returned to hospital for regular checkups. ||||| A supporter of the Kadima party waves an Israeli flag in front of a poster of former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon at the party's headquarters in Newe Ilan, some 15 km (9 miles) west of Jerusalem, March 28, 2006. JERUSALEM | JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's comatose former prime minister, Ariel Sharon, was moved back to his desert ranch on Friday, leaving the secure hospital ward that has been his home for almost five years, officials said. Sharon, 82, will continue to receive treatment at Sycamore Farm, where as premier he would summon advisers to plan strategies such as Israel's 2002 offensive in the Palestinian West Bank and the surprise 2005 withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Felled by a stroke in January 2006, the ex-general left behind an often jittery Jewish state that has since fought two wars while charting an uncertain course in U.S.-sponsored peace talks with the Palestinians. \\"Today, in 2010, the aspiration of any patient, our aspiration in the hospital, is to ensure that any chronic patient, when possible, is with his community, at home,\\" said Prof Shlomo Noy, director of rehabilitation at the Sheba Medical Center outside Tel Aviv, where Sharon had been receiving care. Asked whether there was any chance of Sharon making a significant recovery -- or even returning to public life, as a few of his loyalists envisage -- Noy told Israel's Army Radio: \\"Clearly what's behind this is the hope that his situation will get better. But the improvements that we talk about in such situations are not great improvements, not dramatic improvements.\\" After his stroke, Sharon settled into what medical staff and the friends who were allowed to visit describe as a limbo state -- uncommunicative but apparently responding to basic stimuli and television. He is said to have kept much of the corpulence that was a gift to satirists and gave him his nickname of \\"Bulldozer.\\" EYES OPEN \\"There is a feeling of communication, of realization -- I mean, the eyes are open and there is kind of, like, you feel that he feels your presence,\\" his doctor, Shlomo Segev, told the U.S. online journal The Daily Beast last year. \\"So it's not completely what we call a coma. Not a deep coma, for sure. But if you asked me to quantify that, I cannot.\\" Ehud Olmert, Sharon's deputy and successor, recalled in a memoir telling then-U.S. president George W. Bush that Sharon's two sons refused to consider stopping his life support as they believed his condition was not irretrievable. Sharon spearheaded Israel's repulsion of Egyptian forces in the 1973 war. As defense minister in 1982, he masterminded the Lebanon invasion but was forced to step down over the massacre there of Palestinian refugees by allied Christian militiamen. While many Arabs reviled his war record and zeal to build on occupied land, Sharon won respect as prime minister for plowing through Israel's fractious coalition politics to form the new, centrist Kadima party and pull out of Gaza. Whether Sharon, who at one point cornered Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Beirut with tanks, would have secured a peace accord remains debated, not least as Hamas Islamists opposed to coexistence with Israel were quick to fill the Gaza vacuum. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Ariel Sharon, the comatose former prime minister of Israel, was moved to his family ranch from the long-term care unit of a hospital outside Tel Aviv in 2010. Sharon had been in a coma since early 2006 after suffering a series of strokes while still in office. The decision to move him followed modern medical thinking that encouraged treating long-term patients \\"in the community\\" rather than in hospitals, according to Dr. Shlomo Noi from Tel Hashomer Hospital. Sharon's condition remained unchanged, with no indication of emerging from the coma."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He's furious that she left him, outraged over her \\"silly Reno divorce\\" and indignant that she is playing around with young men, in particular a struggling writer staying near them at their retreat on the English coast.

He keeps calm except for his eyes, which twitch uncontrollably, and departs.A day or two later, Robert Tisdall (Derrick De Marney), a local writer, happens to be walking along the seaside cliffs when Christine's body washes ashore and he sees her body on the beach.

He was the founder and first leader of the Alberta Social Credit Party, which believed the Great Depression was caused by ordinary people not having enough to spend. Therefore, Aberhart argued that the government should give each Albertan 25 per month to spend to stimulate the economy, by providing needed purchasing power to allow needy customers to buy from waiting businesses. - Major Clifford Hugh \\"C.

H. Douglas (18791952), a British engineer, who published a book by that name in 1924. It encompasses economics, political science, history, and accounting. Its policies are designed, according to Douglas, to disperse economic and political power to individuals. Douglas wrote, \\"Systems were made for men, and not men for systems, and the interest of man which is self-development, is above all systems, whether theological, political or economic.\\" Douglas said that Social Crediters want to build a new civilization based upon \\"absolute economic security\\" for the individual, where \\"they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid.\\" In his words, \\"what we really demand of existence is not that we shall be put into somebody else's Utopia, but we shall be put in a position to construct a Utopia of our own.\\" - The Alberta Social Credit Party is a provincial political party in Alberta, Canada, that was founded on social credit monetary policy put forward by Clifford Hugh Douglas and on conservative Christian social values.

Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Since the 1980s, Role-playing is the most commercially viable video game genre in Japan, and has more market share of any other genre in the japanese gaming industry, although in the 2010s first-person shooters and western iOS and Android games were becoming rapidly and increasingly popular in that country. - The PlayStation 2 (abbreviated as PS2) is a home video game console that was developed by Sony Computer Entertainment.

His self-titled album, released March 20, 2007, debuted at number one on the Billboard Independent Albums chart and at number three on the Billboard 200. The album was certified gold in the United States in October 2007. Yamin auditioned in Boston, Massachusetts, singing Leon Russell's \\"A Song for You\\", but his audition was not aired (it was later aired on October 24, 2009, as part of the American Idol Rewind - season 5 show). He performed the song again in front of the judges during Hollywood rounds, as well as Rascal Flatts's \\"Bless the Broken Road\\". During the group auditions, Yamin and his group performed \\"It's In Her Kiss\\" (aka \\"The Shoop Shoop Song\\") from Betty Everett; Simon Cowell disliked the group performance, but Randy Jackson said Yamin was the best one in his group, and Paula Abdul said it was a good thing she could look past two left feet, in a way of saying he did not dance well but he could definitely sing. He was sent through by the judges and made it through to the finals of the competition. During one weekly rehearsal, guest coach Stevie Wonder told Yamin that he should definitely pursue a career in music. Simon Cowell stated that he thought Yamin was \\"potentially the best male vocalist\\" in five seasons on American Idol and later, after Yamin's \\"A Song for You\\" performance, he declared that it was a \\"vocal masterclass\\". His performance of \\"A Song for You\\" ranked third on Entertainment Weekly's countdown of the 16 best American Idol performances in the series history. On the May 10, 2006, results show Yamin, Taylor Hicks, and Katharine McPhee were announced as the top three finalists. All three returned to their respective hometowns for a day of festivities in their honor. Yamin's homecoming visit included radio and television interviews; performing \\"Home\\" for more than 4,000 fans, capped by Mayor Douglas Wilder presenting the key to the city; and meeting Governor Tim Kaine, whom Yamin greeted with a hug. Yamin threw out the first pitch before a sold-out crowd at The Diamond for a Richmond Braves game and sang a verse a cappella of \\"A Song for You\\".

At the beginning of December 1910 Smoller, using the name Joe Levi, visited Exchange Buildings, a small cul-de-sac that backed onto the properties of Houndsditch. He rented No. 11 Exchange Buildings; a week later Svaars rented number 9 for a month, saying he needed it for storage. The gang were unable to rent number 10, which was directly behind their target, 119 Houndsditch, the jeweller's shop owned by Henry Samuel Harris. The safe in the jeweller's was reputed to contain between £20,000 and £30,000 worth of jewellery; Harris's son later stated the total was only around £7,000. Over the next two weeks the gang brought in various pieces of necessary equipment, including a 60-foot (18.25 m) length of India rubber gas hose, a cylinder of compressed gas and a selection of tools, including diamond-tipped drills.With the exception of Gardstein, the identities of the gang members present in Houndsditch on the night of 16 December 1910 have never been confirmed. Bernard Porter, writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, considers that Sokoloff and Peters were present and, in all likelihood, were two of those who shot the policemen who interrupted their burglary. Porter opines that Peter the Painter was probably not at the property that night, while the journalist J P Eddy suggests that Svaars was among those present.

The victim, 40-year-old Norman Deon Crayton, was found dead in a wooded area south of Dadeville, early Sunday, as reported by the New York Daily News. Clate McDaniel, who left the show mid-season in 2012 to pursue a career in excavation, is now in custody with a bond set at 250,000. The show 'Bamazon' followed the lives of eight out-of-work construction workers from Alabama who decided to try their luck at gold mining in Guyana, South America. Matthew Clate McDaniel was described in his show's bio as \\"a brilliant excavator operator,\\" as well as \\"a yoga-practicing nature lover and a California hippie.\\" This once-promising man now faces serious allegations of murder, leaving fans and fellow cast members stunned and in disbelief. According to witnesses who spoke with the Alex City Outlook, Crayton was last seen alive playing pool at a local club with Matthew Clate McDaniel earlier that night. Crayton, who sustained multiple gunshot wounds, had known McDaniel for some time. The two men reportedly worked together at the excavation company McDaniel founded after his departure from the show. While many details surrounding the case remain scarce, the authorities have confirmed that both men were acquainted with one another, but the exact nature of their relationship has yet to be fully established. Sheriff authorities said it is too early to speculate about a motive but are actively investigating the circumstances leading to Crayton's untimely death. Matthew Clate McDaniel's arrest marks the latest high-profile case involving a celebrity being charged with murder – a dark side of fame that has continued to plague the entertainment industry. As the legal proceedings unfold, one cannot help but wonder what drove a once-ambitious reality-TV star to such an alleged heinous crime. In the wake of this tragic news, fans of 'Bamazon' and the community mourn the death of Norman Deon Crayton – a life that was tragically cut short. As the investigation continues, all eyes will be on the court proceedings to ensure that justice is served and questions around this horrifying incident will be answered. In the meantime, Matthew Clate McDaniel remains in custody, with his ambitions of striking gold in South America now overshadowed by the alleged murder of his former coworker and friend. The verdict in McDaniel's case will serve as a sobering reminder of the tragic consequences that can occur when ambitions and personal relationships take a deadly turn. This case is yet another alarming example of the darker side of our fascination with fame and the potential for devastation that lies beneath the surface.

Answer this question. “There’s a sucker born every minute” is a phrase erroneously attributed to what famous showman?","completion":"The phrase \\"There's a sucker born every minute\\" is often erroneously attributed to the famous American showman and entertainer Phineas Taylor Barnum, more commonly known as P.T. Barnum. He was a prominent figure in the 19th century who was known for founding the Barnum & Bailey Circus, as well as various other endeavors in show business, including creating elaborate hoaxes and managing various exhibitions, sideshows, and museums. P.T. Barnum was born on July 5, 1810, in Bethel, Connecticut, and began his career in entertainment by promoting a variety act called \\"Barnum's Grand Scientific and Musical Theater.\\" Later, in 1841, he purchased Scudder's American Museum in New York City and transformed it into the Barnum's American Museum, which featured a variety of attractions, such as living curiosities like the \\"Feejee Mermaid\\" and the \\"General Tom Thumb.\\" Despite his propensity for deception, Barnum was also seen as a keen businessman and marketer who understood the power of public relations and advertising to attract the masses to his attractions. The origin of the phrase \\"There's a sucker born every minute\\" is uncertain, and although it is widely associated with P.T. Barnum, there is no solid evidence that he ever said it. The phrase is generally used to describe the gullibility of people who are easily fooled or swindled. Some sources indicate that the phrase might have been used by a con artist named David Hannum, who was involved in a legal battle with Barnum over a fake giant called the \\"Cardiff Giant\\" that was exhibited in the late 1860s. Hannum allegedly said the infamous phrase in reference to the people who paid to see Barnum's fake giant, not realizing that his own giant was also a counterfeit. Regardless of its questionable origin, the phrase \\"There's a sucker born every minute\\" remains an enduring expression in popular culture that is linked, perhaps unfairly, to P.T. Barnum. Although Barnum was a savvy showman and on occasion, a master manipulator of public opinion, it is important to acknowledge that he also contributed significantly to the development of the entertainment industry in the United States and beyond and laid the groundwork for many current forms of popular entertainment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Milwaukee, Wisconsin (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, in a bid to create jobs and boost economic growth, called on Congress on Monday to pass a 50 billion plan to renew the country's transportation infrastructure. His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \\"Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\\" said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \\"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\\" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \\"This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\\" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of 50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress.

Article: The teenager who pleaded guilty to causing a drunken driving crash that killed four and injured two others last year will be required to attend a rehabilitation facility but will not face jail time, a judge ordered Wednesday. State District Judge Jean Boyd handed down the terms of Ethan Couch’s 10-year probation for the four intoxication manslaughter counts during a closed hearing. In doing so, she rejected prosecutors’ requests to give Couch jail time on the two intoxication assault counts. Boyd ordered Couch to be placed in a lock-down residential treatment center for an undisclosed amount of time and at his parents’ expense. Couch’s father had offered to foot the bill for a 450,000-a-year treatment center near Newport Beach, Calif., but it was unclear whether that’s where Couch will go. Couch cannot drive, drink alcohol or use drugs during his probation. If he violates the terms, he could be sentenced to up to 10 years behind bars, according to the Tarrant County district attorney’s office. “It is our hope that the attention drawn by this case highlights the dangers associated with driving while intoxicated and will ensure that a tragedy such as this one will never happen again,” prosecutor Riley Shaw said in a prepared statement. Defense attorney Reagan Wynn lauded Boyd for giving Couch probation, saying the judge recognized the possibility that he could be reformed better in a rehab facility that in prison. “We recognize that 16-year-old kids are different from 25-year-old adults,” Wynn said. On June 15, 2013, Couch had been partying at his parent’s second home in Burleson and got behind the wheel with seven people piled into his Ford pickup, authorities said. He swerved off the road, hitting and killing 24-year-old Breanna Mitchell, whose SUV had broken down, and three others who had stopped to help: youth pastor Brian Jennings 41, and Hollie Boyles, 52, and her daughter, Shelby Boyles, 21. Teens Sergio Molina and Solimon Mohmand were riding in the bed of the pickup and were thrown out on impact, authorities said. Molina was left with a severe brain injury and is unable to move or talk. Mohmand suffered broken bones and internal injuries. Authorities said Couch, who was 16 at the time of the crash, had a blood alcohol content of 0.24 — three times the legal limit for an adult — and that he was driving 70 mph in a 40-mph zone. The sentence of probation drew national outrage, as did testimony by a psychologist called by the defense who said Couch suffered from “affluenza.” His family’s wealth and a dysfunctional relationship with his parents had left Couch without a sense of responsibility, the witness said in describing the diagnosis. Wynn said the focus on “affluenza” and the media’s reporting of the case had “so twisted the facts that were actually presented in court that I don’t think the truth will ever be able to come out now.” “It was ridiculous to think that we walked into court and said, ‘Oh, this is a rich white kid,’ and [Boyd] decided to probate him,” Wynn said. Prosecutor Richard Alpert called Wynn’s comments hypocritical, stating that it was Couch’s defense team that had presented the “affluenza” argument. “His witnesses don’t say things by accident,” Alpert said. “So they thought maybe that would help — that’s my interpretation — and it blew up on them. It was a stupid thing to say.” Couch has been in juvenile detention since he was sentenced Dec. 12, KXAS-TV (NBC5) reported. Six civil lawsuits that have been filed against Couch, his parents, Fred and Tonya Couch, and the family’s company, Cleburne Metal Works, have been consolidated and transferred into 96th state District Court, presided over by Judge R.H. Wallace, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported. Local media including The Dallas Morning News recently filed a request to be given a hearing on whether court proceedings in the Couch case should be open to the public. Boyd denied the request and closed Wednesday’s proceedings to the public and news media. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

(Associated Press) Ethan Couch, center, sits in juvenile court for a hearing about his future Wednesday, Feb. 5, 2014, in Fort Worth, Texas. Judge Jean Boyd again decided to give no jail time for Couch, who was sentenced... (Associated Press) Judge Jean Boyd again decided to give no jail time for Ethan Couch, defense attorney Reagan Wynn and prosecutors told reporters after the hearing, which was closed to the public. Prosecutors had asked Boyd to sentence him to 20 years in state custody on charges related to two people who were severely injured. The sentence stirred fierce debate, as has the testimony of a defense expert who says Couch's wealthy parents coddled him into a sense of irresponsibility. The expert termed the condition \\"affluenza.\\" Wynn and prosecutor Richard Alpert would not identify the facility where Couch will go or where it is located. The teen's family previously had offered to pay for Couch to go to a 450,000-a-year rehabilitation center near Newport Beach, Calif. Couch, who's currently in state custody, is expected to receive alcohol and drug rehab, and could face prison time if he runs away from the facility or violates any other terms of his probation, Alpert said. There is no minimum amount of time Couch must spend in the facility before his release, prosecutor Riley Shaw said. Wynn ripped the media and the public's focus on \\"affluenza\\" and said that his client was misunderstood. He said reporting of the Couch case had \\"so twisted the facts that were actually presented in court that I don't think the truth will ever be able to come out now.\\" \\"It was ridiculous to think that we walked into court and said, 'Oh, this is a rich white kid,' and she decided to probate him,\\" he said. But Alpert accused Wynn of hypocrisy, pointing out that a defense witness made the comment in the first place. \\"His witnesses don't say things by accident,\\" Alpert said. \\"So they thought maybe that would help — that's my interpretation — and it blew up on them. It was a stupid thing to say.\\" Couch's parents did not speak to reporters as they entered the courtroom. Several relatives of Couch's victims also attended Wednesday's hearing. \\"The families feel like the same way they felt the last time they were here,\\" Alpert said. Asking Boyd to give Couch jail time for intoxication assault was a last-ditch effort by prosecutors, who have said they have almost no way to appeal the judge's sentence in the case. Alpert said he hoped the Couch case would lead the Texas Legislature to allow juries to sentence some juvenile defendants. The case has already spurred calls for potential changes. Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, who serves as president of the Senate, has asked for a study of sentencing guidelines in intoxication manslaughter cases. But Wynn lauded Boyd for giving Couch probation and recognizing the possibility that he could be reformed better in a rehab facility that in prison. \\"We recognize that 16-year-old kids are different from 25-year-old adults,\\" he said. Couch was 16 at the time of the accident. His blood-alcohol level was three times the legal limit for an adult and there were traces of Valium in his system when he lost control of his pickup truck and plowed into a group of people helping a woman whose car had stalled. Seven passengers were riding in Couch's truck. One, Sergio Molina, is paralyzed and can communicate only by blinking. The other, Solimon Mohmand, suffered numerous broken bones and internal injuries. ____ Follow Nomaan Merchant on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/nomaanmerchant. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"In 2013, Ethan Couch, a teenager from Texas, caused a drunk driving crash that resulted in the death of four people and injured two others. He was found guilty but received a 10-year probation sentence without jail time.

In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Quail is a collective name for several genera of mid-sized birds generally placed in the order Galliformes. Old World quail are placed in the family Phasianidae, and New World quail are placed in the family Odontophoridae. The species of buttonquail are named for their superficial resemblance to quail, and form the family Turnicidae in the order Charadriiformes. The king quail, an Old World quail, often is sold in the pet trade, and within this trade is commonly, though mistakenly, referred to as a \\"button quail\\". Many of the common larger species are farm-raised for table food or egg consumption, and are hunted on game farms or in the wild, where they may be released to supplement the wild population, or extend into areas outside their natural range. In 2007, 40 million quail were produced in the U.S. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Charadriiformes is a diverse order of small to medium-large birds. It includes about 350 species and has members in all parts of the world. Most Charadriiformes live near water and eat invertebrates or other small animals; however, some are pelagic (seabirds), some occupy deserts and a few are found in thick forest. - The Galliformes are an order of heavy-bodied ground-feeding birds that includes turkey, grouse, chicken, New World quail and Old World quail, ptarmigan, partridge, pheasant, junglefowl and the Cracidae. The name derives from \\"gallus\\", Latin for \\"cock\\" or \\"rooster\\". Common names are gamefowl or gamebirds, landfowl, gallinaceous birds, or galliforms. \\"Wildfowl\\" or just \\"fowl\\" are also often used for the Galliformes, but usually these terms also refer to waterfowl (Anseriformes), and occasionally to other commonly hunted birds. This group has about 290 species, one or more of which are found in essentially every part of the world's continents (except for the innermost deserts and perpetual ice). They are rarer on islands, and in contrast to the closely related waterfowl, are essentially absent from oceanic islandsunless introduced there by humans. Several species have been domesticated during their long and extensive relationships with humans. - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - The king quail (\\"Excalfactoria chinensis\\"), also known as the blue-breasted quail, Asian blue quail, button quail, Chinese painted quail, or Chung-Chi, is a species of Old World quail in the family Phasianidae. This species is the smallest \\"true quail\\" and is quite common in aviculture worldwide. In the wild they range from southeastern Asia to Oceania with 10 different subspecies. - Coturnix is a genus of eight extant species and two known extinct species of Old World quail . They are related to the francolins , jungle bush quail , snowcocks and rock partridges . Species of Coturnix and the aforementioned genera belong to their own monophyletic clade , Coturnicinae , a subfamily within the family Phasianidae . Some authors consider this clade , together with a sibling assemblage , the Gallininae ( including the junglefowl , long - billed partridge and Chinese bamboo partridge ) warrants classification in its own family , Coturnigallusinidae . Quail of Coturnix live in pairs or small social groups and form larger groups during migration . Not all species migrate , but most are capable of extremely rapid , upward flight to escape from danger . Unlike related genera , Old World quail do not perch in trees . They devote much of their time to scratching and foraging for seeds and invertebrates on the ground . Typical habitats are dense vegetation such as grasslands , bushes alongside rivers and cereal fields . They are predated upon heavily by the diurnal hawks . - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Buttonquail or hemipodes are members of a small family of birds, Turnicidae, which resemble, but are unrelated to, the quails of Phasianidae. They inhabit warm grasslands in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Australia. There are 16 species in two genera, with most species being found in the genus \\"Turnix\\" and only one being found in the genus \\"Ortyxelos\\". - The New World quails or Odontophoridae are small birds only distantly related to the Old World quail, but named for their similar appearance and habits. The American species are in their own family Odontophoridae, whereas Old World quail are in the pheasant family Phasianidae. The family ranges from Canada through to southern Brazil, and two species, the California quail and the bobwhite quail, have been successfully introduced to New Zealand. The stone partridge and Nahan's partridge, both found in Africa, seem to belong to the family. Species are found across a variety of habitats from tropical rainforest to deserts, although few species are capable of surviving at very low temperatures. Thirty-four species are placed in ten genera. - The Phasianidae are a family of heavy, groundliving birds which includes pheasants, partridges, junglefowl, chickens, Old World quail, and peafowl. The family includes many of the most popular gamebirds. The family is a large one, and is occasionally broken up into two subfamilies, the Phasianinae, and the Perdicinae. Sometimes, additional families and birds are treated as part of this family. For example, the American Ornithologists' Union includes Tetraonidae (grouse), Numididae (guineafowl), and Meleagrididae (turkeys) as subfamilies in Phasianidae. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. What object entity has the relation of 'parent taxon' with the subject 'coturnix'?

The vessel has impressive dimensions, demonstrating the significant naval engineering expertise involved in its creation. One measurement disclosed for the ARA Veinticinco de Mayo (V-2) is its length, provided in millimetres to denote precision. Specifically, the ship has a length of 192,000.0 millimetres, or 192 meters when converted. This substantial length suggests that the vessel is potentially a naval or maritime combatant ship; typically, military vessels such as aircraft carriers, destroyers, or cruisers are noted for their long length to incorporate various operational components like weapons systems, engines, and crew accommodation. In addition to the length, information about the vessel's shipBeam is given as well. The ship beam, often referred to as the breadth, is the width of the ship at its widest point. A wider beam often represents enhanced stability in the water, which is crucial in rough seas or during turning manoeuvres. For the ARA Veinticinco de Mayo (V-2), the shipBeam is recorded at 24.4 metres, indicating that the ship is not just lengthy but also considerably broad. Lastly, the data includes information about the country the ship belongs to, which is Argentina in this case. This would usually indicate that the vessel is part of that country's naval or maritime fleet. Given the type of vessel and its dimensions, it's likely that it plays a significant role within the Argentinian Navy. To summarize, the data provided gives a descriptive picture of the ARA Veinticinco de Mayo (V-2), an Argentinian ship with a length of 192 meters and a beam of 24.4 meters. These characteristics, along with its nationality, likely indicate that this ship plays a prominent role in Argentina's naval capabilities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what enters the atmosphere when coal, oil, and natural gas is burned?\\" is \\"toxins\\", given that burning coal, oil, and natural gas increases carbon in the atmosphere?","completion":"The term \\"toxins\\" is too broad to accurately describe what enters the atmosphere when coal, oil, and natural gas are burned. A more specific and comprehensive answer would outline the various types of emissions and pollutants that are released when these fossil fuels are combusted. Here is a detailed breakdown of the emissions produced: 1. Carbon Dioxide (CO2): The primary greenhouse gas emitted by burning coal, oil, and natural gas is carbon dioxide. Combustion of these fossil fuels releases CO2 as a byproduct, which contributes to the increase in atmospheric carbon levels and global warming. 2. Sulfur Dioxide (SO2): Burning coal and some petroleum products, particularly those with high sulfur content, releases sulfur dioxide. This pollutant can react with other compounds in the atmosphere to form fine particles and acid rain, both of which negatively impact human health and the environment. 3. Nitrogen Oxides (NOx): Burning fossil fuels also leads to the release of nitrogen oxides, which contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone (a principal component of urban smog), acid rain, and fine particle pollution. 4. Particulate Matter (PM): Combustion of fossil fuels, particularly coal, produces a significant amount of particulate matter – tiny particles suspended in the air that can be inhaled deep into the lungs and cause respiratory problems and other health issues. 5. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs): Burning fossil fuels releases a variety of VOCs, which can react with other chemicals in the atmosphere to form harmful pollutants like ozone or contribute to the formation of secondary pollutants like PM. 6. Heavy Metals: Coal, in particular, contains trace amounts of heavy metals like mercury, lead, and arsenic. When burned, these heavy metals can be released into the atmosphere, posing potential threats to both human health and the environment. 7. Other Gases: Combustion of fossil fuels can also release smaller amounts of other pollutants, such as carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH4). Therefore, it's more accurate to say that burning coal, oil, and natural gas releases various types of pollutants and greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, heavy metals, and other gases, rather than simply stating \\"toxins.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It offers an experience of ancient Greek and Roman art in a setting that replicates that in which it would originally have been displayed, a Roman villa of the first century AD. On April 18, after three years of work, the galleries of the Villa reopen with an entirely new arrangement of the collection, one that situates art in its cultural and historical context. Since 2006, when the Getty Villa opened as a museum dedicated to the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, the collection has been presented along thematic lines, with galleries dedicated to subjects such as ancient theater, athletes and competition, and gods and goddesses. This approach was useful in illuminating social life in the ancient classical world, but it prioritized objects’ subject matter over their stature as works of art and removed them from their broader artistic and cultural context. Reenvisioning how the antiquities were displayed at the Villa was one of my top priorities when I joined the J. Paul Getty Museum as director in 2012. As a specialist in ancient art, my priority is to help visitors to see these great treasures as beautiful and fascinating works of art, and sparking their curiosity to understand them in the context of their place in human culture. Starting April 18 our Villa galleries offer a new journey through ancient Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art. The visitor’s path begins on the first-floor rooms devoted to Neolithic and Bronze Age (Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean) Greek art. The journey continues through the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods, when the Greeks developed the first fully naturalistic vision of the human figure. And it culminates in the dramatic skylit halls of ancient Roman sculpture. In all there are 33 spaces on two floors, with 3,000 more square feet of gallery space than before. The visitor’s path winds through the galleries, gardens, and fountains, offering views onto the spectacular landscape and Pacific Ocean. According to the above context, answer the following question.

Here is a detailed explanation of why this choice is suitable: To break down the tweet, we have three key parts: 1. \\"Hahahahaha\\" - This is an onomatopoeic representation of laughter, which indicates amusement or happiness experienced by the sender. 2. \\"i love\\" - The use of the word \\"love\\" is a strong indication of affection and positive regard. 3. \\"your drunk ass\\" - While the word \\"drunk\\" might appear to convey negativity, in this context, it seems to be used affectionately or humorously, and it does not negate the overall positive sentiment. When taken together, these elements create a positive sentiment. The sender appears to be amused and expressing affection or appreciation towards the recipient (\\"@katieluckylegs\\") in a playful and lighthearted manner.

OPT: (I) for several years (II) not enough information (III) since they got married (IV) for as long as he can remember I married young, at 19, bright-eyed and hopeful, and in a few months, we will celebrate our 29th anniversary. Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways. My husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable. My husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me. And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer. At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he’d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would “cure” him. Feeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken. I felt betrayed, confused, angry, sad, and yet, miraculously relieved. There was nothing wrong with me — I was just not his type. The emotions flew through me leaving my head and heart confused. What now? I loved this man with every fibre of my being. We had a good life together, sex aside, and had built a family. We were happy. I did not want a divorce and neither did he. According to the above context, answer the following question. For how long has the husband felt attracted to the same sex?

Answer the question...name the type of mutation that does not effect protein synthesis??","completion":"The type of mutation that does not affect protein synthesis is known as a silent mutation. Silent mutations are a specific type of point mutation, which occur when a single nucleotide in the DNA sequence is altered. Point mutations can lead to various outcomes, including missense mutations, nonsense mutations, and silent mutations. In silent mutations, the nucleotide substitution does not change the amino acid specified by the codon. This lack of change is due to the redundancy or degeneracy of the genetic code, where multiple codons can code for the same amino acid. Out of the 64 codons, 61 code for amino acids, while the remaining three serve as stop codons. For example, consider a triplet of DNA bases such as AAG, which codes for the amino acid lysine. If the third base changes from G to A, the codon is still recognized as encoding lysine (AAA). This is because multiple codons (AAG and AAA) can code for the same amino acid – in this case, lysine. Since the resulting protein remains unchanged despite the mutation, the mutation’s impact on protein synthesis is negligible. Silent mutations are considered neutral, as they typically do not cause an observable change in the phenotype of the organism and do not affect the overall function of the protein. However, it is important to note that in some instances, silent mutations may still alter the protein synthesis rate or splicing efficiency leading to subtle effects on protein function or regulation. But generally, it is safe to say that silent mutations do not produce significant effects on protein synthesis and overall organism fitness."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Each year, we celebrate many holidays here in America.

Jones II is going to jail for trying to spy on his wife's text messages, the Raleigh News and Observer writes. When he suspected his wife was having an affair, instead of snooping through her phone himself, Jones thought it would be a good idea to ask a friend in the sheriff's office if copies of text messages between his wife and another man could be obtained through police channels—which is illegal without a warrant and suspicion of criminal activity. In exchange for the warrantless surveillance, Jones offered his \\"friend\\" two cases of Bud Light. Perhaps offended by the low-quality beer on offer, the deputy reported the judge for corruption. The jury deliberated for only 33 minutes before finding Jones guilty, Fox News reports. Jones was convicted on three felony charges. He will face sentencing on Jan. 23. His defense plans to appeal the verdict. Jones' defense team argues that he was never informed his request was illegal, but his long career as a judge—including time as the chairman of the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission—would seem to make it unlikely their appeal will be successful.

The paper was founded in 1885 by Axel Danielsson and August Palm, and existed up to 1944 when it changed name to \\"Morgon-Tidningen\\" (\\"The Morning Paper\\"). \\"Morgon-Tidningen\\" existed up to 1958. - Västra Götaland County is a county or \\"län\\" on the western coast of Sweden. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - Axel Danielsson (15 December 1863 30 December 1899) was a Swedish socialist agitator, journalist and writer, born in Värmland. He was a prominent leader of the early Swedish Social Democratic Party. Danielsson retranslated Karl Marx's \\"Communist Manifesto\\" into Swedish in 1886. - Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium \\"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\\" (MTB). Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections do not have symptoms; in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis. About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected. The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The historical term \\"consumption\\" came about due to the weight loss. Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms. Tuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze. People with latent TB do not spread the disease. Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke. Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids. Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests. Prevention of TB involves screening those at high risk, early detection and treatment of cases, and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine. Those at high risk include household, workplace, and social contacts of people with active TB. Treatment requires the use of multiple antibiotics over a long period of time. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem with increasing rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). One-third of the world's population is thought to be infected with TB. New infections occur in about 1% of the population each year. In 2014, there were 9.6 million cases of active TB which resulted in 1.5 million deaths. More than 95% of deaths occurred in developing countries. The number of new cases each year has decreased since 2000. About 80% of people in many Asian and African countries test positive while 510% of people in the United States population tests positive by the tuberculin test.... - The lungs are the primary organs of respiration in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails. In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the heart. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their musculoskeletal systems to support and foster breathing. In early tetrapods, air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians. In humans, the primary muscle that drives breathing is the diaphragm. The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human speech possible. - The Swedish Social Democratic Party, (SAP; literally, \\"Social Democratic Workers' Party of Sweden\\"), contesting elections as the \\"ArbetarepartietSocialdemokraterna\\" ('The Workers' Party The Social Democrats'), usually referred to just as the 'Social Democrats' (\\"Socialdemokraterna\\"); is the oldest and largest political party in Sweden. The current party leader since 2012 is Stefan Löfven; he has also been Prime Minister of Sweden since 2014. - A diagnosis of latent tuberculosis (LTB), also called latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) means a patient is infected with \\"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\\", but the patient does not have active tuberculosis. Active tuberculosis can be contagious while latent tuberculosis is not, and it is therefore not possible to get TB from someone with latent tuberculosis. The main risk is that approximately 10% of these patients (5% in the first two years after infection and 0.1% per year thereafter) will go on to develop active tuberculosis. This is particularly true, and there is added risk, in particular situations such as medication that suppresses the immune system or advancing age. - Karl Johan ( K. J. ) Gabrielsson ( 1861 -- 1901 ) was a Swedish socialist writer and poet . The son of a railway worker , he was born to a poor family in Töreboda , Västra Götaland County , Gabrielsson eventually settled in Stockholm where he became a socialist and writer , mainly of revolutionary poems , for the newspaper Social - Demokraten .

Some of Chopin's well-known pieces have acquired descriptive titles, such as the Revolutionary Étude (Op. 10, No. 12), and the Minute Waltz (Op. 64, No. 1). However, with the exception of his Funeral March, the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others. There is no evidence to suggest that the Revolutionary Étude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind; it merely appeared at that time. The Funeral March, the third movement of his Sonata No. 2 (Op. 35), the one case where he did give a title, was written before the rest of the sonata, but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it.

Above the Chapel is the Chapel Room, also known as the Queen Anne Room, the Priest's Room, and Nevill's Room. It had been two rooms, a state bedroom and ante-room, but was almost totally transformed in the late 19th century into one larger room. A blocked-up door next to the fireplace was thought to have been a priest hole, but is more likely to have been the entrance to the first floor of the house from an external staircase before the wing was restructured, probably in the late 16th century or the early 17th century.North of the Chapel Room is the Paradise Room, whose name derives from the bed hangings which include embroidered images of Adam and Eve and their fall from paradise, as well as the use in Tudor times of the name \\"paradise\\" for a favourite room, often a bedchamber.

Hisham reformed it and paid only to those who participated in battle.

Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign. However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare the house for the rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.Harvey's land purchase in Silver Springs coincided with a desire by the local postmaster to change the name of the area, because it was often confused with Siloam Springs, Arkansas. Harvey chose the name Monte Ne, which supposedly combined the Spanish and Omaha...","completion":"The last name of the candidate that lost their bid for President is Bryan, as mentioned in the article: \\"Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign.\\""},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: \\"The H-2A worker's contract must include certain minimum benefits, wages, and working conditions that are mandated by federal law.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"H-2A workers have to be given certain benefits.\\" true?","completion":"Yes, based on the given premise, the hypothesis \\"H-2A workers have to be given certain benefits\\" is true. The H-2A visa program is a non-immigrant visa program in the United States that allows agricultural employers to hire foreign workers temporarily for agricultural jobs when there is a shortage of U.S. workers. The H-2A program serves as a vital source of labor for the agricultural sector, providing an essential workforce for certain peak planting and harvesting times when demand for labor cannot be met by the domestic labor market. Under the H-2A program, the United States Department of Labor requires employers to provide certain minimum benefits, wages, and working conditions to foreign agricultural workers in order to participate in the program. These protections exist to prevent the exploitation of foreign workers and to ensure that the employment of foreign workers does not adversely impact the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers similarly employed. Some of the key benefits, wages, and working conditions mandated for H-2A workers include: 1. Wages: Employers must offer H-2A workers a wage that is the highest of the Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR), the prevailing hourly wage rate, the prevailing piece rate, or the federal or state minimum wage. 2. Housing: Employers must provide H-2A workers with free housing that meets federal safety and health standards. 3. Transportation: Employers are required to provide transportation to and from the worker's home country or country of last residence under certain conditions, as well as daily transportation between the provided housing and the worksite. 4. Meals: Employers must provide H-2A workers with three meals a day or furnish free and convenient cooking facilities. 5. Work contract: The job order or contract for an H-2A worker must specify the terms and conditions of employment, ensuring all parties have a clear understanding of the job requirements, wages, and benefits. 6. Workers' compensation insurance: Employers are required to provide H-2A workers with workers' compensation insurance coverage in accordance with state laws. 7. Guarantee of minimum work hours: Employers must provide the H-2A worker with a guarantee of at least 75% of the total work hours for the contract period to ensure that the worker receives sufficient work. 8. No discrimination: H-2A workers are protected under U.S. labor laws, which prohibit discrimination based on nationality, race, color, religion, sex, age, or disability. 9. Limited deductions from wages: Employers can only make certain authorized deductions from an H-2A worker's wages as required by law or specified in the work contract. In summary, the hypothesis \\"H-2A workers have to be given certain benefits\\" is true, as the H-2A program mandates certain minimum benefits, wages, and working conditions for foreign agricultural workers employed in the United States. These protections are designed to ensure fair treatment of foreign workers, prevent their exploitation, and protect domestic labor standards."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Given the following context: Brougham Castle (pronounced ) is a medieval building about 2 miles (3.2 km) south-east of Penrith, Cumbria, England. The castle was founded by Robert I de Vieuxpont in the early 13th century. The site, near the confluence of the rivers, Eamont and Lowther, had been chosen by the Romans for a Roman fort called Brocavum. The castle is scheduled as an Ancient Monument, along with the fort, as \\"Brougham Roman fort and Brougham Castle\\".In its earliest form, the castle consisted of a stone keep, with an enclosure protected by an earthen bank and a wooden palisade. When the castle was built, Robert de Vieuxpont was one of the only lords in the region who were loyal to King John. The Vieuxponts were a powerful land-owning family in North West England, who also owned the castles of Appleby and Brough. In 1264, Robert de Vieuxpont's grandson, also named Robert, was declared a traitor, and his property was confiscated by Henry III. Brougham Castle and the other estates were eventually returned to the Vieuxpont family, and stayed in their possession, until 1269, when the estates passed to the Clifford family through marriage. With the outbreak of the Wars of Scottish Independence, in 1296, Brougham became an important military base for Robert Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford. He began refortifying the castle: the wooden outer defences were replaced with stronger, more impressive stone walls, and a large stone gatehouse was added. The importance of Brougham and Robert Clifford was such that, in 1300, he hosted King Edward I of England at the castle. Robert's son, Roger Clifford, was executed as a traitor, in 1322, and the family estates passed into the possession of King Edward II of England, although they were returned once his son Edward III became king. The region was often at risk from the Scots, and in 1388, the castle was captured and sacked. answer the following question: What is the full name of the person who hosted King Edward I at a castle?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: But the more important question How many teen-age girls are getting pregnant in the first place? Hypothesis: The statistics say men get pregnant more than women actually do. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. These are two separate statements addressing different aspects of the topic. Let us break down each statement for better understanding. Premise: \\"How many teen-age girls are getting pregnant in the first place?\\" This statement is asking for a statistical number or the prevalence of teen pregnancy. It is concerned with understanding the rate at which adolescent girls become pregnant. This issue can be important for various reasons, such as implications for public health, education, and socio-economic factors. Answers to this statement would involve gathering data on the number of teenage pregnancies worldwide or within specific regions. Hypothesis: \\"The statistics say men get pregnant more than women actually do.\\" This statement is a hypothesis making an unusual claim that men experience pregnancy more than women. It is important to note, however, that biologically, males cannot get pregnant. Pregnancy occurs in females, particularly those assigned female at birth, as they possess the reproductive system required to conceive, carry, and give birth to a child. This hypothesis appears to be either a misinterpretation or a misconceived notion. The relationship between the premise and hypothesis, therefore, is that both statements are discussing the topic of pregnancy. However, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The hypothesis presented is not a correct claim, and it does not follow from the initial question regarding the frequency of teenage pregnancies. To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, there needs to be a logical connection between the two, which does not exist in this case."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

First, understand the context: The user found cereal in their cereal and mentioned moving to Australia. This could be considered a play on words or a humorous comment as users don't typically move to a new country because they found cereal in their cereal. 2.

The user might be trying to make a light-hearted joke. 3. Compare the tweet to the sentiment options provided: (a). negative: Negative sentiment typically indicates dissatisfaction, anger, or unhappiness. This tweet doesn't convey any of these strong emotions and appears to be more lighthearted. (b). positive: A positive sentiment would imply satisfaction, happiness, or excitement. Though the tweet is likely a harmless joke, it doesn't show strong positive emotions either. Based on this analysis, the tweet doesn't fall neatly into either category.

Here's a logic test: Harold spent a day rolling his bike tire across a dirt yard and a field. He discovered that the field was fougher then the dirt yard. Rolling a bike tire across a _____ generates less resistance (A) field (B) dirt yard Choose the answer between \\"field\\" and \\"dirt yard\\". The answer to this question is:","completion":"dirt yard. To explain this in detail, let's first understand the terms and factors involved in this question: 1. Resistance: In this context, resistance refers to the force that opposes the motion of the bike tire. Factors that affect resistance include surface roughness, surface material, and rolling friction. 2. Field: A field is an open area of land, generally covered with grass, plants, and other natural elements. Fields can have varying degrees of roughness, depending on the type and height of the vegetation present. 3. Dirt yard: A dirt yard is an area made up of loose soil or earth. It might be devoid of significant vegetation, and the surface might be more even than a field, depending on how it has been compacted and maintained. Now, let's analyze the given information: - Harold spent a day rolling his bike tire across a dirt yard and a field. - He discovered that the field was rougher than the dirt yard. Given these observations, it can be inferred that the resistance generated comes from the roughness of the terrain.

Please answer the following question: Article: In our culture, the sources of what we call a sense of \\"mastery\\" - feeling important and worthwhile - and the sources of what we call a sense of \\"pleasure\\" - finding life enjoyable - are not always the same. Women often are told \\"You can't have it all.\\" Sometimes what the speaker really is saying is: \\"You chose a career, so you can't expect to have closer relationships or a happy family life.\\" or \\"You have a wonderful husband and children--What's all this about wanting a career?\\" But women need to understand and develop both aspects of well-being, if they are to feel good about themselves. Our study shows that, for women, well-being has two dimensions. One is mastery, which includes self-esteem, a sense of control over your life, and low levels of anxiety and depression. Mastery is closely related to the \\"doing\\" side of life, to work and activity. Pleasure is the other dimensions, and it is composed of happiness, satisfaction and optimism. It is tied more closely to the \\"feeling\\" side of life. The two are independent of each other. A woman could be high in mastery and low in pleasure, and vice versa . For example, a woman who has a good job, but whose mother has just died, might be feeling very good about herself and in control of her work life, but the pleasure side could be damaged for a time. The concepts of mastery and pleasure can help us identify the sources of well-being for women, and remedy past mistakes. In the past, women were encouraged to look only at the feeling side of life as the source of all well-being. But we know that both mastery and pleasure are critical. And mastery seems to be achieved largely through work. In our study, all the groups of employed women rated significantly higher in mastery than did women who were not employed. A woman's well-being is enhanced when she takes on multiple roles. At least by middle adulthood, the women who were involved in a combination of roles-marriages, motherhood, and employment were the highest in well-being, despite warnings about stress and strain. Question: The author's attitude towards women having a career is_. Yes or no, is the answer \\"positive\\"? A:","completion":"The author's attitude towards women having a career is positive.

What is the best known novel by the author whose work was the basis for the French film Thomas the Impostor? A:","completion":"The best-known novel by the author whose work was the basis for the French film Thomas the Impostor (Thomas l'imposteur) is \\"Les Enfants Terribles\\" by the renowned French author Jean Cocteau. Jean Cocteau, born on July 5, 1889, was a versatile artist who expressed himself not only through writing but also through poetry, painting, and film. His multifaceted creative career left an indelible mark on the French and international art scenes. \\"Les Enfants Terribles\\" is a novel published in 1929 that demonstrates Cocteau's literary acumen and timeless storytelling. The book revolves around the intricate and complicated relationship between two siblings, Elizabeth and Paul, whose lives are characterized by isolation, jealousy, and destructive patterns. They live in a world of their own, secluded from society, and are completely intertwined in each other's lives. Their connection is extremely intense, often crossing the line between sibling affection and romantic desire. As the story progresses, the siblings are separated, and this leads to a tragic and inevitable conclusion. The novel draws parallels between the siblings' decadent, secluded lifestyle and their ultimate downfall. Cocteau's writing explores how closeness can lead to destruction, emphasizing the idea that one can be too close for comfort. \\"Les Enfants Terribles\\" is considered to be Cocteau's most famous work because of its powerful and thought-provoking narrative. The French film Thomas the Impostor (1965), directed by Georges Franju, is based on another of Cocteau's novels titled \\"Thomas l'imposteur\\" (1923). Set during World War I, this novel tells the story of a 16-year-old boy, Guillaume Thomas de Fontenoy, who, lying about his age and identity, finagles his way into serving on the front lines. Thomas ultimately becomes embroiled in the surreal and dangerous landscape of war, where lines between reality and fantasy blur. Despite the popularity of \\"Thomas l'imposteur\\" and the film adaptation, it is the novel \\"Les Enfants Terribles\\" that remains the most recognized and celebrated work of Jean Cocteau. This novel and its themes continue to resonate with readers and serve as a testament to Cocteau's unique storytelling abilities and his enduring influence in the world of French literature and film."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

What type of thing is the question \\"What is the chemical formula for napalm ?\\" asking about?","completion":"The question \\"What is the chemical formula for napalm?\\" is asking about the specific composition and molecular structure of napalm, which is a highly flammable and viscous substance historically used as an incendiary weapon in warfare. It is an inquiry into the realm of chemistry and can be classified as a question related to chemical compounds, their formulas, and applications. By asking for the chemical formula, the person posing the question is seeking to understand the constituent elements and their arrangement within the molecules of napalm. Napalm was originally developed during World War II and gained notoriety due to its use in the Vietnam War. The term 'napalm' is derived from the two key ingredients at the time of its creation: naphthenic and palmitic acids, which were used to produce a thickened gel that would burn for an extended period. The purpose of napalm was primarily to destroy infrastructure, clear dense vegetation, and cause widespread damage and incapacitation due to its intense heat and toxic smoke. Over time, the composition of napalm has evolved, with subsequent versions replacing the initial constituents for other chemicals to achieve similar or improved properties. The most well-known version is napalm-B, which consists of polystyrene, benzene, and gasoline. Still, it should be noted that there is no unique chemical formula for napalm as a whole since its variants may have slightly different compositions. To summarize, the question \\"What is the chemical formula for napalm?\\" revolves around the domain of chemistry and concerns the chemical composition and molecular structure of napalm, specifically addressing its constituent elements and their arrangement. Understanding napalm's chemical formula allows for insight into its properties, behavior, and potential applications beyond its historical use in warfare."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The goat was scared, and the people who lived in the house were worried. They needed help, so they called the superhero police officers to come and save the day! When the police officers arrived, they thought of a plan. They knew that goats loved to eat grass, so they brought two different types of yummy grass to try and get the goat's attention. They hoped that the goat would come to eat the grass and be able to get down from the roof. But the goat was still too scared to move! The grass didn't work, so the police officers had to think of a new plan. They used their imaginations and came up with a great idea! They would use a rope, called a lasso, to gently wrap around the goat's body and help guide it down the roof. They also made a special ramp to help the goat walk down safely. With teamwork and their clever plan, the police officers were able to save the day! They carefully used the lasso and the ramp to bring the goat down from the roof. The little goat was finally safe and sound back on the ground. After their big adventure, the police officers returned the goat to its owner's yard, where it happily began munching on grass.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: An analog signal consists of continuously changing voltage in a circuit. For example, microphones encode sounds as analog signals. Choices: - energy - frequency - amplitude - voltage A: Answer:","completion":"The correct option is: voltage. An analog signal consists of continuously changing voltage in a circuit. Analog signals are notable for their continuous nature; their key characteristic is that they can take any value within a specified range. In the case of a circuit that handles an analog signal, the voltage is continuously variable and remains the aspect that is constantly in flux. For example, when a microphone encodes sounds, it converts the sound waves – which are themselves analog signals – into an electrical analog signal. This electrical signal is a representation of the sound waves' variations in air pressure, and these variations translate into corresponding variations in voltage within the circuit. It is important to remember that voltage is not the only variable in an analog signal – other parameters, such as frequency, amplitude, and energy can also come into play.

Here is a question about this article: During Reconstruction, freedmen and former free people of color were granted the right to vote; most joined the Republican Party. Numerous African Americans were elected to local offices, and some to state office. Following Reconstruction, Tennessee continued to have competitive party politics. But in the 1880s, the white-dominated state government passed four laws, the last of which imposed a poll tax requirement for voter registration. These served to disenfranchise most African Americans, and their power in the Republican Party, the state, and cities where they had significant population was markedly reduced. In 1900 African Americans comprised 23.8 percent of the state's population, concentrated in Middle and West Tennessee. In the early 1900s, the state legislature approved a form of commission government for cities based on at-large voting for a few positions on a Board of Commission; several adopted this as another means to limit African-American political participation.

Answer:","completion":"Peter Glenville is an English film and stage actor, while Ridley Scott is an English filmmaker known primarily for his work as a director and producer. Although they both belong to the entertainment industry and share English heritage, they have pursued different career paths within the realm of cinema and theatre. Peter Glenville (1913-1996) was born in London, England, and began his career in the theatre, working as an actor and later transitioning to directing. He first appeared on stage in 1932, and over the years, he achieved significant success as a stage actor, appearing in numerous productions in London's West End and on Broadway in New York City. In the world of film, Glenville was also an accomplished actor with a number of film credits to his name. Among his most notable films as an actor are \\"Under Secret Orders\\" (1937) and \\"Saraband for Dead Lovers\\" (1948). Glenville later transitioned to film directing, with his directorial debut being \\"The Prisoner\\" (1955), followed by other successful films such as \\"Becket\\" (1964) and \\"Hotel Paradiso\\" (1966). He was known for his ability to bring theatrical sensibilities to his film work, often adapting stage plays for the big screen. Ridley Scott (born in 1937) pursued a different path in the film industry compared to Glenville. Scott started his career as a set designer, eventually transitioning to directing television commercials. His directorial breakthrough came with the feature film \\"The Duellists\\" (1977), but it was his 1979 science fiction masterpiece \\"Alien\\" that solidified his status as a major director in Hollywood.

Notably, he has also worked with his late brother Tony Scott, who was a renowned director and producer as well. In conclusion, Peter Glenville is an English film and stage actor who later became a director, while Ridley Scott is an English director and producer primarily known for his work in films.

Blank (John Cusack) finds himself depressed and irritable, dissatisfied with his work and the increasing competition from rival assassins, including Grocer (Dan Aykroyd), whose efforts to cartelize the business puts him at potentially lethal odds with the solitary Martin. Following a botched contract, Martin receives an invitation to his 10 year high school reunion in his home town of Grosse Pointe, Michigan. Initially reluctant to attend, he is pressured into it by both his (understandably nervous) therapist (Alan Arkin) and his secretary (Joan Cusack), already booking him for a contract to re-establish ties with a disgruntled client over the botched contract.Upon arriving in Grosse Pointe, Martin seeks out Debi Newberry (Minnie Driver), now a radio DJ, whom Martin had abandoned on prom night to enlist in the Army. While Debi's visit suggests hope for redemption, Martin's subsequent visit to his family only heightens his depression; his father is dead, his mother is an emotionally disturbed resident of a nursing home and his childhood home has been demolished and replaced with a convenience store. Reconnecting with friends like Paul (Jeremy Piven) is likewise depressing, as many have integrated themselves with the local community through mundane establishment jobs. When asked about his livelihood, Martin readily reveals that he is a professional killer, a response taken as a joke by everyone he meets. Meanwhile Martin is being stalked by rival hitmen, including Grocer and Felix LaPoubelle (Benny Urquidez), a Basque terrorist hired to kill him; as well as two awkward National Security Agency agents (Hank Azaria and K.

Her fervor for dissecting the literary work was fueled by her passion for the subject, as well as her desire to excel in the class. Indeed, the result of Angela's hard work and dedication was a book review that captured the essence of the novel and showcased her deep understanding of its intricacies. Her critique was well-structured, containing a seamless narrative flow, crisp language, and a fine balance between a summary of the novel and her perspectives. Angela was able to engage the reader with thought-provoking questions and stimulate a discourse about the broader implications of the book. Overall, it was an exemplary analysis worthy of admiration. On the other hand, Betty didn't invest the same amount of time or effort into her book review. Instead, she focused on completing the assignment as quickly as possible, merely skimming through the novel and piecing together a summary of the plot. Her review lacked the depth, critical thinking, and creativity Angela demonstrated. Consequently, the readers were left with an overview that failed to address the subtleties and nuances of the book.

Question: What is the collective name of the two one-act plays by Terence Rattigan set in the Beauregard Private Hotel in Bournemouth? Answer:","completion":"The collective name for the two one-act plays by Terence Rattigan, set in the Beauregard Private Hotel in Bournemouth, is \\"Separate Tables.\\" Now, let's delve into more details: \\"Separate Tables\\" is a duo of dramatic plays written by English playwright Terence Rattigan. Published in 1954, both plays happen to take place within the confining walls of the Beauregard Private Hotel in the English seaside town of Bournemouth. The two one-act plays within \\"Separate Tables\\" are titled \\"Table by the Window\\" and \\"Table Number Seven\\". Although they are distinct stories, they are often performed together and share a setting as well as a cast of characters. \\"Table by the Window\\" is the first play in the set and centers around a formerly married couple who unexpectedly reunite at the hotel. The core of the story illustrates their rekindled love and tension after six years of separation, providing an intense exploration of regret, redemption, and the ravages of time. The second play, \\"Table Number Seven,\\" features Major Pollock, a bogus upper-class soldier, and Miss Cooper, a past-her-prime hotel manager. The plot unfolds as Major Pollock's actions lead to scandal, and Miss Cooper is placed on the honorable battlefield to either stand up for him against the attacks of the hotel's moralistic residents or succumb to the pressure of the judgmental society. Rattigan's \\"Separate Tables\\" brilliantly interweaves themes of loneliness, social pretensions, and the struggle for personal connection. The emotional narratives discovered within the hotel's walls underlining Rattigan's astute observations of the human condition. The portrayal of characters who put up false fronts to hide their loneliness and need for companionship makes the plays both poignant and universal. \\"Separate Tables\\" was greeted with immense popularity and acclaim and has been adapted for both film and television. In 1958, it was made into a successful film securing several Academy Awards nominations, winning for best actor and actress. Its influence has greatly impacted the landscape of modern theater and served as an inspiration for numerous later works, demonstrating the enduring legacy of Rattigan's plays."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case suggests that if there is less human interference in the environment, it may affect the support of the eggs within the bird's nest. To understand whether this perturbation has a direct or indirect effect on the process, let's examine each step of the nesting process and potential impacts of reduced human interference: 1. A bird picks a high spot, often in a tree: With less human interference, the availability of natural nesting sites may increase, providing birds with more ideal locations to build their nests. 2. The bird collects bits of sticks and grass: Less human interference in the environment can lead to increased vegetation growth, giving birds access to a wider variety of materials and improving the overall quality of these materials. 3. The sticks and grasses are placed between support branches: With less human interference, there could be more healthy tree growth, providing better structural support for nests. 4. Leaves, mud, and spider webs are added to the sticks: If ecosystems are less disturbed by human activity, this could lead to increased availability and quality of these materials as well. 5. The mud, leaves, and webs glue the sticks together: This step may not be directly affected by less human interference, as the birds are already utilizing abundant natural materials in the previous steps. 6. The solid nest supports the eggs: With access to better materials and locations, the nests may indeed be more structurally sound and supportive for the eggs. However, this is dependent on factors like increased vegetation growth and healthier ecosystems as a result of less human interference. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of less human interference in the environment can have an indirect effect on the nesting process. Reduced interference can potentially lead to healthier ecosystems, improved nesting locations, and an increase in the availability and quality of nesting materials, which could provide better support for the eggs. However, this association is not direct, as the positive outcomes rely on the assumption that ecosystem health and material availability will improve with less human interference."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This ideal location is essential for the owl to successfully hunt, as it provides a vantage point from which it can patiently watch for any movement or listen for any sounds indicating the presence of potential prey in the area. Sitting still on a perch offers various advantages for the owl: firstly, it conserves energy by not constantly flying around searching for prey. Secondly, it allows the owl to remain camouflaged and blend into its environment, making it almost invisible to potential prey. This makes it easier for the owl to surprise and capture its target once it is located. While perched, the owl employs its highly sensitive hearing to detect prey, even when they cannot be seen. Owls have an exceptional ability to hear the faintest sounds and determine their location. Their ears are asymmetrically positioned on their heads, which helps them pinpoint the exact direction of the sound source more accurately than if their ears were symmetrical. Furthermore, the facial disk of feathers around an owl's eyes and ears acts as a parabolic reflector, directing the sound towards their ears and amplifying it. In addition to their excellent hearing, owls also have keen vision that allows them to see prey in the dark. Their eyes contain a high number of rod cells, which are particularly sensitive to low light conditions. This enables them to detect movement and see their prey even in near darkness. Once the owl has located its prey using its highly-developed senses, it begins the hunting process by silently flying towards it without flapping its wings. The specially designed feathers of an owl enable it to glide silently through the air, minimizing the noise produced by its flight. This helps the owl remain undetected and allows it to surprise its prey. The owl then silently glides or drops on its prey, extending its sharp talons to grab and immobilize the target. Once the prey is secured in its powerful grip, the owl may use its strong beak to deliver a fatal blow. Finally, upon capturing the prey, the owl either consumes it immediately on the spot or carries it back to its perch for consumption. This entire process showcases how the owl's unique adaptations and hunting techniques enable it to be one of the most effective predators in the animal kingdom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: This hypothesis of migration after formation is favoured, due to its ability to better explain the occupancy of the populations of small objects observed in the trans-Neptunian region. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"Answer: The most widely accepted explanation of Neptune's formation is called the \\"core accretion\\" model, which is further supported by the \\"Nice model\\" that describes the migration of the giant planets after their formation. Both these models work in conjunction to provide a comprehensive understanding of the formation and current position of Neptune in our solar system. The core accretion model posits that Neptune formed through the gradual accumulation of solid particles in the early stages of the solar system's development. This process began approximately 4.6 billion years ago, when the Sun and its surrounding protoplanetary disk consisted primarily of gas and dust. Over millions of years, dust particles in this disk began to clump together, forming increasingly larger bodies. As these bodies grew larger, their gravitational pull became stronger, allowing them to attract even more solid particles and creating a positive feedback loop. Over time, this process led to the formation of planetary cores – massive solid objects that would eventually become the seeds for the formation of the giant planets like Neptune. When the cores reached a critical mass, they began to attract the surrounding gas, forming massive envelopes around them. This gas ultimately led to the creation of Neptune's thick atmosphere, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, with traces of other volatile compounds like methane, ammonia, and water. The Nice model, named after the French city where it was first proposed, builds upon the core accretion model by providing an explanation for the migration of the giant planets, including Neptune, after their formation. According to this model, the giant planets initially formed closer together and migrated to their current positions over millions of years due to gravitational interactions with the surrounding gas and debris in the protoplanetary disk. These interactions caused the giant planets to migrate outward in the solar system. In the case of Neptune, it is believed to have initially formed closer to the sun, at a similar distance to Uranus, and then gradually moved outwards to its current position. This hypothesis of migration after formation is favored due to its ability to better explain the populations of small celestial objects observed in the vast trans-Neptunian region, beyond Neptune's orbit, such as the Kuiper Belt and scattered disc objects. In summary, the most widely accepted explanation of Neptune's formation is a combination of the core accretion model and the Nice model, which together provide a detailed understanding of how the planet formed and migrated to its current position in the solar system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: A Nobel Prize is considered by most people one of the highest international honours a person can receive. As you know, the prizes were started by a Swede called Alfred Nobel. He was born in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. Alfred Nobel was a great scientist. He made two important inventions, and so he became very rich. Although he was rich, Nobel was not a happy man. He never married or had children. Also, he was a sick man during his large part of life. When he died at the age of 63, he left a fund of 9,000,000. The money was to be used in giving prizes to those who made great achievements in physics, chemistry , medicine and literature , and for world peace. The first Nobel Prizes were given on December 10, 1901, five years after Nobel's death. Since then many famous people from all over the world have been given Nobel Prizes for their achievements. Each prize has three parts. The first part is a gold medal. Second, a winner of a Nobel Prize is given a certificate saying that he has been given the prize. The third part of the prize is a large amount of money-about 40,000. Often a prize is given to just one person, but not always. Sometimes a prize is shared. It may be given to two or more people who have worked together. It is also sometimes true that a prize is not given at all if there is no great achievement. In 1972, for example, no Nobel Peace Prize was given. What kind of person would you say Alfred Nobel was? A) He was a rich, happy and lucky man. B) He was a poor, unhappy and unlucky man.

Positive aspects highlighted in the reviews include the actors' dance talent, entertaining dance numbers, and a good supporting cast. Critics complimented the movie for its verve, fancy footwork, and the ability to hold attention despite a familiar plot. Additionally, lead actors Tatum and Dewan were praised for their likability and chemistry. On the other hand, several reviews pointed out the lack of originality and innovation in the story. Critics found the film to be a predictable dance melodrama with little to recommend it and even labeled it as \\"lowest-common-denominator stuff.\\" A few reviews also mentioned poor direction and an underutilization of the movie's potential.

Remove seed. Combine a cup of sugar and 2T cinnamon and enough water to make a paste. Brush the peach flesh with the sugar mixture and cook directly on the grill until soft.\\" This option is more reasonable for accomplishing your goal of cooking peaches on the grill because the amount of cinnamon used in the second option (2 tablespoons) is more appropriate than the first option (1 cup). Using a cup of cinnamon would result in an overpowering cinnamon flavor, whereas 2 tablespoons of cinnamon would provide a more balanced taste. Here's a detailed analysis of the method described in the second option: 1. Wash the peaches: Start by thoroughly rinsing the peaches under cool running water to remove any dirt, bacteria, or debris from the fruit's surface. You can also use a soft brush for a more thorough cleaning. 2. Cut the peaches in half and remove the seed: Hold the peach vertically, and use a sharp knife to cut along the natural seam and around the pit on one side, then twist the two sides apart. Gently remove the pit from the peach half. You can also use a spoon or your fingers to pry the pit out. 3. Prepare the sugar-cinnamon paste: In a small bowl, combine 1 cup of sugar and 2 tablespoons of cinnamon. Slowly add water and mix until you have a thick but brushable paste. The exact amount of water will vary, but start with a tablespoon of water and add more as needed. 4. Brush the peach flesh with the sugar mixture: Using a pastry brush or a clean, food-safe brush, apply the sugar-cinnamon paste generously onto the flesh side of the peach halves. You can also spoon the mixture onto the peaches and spread it with the back of the spoon. 5. Preheat the grill: Preheat your grill to medium heat (about 350°F), and ensure that the grates are clean and well-oiled to prevent the peaches from sticking. 6. Cook the peaches directly on the grill: Place the peach halves, flesh side down, directly onto the grill grates. Cook the peaches for about 4-5 minutes or until the flesh is soft and caramelized, and they have developed nice grill marks. You can use a spatula to flip the peaches and cook on the skin side for an additional 2-3 minutes, but this step is optional. 7. Serve the grilled peaches: Once the peaches are cooked, remove them from the grill and transfer them to a platter or individual serving dishes. Enjoy the grilled peaches on their own or top with whipped cream, ice cream, or a drizzle of honey. This method of cooking peaches on the grill is a delicious and unique way to enjoy a summer dessert, and using the proper sugar-to-cinnamon ratio, as suggested in the second option, ensures a more balanced and pleasing flavor in each bite."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: (CNN) -- While the United Nations' Security Council wrangled over growing tensions in the Korean peninsula, South Korea ordered thousands to find shelter in preparation for the South's planned live-fire military exercises, which could take place within hours, the military announced. In South Korea, an approximate 8,000 residents have been ordered to take cover in Yeonpyeong, Baengnyeong, Daecheong, Socheong and Udo as the hours draw closer to South Korea's military drill, scheduled to take place at 11 p.m. EST Sunday, 1 p.m. Monday local time. North Korea said over the weekend that the planned exercises were designed to violate the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953 and \\"ignite war at any cost.\\" See more of CNN.com's special coverage of the Koreas At the United Nations, nearly eight hours of emergency Security Council talks on the standoff ended Sunday without a unified statement. Susan Rice, the U.S. Ambassador to the United States said Sunday that council members still cannot bridge any difference over North Korea's November 23rd attack on Yeonpyeong island. Four South Koreans were killed in the attack. The United States has publicly condemned the attacks by the Communist north and insists on South Korea's right to conduct its scheduled military drill. \\"The planned exercises are fully consistent with South Korea's legal right to self-defense,\\" Rice said. \\"It has been done and notified transparently, responsibly, and will not occur in a fashion that we believe gives North Korea any excuse to respond in the fashion that it has threatened to do.\\" Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin -- who called for the emergency session over the weekend to defuse the crisis -- warned darkly that the world could be faced with a \\"serious conflict\\" within hours, and that the international community has \\"no game plan on the diplomatic side.\\" \\"Within hours there may be a serious aggravation of tension -- a serious conflict, for that matter,\\" he said. Churkin told reporters that Moscow continues to call for restraint on both sides, but said the Security Council had been \\"not entirely successful\\" in reaching consensus among its 15 members. He disclosed few details of the session, but said members disagreed over whether to include a condemnation of the North Korean shelling, which left four dead. Across the Demilitarized Zone, the heavily fortified border set up by the 1953 armistice, South Korean workers were being barred from entering the Kaesong Industrial Complex, the country's Unification Ministry reported. The factory district is the last remnant of South Korea's \\"Sunshine Policy\\" of encouraging links with the communist North. Bill Richardson, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Monday he was \\"extremely worried\\" that North Korea will respond militarily to the exercises. Richardson has been meeting with high-level officials on an unofficial, four-day trip to North Korea. Russia requested Sunday's emergency Security Council meeting and proposed a draft statement, proposing amendments which Western nations said would place more of the blame on North Korea, diplomats said. But they said the major holdout was China, the North's closest ally, which refuses to agree on any statement that even mentions the Yeonpyeong shelling. Russia and China, both permanent Security Council members, have asked South Korea to reconsider its planned drills. Sunday's closed-door session was held with representatives of both North and South Korea present and speaking. Earlier, a South Korean military official told the country's state-run Yonhap news agency that Seoul would not be deterred by threats from the North. \\"The planned firing drill is part of the usual exercises conducted by our troops based on Yeonpyeong Island. The drill can be justifiable, as it will occur within our territorial waters,\\" the official said. Tensions between the two Koreas have been high since the North fired upon the island last month, killing two marines and two civilians. The South Korean military had said Thursday that the exercises would take place in the seas southwest of the island between December 18 and 21, but adverse weather forced a delay Saturday. \\"We won't take into consideration North Korean threats and diplomatic situations before holding the live-fire drill. If weather permits, it will be held as scheduled,\\" the military official said. Meanwhile, North Korea was beefing up its military forces on its west coast ahead of the South's planned drills, Yonhap reported, citing a South Korean government official. \\"The North Korean artillery unit along the Yellow Sea has raised its preparedness level,\\" the source said. Yeonpyeong is located in the Yellow Sea, just south of the Northern Limit Line -- the maritime boundary drawn in 1953 by the United Nations just after the Korean War. The line is three nautical miles from the North Korean coast. In the absence of a full peace agreement between the two Koreas, the Northern Limit Line remains in place. North Korea has suggested an alternative line, but South Korea has resisted, as it would bring the North's maritime boundary close to Incheon, a main port. A North Korean spokesman over the weekend said that the planned military exercises were a \\"sinister design\\" to violate the Korea Armistice Agreement and \\"ignite war at any cost.\\" \\"The shelling to be perpetrated by the puppet forces of south Korea at last, trespassing on the prohibiting line would make it impossible to prevent the situation on the Korean Peninsula from exploding and escape its ensuing disaster,\\" the spokesman said, according to North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency. North Korea blamed the United States for allegedly egging on the South Koreans. North Korea \\"will force the U.S. to pay dearly for all the worst situations prevailing on the peninsula and its ensuing consequences,\\" the spokesman said. CNN's Jiyeon Lee in Seoul and Richard Roth and Whitney Hurst at the United Nations contributed to this report. ||||| Yeonpyeong Island, South Korea (CNN) -- Amid South Korean plans to hold live-fire military drills this week and North Korean threats of retaliation, many residents of Yeonpyeong Island are evacuating, afraid of being caught in the middle. Villagers streamed onto what they believed was the last ferry to Incheon, South Korea, on Sunday, carrying what belongings they could. Some were holding their children as others helped the elderly. \\"I'm leaving because they said the drills are tomorrow,\\" said Kim Ok Jin, 66. Kim said the island was once a good place to live and she does not want to leave. \\"Of course I'm angry,\\" she said. \\"But that's not going to change anything.\\" See more of CNN.com's special coverage of the Koreas Many Yeonpyeong residents are evacuating for a second time. This time, however, they have warning. On November 23, they had none before North Korea began shelling the island. Two civilians and two South Korean Marines died in the attack. The South Korean military said Thursday that its drills will take place in the seas southwest of Yeonpyeong Island between December 18 and 21, but bad weather forced a delay Saturday. South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported the drills will take place Monday or Tuesday in the Yellow Sea off the island. As villagers departed, few signs of life remained on the island -- only military trucks patrolling and waiting for possible North Korean retaliation for the drills. Not everyone on Yeonpyeong, however, was leaving. Song Young Ok said she has not been told to stop selling tickets for the ferry off the island, and doesn't know when the military drills will take place. Song said she is planning to stay put, holed up along with others in a military bunker. She said she doesn't know why it has to be this way -- if South Korea carries out the drills, North Korea has threatened to retaliate even more strongly. South Korea's insistence on conducting the drills is picking a fight, she said. Others were more optimistic. \\"It's OK,\\" said ferry passenger Lee Chun Nyeo, 83. \\"The soldiers need to do (the exercises), right?\\" Yeonpyeong is located just south of the Northern Limit Line, the line drawn in 1953 by the United Nations just after the Korean War. The U.N. drew the line three nautical miles from the North Korean coast and put five islands close to the coast under South Korean control. That was supposed to be a temporary arrangement. But in the absence of a full peace agreement, the Northern Limit Line remains in place. North Korea has suggested an alternative line, but South Korea has resisted, as it would bring the North's maritime boundary close to Incheon, a main port. Waters in the Yellow Sea are important for fishing and crab. For North Korean fishermen especially, the blue crab season between June and September is an important source of income. Crabs have a habit of migrating south during that time, so the water is sometimes crowded with boats from both countries, as well as vessels from China. However, the Yellow Sea has seen armed clashes in the past few years, the most serious of them in 1999 and 2002. China and Russia have asked South Korea to reconsider holding the drills. Russia called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Sunday.

Options: (A). No (B). Yes Answer:","completion":"(A). No A detailed answer would be: The value of a Japanese yen coin depends on the denomination. There are six denominations of yen coins currently in circulation: 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, and 500 yen. Regarding the description you provided, it corresponds to the 5-yen coin. The 5-yen coin is made of brass (a combination of copper and zinc) and is sometimes referred to as \\"go-en\\" in Japanese, which is a homophone for \\"good luck\\" or \\"good relationship.\\" The front side of the coin features a rice plant growing out of the water with the denomination \\"五円\\" (five yen) written in kanji. The back side of the coin shows a gear symbolizing industry, \\"日本\\" (Japan), and the year of issue written in kanji, separated by the sprouts of a tree, which represents agriculture and fisheries.

In over 50 years on the stage, Mei Lanfang played no less than 100 different characters in the performance. He also wrote many new plays, designing the dances himself. The many dances he created form part of the great treasure that he left to Peking Opera. In 1930, Mei Lanfang started on a successful US tour. There his brilliant performances impressed the audience, making them realize that Peking Opera was a theatrical form of great value.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Who is the brother of John's ex-girlfriend interested in? Set in the early 1930s, Larita meets John Whittaker in Monaco. They marry and he takes his bride to the family mansion near Flintham in rural Nottinghamshire to meet his mother, Veronica Whittaker and father, Major Jim Whittaker and his two sisters, Hilda and Marion. Veronica, already predisposed to dislike her new daughter-in-law, is further disappointed to find that she, like Jim, speaks fluent French. Larita also meets John's former girlfriend and neighbour Sarah Hurst, who is gracious about the marriage. Larita makes some inadvertent gaffes, accidentally killing the family chihuahua and giving some joking advice to Hilda that unfortunately results in embarrassment to, and enmity from, the sisters. Sarah comes to the Whittakers' parties, and to play tennis, accompanied by her brother Philip, on whom Hilda has a crush. Philip, however, is infatuated with Larita, which further angers Hilda. Larita reveals she has been previously married and remains calm in the face of her mother-in-law's disdain. To Larita's disappointment, John is not eager to leave the estate so that they can find a home of their own. Larita is bored and miserable in the countryside and hates blood sports like hunting, and any of the entertainment that country English people seem to enjoy. She reads Lady Chatterley's Lover, shocking the female relatives, and she will not play tennis. She dislikes Veronica's stuffy decor, her constant entertaining of her friends, and the overcooked food. She tries to get along with Veronica who refuses to accept her and resents her attempts to bring American traditions into the home.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? To start a garden without pots for seed starters.","completion":"To start a garden without pots for seed starters, one could follow these steps: Step 1: Gather materials Collect the necessary materials to create an alternative to pots. Some options include: - Recycled materials such as egg cartons, toilet paper rolls, or plastic containers (e.g., yogurt cups) - Soil blocks created using a soil block maker - Biodegradable materials like peat pots, coco coir pots, or rolled newspapers Step 2: Choose a location Find a suitable location for your garden. Look for an area with at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day and good drainage. Step 3: Prepare the soil Prep your soil for planting by removing any debris, turning it over with a garden fork, and amending it with compost if necessary. Step 4: Plant the seeds For recycled materials, fill them with seed starting mix and plant the seeds according to the packet's directions. Place these makeshift pots in a sunny window or under a grow light. For soil blocks, mix equal parts compost, peat moss, and vermiculite, and then add water until the mix holds together. Use a soil block maker to form blocks and place them on a tray. Plant the seeds according to the packet's directions. For biodegradable materials, fill them with seed starting mix, plant the seeds, and place the biodegradable pots in a sunny window or under a grow light. Step 5: Provide proper care Keep the soil moist and provide adequate light for the seeds to germinate. Lightly fertilize with a diluted liquid fertilizer every two weeks after the seedlings have their first set of true leaves. Step 6: Transplant outdoors After the last frost date, harden off seedlings for about a week, gradually exposing them to outdoor conditions. This helps the plants acclimate to the outdoor environment before transplanting. Step 7: Prepare the garden bed Dig holes for your seedlings and amend the soil as needed. If you used biodegradable materials, simply plant the entire pot into the ground; if you used a soil block, plant the block directly into the soil. Step 8: Plant your seedlings Place each seedling in a hole, and backfill with soil, ensuring that the seedlings are at the same ground level as they were in their makeshift pots. Step 9: Water and maintain Water your plants well after transplanting and continue to provide sufficient water and nutrients throughout their growth. Regularly check for pests and diseases, and address them as necessary. Step 10: Harvest Once your plants have matured, enjoy the fruits of your labor by harvesting your garden's bounty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Calling for a “world of true data liberation,” Google labeled the social networking site a “data dead end” because users can’t easily export their contact data from the site. The search giant said only sites that shared its stance on data export would have access to its contacts feed. But over at Facebook, a little hacking dodged a bullet. Using the services provided by Google’s Data Liberation Front, Facebook began allowing users to download their Gmail contacts, then upload them, all without leaving the social network. Google fired back, saying it was “disappointed” but would keep allowing users to export contacts. Expand this summary.","completion":"Last week, Google took a stand against Facebook's data export policies by preventing Facebook users from importing their Gmail contacts directly to the social media platform. This move was fueled by Google's disagreement with Facebook's approach to data sharing, as the search engine giant accused Facebook of being a \\"data dead end\\" where user contact information could not be easily exported from the site. Google strongly supports a \\"world of true data liberation\\" and thus, announced that only websites that share its belief in open data export practices would be granted access to its contacts feed. Despite Google's decision, Facebook effortlessly found a workaround to this imposed limitation. Utilizing the services provided by Google's Data Liberation Front, an initiative that allows users to move their data in and out of Google products, Facebook implemented a way for its users to download their Gmail contacts and subsequently upload them directly to the social network, all without leaving the Facebook site. This was possible through a bit of hacking on Facebook's part and in-effect, circumventing the imposed restriction. Google responded to this development expressing disappointment in Facebook's actions, but at the same time, they remained committed to allowing users to export their Gmail contacts. This highlights the ongoing battle between Google and Facebook over data sharing and open internet practices. While both companies acknowledge the importance of allowing users control over their data, disagreements over the implementation and policies governing these practices continue to create tensions between the two tech giants. The standoff between Google and Facebook has significant implications for users, as it showcases the challenges faced when attempting to balance privacy, data ownership, and ease of use across different platforms. As these online giants continue this tug-of-war over data sharing and user ownership, the primary concern should be centered around upholding user interests and ensuring a free, open, and secure internet experience for all. In summary, Google's decision to block Facebook users from importing Gmail contacts was met with a swift workaround by the social media site, further intensifying the ongoing clash between these two tech giants. As both companies strive to gain control over user data while maintaining their commitment to data liberation and user privacy, the ultimate focus should be directed towards prioritizing user interests and providing the best possible online experience."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Date night: The pair apparently spent three hours enjoying each other's company over dinner Dressed to impress: Katy wore a cute white lace dress for the evening out It's not the first time the couple have been romantically linked, as they were first said to be dating back in 2009 when Katy apparently 'made it her mission' to get closer to the Gravity singer. The new relationship between the pair comes after Katy's divorce from British comedian Russell Brand was made official last month. And in a recent interview with Elle magazine, Katy admitted that despite her divorce, she still believes in love. Keeping her head down: Katy attempted to make a quiet exit from the restaurant, but failed miserably Asked what she wants from her love life, Katy said: 'I'm a woman who likes to be courted, strongly. Never say never, I guess you'd say. I'll let love take the lead on that.' Since her split from Brand, Katy has been linked to male model Baptiste Giabiconi and Florence And The Machine guitarist Rob Ackroyd. Meanwhile, Brand is now dating Isabella Brewster, the sister of Dallas actress Jordana, after the pair met at his yoga class. John is no stranger to being in the limelight thanks to his celebrity relationships. As well as enjoying long-term relationships with Minka Kelly, Jessica Simpson and Jennifer Aniston, John has also dated Jennifer Love Hewitt and Taylor Swift. However, his relationship with Taylor didn't end too well as the teenager later penned a song about their brief romance, entitled Dear John. And John later said he was 'humiliated' by the song, telling Rolling Stone magazine: 'It made me feel terrible. Because I didn't deserve it. I'm pretty good at taking accountability now, and I never did anything to deserve that. 'It was a really lousy thing for her to do.' ||||| Katy Perry and John Mayer were spotted leaving the Chateau Marmont together Wednesday night, and although the snapshots do not a relationship make, they're certainly an indicator that the pair are more than just friends. Neither Perry nor Mayer has confirmed a relationship, but the pair looked cozy as they made their way through what seemed to be a date night. After dining at Pace in Los Angeles, a newly divorced Perry and Jennifer Aniston's ex headed to Hollywood's celebrity couple hotspot, Chateau Marmont. The pair were first spotted together last month when they stepped out for a slice of pizza.

A:","completion":"Based on the given review, \\"Junk Phit\\", it appears to be a negative statement, suggesting that the app may not be a good choice for recommending to a friend. However, one review should not be the sole determining factor for deciding whether or not to recommend an app. To provide a more accurate recommendation, I would consider the following factors: 1. Overall ratings and user feedback: Consult the app store or any reputable platform where the app has been reviewed by numerous users. Higher ratings and more positive reviews would contribute to a stronger recommendation. 2. App's features and benefits: Evaluate the app's features and the benefits it brings to users. If the app aligns with the interests and objectives of your friend, then it might be worth recommending. 3. Pricing and in-app purchases: Take note of any costs associated with the app, including the purchase price or in-app purchases. Ensure that you consider your friend's budget and willingness to spend on an app before recommending it to them. 4. User-friendliness and design: Assess the app's user interface, navigation, and overall design. An intuitive and visually appealing app would be more enjoyable and practical for your friend to use. 5. Updates and support: Check whether the app receives regular updates from its developer, and if there's good customer support available to handle any issues or concerns users may have. Given these factors, I cannot provide a conclusive answer solely based on the review submitted. I would suggest doing further research on the app, taking into account the factors mentioned above, to make a more informed decision on whether you should recommend the app to your friend or not. If you find that the app has numerous positive reviews, aligns well with your friend's interests, and has a reasonable pricing model, then it might be worth considering a \\"Maybe\\" or \\"Yes\\" recommendation.

Please answer a question about the following article about Universal Studios: In 2006, after almost 80 years, NBC Universal sold all Walt Disney-produced Oswald cartoons, along with the rights to the character himself, back to Disney. In return, Disney released ABC sportscaster Al Michaels from his contract so he could work on NBC's Sunday night NFL football package. However, Universal retained ownership of Oswald cartoons produced for them by Walter Lantz from 1929 to 1943. Who began producing Oswald cartoons for Universal in 1929?","completion":"Walter Lantz began producing Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoons for Universal Studios in 1929. He was an American animator, cartoonist, director, and producer who was already known for his work in the animation industry. After Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks, the original creators of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, lost the rights to the character in a contract dispute with Universal Studios, Walter Lantz was tasked with taking over the production of the Oswald cartoons. Under Lantz's direction, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit underwent several changes in design and personality, leading the character to evolve significantly from its original Disney iteration. Walter Lantz continued to produce Oswald cartoons for Universal Studios until 1943, creating a long-lasting legacy for the character in the world of animation. It is essential to also recognize that even though Disney regained the rights to Walt Disney-produced Oswald cartoons, Universal Studios retained ownership of the Oswald cartoons produced by Walter Lantz from 1929 to 1943, thereby maintaining a part of Oswald's history separate from Walt Disney's creative contributions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

England and Wales were chosen as the hosts for this prestigious international cricket tournament, which took place from May 30th to July 14th, 2019. This was the 12th edition of the Cricket World Cup, an event held every four years and organized by the International Cricket Council (ICC). England and Wales were awarded the hosting rights for the 2019 Cricket World Cup in April 2006. This event marked the fifth time that England had hosted the Cricket World Cup, with previous editions held in 1975, 1979, 1983, and 1999. The tournament was played across multiple cricket grounds and stadiums in both England and Wales, showcasing the beautiful and diverse geography of these two countries. Some of the primary venues that were used during the 2019 Cricket World Cup included the iconic Lord's Cricket Ground in London, the Oval in London, Edgbaston in Birmingham, Old Trafford in Manchester, Trent Bridge in Nottingham, Headingley in Leeds, and the Cardiff Wales Stadium in Cardiff, among others. The 2019 Cricket World Cup featured a total of ten teams, including England, Australia, Bangladesh, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, and the West Indies. The format of the tournament involved round-robin matches, where each team played the other nine teams once. At the conclusion of these matches, the top four teams advanced to the semi-finals, and the winners of the semi-finals competed in the final match to determine the World Cup champion. The final match of the 2019 Cricket World Cup was held on July 14th, 2019, at the Lord's Cricket Ground in London. In a thrilling and nail-biting final, England faced off against New Zealand.

They’re young, small and raring to go at Biotech Showcase 2015 in San Francisco this week SAN FRANCISCO — Frank Reynolds stood before two dozen investors in a windowless conference room not much bigger than a closet Tuesday, talking about his 12-person Medford, Mass., startup and the nerve-blocking pain treatment that it is working on. He wasn’t lacking for confidence. “The market is monstrous,” Reynolds, chief executive of PixarBioCorp., told his audience as they sipped coffee and tapped on tablet computers. “It’s probably a 20 billion market. We have one competitor, and we’ll just crush them.” Welcome to Biotech Showcase 2015, the farm system of the life sciences industry. Just a few blocks from Union Square, where Wall Street dealmakers are taking measure of the biopharmaceutical giants at the annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, bootstrapped companies too young or too small to be invited to present to the big boys come here to make their pitches in the hopes of reaching investors in town for the larger event. “We call it the petri dish,” said Mark T. Williams, a finance and economics professor at Boston University’s School of Management. “It’s a real laboratory, below the radar. These are companies that feel they are at the core of what biotech is all about. They’re solving problems in life sciences.” Biotech Showcase, a seven-year-old partnering conference hosted by EBD Group, is held at the Parc 55 Wyndham hotel. It is a five-minute walk from the elegant Westin St. Francis, where thousands of investors in pin-striped suits cram into ornate ballrooms at the J.P. Morgan conference. It is also a different world, less formal and more entrepreneurial. Representatives from biotech startups, investors and pharmaceutical companies prepared to meet in the partnering booths. In an exhibition area, Collin Burger, business development associate for San Diego contract research manufacturer Pharmatek Laboratories Inc., handed out freebie pens and cellphone attachments while showing off vials of pills and powder that his company can supply to drug developers. “Our customers are pretty much in Boston and San Francisco,” Burger said, deadpan. The two cities are the nation’s top biotech centers. More than 2,000 people registered for Biotech Showcase, one of several conferences and other events that have sprung up here this week to piggyback on the J.P. Morgan gathering. They listened to the stories spun by chief executives of companies from as far away as the Netherlands and Australia. “We’re a new company focused on new technology,” said Tom Barnes, chief scientific officer of Intellia Therapeutics Inc., a gene-editing startup launched in Cambridge last summer by the venture capital firm Atlas Venture and backed by a Swiss drug giant, Novartis AG. “We’re not a build-to-buy company. We have an ambition to be around for a while and sell therapeutics.” Seth Yakatan (left), chairman of Mercury Therapeutics in Woburn, meets with Lynn Cho (center) and Steven Kim (right) of CrystalGenomics. While the company is licensing technology from a lab at the University of California Berkeley, Barnes assured his audience it will bring all the resources of the Greater Boston biosciences cluster — including a partnership with the Novartis research headquarters in Cambridge — to its work. “We have some research capabilities in San Francisco, but we have 15,000 square feet of research space in Cambridge that’s ready to go now,” he said. Elizabeth Gabitzsch, vice president of research at Etubics Corp., an early-stage Seattle company, said it had raised 23 million — much of it from the US government — to fund development of an Ebola vaccine and cancer drugs. “Our Ebola vaccine is in clinical studies,” she told prospective investors. “We’ll have some data by the end of the year. If all goes well, we’ll be in pre-clinical discussions” with regulators from the Food and Drug Administration. A Canadian startup, Medicenna Therapeutics Inc., of Vancouver, B.C., is trying to raise 20 million to fund development of drugs to treat blood cancers and solid tumors. It is not J.P. Morgan, but those enrolled in the Biotech Showcase forum got Starbucks gift cards on their way out of the hotel lobby as a show of thanks. For many, just being in San Francisco on a week when this city becomes the biopharma capital of the world is enough. Getting their stories before investors is the icing on the cake. “We watch every penny,” PixarBio’s Reynolds assured his audience. “My parents were Irish immigrants and we watched every penny.” What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about the Biotech Showcase 2015 event in San Francisco.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was offered a song on the condition that he release it as his next single? from the following article ? Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it's a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it.

If you have the wish and really make a self-effort, then you can quite easily improve your ability to remember things. But even if you are successful, there are times when your memory seems to play tricks on you. Sometimes you remember things that did not happen. One morning last week, for example, I got up and found that I had left the front door unlocked all night, yet I clearly remembered locking it carefully the night before. Memory \\"trick\\" works the other way as well. Once in a while you remember not doing something, and then find out that you did. One day last month, for example, I was sitting in a barber shop waiting for my turn to get a haircut, and suddenly I realized that I had got a haircut two days before at the barber shop across the street from my office. We always seem to find something funny in incidents caused by people's forgetfulness or absent-mindedness . Stories about absent-minded professors have been told for years, and we never got tired of hearing new ones. Unfortunately, however, absent-mindedness is not always funny. There are times when \\"trick\\" of our memory can cause us great trouble. (words: 169) If you want to have a good memory, _ . A) you should force yourself to remember things B) you should make a self-effort of practice and exercise C) you should never stop learning D) you should try hard to remember things Answer:","completion":"B) you should make a self-effort of practice and exercise Having a good memory indeed requires consistent practice and exercise. It is important to continually challenge your brain with various mental activities to improve the ability to retain and recall information. This can involve various techniques, such as mnemonic devices, visualization, and association, as well as engaging in brain-stimulating activities like solving puzzles, reading, and learning new skills. Memory exercises and practice can help strengthen neural connections in the brain and even create new ones. When your brain is regularly challenged, it becomes more efficient at processing information and can lead to an enhanced ability to remember. This is because the more you practice, the more effectively your brain can find and retrieve stored information. Another aspect of making a self-effort toward improving your memory is understanding your personal learning style and adapting memory techniques accordingly. Some people are visual learners, while others are auditory or kinesthetic learners. Adapting your memory techniques to suit your learning style will improve the effectiveness of the exercises and enhance your ability to remember things more accurately. Furthermore, maintaining a healthy lifestyle can also contribute to better memory. Getting enough sleep, consuming a balanced diet, staying physically active, and managing stress can all have positive effects on your memory overall. Ultimately, having a good memory requires dedication, practice, and self-effort. It is essential to continuously exercise your brain, adapt memory techniques to your specific learning style, and maintain a healthy lifestyle to successfully improve your ability to remember things more effectively. In doing so, incidents of memory \\"tricks\\" or absent-mindedness may decrease, and you will be more confident in your own memory's ability to accurately recall information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Avoid using high heat, as it may scorch the chocolate. b. Put the chopped chocolate into the top pot or a heatproof bowl and place it over the simmering water in the bottom pot. The bottom of the top pot or bowl should not touch the hot water in the bottom pot. c. Stir the chocolate constantly as it melts, ensuring it heats evenly. Once the chocolate is smooth and has fully melted, remove the top pot or bowl from the heat. - Microwave method: a. Place the chopped chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl. b. Microwave the chocolate at 50% power for 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval. c. Repeat this process until the chocolate is smooth and fully melted. 4.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: When the weather is hot, you go to a lake or an ocean. When you are near a lake or an ocean, you feel cool. Why? The sun makes the earth hot, but it can not make the water hot. Though the air over the earth becomes hot, the air over the water stays cool. The hot air over the earth goes up, then the cool air over the water moves in and takes the place of the hot air. When you are near a lake or an ocean, you feel the cool air when _ moves in. You feel the wind and the wind makes you cool. Of course, scientists cannot answer all of our questions. If we ask \\"Why is the ocean full of salt?\\" scientists will say that the salt comes from rocks. When a rock gets very hot or very cool, it cracks , and rain falls into the cracks. The rain then carries the salt into the earth and the rivers. The rivers carry the salt into the ocean. But then we ask \\"What happens to the salt in the ocean? The ocean does not get saltier every year. \\" scientists are not sure about the answer to the question. We know a lot about our world.

The bot's reputation gets it into the top fight against Midas, but Charlie's inexperience and showboating costs him the fight, losing not only the money, but the famous bot.After his last bot becomes trashed, Charlie takes Max to the junkyard to scour parts to try and fix up one of the old bots. After a dangerous fall, Max finds a buried robot, but Charlie doesn't see the potential. Charlie says that he'll consider it if Max digs it up, so Max stays through the night to recover the bot. After getting it to the gym, they reboot it and find out it has a rare Shadow Function, but that is the only piece of value Charlie sees, while Max... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Real Steel\\", after Atom's vocal-respond controls failed, Charlie was forced to take a more hands-on approach during the fights. He had to use the robot's shadow function, which allowed Atom to mimic Charlie's movements, to control the robot manually instead of relying on the vocal commands. This led Charlie to dig into his past experience as a boxer to control Atom effectively during the fights. With the shadow function, Atom was able to learn and implement Charlie's movements in the ring. This allowed Charlie and Max to develop a unique fighting style for Atom that combined both the efficient boxing skillset of Charlie and the nimble agility of the robot itself. As they trained Atom together, both Charlie and Max started to build a bond that brought them closer together as father and son. Throughout the film, Charlie, Max, and Atom participate in several robot fights and face various opponents, eventually culminating in a fight against Zeus, the world champion robot. In the final battle, Charlie and Atom put up a strong fight, but Zeus's power and advanced technology push them to the edge. However, with their teamwork, resilience, and the unique bond between Charlie and Atom, they manage to stand their ground. Although the film ends with a match judged to be a close loss for Atom, the fight earns the robot the admiration of the onlookers, while Charlie is redeemed and his relationship with Max strengthened. Ultimately, the failure of Atom's vocal-respond controls forced Charlie to engage with his son and their robot on a deeper level, leading to both personal growth and a strengthening of the familial bond."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Kobe Bryant says “only an idiot” would doubt he’ll return Kobe Bryant remained in the game Tuesday after hurting his knee. (Justin Ford / USA Today) The news that Kobe Bryant would be sidelined for about six weeks by a fracture of his lateral tibial plateau brought into clearer focus for most people how quickly the end of his career is approaching. Bryant isn’t among those folks, though. “All I can do is do the work,” he told ESPN, “and do everything I can to be back at the highest level.” Bryant will not require surgery, just rest and rehab. To Yahoo’s Adrian Wojnarowski, he was a little bolder, a little more Kobe. “Lucky it wasn’t a meniscus,” he said of the injury to the same leg on which he had surgery to repair a torn Achilles’ in April. He came back from that and he’ll come back from this, saying “only an idiot would” would doubt him. Yo @kobebryant #Mamba get well soon homie! — LeBron James (@KingJames) December 20, 2013 — Kobe Bryant (@kobebryant) December 19, 2013 Thank you my fellow nba brothers for all the luv and support #Respect — Kobe Bryant (@kobebryant) December 20, 2013 Whether it’s the end or the end of Bryant at a stellar level, this much is clear: the end is approaching more quickly than anticipated for Bryant, who, at 35, is in his 18th NBA season. “If this isn’t the end,” Tony Kornheiser put it on “PTI,” “we can see it from here.” Because of the Achilles’ injury his suffered last spring, “[h]is absence already reminded us to pay close attention to the time he has left,” J.A. Adande writes on ESPN.com., “because it might not even be as much as we thought.” Bryant hurt the knee Tuesday night, playing 33 minutes against Memphis.”I just hyperextended it,” Bryant said at the time. “I tend to hyperextend my knees every now and then.” But a hyperextension at 35 is different from one at 25. A six-week estimate for his return seems optimistic, even for Bryant, USA Today’s Sam Amick writes. There’s no way to know what Bryant’s latest injury means just yet, beyond the daunting fact that a 35-year-old who came off one of the most brutal injuries (his April Achilles tendon tear) in existence six games ago will now be out at least six weeks with a fracture in his left knee. And for anyone who’s not familiar with one of these rare fractures of the lateral tibial plateau, consider this: Former Houston Rockets star Yao Ming, who certainly carried a much heavier load, once suffered the same injury in mid-December 2006, and we didn’t see him again until early March 2007. #Lakers Kobe Bryant out 6 wks with lateral tibia plateau fracture.

Police in Myanmar said 13 children died when an electrical fire broke out at the... (Associated Press) Security forces and three trucks of riot police blocked off roads around the scarred building compound in Yangon, which encompasses a mosque, a school and a dormitory. There were no reports of violence, but around 200 Muslim residents gathered uneasily nearby, many expressing suspicions the fire had been set intentionally. Myanmar has been on edge after sectarian unrest between Buddhists and Muslims erupted in the central city of Meikhtila in March, killing dozens of people and displacing more than 12,000. The violence, which has largely targeted Muslims, has since spread to several other towns where extremist Buddhist mobs have torched or ransacked mosques and Muslim-owned property. Police officer Thet Lwin said about 75 children lived in the mosque compound in eastern Yangon, and most escaped safely by running out of a door police knocked open. Other doors appeared to have been locked, but it was not immediately clear why. Security bars blocked most of the white building's windows, which were marked by black smoke in the late morning, hours after firefighters put out the flames. The building had burned from the inside. Mosque member Soe Myint said most of the children, who had been sent to the religious boarding school by their parents, were sleeping on the ground floor when the blaze began and were able to flee. But 16 of them were sleeping in a small loft on the first floor and were trapped when the ladder that led to the loft caught fire. Three boys jumped to safety, he said, and the rest died. Thet Lwin, the policeman who was at the scene before dawn, said the fire was triggered by an electrical short \\"and not due to any criminal activity.\\" Every time he mentioned the word \\"electrical short,\\" though, angry Muslims shouted and began banging on vehicles with their fists. He also appealed on journalists to help. \\"We need the media's support in Yangon. Please don't report that there is conflict in Yangon. We're here to stop conflict,\\" he said. Zaw Min Htun, a member of a local Muslim youth organization, said he raced to the mosque early Tuesday after hearing it was on fire. \\"Muslims are very angry,\\" he said, calling on authorities to investigate what happened. \\"The children are innocent. ... Someone burned the mosque.\\" Zaw Min Htun said he saw no burned wires inside the mosque and said the building's fuse box was in good condition. The recent upsurge in sectarian unrest in Myanmar has cast a shadow over President Thein Sein's administration as it struggles to make democratic changes after a half-century of military rule. His government has warned the violence could threaten the reform process. Hundreds of people were killed last year and more than 100,000 made homeless in sectarian violence in western Myanmar between ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and Muslim Rohingyas. On March 20, unrest hit the central town of Meikhtila for several days and then spread to several villages farther south, near the capital Naypyitaw. The violence had already spooked people in Yangon, where late last month false rumors swirled of mosque burnings and authorities told some businessmen to shutter their shops as a precautionary measure. Yangon is about 550 kilometers (340 miles) south of Meikhtila. ||||| Rangoon school fire: Imam probed for possible negligence Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Continue reading the main story Related Stories A Burmese imam is being investigated for possible negligence after 13 children died in a fire at a Muslim school in Rangoon, police said. Authorities were also quizzing a Muslim teacher in the case, reports said. Police earlier blamed an electrical fault for the blaze. Most of the children escaped unharmed. Riot police were deployed to the area as people gathered, concerned that the fire was linked to recent communal violence in other parts of the country. At least 40 people have been killed since 20 March in the attacks which have mainly targeted minority Muslims. The school's imam and a Muslim teacher were being investigated but no arrests had been made so far, Rangoon police chief Win Naing told the AP news agency. \\"As the two people in charge, they are responsible for this and we have to take action against them,\\" he was quoted as saying. Meanwhile hundreds of people attended the funeral of some of the victims on Tuesday afternoon. Locked doors Earlier, police spokesman Thet Lwin said the two-storey building - part of a mosque - in eastern Rangoon sheltered about 75 orphans. Most of the children escaped by running out of a door after police knocked it open, he said. The school was badly burned. Anxious Muslims gathered near the school fearing it had been attacked The Myanmar (Burma) Police Force said on its official Facebook page that the victims had died from burns or smoke inhalation. One report said all of the victims were boys. The dormitory had locked its doors because of the recent tensions, so the children struggled to escape, reports said. \\"The whole country is worried now for Rangoon, and is wondering whether this was a crime,\\" Ye Naung Thein, a local Muslim leader, told the AFP news agency at the scene. The fire comes amid an upsurge in violence between Buddhists and Muslims. On 22 March, a state of emergency was enforced in the central town of Meiktila in the Mandalay region, where violent clashes erupted between Muslim and Buddhist communities after a reported argument at a gold shop. Many houses and buildings were destroyed in the town and thousands of people, mostly Muslims, displaced. Curfews have since been imposed in other towns and villages after violence spread. The violence follows clashes last year in Rakhine state between the Buddhist community and Muslim Rohingyas - a stateless minority group not recognised by the Burmese government. President Thein Sein has warned that the government will use force if necessary to stop \\"political opportunists and religious extremists\\" from fomenting hatred between faiths. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"On April 2, 2013, a tragic fire broke out in a mosque in Yangon, Myanmar, killing at least 13 Muslim schoolchildren. Authorities quickly attributed the cause of the fire to an accidental electrical short, ruling out any criminal activity. However, community members expressed suspicions that the fire could have been set intentionally, given the tense atmosphere and history of sectarian violence between Buddhists and Muslims in the region. At the time, Myanmar was dealing with the aftermath of sectarian violence between the two groups which erupted in central city Meikhtila in March, resulting in dozens of deaths and the displacement of over 12,000 individuals. The violence then spread to other towns, where extremist Buddhist mobs attacked mosques and Muslim-owned property. In the mosque fire incident, around 75 children were living in the mosque compound, many of whom managed to escape as a door was knocked open by police. Some of the doors were locked against external threats due to the tensions in the area, making escape more difficult. The fire raised alarm and concern about the potential for further sectarian violence.

The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who announced, with Shuttlesworth, that desegregation would take place 90 days from May 15? is inside the article: Desegregation in Birmingham took place slowly after the demonstrations. King and the SCLC were criticized by some for ending the campaign with promises that were too vague and \\"settling for a lot less than even moderate demands\\". In fact, Sydney Smyer, president of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, re-interpreted the terms of the agreement. Shuttlesworth and King had announced that desegregation would take place 90 days from May 15. Smyer then said that a single black clerk hired 90 days from when the new city government took office would be sufficient. By July, most of the city's segregation ordinances had been overturned. Some of the lunch counters in department stores complied with the new rules. City parks and golf courses were opened again to black and white citizens. Mayor Boutwell appointed a biracial committee to discuss further changes. However, no hiring of black clerks, police officers, and firefighters had yet been completed and the Birmingham Bar Association rejected membership by black attorneys.The reputation of Martin Luther King Jr. soared after the protests in Birmingham, and he was lauded by many as a hero. The SCLC was much in demand to effect change in many Southern cities. In the summer of 1963, King led the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom where he delivered his most famous speech, \\"I Have a Dream\\". King became Time's Man of the Year for 1963 and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. Four months after the Birmingham campaign settlement, someone bombed the house of NAACP attorney Arthur Shores, injuring his wife in the attack. On September 15, 1963, Birmingham again earned international attention when Ku Klux Klan members bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church on a Sunday morning and killed four young girls. FBI informant Gary Thomas Rowe was hired to infiltrate the KKK and monitor their activities and plans. Rowe was involved, along with the Birmingham Police, with the KKK attacks on the Freedom Riders, led by Fred Shuttlesworth, in Anniston, Alabama on May 14, 1961. In..., can you guess it ?

Premise: \\"The town has a high percentage of Nubians in its population; these people, though fully integrated into Egyptian society, remain proud of their separate cultural identity.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Nubians do not care for their culture. \\" true?","completion":"The given hypothesis, \\"Nubians do not care for their culture,\\" is not true according to the premise provided. The premise states, \\"The town has a high percentage of Nubians in its population; these people, though fully integrated into Egyptian society, remain proud of their separate cultural identity.\\" There are several reasons why this hypothesis can be refuted based on the provided information. Firstly, the premise highlights that Nubians are fully integrated into Egyptian society. Integration refers to the process by which Nubians have adapted and assimilated into Egyptian culture. This could involve learning the language, customs, and traditions of the Egyptian society. However, the premise also indicates that despite their successful integration, Nubians continue to maintain a sense of pride in their own distinct cultural identity. Pride in one's culture signifies that Nubians not only acknowledge their separate cultural roots but also respect and value their own cultural heritage. This would mean that Nubians have great concern for their own cultural practices, customs, beliefs, and traditions inherited from their ancestors. Thus, the hypothesis claiming that Nubians do not care for their culture contradicts the given premise. Furthermore, it is essential to note that maintaining cultural pride does not necessitate non-adaptation to the surrounding culture. People can simultaneously care for their own cultural background while embracing and integrating into a new culture. This dual process allows for a rich cultural exchange, fostering understanding and harmony among diverse communities. Moreover, the high percentage of Nubians in the town's population could instigate a strong sense of community and belonging among the Nubians. This in itself could create an environment where cultural traditions are more likely to be preserved and cherished. In such a setting, Nubians can act as support systems for one another, helping maintain and strengthen their cultural identity through shared experiences and mutual understanding. In conclusion, the premise supports the fact that the Nubians, despite being well integrated into Egyptian society, continue to value and take pride in their cultural identity. This directly refutes the hypothesis stating that Nubians do not care for their culture. It is important to recognize that people can balance integration into a new society while simultaneously appreciating and preserving their own cultural heritage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which sample would have elastic collisions, sample A or sample B? A:","completion":"Based on the provided information, it can be concluded that sample A, which contains gas particles, is more likely to have elastic collisions than sample B. This is because gas particles typically undergo elastic collisions, meaning that during the collision, there is no net loss in kinetic energy. In an elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. Gases tend to have these types of collisions as their particles move freely and rarely interact other than occasional brief collisions. On the other hand, sample B, which does not contain gas particles, might consist of particles with different properties (e.g., from solids or liquids), making it less likely to undergo elastic collisions. In other types of collisions known as inelastic collisions, particles might stick together or cause deformation, resulting in a loss of kinetic energy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The text explains that Deutsche Post AG operates under the trade name Deutsche Post DHL Group, which basically means that the company comprises both Deutsche Post and DHL under a singular corporate entity.

Deutsche Post primarily focuses on domestic and international postal services, dealing with the delivery of letters, parcels, and other mail-related services. As mentioned in the text, the postal division is responsible for the delivery of 61 million letters each day in Germany, making it the largest postal service in Europe. On the other hand, DHL, which stands for Dalsey, Hillblom, and Lynn, functions primarily as an international express courier, shipping, e-commerce, and supply chain management service provider. The company has a vast global presence, as it claims to operate in more than 220 countries and territories. The Express division's core focus is facilitating shipping and logistics for businesses and individuals on a worldwide scale. It is important to note that while both Deutsche Post and DHL operate under the same corporate structure, they serve different purposes and cater to different market segments.

Nevertheless, the combined entity, Deutsche Post DHL Group, is the world's largest postal and international courier service company, boasting a workforce of 510,000 employees and a headquarters in Bonn, Germany.

Where in your body are those red blood cells created?","completion":"Red blood cells, also known as erythrocytes, play a critical role in transporting oxygen from the lungs to various tissues and organs throughout the body and carrying carbon dioxide back to the lungs for excretion. The production of new red blood cells takes place primarily in the bone marrow, which is the soft, spongy tissue found within the cavities of bones. Bone marrow is spread across different bones in the body, but it is predominantly found in the central and flat bones, including the sternum (breastbone), pelvis (hip bones), ribs, vertebrae (spinal column), and the proximal ends of long bones, such as the femur (thigh bone) and humerus (upper arm bone). There are two types of bone marrow: red marrow and yellow marrow. Red marrow is actively involved in the production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, while yellow marrow mostly consists of fat cells and is not directly involved in blood cell formation. The process of red blood cell production is called erythropoiesis. This complex process is regulated by several factors, including the hormone erythropoietin (EPO), which is primarily produced by the kidneys. When the body senses low oxygen levels, the kidneys produce and release more EPO, which in turn stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells to compensate for the oxygen deficit. Erythropoiesis begins with the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells, which are multi-potent cells found in the bone marrow. These stem cells have the potential to develop into various types of blood cells, including red blood cells. Under the influence of EPO and other growth factors, hematopoietic stem cells differentiate into proerythroblasts, which are early, immature red blood cell precursors. As these proerythroblasts mature, they undergo several stages of development, including basophilic erythroblasts, polychromatophilic erythroblasts, and orthochromatic erythroblasts. During these stages, the cells accumulate hemoglobin (an iron-containing protein that transports oxygen) and gradually lose their nucleus, organelles, and ribosomes. The final product is a mature, biconcave-shaped red blood cell, which is released from the bone marrow into the bloodstream to begin its essential work of oxygen transportation and carbon dioxide removal. The lifespan of a red blood cell in the human body is approximately 120 days. As they age and lose functionality, red blood cells are removed from circulation by specialized cells in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow, which recognize and target damaged or worn-out cells for clearance. This continuous cycle of production, circulation, and removal ensures that the human body maintains an adequate supply of healthy, functional red blood cells to support its oxygen transport needs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Steelers’ Defense Is as Dominant as Ever The Ravens said later that McGahee had full neurological functioning. Another interception — the third thrown by Joe Flacco, the usually unflappable Ravens rookie quarterback — with a little more than a minute remaining sent the fans into a towel-waving frenzy and the Steelers on their way to an attempt to win more Super Bowls than any other N.F.L. franchise. “They did it tonight the way they did it all year,” Tomlin said. “We’re opportunistic. We didn’t start this journey to get to Tampa. We’ve got some business to do.” The Super Bowl will present more than a matchup of present and might-have-been Steelers coaches; it will also match a high-scoring offense against a punishing defense — nothing like the A.F.C. championship game. The Steelers and the Ravens were mirror images, and the conference championship was a struggle for yards and points that turned on a handful of big plays and mistakes. The Steelers won the tug-of-war in cleats because Flacco, who had last thrown an interception in December against the Steelers, looked like a rookie for the first time in months. Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who also lost in the A.F.C. championship game during his rookie season, guided the Steelers to just enough points and away from errors. The Ravens did not have a first down in the first quarter and had just 74 yards in the first half, while the Steelers built a 13-0 lead. But with receiver Hines Ward injured and on the sideline for most of the game and Roethlisberger under pressure from Ravens blitzes, the Steelers could not sustain a drive. The momentum, and field position, switched in the second quarter when Jim Leonhard returned a Mitch Berger punt 45 yards. That put the Ravens at the Steelers’ 17-yard line and a defensive pass interference call on third-and-9 gave the Ravens first down at the 3-yard line. McGahee, who had had almost no success breaking free earlier in the game, scooted in with 2:40 left in the second quarter for the Ravens’ only score of the first half. The Steelers blew a chance to lengthen their lead as the half came to a close. After their drive was extended when Baltimore was called for a roughing the kicker penalty on a punt, the Steelers failed to get their field-goal unit on the field as the final seconds of the first half ticked away. “I screwed it up,” Tomlin said. “We had 16 seconds; I wanted to take a shot at the end zone.” No matter. The Steelers had never blown a 13-point lead in their playoff history, and despite a few missed chances — Limas Sweed dropped a wide open pass that would have gone for a touchdown, Willie Parker managed just 47 yards — they eked out a 46-yard field goal in the third quarter that settled the Steelers down. With Roethlisberger wincing because of a hit to his back earlier in the game, the Steelers had taken more than five minutes off the clock. “Winning takes away a little bit of pain,” Roethlisberger said. “This is a 12-round slugfest.” The Ravens briefly had life late in the game when a botched Steelers punt and a pass interference call in the end zone gave the Ravens their final touchdown and a 16-14 deficit. But Roethlisberger said that his rookie title game loss taught him one thing: “Don’t turn the ball over.” That is a lesson that Flacco will learn now, but the Ravens’ rookie coach, John Harbaugh, told his team that its success — Baltimore won 11 games and made it to the A.F.C. championship game as a sixth seed — was just the start. The Ravens were hit by injuries during the season and during the game, and they had encountered a defense that Polamalu said was the best he has played on because it has had to carry the Steelers more than usual while the offense struggled with injuries. Flacco had relieved years of similar responsibility from the Ravens’ defense — until Sunday night. “There’s not much you can say,” Ravens linebacker Bart Scott said. “It’s time to go on vacation and forget about it.” Perhaps.

Summarize this article: The seed came from a pumpkin which weighed more than one tonne - believed to be a world record. It was bought by Ipswich-based seed company Thompson & Morgan earlier this year for £1,250 at auction. The seed has been nurtured by Matthew Oliver at the Hyde Hall near South Woodham Ferrers, Essex. The record-breaking 2,323lb (1,054kg) pumpkin was grown in Switzerland in 2014 by Beni Meier and it holds the world record for weight, according to the Great Pumpkin Commonwealth organisation. Mr Oliver said that pumpkin's girth was about 4.5m (15ft). He said he had been planning to grow pumpkins at the Royal Horticultural Society's Hyde Hall this year. When he was approached by Thompson & Morgan with its valuable seed, Mr Oliver said: \\"I was a bit nervous, the pressure was suddenly on.\\" The seed was planted in mid April. It took six days to germinate and \\"come up\\", said Mr Oliver. \\"I was getting worried. Six days is a long time. \\"It had to be re-potted a couple of times because they are such vigorous growers.\\" On 9 May it was potted outside. Mr Oliver said the current world record was safe - but he does hope his labour has created the largest pumpkin grown outdoors in the UK.

According to his son Ernie Harburg, Gilbert and Irish dramatist George Bernard Shaw taught his father, a \\"democratic socialist, [and] sworn challenger of all tyranny against the people, that 'humor is an act of courage' and dissent\\". After World War I, Harburg returned to New York and graduated from City College (later part of the City University of New York), which Ira Gershwin had initially attended with him, in 1921. After Harburg married and had two children, he started writing light verse for local newspapers. He became a co-owner of Consolidated Electrical Appliance Company, but the company went bankrupt following the crash of 1929, leaving Harburg \\"anywhere from 50,000 - 70,000 in debt,\\" which he insisted on paying back over the course of the next few decades. At this point, Harburg and Ira Gershwin agreed that Harburg should start writing song lyrics. Gershwin introduced Harburg to Jay Gorney, who collaborated with him on songs for an Earl Carroll Broadway review (Earl Carroll's Sketchbook): the show was successful and Harburg was engaged as lyricist for a series of successful revues, including Americana in 1932, for which he wrote the lyrics of \\"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\\" to the tune of a lullaby Gorney had learned as a child in Russia. This song swept the nation, becoming an anthem of the Great Depression. Harburg was a staunch critic of religion and an atheist. He wrote a poem entitled \\"Atheist\\" that summarized his views on god and religion. Was Harburg religious?","completion":"No, Edgar \\"Yip\\" Harburg was not religious. He was a staunch critic of religion and an atheist, which means he did not believe in God or any religious beliefs. He even wrote a poem called \\"Atheist\\" that shared his thoughts about religion and his disbelief in God."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

[Getty Images] Translate to English","completion":"Serbian Central Bank Governor Radovan Jelasić criticized the new budget. [Getty Images] Radovan Jelasić, the Governor of the National Bank of Serbia, has recently expressed his concerns and criticism regarding the newly proposed budget. As the head of Serbia's central banking authority, Jelasić is responsible for ensuring stability in the country's economy and maintaining the value of the national currency, which is the Serbian dinar. His role also includes implementing monetary and fiscal policies, exercising control over the country's banking system, and overseeing the exchange rates. Given his extensive experience and knowledge in this field, Jelasić's comments on the new budget are of significant importance. While the official statement outlining Jelasić's critique has yet to be released, it is expected that he may have taken issue with the lack of measures aimed at addressing fiscal stability and promoting long-term economic growth. Additionally, there might be concerns about the proposed budget's impact on inflation rates and public debt. As the Serbian economy is still recovering from the effects of the global financial crisis and is facing numerous challenges in terms of maintaining sustainable growth, these criticisms are not to be taken lightly. Furthermore, it is possible that the Serbian Government's approach to spending in this new budget may have been a point of contention for Jelasić. In order to achieve a balance and well-functioning economy, a country's budget should consider various factors, such as investments in infrastructure, education, health care, and social support, as well as maintaining a manageable level of public debt. However, if the new budget does not carefully weigh these competing priorities, it could lead to short-term financial gains at the expense of long-term stability and growth. Besides these potential concerns, Radovan Jelasić could also be critical of the degree of transparency within the budgetary process. Transparency is essential in ensuring public trust and effectiveness in the allocation of resources. If the new budget does not clearly outline its objectives, priorities, and allocations, it may lead to skepticism and mistrust amongst the population, as well as potential investors. To address these concerns, Jelasić may suggest several improvements and adjustments to the proposed budget, such as implementing stricter budgetary constraints to control spending and ensuring the allocation of funds is allocated towards crucial sectors like health care, education, and infrastructure. Additionally, he could recommend increasing transparency in budgeting by clearly outlining and communicating the government's goals, strategies, and progress in achieving them. In conclusion, while the specifics of Radovan Jelasić's criticism of the new Serbian budget are not yet available, his concerns most likely revolve around fiscal stability, long-term economic growth, transparency, and the government's approach to spending. As the Governor of the Serbian Central Bank, his insights and recommendations could have a significant impact on the future direction and success of the country's economy."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Sending humans to the seafloor is expensive and dangerous.

Kirina shows no fear and Kinjo, the leader of a cult of ninja assassins and grants her final wish by showing his face. Paul returns and hides in the foyer while calling the police. When Kinjo decapitates Kirina, Paul tries to come to her defense and then tries to flee. Enraged that someone has seen his face, Kinjo's men stab Paul, hit him with a poisoned shuriken and slash his throat, leaving him for dead. Paul awakes in a hospital room, but his claims of seeing Kinjo are met with disbelief by the police. Lieutenant Wadakura dismisses the allegation and suspects that the murder is the work of a Yakuza syndicate. Paul is approached by Ijuro Takeda, an expert on the cult and Kinjo. Paul discovers that Takeda is the last in a samurai line and has a score to settle with Kinjo. The ninjas attempts to murder Paul at the hospital, killing several hospital staff and police officers, including Wadakura, but Paul escapes. Takeda and his wife Mieko subsequently take Paul to their family's stronghold, located on an island several hundred miles away.

John had a big aphid problem, so he used all the methods available to get rid of them. Mike had a slug problem, but had almost no aphides. and a hint : Insecticide control of aphids is difficult, as they breed rapidly, so even small areas missed may enable the population to recover promptly. Aphids may occupy the undersides of leaves where spray misses them, while systemic insecticides do not move satisfactorily into flower petals. Finally, some aphid species are resistant to common insecticide classes including carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids.For small backyard infestations, spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days may be sufficient protection. An insecticidal soap solution can be an effective household remedy to control aphids, but it only kills aphids on contact and has no residual effect. Soap spray may damage plants, especially at higher concentrations or at temperatures above 32 °C (90 °F); some plant species are sensitive to soap sprays.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: the girls recreate their parents' first date at an Italian restaurant with a gypsy violinist for the following movie plot: Identical twins Susan Evers and Sharon McKendrick (Hayley Mills) meet at summer camp, unaware that they are sisters. Their identical appearance initially creates rivalry, and they continuously pull pranks on each other, which ultimately leads to the camp dance being crashed by their mischief. As punishment, they must live together in an isolated cabin (and eat together at an \\"isolation table\\") for the remainder of their time at summer camp. After both admit they come from broken homes, they soon realize they are twin sisters and that their parents, Mitch (Brian Keith) and Maggie (Maureen O'Hara), divorced shortly after their birth, with each parent having custody of one of them. The twins, each eager to meet the parent she never knew, switch places. They drill each other on the other's behavior and lives, and Susan cuts Sharon's hair into the same style as hers. While Susan is in Boston masquerading as Sharon, Sharon goes to California pretending to be Susan. Sharon telephones Susan in Boston with news that their father is planning to marry a gold digger, and their mother needs to be rushed to California to stop the wedding. In Boston, Susan reveals to her mother the truth about the switched identities and the two fly to California. In California, the twins (with mild approval from their mother) scheme to sabotage their father's marriage plans. Mitch's money-hungry - and much younger - fiancÃ©e Vicky Robinson (Joanna Barnes) receives rude, mischievous treatment from the girls and some veiled cattiness from Maggie. One evening, the girls recreate their parents' first date at an Italian restaurant with a gypsy violinist.

From the moment I walked in to the moment I left, everything was a disaster. I hope potential future customers are aware of the issues I encountered. Upon arrival, I noticed the café was in dire need of a deep clean. The floor was littered with dirt, napkins, and crumbs, leaving me wondering if it had been swept in weeks. The tables appeared sticky, and the condiment station was a mess, making me question the overall hygiene of the café. The atmosphere was made worse by a pungent odor that lingered throughout my visit, possibly coming from the poorly maintained bathrooms. The waiting staff was far from helpful. Despite the café being almost empty, my friends and I were left standing at the entrance for over ten minutes before someone finally noticed us and showed us a table. The waitstaff appeared disinterested and unenthusiastic, which did not give a good first impression. Upon being seated, we found that the menu was limited and lacked creativity. It featured typical, overpriced café items, with no unique or special offerings. The few vegan and gluten-free options were uninspiring, leaving my dietary-restricted friends without appetizing choices. Our orders eventually arrived after a 45-minute wait, which was unreasonably long considering the lack of patrons. Sadly, the food failed to make up for the wait time. My coffee was lukewarm, and the milk tasted as if it had gone sour. The egg and bacon sandwich I ordered was greasy and lacked flavor. The bread was dry, despite being advertised as freshly baked, and the eggs were rubbery. My friends shared similar complaints about their dishes - the salad was bland, the soup was cold, and the quiche lacked seasoning. During our meal, the staff hardly checked in on us, and we had to get up and walk to the counter to request napkins, utensils, and a refill of water. After finally receiving our check, it took an additional 20 minutes to process our payment, leaving us feeling ignored and frustrated. As if the experience could not get worse, I became ill later that day, which I can only assume was due to the substandard quality of food at XYZ Café. My friends and I left the café with a deep sense of disappointment, and none of us have any intention of ever returning. In conclusion, my experience at XYZ Café was remarkably negative. Between the poor food quality, unprofessional staff, and unsanitary conditions, I cannot recommend this establishment to anyone. I will be taking my business elsewhere, and I encourage others to do the same to avoid what was truly a terrible dining experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The Winnipeg Public Library is a public library network with 20 branches throughout the city, including the main Millennium Library.Winnipeg the Bear, which would become the inspiration for part of the name of Winnie-the-Pooh, was purchased in Ontario by Lieutenant Harry Colebourn of the Fort Garry Horse. He named the bear after the regiment's home town of Winnipeg. A. A. Milne later wrote a series of books featuring the fictional Winnie-the-Pooh. The series' illustrator, Ernest H. Shepard, created the only known oil painting of Winnipeg's adopted fictional bear, displayed in Assiniboine Park.The city has developed many distinct dishes and cooking styles, notably in the areas of confectionery and hot-smoked fish.

Washington Sentinels[1][2] owner Edward O'Neil calls a former coach of his, Jimmy McGinty, telling McGinty that he and the rest of the teams are going to finish the final four games of the season with replacement players. O'Neil asks McGinty to coach the Sentinels the rest of the season, along with the pressure of winning three of the last four games to make the playoffs. McGinty accepts, on the condition that he will also be given the freedom to sign the players he wants, with O'Neil not allowed to interfere. With O'Neil accepting, McGinty builds his team of different varying players that he believes he can make a winning team. As his quarterback, he chooses Shane Falco, a former All-American from Ohio State who's career went to pieces after a horrendous Sugar Bowl game, and now lives in a houseboat near the Sentinels' stadium. Falco initially refuses, but McGinty convinces him, believing that Falco can still be the player he was meant to be. The replacement players are greeted to their first practice hostilely by the striking players, calling the replacements \\"scabs\\", and throwing eggs at them, and Falco, who arrives late, gets his truck turned over.

Both sentences emphasize the need for the free world and those who value freedom and peace to confront Hamas and the killers strongly. The speaker in both sentences is making a statement about the importance of firmly dealing with these entities in order to protect and preserve freedom and peace. In the first sentence, the speaker tells reporters their stance as they exit a church service. This context might imply that the speaker is a public figure or someone of importance, and the statement is being made to the media. The setting (coming out of a church service) could potentially indicate that the speaker's views are influenced by their religious or moral beliefs. The second sentence omits the specific context of the church service and reporters but retains the same core message. The crucial elements about the free world, freedom, peace, Hamas, and the killers remain the same in both sentences, asserting the need for a strong response to the identified threats.

Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words. Input: We investigate the properties of multidimensional probability distributions in the context of latent space prior distributions of implicit generative models. Our work revolves around the phenomena arising while decoding linear interpolations between two random latent vectors -- regions of latent space in close proximity to the origin of the space are oversampled, which restricts the usability of linear interpolations as a tool to analyse the latent space. We show that the distribution mismatch can be eliminated completely by a proper choice of the latent probability distribution or using non-linear interpolations. We prove that there is a trade off between the interpolation being linear, and the latent distribution having even the most basic properties required for stable training, such as finite mean. We use the multidimensional Cauchy distribution as an example of the prior distribution, and also provide a general method of creating non-linear interpolations, that is easily applicable to a large family of commonly used latent distributions. Output:","completion":"This study examines properties of multidimensional probability distributions in latent space prior distributions of implicit generative models.

The 25-year-old, who is also the record-holding world and Olympic champion over 200m, is confident he can become the first man to smash the 9.4 barrier in the British capital in August. \\"After my trials leading up to the Olympics, then it depends on where my fitness is,\\" he said. \\"If everything goes well, I can determine, how fast I think I can go. \\"Everybody has been talking about this 9.4 all season. If it's possible, I'll be the one to run 9.4 seconds.\\" Bolt was talking to CNN Olympic contributor Linford Christie, a 100m gold medalist at the Barcelona Games in 1992, after recording 9.76 in Rome on Thursday -- the fastest time this year. Bolt named IAAF male athlete of the year after world championships double. The Kingston native's electric performances and exuberant personality have made him a global celebrity, with his \\"lightning bolt\\" pose now recognized all over the world. \\"I think it was God sent,\\" said Bolt when asked about the iconic stance. \\"But it was slightly originated from an archery pose. \\"I just copied it and made it my own and it worked. It's catchy and I'm like the Michael Jordan of track and field really!\\" Bolt's charisma on the starting blocks sets him apart from previous generations of sprinters, who would take a far more serious approach to race preparations. He revealed how an encounter with U.S. sprinter Justin Gatlin, who served a four-year doping ban between 2006 and 2010, influenced his approach to racing. \\"For me it never happened until Justin Gatlin,\\" he said. \\"I ran once with him in Zagreb, he did something which was really funny to me. \\"We were walking back and forward and he actually spat across my lane. And when he did it, I knew he was trying to intimidate me and I found it really funny. \\"Today it doesn't really bother me. I just go there, enjoy myself and relax. It's just one of those things where over the years the game has changed.\\" Bolt suffered a setback at the 2011 World Championships in Daegu, when a false start in the 100m final allowed his compatriot Yohan Blake to claim the gold medal. Human to Hero: Champion Blake bids to steal Bolt's sprint swag. In London, Bolt will once again face competition from Blake as well as longtime rival Tyson Gay of the United States -- the 100m world champion in 2007. Can Bolt be beaten? Gay's golden Olympic goal. Despite fierce competition, Bolt insists he will be focused on his own race if he reaches the London 2012 final on August 5. \\"I can't really say who's going to be my main rival but for me the main thing is the seven guys in the lanes beside me,\\" he said. \\"You never know what can happen on the day so I'm really focused and I'm not really worried about one thing or one person.\\" Christie believes Bolt can be challenged at the forthcoming Games, but his rivals with have to be confident if they are to capture his crown. Gold medal formula: Mind over matter? \\"There's always a challenge,\\" the Briton told CNN. \\"It's whether they believe enough to challenge him. Does a challenge mean beating him? That's tough.\\" When asked about the biggest threats to Bolt's dominance, Christie highlighted the American duo of Gay and Gatlin as the men most likely to mount a serious challenge. \\"We don't know what Justin Gatlin is capable of, Tyson Gay hasn't competed yet. We also need to wait until after the Jamaican trials.\\" Christie said the impact Bolt has had on athletics is similar to that of American legend Michael Johnson, a world and Olympic champion over 200m and 400m, while also comparing him to other sporting icons. \\"Not meaning it in a horrible way, but he's one of the freaks in our sport. Michael Johnson came along and everybody thought 'wow.' \\"Muhammad Ali was a freak in his sport, now we've got Bolt. Every so many years, someone like that comes along. Pele, Maradona, it's one of those things.\\" Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Usain Bolt, the Jamaican sprint star, believes he can set a new 100-meter world record at the London 2012 Olympic Games, possibly running as fast as 9.4 seconds. Bolt already holds world records for both 100m and 200m races. Despite facing fierce competition from fellow athletes, Bolt remains focused on his own performance. Linford Christie, a 100m gold medalist, acknowledged the challenge for Bolt, noting that American sprinters Justin Gatlin and Tyson Gay could pose a serious threat. Christie compared Bolt's impact on athletics to legends such as Michael Johnson, Muhammad Ali, Pele, and Maradona."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: A sobbing little girl stood near a small church from which she had been turned away because it \\"was too crowded.\\" \\"I can't go to Sunday School,\\" she sobbed to the pastor as he walked by. Seeing her shabby appearance, the pastor guessed the reason, and, taking her by the hand, took her inside and found a place for her in the Sunday School class. The child was so touched that she went to bed that night thinking of the children who have no place to worship Jesus. Some years later, this child lay dead in one of the poor buildings and the parents called for the kindhearted pastor, who had befriended their daughter, to handle the final arrangements. As her poor little body was being moved, a worn purse was found which seemed to have been picked up from some trash dump. Inside was found 57 cents and a note scribbled in childish handwriting which read, \\"This is to help build the little church bigger so more children can go to Sunday School.\\" For two years she had saved for this offering of love. When the pastor tearfully read that note, he knew instantly what he would do. Carrying this note, he told people the story of her unselfish love and devotion. A newspaper learned of the story and published it. It was read by a Realtor who offered them a parcel of land worth many thousands. When told that the church could not pay so much, he offered it for 57 cents. Church members made large donations. Checks came from far and wide. Within five years the little girl's gift had increased to 250,000, a huge sum for that time. When you are in the city of Philadelphia, look up Temple Baptist Church, with a seating capacity of 3,300 and Temple University, where hundreds of students are trained. Have a look, too, at the Good Samaritan Hospital and at a Sunday School building which houses hundreds of Sunday scholars, so that no child in the area will ever need to be left outside during Sunday school time.

Write an article based on this \\"Record numbers of sixth-formers are thought to have taken a dissertation-style project this year to give them an edge in their university applications.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Sixth-formers Embrace Dissertation-style Projects to Boost University Applications Introduction In today's increasingly competitive environment for university admission, students are constantly searching for ways to differentiate themselves from their peers and maximize their chances of acceptance to their dream institutions. This year, record numbers of sixth-formers have opted to take on a dissertation-style project to give them that competitive edge. Experts suggest that these projects not only showcase students' commitment to their chosen subject but also their ability to think critically and develop vital research skills, making them more appealing to university admissions officers. Increasing Demand for Academic Rigor Over the years, many students have pursued extracurricular activities, volunteer work, and various other non-academic pursuits to impress admissions officers. However, with the increasing focus on academic excellence and intellectual curiosity as key factors influencing university admission decisions, more students are turning to rigorous academic projects that allow them to delve deeper into their chosen subjects. A dissertation-style project enables students to work independently to research a topic using critical thinking and problem-solving skills. The completion of such a project not only demonstrates initiative and dedication but also highlights the student's ability to meet the academic challenges they will likely face at the university level. Why Universities Value Dissertation-style Projects As university admissions become more competitive, admissions officers seek to identify prospective students who will excel academically and actively contribute to the intellectual community on campus. Dissertation-style projects offer several advantages in this context. 1. Depth of Knowledge: In contrast to traditional school assignments that tend to focus on a specific subject area, these projects allow students to explore a topic of personal interest in-depth and gain a deep understanding of their chosen subject matter. This depth of knowledge can offer valuable insight into the student's potential for success in their university studies. 2. Critical Thinking and Problem-solving Skills: Undertaking a dissertation-style project requires students to analyze complex information, identify patterns, develop hypotheses, and draw meaningful conclusions. These critical thinking and problem-solving skills are transferable across numerous academic disciplines and are highly sought after by universities. 3. Time Management and Self-Motivation: Completing a research project within a limited timeframe necessitates effective time management and self-motivation. As university students are expected to balance their course load with various other responsibilities, the development of these skills can be a strong indicator of future academic success. 4. Originality and Innovation: The ability to approach a topic from a unique perspective, synthesize information, and challenge conventional thought processes is an asset for any university student. Dissertation-style projects showcase these qualities, indicating to admissions officers that the student has the potential to be an intellectual leader on campus. Increased Acceptance Rates Among Those Who Undertake Dissertation-Style Projects Various reports suggest a correlation between the completion of a dissertation-style project and increased likelihood of university acceptance. Not only do these projects add weight to an applicant's personal statement, but they also provide additional opportunities for students to demonstrate their commitment to their chosen subject. Moreover, during interviews or assessments, the knowledge gained through such projects can be invaluable, helping students perform better and leave a lasting impression on their evaluators. Conclusion In summary, the rising popularity of dissertation-style projects among sixth-formers as a means to gain an edge in the university application process comes as no surprise. This approach effectively highlights a student's dedication to their chosen subject while showcasing their critical thinking skills, time management capabilities, and ability to meet the challenges of university life. As a result, it is likely that the trend of students undertaking such projects will continue to grow in the coming years, proving advantageous for both universities and ambitious, hard-working students."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve this problem.","completion":"To solve the given equation 6127 * p = 4167 * p − 43120 for the variable p, we can follow these steps: 1. First, write down the given equation: 6127 * p = 4167 * p - 43120 2. Now, we want to isolate the variable p, so we need to eliminate p from one side of the equation. Start by subtracting 4167 * p from both sides of the equation to move all the terms with the variable p to one side: (6127 * p) - (4167 * p) = -43120 3. Combine the terms containing p on the left side of the equation: (6127 - 4167) * p = -43120 1960 * p = -43120 4. Now, we need to solve for p by dividing both sides of the equation by 1960: p = -43120 / 1960 5.

The suggested answer seems to discuss the oversight of work permits for expatriate religious workers but does not specifically address the main religions practiced in Thailand. A detailed and more appropriate answer to the question would be as follows: Thailand is known for its rich religious tradition, with a majority of its population practicing Buddhism, particularly Theravada Buddhism. According to the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) World Factbook, the religious distribution in Thailand is as follows: - Buddhism: 94.6% - Muslim: 4.3% - Christian: 1% - Other: 0.1% Apart from Buddhism, Islam is the second most common religion, predominantly practiced in the southern provinces of Thailand near the Malaysian border. The Muslim population consists mostly of ethnic Malays, along with some Persians, Indians, Pakistanis, Arab descendants, and Thai Muslims. Christianity has a small presence in Thailand, with the majority of Christians being Protestant, followed by Roman Catholics. There are also several Christian organizations and missionary groups actively working within the country. Other religions with a limited presence in Thailand include Hinduism, Sikhism, and Baha'i.

Select from: + a whole metal spoon getting hot when one end is in hot soup; + the inside of a car in the sun getting very hot; + a tar road getting hotter in the sun than a concrete sidewalk; + a fireplace fire heating a room on a cold day;","completion":"To answer this question, let us first understand the different types of heat transfer and then analyze each option to determine which represents an example of heat transfer by conduction. 1. Conduction: Direct heat transfer between two objects in contact with each other. The energy is transferred from high-temperature regions to lower-temperature regions through the vibrations of particles in a solid material. 2. Convection: Heat transfer through fluids (gases or liquids) due to the motion of fluid particles, where hotter particles move and carry the heat with them. 3. Radiation: Heat transfer in the form of electromagnetic waves or photons, requiring no direct contact or medium to travel. Now, let's analyze each option: a) A whole metal spoon getting hot when one end is in hot soup; This option demonstrates heat transfer by conduction. Since the spoon is in direct contact with the hot soup, the heat from the soup is transferred to the spoon, causing the entire spoon to get hot. The metal spoon is a good conductor of heat, which is why the whole spoon gets hot. b) The inside of a car in the sun getting very hot; This option mostly demonstrates heat transfer through radiation and convection. Sunlight passes through the car's windows as electromagnetic waves (radiation), heating the interior surfaces of the car. The heated surfaces then heat the air inside the car through conduction and convection, forming a greenhouse effect which makes the overall interior very hot. c) A tar road getting hotter in the sun than a concrete sidewalk; This situation is mainly a result of differing heat absorption rates and conduction. The tar road absorbs more solar radiation than the concrete sidewalk, making it hotter in the sun. However, this option doesn't purely describe heat transfer by conduction. d) A fireplace fire heating a room on a cold day; This option mainly demonstrates heat transfer through radiation and convection. The fireplace fire emits infrared radiation, which travels through the air, heating the objects and surfaces in the room. When air particles are heated, they rise, and cooler air moves closer to the fire, repeating the cycle. This process is known as convection. Based on the analysis, the answer is: A whole metal spoon getting hot when one end is in hot soup, as this is an example of heat transfer through conduction."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Natural Place: This title seems unlikely as the name of a natural place, which typically features more descriptive and identifiable names in reference to their geological or geographic features. 9. Village: It is possible that \\"Another Bag\\" could be the name of a small village or community, as village names can be diverse and unique. 10. Animal: It is improbable that \\"Another Bag\\" refers to an animal, as animal names are generally well-established and descriptive. 11. Plant: Similarly, \\"Another Bag\\" is unlikely to be the name of a plant, given that plant names tend to be descriptive and scientifically classified. 12. Album: It is conceivable that \\"Another Bag\\" could be the title of an album or collection of musical works released by an artist, as album titles can be diverse and less restrictive in terms of naming conventions. 13. Film or Written Work: \\"Another Bag\\" is possible as a film or written work title, as both literary and cinematic titles may have ambiguous and diverse names. Given the analysis, the most likely options for the title \\"Another Bag\\" would be as the name of a company, an album or collection of artistic works, a film or written work, or possibly a village. However, without further context or information, it is challenging to decisively pinpoint the category to which \\"Another Bag\\" belongs."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We went to the park, bringing both my favorite notebook and her favorite tablet. Our challenge was to see whose messages looked nicer on their favorite mode of communication. Since we were just kids, our parents stayed close by, watching us have fun together. We started by taking turns writing words and sentences. I wrote with my colorful crayons on the soft, creamy paper. The crayons felt squishable, like playdough as I drew letters and fun shapes. My friend, on the other hand, used her tablet, tapping the glassy screen with her fingers. She made words with cute pictures too. Our parents gathered around to judge who had created the prettiest and most fun messages. They smiled at our drawings, and they said both our messages were special and pretty in their own ways. We learned that day that it didn't matter if we liked paper or screens, because we could still communicate and have fun together. And that's what mattered most to us - being good friends, no matter how we liked to talk to each other. From that day on, we continued using both paper and the computer screen to share our ideas and stories. Sometimes, we even mixed them together by using one while the other watched. We discovered that both ways had their magic, and our friendship became ever so much more exciting!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This aligns with the hypothesis that the OPM decided to change the regulations so that senior executives would be held to account. Thus, the correct answer is [I] yes.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Choose your answer? In any physical or chemical process, what two quantities are always conserved? Select from the following. [i] matter and total energy. [ii] light and acoustic energy. [iii] density and thermal energy. [iv] gravity and potential energy.","completion":"The correct answer is [i] matter and total energy. In any physical or chemical process, the two fundamental quantities that are always conserved are matter and total energy. This principle is based on the fundamental laws of nature, including the law of conservation of mass and the law of conservation of energy. The Law of Conservation of Mass states that mass cannot be created nor destroyed in a closed system during a chemical or physical process. This means that the total mass of reactants before a reaction or process must equal the total mass of the products after the reaction or process. This principle was first formulated by Antoine Lavoisier in 1789 and has since then become a cornerstone of chemistry and physics. The Law of Conservation of Energy, also known as the First Law of Thermodynamics, states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed but can only be converted from one form to another. This means that the total amount of energy in a closed system remains constant before, during, and after a process. The total energy during any process may change forms, such as conversion from potential energy to kinetic energy or from chemical energy to thermal energy, but the total energy of the system remains the same. The other options provided do not align with the conservation laws in physical and chemical processes: [ii] Light and acoustic energy are specific forms of energy rather than fundamental quantities. They can be converted to other forms of energy during a process, and they are not always conserved separately. [iii] Density and thermal energy do not represent fundamental conservation laws. Density can change during phase transitions as well as in response to changes in pressure and temperature. Thermal energy can also be transferred between systems as heat. [iv] Gravity and potential energy are related as gravitational potential energy is associated with the force of gravity acting on an object over a distance. However, these two entities do not represent fundamental conservation laws. The law of conservation of energy includes potential energy (including gravitational), but it also encompasses other energy forms. In conclusion, the two quantities that are always conserved in any physical or chemical process are matter and total energy, which are governed by the Law of Conservation of Mass and the Law of Conservation of Energy, respectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Title: Painfully boring Review: I really liked 'Joe Merchant', but I had to stop reading this about 150 pages in because it was simply TOO BORING. Nothing ever really happened, and I got the feeling it never would. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","completion":"This product review conveys a negative sentiment towards the book in question. The reviewer explicitly states that they found the book \\"painfully boring\\" and had to stop reading it after 150 pages, as they felt that nothing interesting was happening in the story. This negative sentiment is further reinforced by the reviewer drawing a comparison with another book, \\"Joe Merchant,\\" which they mention they really liked. By making this comparison, the reviewer emphasizes their disappointment with the book they are reviewing. The overall tone of the review is quite critical, and it is evident that the reader did not have a positive experience with the book. Several aspects contribute to the negative sentiment in this review: 1. Use of strong negative descriptors: The reviewer uses the phrase \\"painfully boring\\" to describe their experience of reading the book. This adjective is quite strong and instantly conveys a sense of dissatisfaction and frustration. 2. Comparison with a liked book: By mentioning that they liked \\"Joe Merchant,\\" the reviewer sets a reference point, which highlights their discontent with the book being reviewed. This comparison showcases that the reviewer's negative sentiment is not just directed towards books in general but specifically towards the book they are reviewing. 3. Discontinuation of reading: The reviewer mentions they had to stop reading after 150 pages. This is an example of a strong negative action, as it shows that they could not find any redeeming qualities in the book to continue reading it. It sends a clear message that they found the book so boring that they simply could not bear to read any more of it. 4. No positive remarks: Throughout the entirety of the review, there are no positive aspects or redeeming qualities mentioned about the book. The absence of any positive comments further cements the overall negative sentiment. 5. Predicting that the book won't improve: The reviewer's statement, \\"I got the feeling it never would,\\" suggests that they believe the book will not improve or become more exciting even if they were to continue reading. This implies a lack of confidence in the book's ability to engage the reader and provides a pessimistic outlook on the story. In conclusion, the product review conveys a distinctly negative sentiment towards the book, based on the strong negative language, comparisons to a more liked book, discontinuation of reading, lack of positive remarks, and pessimistic predictions about the book's potential improvement."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Given the below context: Elgar is probably best known for the first of the five Pomp and Circumstance Marches, which were composed between 1901 and 1930. It is familiar to millions of television viewers all over the world every year who watch the Last Night of the Proms, where it is traditionally performed. When the theme of the slower middle section (technically called the \\"trio\\") of the first march came into his head, he told his friend Dora Penny, \\"I've got a tune that will knock 'em – will knock 'em flat\\". When the first march was played in 1901 at a London Promenade Concert, it was conducted by Henry J. Wood, who later wrote that the audience \\"rose and yelled ... the one and only time in the history of the Promenade concerts that an orchestral item was accorded a double encore.\\" To mark the coronation of Edward VII, Elgar was commissioned to set A. C. Benson's Coronation Ode for a gala concert at the Royal Opera House in June 1901. The approval of the king was confirmed, and Elgar began work. The contralto Clara Butt had persuaded him that the trio of the first Pomp and Circumstance march could have words fitted to it, and Elgar invited Benson to do so. Elgar incorporated the new vocal version into the Ode. The publishers of the score recognised the potential of the vocal piece, \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\", and asked Benson and Elgar to make a further revision for publication as a separate song. It was immensely popular and is now considered an unofficial British national anthem. In the United States, the trio, known simply as \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" or \\"The Graduation March\\", has been adopted since 1905 for virtually all high school and university graduations.In March 1904 a three-day festival of Elgar's works was presented at Covent Garden, an honour never before given to any English composer. The Times commented, \\"Four or five years ago if any one had predicted that the Opera-house would be full from floor to ceiling for the performance of an oratorio by an English composer he would probably have been supposed to be out of his...

The geographical regions in which Iranian languages were spoken were pushed back in several areas by newly neighbouring languages. Arabic spread into some parts of Western Iran (Khuzestan), and Turkic languages spread through much of Central Asia, displacing various Iranian languages such as Sogdian and Bactrian in parts of what is today Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. In Eastern Europe, mostly comprising the territory of modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, the core region of the native Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans had been decisively been taken over as a result of absorption and assimilation (e.g. Slavicisation) by the various Proto-Slavic population of the region, by the 6th century AD. This resulted in the displacement and extinction of the once predominant Scythian languages of the region. Sogdian's close relative Yaghnobi barely survives in a small area of the Zarafshan valley east of Samarkand, and Saka as Ossetic in the Caucasus, which is the sole remnant of the once predominant Scythian languages in Eastern Europe proper and large parts of the North Caucasus.

Title: Terror by Night Movie plot: An off-screen narrator tells of the deadly curse carried by the fabulous \\"Star of Rhodesia\\" diamond, then takes us to a London coffin-maker's, where Vivian Vedder (Renee Godfrey) arranges a special coffin for her late mother. She'll be taking it on the 7 PM train to Edinburgh. At Euston Station, Roland Carstairs (Geoffrey Steele) meets Holmes (Basil Rathbone), whom he has hired to guard his mother Lady Margaret (Mary Forbes), who has already boarded the train back home to Scotland. Actually, he's there to guard the Star of Rhodesia, which she has owned for many years, but was the object of an attempted theft when Lady Margaret wore it at a royal function. Holmes is certain the thieves will try again. Apparently, Scotland Yard agrees, as Inspector Lestrade (Dennis Hoey) is also taking the trip. The train begins to pull out, and Watson (Nigel Bruce) and his old army friend Major Duncan-Bleek (Alan Mowbray) barely manage to board. They had bumped into each other, and forgotten the time as they reminisced.

They find Carstairs dead and the box that had contained the Star empty. The body shows no wounds aside from a tiny spot of blood, but Holmes declares it's murder, since a thief arriving right after Carstairs died of natural causes is too improbable. Watson, unimpressed with Lestrade's plodding, decides to try questioning suspects himself.

I read this background article the other day: Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries: the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc. I am facing a new situation today: Two researches studied the Earth's mantle. Clint studied mantle melting, and his pal Uri decided to study other mantle related phenomena. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which researcher read less about adding water to the mantle?","completion":"In the new situation, Clint studied mantle melting, while Uri studied other mantle-related phenomena.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person is on an oxygen machine happens, how will it affect they take in less oxygen. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"If a person is on an oxygen machine and they take in less oxygen than required, it can affect the overall process of oxygen delivery to the cells in the body. The perturbation can have both direct and indirect effects on the process. Direct effects: 1. Reduced oxygen concentration in the inhaled air can lead to a lower amount of oxygen being available to bind with hemoglobin proteins in erythrocytes. 2. A reduced oxygen saturation in the blood could make it harder for the body to meet the oxygen demands of various cells and tissues. Indirect effects: 1. If the body is not receiving enough oxygen, it may trigger a compensatory response, such as increased heart rate and breathing rate in an attempt to increase oxygen intake and delivery throughout the body. 2. Prolonged oxygen deficiency might result in fatigue, dizziness and impaired mental function, as the cells are not receiving enough oxygen to function optimally. 3. In severe cases, a lack of oxygen can lead to organ damage and potential failure, as cells begin to die due to insufficient oxygen supply. In summary, the perturbation of taking in less oxygen while on an oxygen machine can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of oxygen delivery to the cells in the body. It is essential to ensure that individuals using oxygen machines receive the appropriate concentration of oxygen to prevent potential health consequences."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Article: As the capital of China's Shaanxi Province, Xi'an's long history was properly summed up by our English-speaking guide: \\"If Xi'an is the grandmother of cities, Beijing is a youth and Shanghai is just a baby in the womb. \\" However, it was not until 1974, following the chance discovery of the Army of Terracotta Warriors by well-digging farmers, that Xi'an was once again pushed onto the international map. Three decades later, the local government is pouring funds into the tourism sector. Ancient monuments and museums are being restored, and various copies of Buddhist and Tang heritage are being constructed to help Chinese tourists rediscover their national heritage. One of those ancient monuments is the Big Wild Goose Pagoda-Xi'an's most sacred monument-which was built in 652 by the monk Xuanzang ,who travelled across India for 18 years and returned with a precious collection of Buddhist sacred texts. In 1966,the Red Guards burnt the pagoda's scriptures, silk wall hangings and other relics in a bonfire that raged all night. But that destruction has largely been forgotten as tourists flock to the newly restored pagoda. The only original remainders-the empty shell of the seven-storey pagoda-light up at night, standing out in the city's skyline. Xi'an is also displaying the glories of the ancient Tang Dynasty, with a 165-acre Tang Paradise Theme Park that is visited by flocks of tourist groups. Although every bit of this Tang heritage is recreated, it is artistically pleasing, landscaped with ponds and lakes, classical gardens, bridges, palaces and pavilions. Explore the vast area on a golf cart, hopping on and off to see shortened operas from the Tang Dynasty days, laser shows on the lake, highly structured man-made waterfalls, as well as murals and statues of historical figures ,philosophers and poets.

Answer: The answer is:","completion":"Three historical sites in Xi'an have been referred to in the passage: the Big Wild Goose Pagoda, the Tang Paradise Theme Park, and the Army of Terracotta Warriors. Justification: 1. The Big Wild Goose Pagoda is mentioned as an ancient monument that has been restored and is attracting tourists. This constitutes one historical site. 2. The Tang Paradise Theme Park is presented as a vast area designed to showcase the glories of the ancient Tang Dynasty. Despite it being a \\"recreated\\" heritage, it represents a significant historical period and is thereby considered a historical site. 3. The Army of Terracotta Warriors is brought up as the most famous attraction in Xi'an, created in 221BC by the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huangdi.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Appendix: Periodic Table of the Elements In this chapter, we present some data on the chemical elements. The periodic table, introduced in Chapter 3 \\"Atoms, Molecules, and Ions\\", lists all the known chemical elements, arranged by atomic number (that is, the number of protons in the nucleus). The periodic table is arguably the best tool in all of science; no other branch of science can summarize its fundamental constituents in such a concise and useful way. Many of the physical and chemical properties of the elements are either known or understood based on their positions on the periodic table. Periodic tables are available with a variety of chemical and physical properties listed in each element’s box. What follows here is a more complex version of the periodic table than what was presented inChapter 3 \\"Atoms, Molecules, and Ions\\". The Internet is a great place to find periodic tables that contain additional information. One item on most periodic tables is the atomic mass of each element. For many applications, only one or two decimal places are necessary for the atomic mass. However, some applications (especially nuclear chemistry; see Chapter 15 \\"Nuclear Chemistry\\") require more decimal places. The atomic masses in Table 17.1 \\"The Basics of the Elements of the Periodic Table\\" represent the number of decimal places recognized by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, the worldwide body that develops standards for chemistry. The atomic masses of some elements are known very precisely, to a large number of decimal places. The atomic masses of other elements, especially radioactive elements, are not known as precisely. Some elements, such as lithium, can have varying atomic masses depending on how their isotopes are isolated. The web offers many interactive periodic table resources.

Many poor Mexicans have sought to cross the 3,000-km border with the US in search of a job but in recent years more Mexicans immigrants have returned to Mexico than migrated to the US. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in drugs-related gang violence in the past decade. Powerful cartels control the trafficking of drugs from South America to the US. Security forces ordered to crack down on them have been accused of abusing their power and acting with impunity.

Central American provinces secede. 1846-8 - Mexican-American War ends with Mexico being forced to sell its northern provinces (including modern-day California, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona and Utah) to the US. 1910-1920 - Mexican Revolution leads to establishment of a constitutional republic. 1929 - Formation of the National Revolutionary Party, which later becomes the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which dominates politics until 2000. 1968 - Student demonstration in Mexico City during the Olympic Games is fired upon by Mexican security forces. Hundreds of protesters are killed or wounded. 1976 - Huge offshore oil reserves discovered. 1994 - Zapatista rebels, led by the charismatic Subcommander Marcos, rise up demanding improved rights for some 10 million Indians in Mexico, four million of whom live in Chiapas. 2000 - Vicente Fox breaks ruling PRI party's seven-decade dominance by winning presidential election. 2006 - President Felipe Calderon launches crackdown on drug gangs, with violence escalating into a national security crisis. 2014 - Global outcry after 43 students go missing in the city of Iguala in southwest Mexico. Summary:","completion":"Mexico is the second biggest economy in Latin America and sells a lot of oil, but still, not everyone lives comfortably. Many people live in poor areas in the city or in the countryside, and some try to move to the US for better jobs. There has also been a lot of violence because of gangs who sell drugs. The leader of Mexico is a man named Enrique Pena Nieto, who won the presidential election for his party in 2012. He has been trying to make some big changes in the country, like making sure big businesses pay their taxes and making it easier for other companies to sell energy. But, things like gang violence and corruption are still big problems. It is also a very dangerous place for journalists, or people who write news stories, because many have been hurt or even killed since 2000. The internet is pretty popular in Mexico, with more than half the people using it. Mexico has a long history, starting from when Spain took over in 1519 until it became its own country in 1824. It has been through wars and revolutions, and has grown and changed a lot over time. One big thing that happened was the Mexican-American War, when Mexico had to give up a lot of land to the US. Nowadays, Mexico is working hard to solve its problems, like drug violence and ensuring rights for its people, and continues to grow and change every day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Process: - The gravity of the sun pulls its mass inward - There is a lot of pressure on the Sun - The pressure forces atoms of hydrogen to fuse together in nuclear reactions - The energy from the reactions gives off different kinds of light - The light travels to the Earth. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose pressure moves atoms together slower happens, how will it affect MORE sunlight arriving at the Earth. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation could potentially have a direct effect on the process. In the context of the Sun, pressure is a crucial factor in initiating nuclear fusion. It is the incredibly high pressure and temperature in the Sun's core that allows hydrogen nuclei, or protons, to come close enough together to overcome their natural repulsion and fuse. This fusion process releases a vast amount of energy in the form of light and heat, which eventually reaches the Earth as sunlight. Now, if we hypothesize that pressure inside the Sun somehow started to move atoms together more slowly, this could have a few potential effects: 1. Decreased fusion rate: If the pressure is not high enough to overcome the natural repulsion between hydrogen atoms, the rate of fusion might decrease. Reduced fusion means less energy and therefore less light and heat are produced. 2. Slower energy transmission: The energy generated in the Sun's core takes a significant amount of time to reach the surface and radiate into space. If fusions are happening less frequently due to decreased pressure, it could also mean the energy takes longer to get to the surface of the Sun. 3. Decreased Sunlight: With less energy being produced and potentially slower transmission of that energy, the Earth could receive less sunlight over a certain period of time, assuming all other factors remain constant. So yes, the perturbation you described could potentially result in less, not more, sunlight reaching the Earth. It's important to note, however, that this is all purely hypothetical, as any significant change in the Sun's internal pressure could have a wide range of other impacts on solar dynamics."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write highlights for this article: The fabled PlayStation Phone has finally surfaced, and it is definitely packing Google's Android OS. A few months ago, rumors surfaced about the existence of a PlayStation Phone, a hybrid mobile and gaming device with a 5-megapixel camera, 1 GHz Snapdragon processor, slide-out gaming pad and the Android Gingerbread OS. While those reports contained several details concerning the device, there wasn't much in terms of proof. Now Engadget has delivered strong evidence that the device exists. The technology blog has posted a series of crisp pictures of the device, and unless someone went to extreme lengths to create a false prototype, it looks legitimate to us. Engadget reports that the PlayStation Phone sports 512 MB of RAM, 1 GB of ROM and a 1GHz Qualcomm MSM8655 Snapdragon chip. It includes a multitouch touchpad, trigger buttons and microSD card support. The device is being built by Sony Ericsson. The Android-based gaming phone is still a prototype according to the report, so it's unlikely to arrive before the holidays; we'd bet on a Q1 or Q2 2011 release. We're itching to get our hands one of of these bad boys. We want to find out if the PlayStation Phone can make Android into a gaming powerhouse on par with the iPhone, or whether the device will go the way of the N-Gage. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

Given those answer options, answer the question: I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen.

Because steak was so expensive, restaurants ordered less from farms , so","completion":"Because steak was so expensive, restaurants ordered less from farms, so they could efficiently manage their budgets and maintain optimal profit margins without passing on the exorbitant costs to their customers. As a result, the demand for high-priced steaks decreased, ultimately leading to various ripple effects throughout the supply chain. Firstly, the lower demand from restaurants forced some farms to pivot and diversify their offerings. Many started focusing more on more affordable animal products like chicken and pork. By reevaluating their product portfolios, these farms were able to stay afloat in an increasingly competitive market, catering to the evolving needs of the restaurants they supply. Additionally, the reduced demand for expensive steaks encouraged farmers to seek out alternative revenue streams, leading to a rise in value-added products and increased emphasis on environmentally friendly and sustainable farming practices. In response to changing consumer preferences, some farmers began experimenting with different types of cattle breeds and feed, aiming to find the perfect balance between cost, quality, and sustainability. With restaurants purchasing less quantity of steaks, they had to be more creative with their menus to continue attracting customers. This stimulated the market for innovative culinary offerings, including the incorporation of lesser-known cuts of meat, as well as the growth of vegetarian and plant-based options. Chefs began exploring the potential of alternative proteins and ingredients, developing dishes that not only catered to changing dietary preferences but also reduced their reliance on expensive steak. Moreover, the lower demand for expensive steaks had an impact on the overall meat industry. Competing products such as lab-grown meats and plant-based alternatives continued to gain traction, with many consumers seeking affordable and sustainable options that had a reduced environmental impact. This contributed to the increased awareness and growth of alternative protein sources, further expanding the offerings available in restaurants and other foodservice establishments. Lastly, the reduction in steak purchases from farms prompted a reevaluation of restaurant pricing strategies. Many establishments realized that they could no longer rely solely on premium-priced steak dishes to boost their revenues. Instead, they began focusing on providing a diverse range of options at varying price points, allowing them to cater to a wider demographic and maintain the loyal patronage of their customers even in challenging economic times. In summary, because steak was so expensive, restaurants ordering less from farms led to significant changes throughout the industry. The reduced demand prompted farms to adapt and diversify their products, while restaurants had to explore new menu offerings, cater to diverse dietary preferences, and adjust their pricing strategies. Meanwhile, alternative protein sources continued to gain prominence as the market shifted, emphasizing the importance of innovation, sustainability, and adaptability in the ever-evolving foodservice landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In places where foliage is dense and plants are growing quickly, the index is high, represented in dark green. Regions where few plants grow have a low vegetation index, shown in tan. The index is based on measurements taken by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASAs Terra satellite. Areas where the satellite did not collect data are gray. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - The lion (\\"Panthera leo\\") is one of the big cats in the genus \\"Panthera\\" and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered. - Solomon Islands is a sovereign country consisting of six major islands and over 900 smaller islands in Oceania lying to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu and covering a land area of . The country's capital, Honiara, is located on the island of Guadalcanal. The country takes its name from the Solomon Islands archipelago, which is a collection of Melanesian islands that also includes the North Solomon Islands (part of Papua New Guinea), but excludes outlying islands, such as Rennell and Bellona, and the Santa Cruz Islands. - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - Wellington is the capital city and second most populous urban area of New Zealand, with residents. It is at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa. As the nation's capital city, the New Zealand Government and Parliament, Supreme Court and most of the civil service are based in the city. - Tasmania (abbreviated as Tas and known colloquially as \\"Tassie\\") is an island state of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is located to the south of the Australian mainland, separated by Bass Strait. The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania, the 26th-largest island in the world, and the surrounding 334 islands. The state has a population of around 518,500, just over forty percent of which resides in the Greater Hobart precinct, which forms the metropolitan area of the state capital and largest city, Hobart. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - Afri (singular \\"Afer\\") was a Latin name for the inhabitants of Africa, referring in its widest sense to all the lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya). Latin-speakers at first used \\"afer\\" as an adjective, meaning \\"of Africa\\". As a substantive, it denoted a native of \\"Africa\\", i. e., an African. - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans. - Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats. - Modern humans (\\"Homo sapiens\\", primarily ssp. \\"Homo sapiens sapiens\\") are the only extant members of Hominina tribe (or human tribe), a branch of the tribe Hominini belonging to the family of great apes. They are characterized by erect posture and bipedal locomotion; manual dexterity and increased tool use, compared to other animals; and a general trend toward larger, more complex brains and societies. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Trichoceridae, or winter crane flies, of the order Diptera are long, thin, delicate insects superficially similar in appearance to the Tipulidae, Tanyderidae, and Ptychopteridae. The presence of ocelli distinguishes the Trichoceridae from these other families. There are approximately 160 known species. The adults can be found flying in the fall and the spring and some are active even in the winter, hence their common name. They form dancing, loose swarms of mostly males. Adults can also be found resting inside caves and hollow logs. Larvae occur in moist habitats where they feed on decaying vegetable matter. They are of no economic importance. - The Tanyderidae , or primitive crane flies , of the order Diptera , are long , thin , delicate insects with spotted wings , superficially similar in appearance to some Tipulidae , Trichoceridae , and Ptychopteridae . Most species are restricted in distribution . They are found in many parts of the world , including North America , South America , Africa , Australia , New Zealand , and various islands in the Pacific Ocean . Adults are usually found hanging from vegetation near streams . Larvae are found either in sandy stream margins or in wet , rotten wood . Fossil species are known . - A larva (plural \\"larvae\\" ) is a distinct juvenile form many animals undergo before metamorphosis into adults. Animals with indirect development such as insects, amphibians, or cnidarians typically have a larval phase of their life cycle. - The Sinai Peninsula or simply Sinai ('; ', ; \\"\\") is a peninsula in Egypt, situated between the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Red Sea to the south, serving as a land bridge between Asia and Africa. It is the only part of Egyptian territory located in Asia. Sinai has a land area of about and a population of approximately 1,400,000 people. The bulk of the peninsula is divided administratively into two of Egypt's 27 governorates (with three more straddling the Suez Canal area). - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - The Ptychopteridae, phantom crane flies, are a small family (three extant genera) of nematocerous Diptera. Superficially similar in appearance to other \\"tipuloid\\" families, they lack the ocelli of the Trichoceridae, the five-branched radial vein of the Tanyderidae, and the two anal veins that reach the wing margins of the Tipulidae. They are usually allied with the Tanyderidae based on similarities of the mesonotal suture, this group being called the Ptychopteromorpha. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay. - The North Island or Te Ika-a-Mui (\\"Mori\\") is one of the two main islands of New Zealand, separated from the slightly larger but much less populous South Island by Cook Strait. The island's area is , making it the world's 14th-largest island. It has a population of - Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about scattered over of the southern Pacific Ocean. It has a population of 103,000 people of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu. - Auckland is a city in the North Island of New Zealand. It is the most populous urban area in the country. Auckland has a population of , which constitutes percent of New Zealand's population. It is part of the wider Auckland Regionthe area governed by the Auckland Councilwhich also includes outlying rural areas and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf, resulting in a total population of . Auckland also has the largest Polynesian population of any city in the world. The Mori language name for Auckland is or , meaning \\"Tmaki with a hundred lovers\\", in reference to the desirability of its fertile land at the hub of waterways in all directions. It has also been called karana, the Mori enunciation of \\"Auckland\\". - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - The Antarctic (US English , UK English or and or ) is a polar region, specifically the region around the Earth's South Pole, opposite the Arctic region around the North Pole. The Antarctic comprises in the strict sense the continent of Antarctica and the island territories located on the Antarctic Plate. In a broader sense the Antarctic region include the ice shelves, waters, and island territories in the Southern Ocean situated south of the Antarctic Convergence, a zone approximately wide varying in latitude seasonally. The region covers some 20% of the Southern Hemisphere, of which 5.5% (14 million km) is the surface area of the Antarctic continent itself. All of the land and ice shelves south of 60°S latitude are administrated under the Antarctic Treaty System. In a biogeographic sense, the Antarctic ecozone is one of eight ecozones of the Earth's land surface. - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.

Context: Treaties are not necessarily permanently binding upon the signatory parties. As obligations in international law are traditionally viewed as arising only from the consent of states, many treaties expressly allow a state to withdraw as long as it follows certain procedures of notification. For example, the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs provides that the treaty will terminate if, as a result of denunciations, the number of parties falls below 40. Many treaties expressly forbid withdrawal. Article 56 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties provides that where a treaty is silent over whether or not it can be denounced there is a rebuttable presumption that it cannot be unilaterally denounced unless: The answer to this question is:","completion":"For a treaty to be valid, obligations in international law must arise from the consent of states, and certain procedures of notification must be followed for withdrawal.

Bill Bartlett, whose full name is William Byron Bartlett, was born on June 22, 1946, in Pasadena, Texas. Before joining Ram Jam, Bartlett was a member of several bands, including The Lemon Pipers, which had a hit in 1968 with the song \\"Green Tambourine.\\" As Ram Jam's lead singer and guitarist, Bartlett was a crucial part of the band's sound and image.

As Harvey's interests shifted to the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended and the number of visitors slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in his foot put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced.

This boxing match was one of the most highly anticipated bouts at the time as it pit Mayweather Jr., who was still on the rise as an undefeated contender, against De La Hoya, who was not only a popular figure in the boxing world but also a seasoned veteran with multiple title wins under his belt. The fight was also notable as it was billed as \\"The World Awaits,\\" indicative of the significant global attention it had garnered. Over the course of twelve rounds, both fighters displayed substantial skill and prowess. Mayweather mainly used his typical defensive style of fighting -- relying on his speed, quick reflexes, and accurate counter-punching to score points, while De La Hoya was the more aggressive fighter, throwing more punches and pushing the action. However, despite De La Hoya’s efforts, Mayweather emerged victorious by a split decision. The match ended with one judge scoring the match 115-113 in favor of De La Hoya, another judging it 115-113 in favor of Mayweather, and the third scoring it 116-112, also in favor of Mayweather. So, Mayweather maintained his undefeated record and also won the WBC Light Middleweight title following this match. Although some people were critical of the judges' decision and believed De La Hoya had won, the match's outcome cemented Mayweather's standing as one of the most noteworthy figures in boxing. He went on to maintain an undefeated professional boxing record throughout his career. This fight was also a major milestone in Mayweather's career as it was the most lucrative fight in boxing history at the time, generating approximately 136 million in pay-per-view revenues.

Article: You've heard it repeatedly: Make sure you drink at least eight glasses of water per day. The key words are \\"at least\\", because, unless you are a child, you need more water than that. The rule is, for every 50 pounds of body weight you carry, drink one quart of bottled or filtered water per day. The average person weighs 150 pounds, so they should drink three quarts per day. A 200 pounds person should drink a full gallon per day. Athletes should drink even more than that. Follow these and you've adopted one of the most important health habits. Our bodies are mostly water, and water is essential to our every function. Drink the appropriate amount, and everything is much more likely to function at the best levels. If you don't drink enough water, over the short term you will experience tiredness, dry skin, headaches and constipation ; over the longer term, every body function will _ more quickly. It really is as simple as that. Things get a bit more complicated in what type of water to drink. Bottled water and filtered water are both good options. Do not drink tap water or distilled water .Bottled water should be bottled in clear glass containers, not the plastic containers that transfer far too many chemicals into the water. Filtered water can be obtained through low-cost filters. Tap water should be avoided because it contains chlorine and may contain fluoride , which is poisonous and can have terrible consequences for the body. Distilled water should also be avoided because it can burn up your body of necessary minerals. It has been tied to hair loss, which is often associated with certain mineral lack. Finally, drink water at room temperature if possible, as ice-cold water can harm your stomach. Question: Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage? Options: A: It is harmful to drink plenty of icy water. B: One may feel tired due to lack of water for a short time. C: The water with chlorine is not suitable to drink. D: The water in plastic containers is safe to drink. Answer:","completion":"D: The water in plastic containers is safe to drink."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Who will make a worse parent? Two bears are living in the same forest. One bear, named Teddy, often runs and is active in its daily life. The other bear, Fluffy, is lazy and hardly moves at all. Their levels of fitness are very different with Teddy having a much higher overall fitness level than Fluffy. Hint: All of these animal behaviors are important. They help the animals get food for energy, make sure their young survive, or ensure that they, themselves, survive. Behaviors that help animals or their young survive, increase the animals’ fitness. Animals with higher fitness have a better chance of passing their genes on to the next generation. If genes control behaviors that increase fitness, the behaviors become more common in the species. This occurs through the process of evolution by natural selection. The answer is:","completion":"Fluffy will likely make a worse parent compared to Teddy, based on the information provided in the paragraph. Teddy, being more active and having a higher overall fitness level, demonstrates behaviors that are more inclined towards ensuring the survival of its offspring and contributing to the overall fitness of the species. Animal behaviors play a significant role in their ability to secure food sources, protect their young, and guarantee their survival. Behaviors that contribute to the well-being and survival of animals and their offspring are linked to an increased level of fitness. As a result, animals with higher fitness have a better chance of passing their genes on to the next generation and contributing to the prevalence of these behaviors within their species. In the case of the two bears, Teddy's active lifestyle and increased overall fitness level are indicative of its greater capability to provide for its young, protect them from harm, and ensure their survival. Fluffy, on the other hand, being lazy and less active, is less likely to be successful in these crucial parenting aspects. Consequently, Teddy's genes associated with favorable fitness-promoting behaviors stand a better chance of being passed on to the next generation of bears and becoming more common across the species through the process of evolution by natural selection. Given the importance of fitness for survival and reproduction, it can be deduced that Fluffy's lazy and inactive lifestyle is deterring its ability to contribute optimally to the welfare of its offspring and the progression of its species as a whole. Therefore, Fluffy would likely make a worse parent when compared to the more active and fit Teddy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

(CNN) -- Cuba will pardon more than 2,900 prisoners, the government said Friday, though U.S. subcontractor Alan Gross is not among those who will be freed. The decision to release the prisoners follows \\"numerous requests\\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro. Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released. Those who will be freed have already served a \\"important\\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate. The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said. Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state. He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict XVI as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the \\"generosity and strength of the revolution.\\" The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter.

Up to 1990, English, German and Afrikaans were official languages. Long before Namibia's independence from South Africa, SWAPO was of the opinion that the country should become officially monolingual, choosing this approach in contrast to that of its neighbour South Africa (which granted all 11 of its major languages official status), which was seen by them as \\"a deliberate policy of ethnolinguistic fragmentation.\\" Consequently, SWAPO instituted English as the sole official language of Namibia though only about 3% of the population speaks it as a home language.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does the word \\"store\\" mean the same thing in \\"Store grain for the winter.\\" and \\"The bear stores fat for the period of hibernation when he doesn't eat.\\"?","completion":"Yes, the word \\"store\\" in both sentences refers to the same meaning, which is to accumulate or gather something for later use or for a specific purpose. The differences in the sentences are in the context and the subjects involved, but the core meaning of \\"store\\" remains the same. In the sentence \\"Store grain for the winter,\\" the word \\"store\\" is used as a verb, and the context implies that the speaker is advising someone (or possibly themselves) to accumulate a stockpile of grain during a time when it is plentiful so that it will be available for use throughout the winter months. Winter can be a challenging time in terms of food shortages and harsh weather, so storing essential food items like grain becomes an important task to ensure survival and sustenance. The subject involved in this sentence is an unspecified individual who needs to perform the action of storing the grain. In the sentence \\"The bear stores fat for the period of hibernation when he doesn't eat,\\" the word \\"store\\" is similarly used as a verb, and the context refers to the biological and survival-oriented mechanism of a bear's body. Before hibernation, bears need to accumulate enough fat reserves to sustain themselves during the long period when they do not eat. The bear's body stores the fat, which will be utilized as a source of energy during hibernation. The subject involved in this sentence is the bear, specifically its natural instincts and ability to store fat for hibernation. In conclusion, while the context and subjects differ in the two sentences, the word \\"store\\" maintains the same meaning of gathering or accumulating something for later use or for a specific purpose. The two examples illustrate how the act of storing is important for survival and sustenance, whether it involves humans storing grain for winter or bears storing fat for hibernation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can you tell me the answer to when was the guns and roses riot in st louis??","completion":"The Guns N' Roses riot, also known as the Riverport Riot, occurred on July 2, 1991, during a concert at the Riverport Amphitheater (now known as Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre) in St. Louis, Missouri. The infamous riot transpired when Guns N' Roses, a renowned rock band from the late 1980s and early 1990s, was in the middle of performing their hit song \\"Rocket Queen.\\" The incident began when lead singer Axl Rose noticed a fan in the crowd taking pictures with a camera, which was against the band's previously stated rules. Rose asked the venue's security to handle the situation, but when he felt they weren't quick enough to act, he decided to confront the fan and confiscate the camera himself. Axl Rose jumped into the crowd to retrieve the camera and had a brief physical altercation with the fan. Once back on stage, Rose criticized the security team and announced, \\"Well, thanks to the lame-ass security, I'm going home!\\" He then removed his hat, placed it on the stage, and dropped the microphone before departing. The rest of the band shortly followed, leaving an enraged and disappointed audience behind. The frustration of the 15,000 fans culminated in a destructive riot, resulting in multiple injuries and considerable property damage both within the venue and surrounding areas. Shocked concertgoers wreaked havoc by flipping cars, tearing up the venue, and clashing with the police. The St. Louis County Police Department estimated the damage to be around 200,000. In the aftermath, Axl Rose faced legal issues and was charged with four misdemeanors: third-degree assault, property damage, general peace disturbance, and leaving the scene of a misdemeanor. After a two-year legal battle, Rose settled the cases out of court, agreeing to pay damages and pled guilty to property damage and assault charges. He received two years of probation and was ordered to contribute to a local crime victim's fund. The Riverport Riot had a lasting impact on Guns N' Roses' reputation, contributing to the tension within the band and eventually leading to their temporary disbandment in the mid-1990s. It took 26 years for the band to return to St. Louis, as part of their \\"Not in This Lifetime… Tour\\" in July 2017."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Q: How does air pressure change as altitude increases?

Translate to English","completion":"The European parliamentary delegations that you mentioned are already open to commissioners, or members of the Council, who can go there; however, everything depends on the schedule. The European parliamentary delegations play a significant role in fostering cooperation and dialogue between the European Union and other countries, regions, and organizations. The main objective of these delegations is to establish and maintain relationships with the parliaments of the respective countries or regions, as well as to enhance mutual understanding and collaboration. There are several types of European parliamentary delegations: interparliamentary delegations, joint parliamentary committees, and parliamentary cooperation committees. Each type has its specific tasks and responsibilities; however, they all share common goals: to support the external policies of the European Union, to contribute to the development of democracy and human rights globally, and to engage in dialogue with third countries and their respective parliaments. Commissioners, or members of the European Commission, are responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, and managing the day-to-day affairs of the EU. They are appointed by the European Council and represent the interests of the European Union as a whole, rather than their home countries. Members of the Council, on the other hand, represent EU member states and coordinate the policies of individual nations within the larger framework of the European Union. Both commissioners and members of the Council can participate in European parliamentary delegations. Their presence in the delegations helps in establishing a stronger connection between the European institutions and the parliaments of third countries or regions. However, the extent of their involvement in these delegations depends on their schedules and availability. To summarize, the European parliamentary delegations serve as important avenues for dialogue and cooperation between the European Union and other countries, regions, and global organizations. Commissioners and members of the Council can take part in these delegations, depending on their schedules and availability, to strengthen relationships and engage in fruitful discussions towards common goals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hari Singh was equally hesitant about acceding to either India or Pakistan, as either would have provoked adverse reactions in parts of his kingdom. He signed a Standstill Agreement with Pakistan and proposed one with India as well, but announced that Kashmir intended to remain independent. However, his rule was opposed by Sheikh Abdullah, the popular leader of Kashmir's largest political party, the National Conference, who demanded his abdication.Pakistan, attempting to force the issue of Kashmir's accession, cut off supplies and transport links. The chaos in Punjab resulting from Partition had also severed transport links with India, meaning that Kashmir's only links with the two dominions was by air. Rumours about atrocities against the Muslim population of Poonch by the Maharajah's forces caused the outbreak of civil unrest. Shortly thereafter, Pathan tribesmen from the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan crossed the border and entered Kashmir. The invaders made rapid progress towards Srinagar. The Maharaja of Kashmir wrote to India, asking for military assistance. India required the signing of an Instrument of Accession and setting up an interim government headed by Sheikh Abdullah in return.

The woman had written a will and said 'under no circumstances' did she wish the youngsters - a girl aged eight and a boy aged seven - to return to their Australian father. Her parents and her ex-husband, who is of Aboriginal descent, became embroiled in a family court fight over the children's futures after she died late in 2014. A judge today ruled in favour of the woman's ex-husband following a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London. Their mother, now deceased, took them to","completion":"England without their father's consent in 2013, after the couple's relationship broke down. The father subsequently filed for custody and launched legal proceedings under the Hague Convention on child abduction, seeking their return to Australia. The children's maternal grandparents argued that they should remain in England with them, as per their late daughter's wishes. They expressed concerns about the father's ability to care for the children, citing his Australian residence and cultural differences. During the court proceedings, the judge carefully considered the best interests of the children. Evidence was presented from both parties, including testimonies from the children themselves, social workers, and child psychologists. The judge ultimately decided that the children's best interests would be served by returning them to their father in Australia. In the ruling, the judge noted that the father had demonstrated a strong commitment to the children's well-being, and acknowledged the importance of maintaining a connection with their Aboriginal heritage. The judge also indicated that the children had expressed a desire to be reunited with their father. Taking all factors into account, the judge ruled that the children should return to Australia to live with their father. The grandparents were granted visitation rights, and the father agreed to facilitate communication and visits between the children and their maternal family in England. Following the court's decision, the ex-husband expressed his gratitude and relief at being able to reconnect with his children, while the maternal grandparents, though disappointed, stated that they would respect the court's ruling and focus on maintaining a positive relationship with their grandchildren. The children are expected to return to Australia within the coming weeks to begin their new lives with their father. The case underscores the difficult decisions that courts must make in custody disputes, and the importance of prioritizing the best interests of the children involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe.

Background: The Sinhalese (Sinhala: siNhl jaatiy Sinhala Jathiya, also known as Hela) are an Indo-Aryan-speaking ethnic group native to the island of Sri Lanka. They constitute about 75% of the Sri Lankan population and number greater than 16.2 million. The Sinhalese identity is based on language, historical heritage and religion. The Sinhalese people speak the Sinhalese language, an Indo-Aryan language, and are predominantly Theravada Buddhists, although a small percentage of Sinhalese follow branches of Christianity. Context: Sinhalese cuisine is one of the most complex cuisines of South Asia. Due to its proximity to South India, Sinhalese cuisine shows some influence, yet is in many ways quite distinct. As a major trade hub, it draws influence from colonial powers that were involved in Sri Lanka and by foreign traders. Rice, which is consumed daily, can be found at any occasion, while spicy curries are favourite dishes for lunch and dinner. Some of the Sri Lankan dishes have striking resemblance to Kerala cuisine, which could be due to the similar geographic and agricultural features with Kerala. A well-known rice dish with Sinhalese is Kiribath, meaning \\"Milk Rice.\\" In addition to sambols, Sinhalese eat \\"Mallung\\"- chopped leaves mixed with grated coconut and red onions. Coconut milk is found in most Sri Lankan dishes to give the cuisine its unique flavour. Sri Lanka has long been renowned for its spices. The best known is cinnamon which is native to Sri Lanka. In the 15th and 16th centuries, spice and ivory traders from all over the world who came to Sri Lanka brought their native cuisines to the island, resulting in a rich diversity of cooking styles and techniques. Lamprais rice boiled in stock with a special curry, accompanied by frikkadels (meatballs), all of which is then wrapped in a banana leaf and baked as a Dutch-influenced Sri Lankan dish. Dutch and Portuguese sweets also continue to be popular. British influences include roast beef and roast chicken. Also, the influence of the Indian cooking methods and food have played a major role in what Sri Lankans eat. The island nation's cuisine mainly consists of boiled or steamed rice served with curry. This usually consists of a \\"main curry\\" of fish or chicken, as well as several other curries made with vegetables, lentils and even fruit curries. Side-dishes include pickles, chutneys and \\"sambols\\". The most famous of these is the coconut sambol, made of ground coconut mixed with chili peppers, dried Maldive fish and lime juice. This is ground to a paste and eaten with rice, as it gives zest to the meal and is believed to increase appetite. Question: anything else?. Whats the answer?","completion":"In addition to the information provided, there are several other aspects of Sinhalese cuisine that contribute to its rich and diverse nature. Here, we will discuss some of the popular dishes, ingredients, and culinary traditions in Sinhalese cuisine. 1. Popular dishes: Apart from the mentioned Kiribath and Lamprais, Sinhalese cuisine offers a range of flavorful and unique dishes. - Hoppers (Appa): A fermented pancake made from rice flour and coconut milk, often served with an egg in the center (Egg Hopper) and various accompaniments like curries or sambols. - Kottu Roti: A popular street food consisting of chopped flatbread mixed with vegetables, meats, and spices, stirred and cooked together on a flat griddle. - String Hoppers (Indiappa): Steamed thin rice noodles made from rice flour dough, often served with curries and coconut milk gravy (kiri hodi). - Watalappan: A sweet and spiced coconut custard dessert made with coconut milk, jaggery (palm sugar), and spices like cardamom and nutmeg. 2. Ingredients: Sinhalese cuisine makes use of various indigenous ingredients that add distinct flavors to the dishes. - Spices: As a land rich in spices, Sri Lankan dishes incorporate various spices like cinnamon, black pepper, cardamom, cloves, and nutmeg. These spices not only enhance the taste but also have several health benefits. - Curry leaves (Karapincha): An essential ingredient in many Sinhalese dishes, curry leaves add a unique flavor and aroma to the dishes. - Jackfruit: Both ripe and unripe jackfruit are used in Sinhalese cuisine for their diverse flavors and textures. Unripe jackfruit can be prepared as a curry (Polos), while ripe jackfruit is used in desserts and snacks. - Tamarind: The sour taste of tamarind is used in many dishes, particularly in fish and seafood recipes, to add a tangy flavor. 3. Culinary traditions: Sinhalese cuisine has many unique culinary practices that have been passed down for generations. - Clay pot cooking: Traditional Sinhalese cooking often uses clay pots, which helps to retain the flavors and nutrients in food. The slow cooking process in clay pots imparts a distinct earthy flavor to the dishes. - Banana leaves: Wrapping food, especially rice and curry, in banana leaves preserves the natural flavors, aroma, and nutrients. The banana leaf imparts a subtle fragrance to the food, enhancing the overall eating experience. - Grinding stones: Traditional methods, such as the use of stone grinding tools (mirisgala), are still employed in many households to make coconut sambols and other spice pastes, resulting in a more authentic and aromatic end product. In conclusion, Sinhalese cuisine showcases a compelling blend of indigenous, regional, and international influences that make it a unique gastronomic experience. From the use of abundant local ingredients to the adoption of time-honored culinary practices, Sinhalese cuisine offers a diverse palate that is reflective of the island's rich cultural heritage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Das Grünbuch der Europäischen Kommission zeigt überzeugende Argumente im Zusammenhang mit der Frage, warum wir die derzeitigen Pensions- und Rentensysteme verbessern müssen, auf. Translate to English English:","completion":"The Green Paper of the European Commission presents convincing arguments in connection with the question of why we need to improve the current pension and retirement systems. The European Commission's Green Paper is a crucial document that highlights the need to improve the existing pension and retirement systems in member countries. The paper presents several convincing arguments that support the case for these improvements. Some key arguments are as follows: 1. Demographic changes: Europe is experiencing significant demographic shifts, with an aging population and a decline in the working-age population. This means that the dependency ratio (the number of elderly people relative to the working-age population) will increase, putting pressure on the current pension systems. The Green Paper emphasizes the need to adapt pension systems to these demographic changes and ensure their long-term sustainability. 2. Adequacy of retirement incomes: One of the main concerns regarding existing pension systems is whether they provide adequate retirement incomes for people to maintain a decent living standard. The Green Paper argues that the pensions landscape should be improved to ensure retirees receive adequate incomes, reflecting their contributions to the working world and their needs in retirement. 3. Financial sustainability: Pension systems in many European countries are facing long-term financial challenges. The Green Paper points out that these challenges must be addressed to ensure the systems remain solvent and capable of fulfilling their obligations. This may involve adjustments to key aspects, such as contributions, benefits, retirement age, or systemic organization. 4. Flexibility and adaptability: The European Commission emphasizes the importance of making pension systems more flexible and adaptable to cater to the diverse and changing needs of the workforce. This includes addressing issues such as gender inequality, labor market mobility, and having a greater emphasis on employment opportunities for older workers. 5. Transparency and communication: The Green Paper stresses the need for increased transparency and effective communication regarding pension systems. This is important to enhance awareness and understanding among citizens, allowing them to make informed decisions about their retirement plans, ultimately ensuring better financial security in old age. In conclusion, the European Commission's Green Paper presents several convincing arguments for the need to improve current pension and retirement systems in Europe. These improvements are vital for ensuring the adequacy and sustainability of retirement incomes, catering to the diverse needs of the workforce, and enhancing transparency, ultimately contributing to the well-being of European citizens in their later years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information: - Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances. - Acetic acid , systematically named ethanoic acid , is a colourless liquid organic compound with the chemical formula CHCOOH (also written as CHCOH or CHO). When undiluted, it is sometimes called \\"glacial acetic acid\\". Vinegar is roughly 39% acetic acid by volume, making acetic acid the main component of vinegar apart from water. Acetic acid has a distinctive sour taste and pungent smell. In addition to household vinegar, it is mainly produced as a precursor to polyvinyl acetate and cellulose acetate. Although it is classified as a weak acid, concentrated acetic acid is corrosive and can attack the skin. - In chemistry, structural theory explains the large variety in chemical compounds in terms of atoms making up molecules, the order in which atoms are put together in molecules and the electrons that hold them together. According to structural theory, from the structural formula of a molecule it is possible to derive physical and spectroscopic data and to predict chemical reactivity. - Hermann Kolbe ( Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe , 27 Sept. 1818 -- 25 Nov. 1884 ) , was a seminal contributor in the birth of modern organic chemistry as Professor at Marburg and Leipzig . Kolbe coined the term synthesis , and contributed to the philosophical demise of vitalism through synthesis of the biologic natural product acetic acid from carbon disulfide , to structural theory via modifications to the idea of \`\` radicals '' and accurate prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary alcohols , and to the emerging array of organic reactions through his Kolbe electrolysis of carboxylate salts , the Kolbe - Schmitt reaction in the preparation of aspirin , and the Kolbe nitrile synthesis . After studies with Wöhler and Bunsen , Kolbe was involved with the early internationalization of chemistry through overseas work in London ( with Frankland ) , and rose through the ranks of his field to edit the Journal für Praktische Chemie , to be elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences , and to win the Royal Society of London 's Davy Medal in the year of his death . Despite these accomplishments and his training a storied next generation of chemists ( including Zaitsev , Curtius , Beckmann , Graebe , Markovnikov , etc. ) , Kolbe is remembered for editing the Journal for more than a decade , where his rejection of Kekulé 's structure of benzene , va n't Hoff 's theory on the origin of chirality , and von Baeyer 's reforms of nomenclature were personally critical and linguistically violent . Kolbe died of a heart attack in Leipzig at age 68 , six years after the death of his wife , Charlotte . He was survived by four children . - The Parthe is a river in Saxony, Germany, right tributary of the White Elster. Its total length is 60 km. The Parthe originates in northern Saxony, between Colditz and Bad Lausick. It flows northwest through Parthenstein, Naunhof, Borsdorf and Taucha before entering the city of Leipzig. The Parthe joins the White Elster in northwestern Leipzig. - Carbon (from \\"coal\\") is a chemical element with symbol C and atomic number 6. It is nonmetallic and tetravalentmaking four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds. Three isotopes occur naturally, C and C being stable, while C is a radioactive isotope, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity. - Élan vital is a term coined by French philosopher Henri Bergson in his 1907 book \\"Creative Evolution\\", in which he addresses the question of self-organisation and spontaneous morphogenesis of things in an increasingly complex manner. \\"Elan vital\\" was translated in the English edition as \\"vital impetus\\", but is usually translated by his detractors as \\"vital force\\". It is a hypothetical explanation for evolution and development of organisms, which Bergson linked closely with consciousness - with the intuitive perception of experience and the flow of inner time. - Hermann Kolbe (\\"Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe\\", 27 September 1818 25 November 1884), was a seminal contributor in the birth of modern organic chemistry. He was a Professor at Marburg and Leipzig. Kolbe coined the term synthesis and contributed to the philosophical demise of vitalism through synthesis of the organic substance acetic acid from carbon disulfide, and also contributed to the development of structural theory. This was done via modifications to the idea of \\"radicals\\" and accurate prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary alcohols, and to the emerging array of organic reactions through his Kolbe electrolysis of carboxylate salts, the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction in the preparation of aspirin and the Kolbe nitrile synthesis. After studies with Wöhler and Bunsen, Kolbe was involved with the early internationalization of chemistry through overseas work in London (with Frankland), and rose through the ranks of his field to edit the . As such, he was elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences won the Royal Society of London's Davy Medal in the year of his death.

With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - The Kolbe electrolysis or Kolbe reaction is an organic reaction named after Hermann Kolbe. The Kolbe reaction is formally a decarboxylative dimerisation of two carboxylic acids (or carboxylate ions) The overall general reaction is: - Organic chemistry is a chemistry subdiscipline involving the scientific study of the structure, properties, and reactions of organic compounds and organic materials, i.e., matter in its various forms that contain carbon atoms. Study of structure includes many physical and chemical methods to determine the chemical composition and the chemical constitution of organic compounds and materials. Study of properties includes both physical properties and chemical properties, and uses similar methods as well as methods to evaluate chemical reactivity, with the aim to understand the behavior of the organic matter in its pure form (when possible), but also in solutions, mixtures, and fabricated forms. The study of organic reactions includes probing their scope through use in preparation of target compounds (e.g., natural products, drugs, polymers, etc.) by chemical synthesis, as well as the focused study of the reactivities of individual organic molecules, both in the laboratory and via theoretical (in silico) study. - Cellulose acetate is the acetate ester of cellulose. It was first prepared in 1865. Cellulose acetate is used as a film base in photography, as a component in some coatings, and as a frame material for eyeglasses; it is also used as a synthetic fiber in the manufacture of cigarette filters and playing cards. In photographic film, cellulose acetate replaced nitrate film in the 1950s, being far less flammable and cheaper to produce. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - In silico (literally Latin for \\"in silicon\\", alluding to the mass use of silicon for semiconductor computer chips) is an expression used to mean \\"performed on computer or via computer simulation.\\" The phrase was coined in 1989 as an allusion to the Latin phrases \\"in vivo\\", \\"in vitro\\", and \\"in situ\\", which are commonly used in biology (see also systems biology) and refer to experiments done in living organisms, outside of living organisms, and where they are found in nature, respectively. - Vinegar is a liquid consisting of about 520% acetic acid (CHCOOH), water, and other trace chemicals, which may include flavorings. The acetic acid is produced by the fermentation of ethanol by acetic acid bacteria. Vinegar is now mainly used as a cooking ingredient, or in pickling. As the most easily manufactured mild acid, it has historically had a great variety of industrial, medical, and domestic uses, some of which (such as its use as a general household cleaner) are still commonly practiced today. - The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences or \\"Kungliga Vetenskapsakademien\\" is one of the Royal Academies of Sweden. It is an independent, non-governmental scientific organisation which takes special responsibility for the natural sciences and mathematics, but endeavours to promote the exchange of ideas between various disciplines. - Vitalism is a discredited scientific hypothesis that \\"living organisms are fundamentally different from non-living entities because they contain some non-physical element or are governed by different principles than are inanimate things\\". Where vitalism explicitly invokes a vital principle, that element is often referred to as the \\"vital spark\\", \\"energy\\" or \\"élan vital\\", which some equate with the soul. - The electron is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with a negative elementary electric charge. Electrons belong to the first generation of the lepton particle family, and are generally thought to be elementary particles because they have no known components or substructure. The electron has a mass that is approximately 1/1836 that of the proton. Quantum mechanical properties of the electron include an intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of a half-integer value, expressed in units of the reduced Planck constant, \\"\\". As it is a fermion, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state, in accordance with the Pauli exclusion principle. Like all matter, electrons have properties of both particles and waves: they can collide with other particles and can be diffracted like light. The wave properties of electrons are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like neutrons and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a larger De Broglie wavelength for a given energy. - An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are very small; typical sizes are around 100 picometers (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale). - Leipzig is the largest city in the federal state of Saxony, Germany. With a population of 570,087 inhabitants (1,001,220 residents in the larger urban zone) it is Germany's tenth most populous city. Leipzig is located about southwest of Berlin at the confluence of the White Elster, Pleisse and Parthe rivers at the southern end of the North German Plain.

A woman who stole her severely disabled brother's £62,000 inheritance to fund lavish spending sprees has been jailed for three years. Jane Martin, 51, plundered the bank account of her vulnerable brother Vaughan Martin after their elderly mother died and left him the five figure sum. She moved her brother out of a care home to live with her and her partner Steven Collins so the couple could easily access his money. The pair spent the money on a new BMW Mini Cooper car along with several high performance motorbikes over the course of 15 months. Jailed: Jane Martin, 51, pictured left, and her partner Steve Collins, pictured right, plundered the bank account of her vulnerable brother Vaughan Martin after their elderly mother died and left him more than £60,000. Their theft was discovered after they. placed Vaughan into respite care so they could go away on holiday and. staff noticed bruises on the 53-year-old’s body. Police were called and an investigation revealed that Collins, also 53, had physically abused Vaughan. The probe also uncovered the theft of his inheritance from his late mother Violet and that Martin had stolen £14,000 from her bank account before she died. Martin, from Blandford, Dorset, was jailed for three years for theft while Collins was sentenced to four years in prison. Judge Peter Johnson said: 'This was a despicable loss of control. You were living well beyond your means. 'You systematically plundered Vaughan’s bank account to the sum of £62,000 over approximately 15 months. 'Some of it was used to buy expensive motorbikes, and also a Mini Cooper.' Lavish spending: A court heard how the couple used the stolen money to fund extravagant spending sprees - purchasing a Mini Cooper and high performance motorbikes (stock image) Bournemouth Crown Court heard that the thefts started when Violet Martin was admitted to hospital after a fall in November 2011. The couple seized the opportunity to steal £14,000 from her bank account and disguised it as a loan. After she died and the inheritance had gone through, Martin and Collins removed Vaughan Martin from a care home to live in their house.

Write an article that answers the following question: In which quarter was the first field goal kicked?","completion":"Title: A Glimpse into Football History: When Was the First Field Goal Kicked? Hello, little friends! Today, we are going to talk about football - not the one with a round ball that you kick with your feet, but the one where players throw an oval-shaped ball and score points through touchdowns and field goals. We'll be looking at when the first field goal was kicked. First, let's understand what a field goal is. In football, a field goal is a way of scoring points. A team's kicker tries to kick the ball through a big Y-shaped post called 'goalposts' at the end of the field. If the ball goes between the two tall posts and above the shorter, crossbar, the team gets 3 points. Hooray! Now, gather around, little friends, for a story about when the first-ever field goal was kicked. This special moment took place many years ago, in 1883. That's more than 100 years before you were even born! There was a game between the two college football teams, Yale and Princeton. These teams played against each other, trying to score points and win the game. In this game, a brilliant moment happened in the second quarter. A quarter is a part of the game. Football is divided into 4 parts, so each quarter is like a different piece of cake at a birthday party. During the second quarter of the game, a young football player named Thomas \\"Tuts\\" Trenchard made history. He was a player for Princeton, and he kicked the ball high up into the air and through the goalposts. His teammates and the people watching the game cheered! By doing this, Thomas scored the first-ever field goal, and it happened in the second quarter. Since then, field goals have become an important part of football. Teams work hard to score touchdowns, but sometimes, they rely on this 3-point play to win games. And it all started with that one kick from Thomas \\"Tuts\\" Trenchard, which happened in the second quarter, back in 1883. So, my little friends, whenever you watch a football game and see someone kicking a field goal, remember the story of Thomas \\"Tuts\\" Trenchard and the very first field goal ever kicked in the second quarter of a game between Yale and Princeton. Happy watching, and who knows, maybe one day you'll be telling this story to your own little friends!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

On September 19, having buried their non-essential possessions in a mound marked by a tent pole, they set out in search of settlements. Progress was hampered by the poor physical condition of the men, in particular Eriksen, who was badly affected by frostbite. On September 21 they halted at two empty huts, probably part of a hunting camp, where Alexey raised spirits by shooting a deer to replenish their dwindling food stocks. De Long allowed his exhausted party several days' rest before resuming the march.On September 28 the party found a large hut, with signs of recent occupation–edible food in the store, and moccasin tracks in the snow. When searches in the locality brought no sign of people, De Long decided to move on. By October 4, Eriksen could not continue; the party halted at another abandoned hut where, on October 6, Eriksen died. On October 9, with the condition of several men worsening, De Long decided to send two of the fittest in the group, Nindemann and Noros, to seek help. Ambler was offered the opportunity to go with them, but felt that his duty as a doctor required him to stay with the main body.For the next week De Long's party struggled on, sometimes making barely a mile a day.

This time he attacked his mother and sister and two police officers. He's now been jailed for two years after admitting catelogue of offences. Victims of first attack say he should never have walked free from court. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Joshua Bryant Jailed for Two Years After Second Rampage Following Suspended Sentence Subtitle: Victims of the first attack question whether Bryant should have been released in the first place, as he unleashed another violent rampage only a month later Joshua Bryant, who previously received a suspended sentence for attacking an elderly couple in their 60s, has been jailed for two years after a second, more vicious rampage. Just one month after his first release, Bryant assaulted his mother and sister, as well as two police officers who arrived on the scene to intervene. This reoffending spree evokes the question of whether the court should have granted him the initial suspended sentence and released him back into the community in the first place. In the first incident, sources report that Bryant violently attacked an elderly, unsuspecting couple, causing both physical and emotional harm. After being arrested and subsequently charged, Bryant was given a suspended sentence by the court on the grounds that he showed remorse for his actions and was unlikely to reoffend. However, just a month after his release, the convicted felon proved this assumption to be gravely incorrect. During the second rampage, Bryant's aggression escalated as he targeted his own family members, particularly his mother and sister. Upon receiving a distress call, two police officers attended the scene, only to be brutally attacked by Bryant as well. It became apparent that the assailant had little to no control over his violent outbursts, which prompted deeper concern for the safety and well-being of those living in the community. Following the second barrage of offenses, Bryant was arrested and charged once again. This time, the court recognized the seriousness of the situation, ruling that Bryant be immediately jailed for a total of two years after admitting to the comprehensive catalog of offenses. Due to the gravity of his crimes and the danger he posed to society, the court deemed it necessary to remove him from the public and allow further rehabilitation behind bars. The victims of the first attack, however, feel a sense of injustice and have expressed their concern as to why Bryant was allowed to walk free after the initial assault. The couple stated that if the court had taken a firmer stance on his sentencing and recognized his potential to reoffend, tragedy could have been averted, and Bryant's family members and the two police officers would not have had to endure his violent spree. This case highlights the responsibility that the criminal justice system bears for accurately evaluating the risk that a convicted individual poses to the public. While granting suspended sentences can offer an opportunity for rehabilitation and support, they can also result in the reoffending of dangerous criminals and further victimization. It is crucial that thorough assessments and evaluations are conducted on a case-by-case basis to help protect the community and provide support to offenders, in particular those showing a propensity for violence and reoffending."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's analyze both sentences separately to understand the differences: 1. \\"Terry was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and died in Fairfax, Iowa.\\" In this sentence, Terry's birth took place in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, while Terry's death occurred in Fairfax, Iowa. The sentence clearly states the progression of events, from birth to death, with specific locations for each event. 2. \\"Was born Terry in Fairfax, Iowa, and died in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.\\" In this sentence, the syntax and word placement are somewhat unusual, but it still conveys the intended message. Terry's birth took place in Fairfax, Iowa, while Terry's death occurred in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Similar to the first sentence, the events are described in a sequence from birth to death, but the locations of each event are reversed. In summary, while the sentence structure and word order of the second sentence are unconventional, both sentences effectively communicate information about Terry's birth and death. However, they do not mean the same thing since the birth and death locations are different in each sentence. The first sentence describes a birth in Cedar Rapids and a death in Fairfax, while the second sentence describes a birth in Fairfax and a death in Cedar Rapids."},{"prompt":"What is the first name of the person who also studied violin and piano? Answer the above question based on the context below: Bedřich Smetana, first named Friedrich Smetana, was born on 2 March 1824, in Litomyšl (German: Leitomischl), east of Prague near the traditional border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia. There being no suitable local school, Smetana was sent to...","completion":"Bedřich"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

She has made sure that the pattern aligns properly with the adjacent sheets and has smoothed out any wrinkles or bubbles as she goes along. The most logical next event after this would be for the woman to complete hanging the wallpaper on the entire wall, ensuring that each sheet is aligned and adhered appropriately. This process would involve the following steps: 1. Continue applying adhesive: The woman would ensure that enough adhesive is applied to the back of each sheet of wallpaper, carefully and consistently spreading it over the surface. This is important in order to achieve a secure and long-lasting bond with the wall. 2. Adjusting and aligning: As the woman hangs each sheet, she would adjust the wallpaper to align the pattern correctly with adjacent sheets. This process is crucial for a professional finish and a seamless appearance, especially if the wallpaper has a repeat pattern or intricate design. 3. Smoothing the sheets: Once each sheet is properly aligned, the woman would smooth the wallpaper using a specialized tool or a soft, dry cloth. This step helps eliminate any air bubbles or wrinkles, ensuring a smooth and even appearance. 4. Trimming excess wallpaper: The woman would use a utility knife or wallpaper trimmer to carefully trim the excess wallpaper at the edges, corners, and around any fixtures, such as electrical outlets or light switches. It's important to trim the excess carefully and accurately to achieve clean and sharp edges. 5. Cleaning up adhesive residue: As she works, the woman might need to clean up any excess adhesive that seeps out from behind the wallpaper. A damp sponge or cloth can be used to remove adhesive residue without damaging the wallpaper. 6. Inspecting the work: Upon completing the wallpaper installation, the woman would take a step back and inspect her work to ensure that the pattern is evenly spaced, and the seams are discreet. If necessary, she may make minor adjustments at this stage to perfect the overall appearance. 7. Drying and setting: Once satisfied with her work, the woman would allow the wallpaper to dry and set, typically for at least 12 to 24 hours depending on the manufacturer's instructions and the environmental conditions in the room. 8. Reattaching fixtures and furniture: After the wallpaper has set and dried completely, the woman can safely reattach any fixtures such as electrical outlets, light switches, or wall decorations that she removed earlier. Additionally, she can rearrange any furniture that was moved during the wallpapering process. The most logical next event, overall, is to finish hanging the wallpaper and complete these subsequent steps, resulting in a beautifully papered wall that enhances the aesthetics of the room and reflects the woman's personal taste and style."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Barely a generation ago, Ireland listed homosexual acts as a crime and made gays... (Associated Press) The campaign ahead of Friday's constitutional referendum has featured searing testimonies designed to make the voters of this predominantly Roman Catholic nation look in the mirror. Members of many of Ireland's most prominent families have come out of the closet in hopes of challenging their neighbors' attitudes to homosexuality. The contest has pit the waning power of the Catholic Church against the secular-minded government of Prime Minister Enda Kenny. \\"A yes vote costs the rest of us nothing. A no vote costs our gay children everything,\\" former President Mary McAleese said at a gay rights event in Dublin this week after her only son, a 30-year-old airline executive, revealed he is gay. McAleese, a canon law scholar and former legal adviser to the church, spoke of her son's experience of bullying and isolation as a teenager, and of friends who learned that their own sons were gay only when they tried to kill themselves. The government's campaign effectively began in January with a 36-year-old Cabinet minister, Leo Varadkar, declaring his homosexuality so that he could campaign for a \\"yes\\" vote from a position of honesty. The public confessional has been busy ever since. A steady stream of entertainers, sports stars and political and business leaders have told their stories of coming out to parents and siblings, or of learning that a close friend or relative was gay. Most say they kept their true sexual identity secret to avoid ostracism, intimidation or even criminal sanction in a country that, until 1993, outlawed homosexual acts. \\"For too long now, people haven't been able to be true to themselves,\\" said Conor Cusack, who is one of the few openly gay athletes in Ireland's native Gaelic sports scene. In media debates, Cusack has challenged the views of other well-known sportsmen who say they'll vote no. \\"Emotionally, I have been in a prison since the age of 17; a prison where I lived a half-life, repressing an essential part of my humanity, the expression of my deepest self; my instinct to love,\\" wrote Ursula Halligan, one of Ireland's best known political correspondents. She came out as a lesbian this month at age 54. \\"At every turn society assumes and confirms heterosexuality as the norm. This culminates in marriage when the happy couple is showered with an outpouring of overwhelming social approval. For me, there was no first kiss; no engagement party; no wedding,\\" she wrote. \\"And up until a short time ago, no hope of any of these things.\\" Gay marriage is legal in 19 countries, including Britain and most of the United States. Three U.S. states used referendums to help enact their laws, but Ireland is the first to hold a nationwide popular vote. Ireland legally must do this because of its conservative 1937 constitution written by then-Prime Minister Eamon de Valera in collaboration with Catholic church leaders. Its family section proclaims inalienable rights for married couples, but doesn't specify that a marriage must be between a man and a woman — an omission that reflects the age's social assumptions and invisibility of gays in public life. While some politicians called for the government to legislate directly for gay marriage, Kenny's attorney general advised that any changes in marriage law would have to be approved by referendum and formally added to the constitution, lest it be challenged as unconstitutional. Ireland's previous government in 2010 did legalize civil partnerships for gay couples, resolving problems involving property ownership, pensions, tax benefits and other financial matters. But a constitutional reform commission in 2013 recommended legalization of full-fledged marriage for gays, citing more than 150 shortcomings with civil partnerships, and Kenny backed the recommendation. His government's proposed amendment to permit marriages of \\"two persons without distinction as to their sex\\" requires a simple majority of referendum votes to become law. While opinion polls have consistently shown that most voters support the change, the \\"yes\\" side's lead has narrowed this month as religiously conservative campaigners raise fears that gay marriage could endanger children. \\"No\\" campaigners have plastered lamp posts with posters arguing that civil partnerships should be good enough for gays. Other ads warn that unregulated surrogate pregnancies would flourish in a more gay-friendly Ireland, and judges could order children to be seized from single mothers and handed over to adoptive gay couples. \\"A mother's love is irreplaceable, vote NO,\\" advises one placard depicting a red-haired boy hugging his mom. \\"Two men can't replace a mother's love,\\" advises another poster produced, with a tinge of irony, by a pressure group called Mothers and Fathers Matter. Ireland's independent Referendum Commission, tasked with providing objective information for both sides of every referendum question, has rejected the \\"no\\" camp's claims on child endangerment issues as nonsense. It notes that under existing law, gay couples already have the ability to adopt and have children through in-vitro fertilization or surrogacy arrangements. Another ubiquitous \\"no\\" campaign poster, portraying a heterosexual couple kissing a baby on each cheek under the message \\"Children Deserve a Mother and a Father, Vote No,\\" caused some embarrassment to Mothers and Fathers Matter when it was revealed that the baby-kissing picture came from a stock photo agency — and the real-life British couple protested that their family portrait shouldn't be used to promote anti-gay bigotry. \\"This family believes that everyone has a right to marry the person they love regardless of their gender ... and this family would vote 'yes',\\" the couple said in a statement distributed by Amnesty International, which is campaigning for gay marriage. The Catholic Church, its authority weakened by declining Mass attendance and two decades of child abuse cover-up scandals, still wields influence in Ireland, particularly in schools and in the rural west of Ireland, where polls indicate anti-gay marriage sentiment runs highest. Priests at weekend Masses read out bishops' pastoral letters from the pulpit asking worshippers to reject the proposed amendment. In a joint statement, Ireland's bishops said gay marriage would place \\"the union of two men, or two women, on a par with the marriage relationship between a husband and wife which is open to the procreation of children.\\" Failure to stop this, the bishops forecast, would mean it becomes \\"increasingly difficult to speak any longer in public about marriage as being between a man and a woman. What will we be expected to teach children in school about marriage? Will those who sincerely continue to believe that marriage is between a man and a woman be forced to act against their conscience?\\" But even within the church, some priests and nuns have said their leaders are wrong, and they'll vote yes. Dublin's politically savvy archbishop, Diarmuid Martin, has offered a more nuanced defense of traditional marriage. He says the faithful should examine their own consciences when casting their ballots Friday. \\"I know that the severity with which the Irish church treated gay and lesbian people in the past, and in some cases still today, makes it difficult for some to understand the church's position,\\" Martin said. ___ Online: Catholic Church letter on referendum, http://bit.ly/1PVhlRW YesEquality campaign, https://www.yesequality.ie/ Mothers and Fathers Matter, http://mothersandfathersmatter.org/ Ireland's Referendum Commission, http://refcom2015.ie/ ||||| DUBLIN (AP) — Prime Minister Enda Kenny has appealed to Ireland's voters to support the legalization of gay marriage in a referendum that pits the power of the Catholic Church against his secular-minded government.

Many high profile individuals publicly came out as gay for the first time to encourage a 'yes' vote. The \\"yes\\" vote would legalize gay marriage in Ireland, in stark contrast to the country's past where homosexuality was criminalized until 1993. The government and former officials have expressed support for the legislation, while the Catholic Church and other conservative bodies have opposed it. Ireland was the first country to hold a nationwide popular vote on the issue. This vote occurred due to the country's conservative 1937 constitution, which already acknowledged rights for married couples but did not specify that marriage must be between a man and a woman. Amendments to the marriage law must be approved by referendum and added to the constitution to avoid being deemed unconstitutional. The referendum's result was unknown at the time of writing this article."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

A:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the passage - The passage states that less photosynthesis leads to less food production by plants and phytoplankton. Step 2: Identify the scenario - Mona owns a greenhouse and decides to cover the top to restrict sunlight. Step 3: Analyze the situation - By covering the top of the greenhouse, Mona is reducing the amount of sunlight that enters the greenhouse, which means less sunlight will be available for photosynthesis. Step 4: Connect the situation to the passage - Since the passage mentions that less photosynthesis results in less food production, we can deduce that Mona's action of covering the top of the greenhouse and restricting sunlight will affect the photosynthesis process in the plants. Step 5: Answer the question - Since less photosynthesis correlates with less food production, we can conclude that Mona's plants' ability to make food will decrease.

Q:Process: - Suns heat enters atmosphere - Green house gases enter from the earth - Heat is trapped in atmosphere - Different things on earth are hotter - The overall planet is hotter. suppose Making meat illegal happens, how will it affect LESS global warming. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"Making meat illegal would directly and indirectly impact the steps of the global warming process due to the role of the meat industry in producing significant amounts of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and its contribution to deforestation for livestock rearing which further exacerbates climate change. First, let us look at how it directly impacts the global warming process. Typically, livestock farming entails serious non-carbon dioxide (CO2) GHG emissions - such as methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Methane, primarily from enteric fermentation in ruminant livestock, is an especially potent GHG, with a heat-trapping power many times that of CO2. N2O, largely emitted from manure and synthetic fertilizer (used predominantly in feed crop cultivation), also significantly multiplies the potential for global warming. Hence, making meat illegal reduces these emissions directly affecting step two (\\"Greenhouse gases enter from the Earth\\") and step three (\\"Heat is trapped in the atmosphere\\") of the global warming process. Now we move on to how making meat illegal could indirectly influence the process of global warming. Typically, the meat industry contributes to deforestation, especially in the Amazon, where forests are often cleared for cattle grazing or to grow livestock feed. Trees naturally store carbon and their removal exacerbates the amount of free CO2 in the atmosphere. Thus, with meat becoming illegal and the demand for meat decreasing, it would indirectly reduce the need for deforestation for livestock farming. This decreases the amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere, indirectly affecting step two (\\"Greenhouse gases enter from the Earth\\") and thus steps three (\\"Heat is trapped in the atmosphere\\") and five (\\"The overall planet is hotter\\") because there would be less CO2 to trap heat. Furthermore, rewilding the land previously used for livestock grazing and meat production can help restore ecosystems and improve carbon storage, indirectly further reducing the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere and thus also indirectly impacting the process. By impacting the emission levels of GHGs, making meat illegal affects the global heat retention ability of the atmosphere, ultimately influencing the overall temperature of the planet. Hence, the supposed perturbation brought about by making meat illegal can be seen to be both directly and indirectly impacting the steps of the global warming process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: Last January, British GQ caused some mild commotion by anointing a one-year-old (Prince George) as the 49th best-dressed male in the U.K., and the publication—which has just now unveiled its top 50 best-dressed men in the U.K. for 2016—has again caused something of a stir in the British press (we like to think Kate woke up this morning and texted Pippa, “lol did u see the british gq list ?? dinner’s gonna be fun tonight”). This year, the magazine has deemed not Harry, not William, not Charles, not George—but 94-year-old Prince Philip as the best-dressed royal male in the country. Philip earned the No. 12 spot on the list, placing him between 26-year-old actor Taron Egerton and 25-year-old singer James Bay (actor Eddie Redmayne tops the list, for the second straight year). As rationale for their choice, Dunhill creative director John Ray explains, “The Duke of Edinburgh embodies duty and decorum and comes across effortlessly in the way he dresses. He is always British, masculine and appropriate for his role.” (GQ adds, “If we look as good as the Queen’s consort does when we reach our tenth decade we will be very happy.”) Meanwhile, Charles (who was placed seventh on the list last year) did not make the top 50 this year at all (“Camilla, is it the pocket squares?!? I told you my pocket squares are starting to feel a few seasons behind”), and William was left off, as well. Harry nabbed the No. 38 spot, cited for his “unique style and energy” and “zest for life” (“His family may do elegant but Prince Harry is the one royal who can do cool, too,” GQ notes). We imagine Harry punching William in the shoulder—“Hey, bro, you hear that? I’m the cool one, now it’s official”—before flitting off behind the couch on a hoverboard as he bites off a piece of beef jerky. ||||| Welcome to GQ's 2016 Best-Dressed List in association with Mercedes-Benz which is published in full with our February issue, available on newsstands and as a digital edition from Thursday 7 January. In our opinion, it is definitely one of the best-of-British ways to welcome in the New Year. Our judges have compiled an eclectic list that ranges from trendsetting teenagers to grand old men and everything in between. This is because being well-dressed is nothing to do with age or fashion. As Keith Richards says, you don't find a style, a style finds you. That's not to say that trends aren't interesting. In recent years, for example, we have seen the rise and fall of the Pitti peacocks - the self-conscious dandies that lurk around Florence during that city's biannual menswear fair, who have been replaced with a more relaxed take on sports luxe. And trend-wise right now it seems that we are witnessing the demise of the sock, as ankles remain bare even when the mercury falls. And remember, even the most polished man won't get it right every time. Patrick Grant - No5 in our list - was named by the Mail Online as one of the worst-dressed attendees of the British Fashion Awards in November. I felt at the time that his high-waisted dress trousers were too Alfred Hitchcock, but without the guts to experiment, how can we hope to get things right?

To do that, we'll add 72 to both sides of the equation. 0 + 72 = -24*m - 72 + 72 Which simplifies to: 72 = -24*m Step 3: Solve for m Now, to solve for m, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -24. 72 / (-24) = -24*m / (-24) Which simplifies to: -3 = m So, the solution to the equation 0 = 9*m - 33*m - 72 is m = -3."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
