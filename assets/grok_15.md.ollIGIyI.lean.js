Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Carbohydrate Digestion The average American diet is about 50 percent carbohydrates, which may be classified according to the number of monomers they contain of simple sugars (monosaccharides and disaccharides) and/or complex sugars (polysaccharides). Glucose, galactose, and fructose are the three monosaccharides that are commonly consumed and are readily absorbed. Your digestive system is also able to break down the disaccharide sucrose (regular table sugar: glucose + fructose), lactose (milk sugar: glucose + galactose), and maltose (grain sugar: glucose + glucose), and the polysaccharides glycogen and starch (chains of monosaccharides). Your bodies do not produce enzymes that can break down most fibrous polysaccharides, such as cellulose. While indigestible polysaccharides do not provide any nutritional value, they do provide dietary fiber, which helps propel food through the alimentary canal. The chemical digestion of starches begins in the mouth and has been reviewed above. In the small intestine, pancreatic amylase does the ‘heavy lifting’ for starch and carbohydrate digestion (Figure 23.29). After amylases break down starch into smaller fragments, the brush border enzyme α-dextrinase starts working on αdextrin, breaking off one glucose unit at a time. Three brush border enzymes hydrolyze sucrose, lactose, and maltose into monosaccharides. Sucrase splits sucrose into one molecule of fructose and one molecule of glucose; maltase breaks down maltose and maltotriose into two and three glucose molecules, respectively; and lactase breaks down lactose into one molecule of glucose and one molecule of galactose. Insufficient lactase can lead to lactose intolerance.

And it's not because since her days on \\"Clarissa Explains It All\\" that I've had a bit of a crush on Melissa Joan Hart, who at the time this show was popular was already well into her 20s, but was still able to get teenage roles. \\"Sabrina, the Teenage Witch\\" was Hart's next big leap after her \\"Clarissa\\" days. Based on the comic strip, Sabrina Spellman is - you guessed it! - a teenage witch who attempts to balance her witchcraft antics with the demands of everyday teenage life.

A spork I'd seen before, but the addition of a simple serration on the side of the fork end makes this a genuine \\"three-in-one\\" implement for eating one's full three-course takeaway meal on the plane. The sporf is no innovation; back in 1940 the \\"sporf\\" was born. It took me until 2015 to notice this one thanks to its rather pleasant design. The sporf is a little like most strategy documents that I come across. It is one implement designed to serve a multitude of goals, but with one fatal flaw: you can only ever use one part of the sporf / strategy at any one time. With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork. In strategy formation, we can develop a multitude of potential purposes within one document, killer vision statement or mission. But it's important to recognise that the teams around us will only ever be able to do one thing really well at any one time. This is a lesson oft ignored by schools, in particular, as they attempt to ask educators to create an ever-more creative curriculum without having first tackled attitudes towards summative assessments throughout the year. It is also a challenge in some of the world's most successful, but now stagnating, big businesses: they've spent decades or centuries building a reputation across a large array of devices, technologies, components or clothing, but the real strategy is working out which of the current array needs killed off to enable teams in their quest to develop something totally new, properly innovative.

He discovers that his wife Ellen (Susan Clark) is having an affair with a man named Marty Heller (Harris Yulin). Aging actress Arlene Iverson (Janet Ward) hires Harry to find her 16-year-old daughter Delly Grastner (Melanie Griffith). Arlene's only source of income is her daughter's trust-fund, but it requires Delly to be living with her. Arlene gives Harry the name of one of Delly's friends in L.A., a mechanic called Quentin (James Woods). Quentin tells Harry that he last saw Delly at a New Mexico film location, where she started flirting with one of Arlene's old flames, stuntman Marv Ellman (Anthony Costello). Harry realises that the injuries to Quentin's face are from fighting the stuntman and sympathises with his bitterness towards Delly. He travels to the film location and talks to Marv and stunt coordinator, Joey Ziegler (Edward Binns). Before returning to L.A., Harry is surprised to see Quentin working on Marv's stunt plane. Harry suspects that Delly may be trying to seduce her mother's ex-lovers and travels to the Florida Keys, where her stepfather Tom Iverson (John Crawford) lives. In Florida, Harry finds Delly staying with Tom and a woman named Paula (Jennifer Warren). Harry, Paula and Delly take a boat trip to go swimming, but Delly becomes distraught when she finds the submerged wreckage of a small plane with the decomposing body of the pilot inside.

Identify the target area: Determine the area of the body where you want to apply the Vicks Vaporub. Common areas include the chest, throat, and back for cold and cough relief, as well as sore muscles and joints for pain relief. 2. Apply the Vicks Vaporub: Gently massage the Vicks Vaporub onto the designated area using circular motions and gentle pressure. Ensure that you cover the entire area with a thin, even layer, avoiding the face and sensitive regions like the nostrils, eyes, and lips. Vicks Vaporub should not be applied to broken or irritated skin. 3. Massage the area: Continue massaging the area for a few minutes to help the skin absorb the Vicks Vaporub. The act of massaging not only promotes absorption but may also help to provide additional relief by stimulating blood flow to the area, and further relaxing tight muscles. 4. Apply more Vaporub if needed: If you feel that the initial layer was not enough to cover the entire target area, scoop a little more Vaporub onto your hands and repeat the rubbing and massaging process. Remember, it is important not to overuse or excessively apply the product. 5. Wash your hands: Once you have finished applying and massaging the Vicks Vaporub, ensure that you clean your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water. This will help to avoid any accidental contact with your eyes or other sensitive areas. 6. Dress appropriately: To allow the Vicks Vaporub to work effectively, it is essential to wear loose and comfortable clothes that let your skin breathe. If you applied the Vaporub to your chest or throat, wearing a breathable, low-cut t-shirt may be ideal. For application to your back, consider wearing a light, loose-fitting shirt. 7. Wait and relax: Give the Vicks Vaporub time to work as its active ingredients – menthol, camphor, and eucalyptus oil – help to alleviate your symptoms. The menthol and camphor provide a cooling sensation, which can help soothe aches, pains, and congestion, while the eucalyptus oil may aid in reducing cough frequency. 8. Reapply as needed: Depending on the severity of your symptoms, you may need to reapply the Vicks Vaporub every few hours or as instructed on the product label. Be sure to read and follow the directions for proper usage, and do not exceed the recommended application frequency. Remember, Vicks Vaporub is only intended for external use and should not be ingested or applied inside the nostrils. Keep the product away from children to avoid accidental ingestion or incorrect application. If your symptoms persist or worsen, consult your healthcare provider for further guidance and treatment options."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the following context: Ride the Lightning is the second studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released on July 27, 1984, by the independent record label Megaforce Records. The album was recorded in three weeks with producer Flemming Rasmussen at the Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The artwork, based on a concept by the band, depicts an electric chair being struck by lightning flowing from the band logo. The title was taken from a passage in Stephen King's novel The Stand. Although rooted in the thrash metal genre, the album showcased the band's musical growth and lyrical sophistication. This was partly because bassist Cliff Burton introduced the basics of music theory to the rest of the band and had more input in the songwriting. Instead of relying strictly on fast tempos as on its debut Kill 'Em All, Metallica broadened its approach by employing acoustic guitars, extended instrumentals, and more complex harmonies. The overall recording costs were paid by Metallica's European label Music for Nations because Megaforce was unable to cover it. It was the last album to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, and the first to feature contributions from his replacement, Kirk Hammett. Ride the Lightning received positive response from music critics, who saw it as a more ambitious effort than its predecessor. Metallica promoted the album on the Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang European tour in late 1984, and on its North American leg in the first half of 1985. The band performed at major music festivals such as Monsters of Rock and Day on the Green later that year. Two months after its release, Elektra Records signed Metallica to a multi-year deal and reissued the album. Ride the Lightning peaked at number 100 on the Billboard 200 with no radio exposure. Although 75,000 copies were initially pressed for the American market, the album sold half a million by November 1987. It was certified 6× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2012 for shipping... answer the following question: What album title was taken from a passage in a Stephen King novel?

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What group did the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts contribute to their album? ? After the October Tour, U2 decamped to a rented cottage in Howth, where they lived, wrote new songs, and rehearsed for their third album, War. Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December. War's lead single, \\"New Year's Day\\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. Nonetheless, it was the band's first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. War's sincerity and \\"rugged\\" guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time. A record on which the band \\"turned pacifism itself into a crusade\\", War was lyrically more political than their first two records, focusing on the physical and emotional effects of warfare. The album included the protest song \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", in which Bono lyrically tried to contrast the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting with Easter Sunday.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: The hartebeest (; Alcelaphus buselaphus), also known as kongoni, is an African antelope. Eight subspecies have been described, including two sometimes considered to be independent species. A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over 1 m (3.3 ft) at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of 200 to 250 cm (79 to 98 in). The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb). It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne's hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of 45–70 cm (18–28 in). Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. Gregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years. answer the following question: What is the scientific name of the animal that forms herds of 20 to 300 individuals?

Choose from: * yes * no","completion":"No, the answer provided does not correctly identify the medical scientist who first proposed the clonal selection theory of immunology. The statement you provided explains a modification made to the theory in response to new discoveries. The correct answer to your question is Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet. Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet, an Australian immunologist and virologist, first proposed the Clonal Selection Theory of Immunology in the 1950s. This theory has become a central concept in our understanding of how the immune system functions. It provides an explanation for how the immune system is capable of generating a vast range of different antibody specificities in response to foreign antigens. According to the Clonal Selection Theory, the body produces a diverse pool of lymphocytes, each with a unique antigen receptor (either a B cell receptor or a T cell receptor). When a lymphocyte encounters its specific antigen, it binds to it, which results in the activation, proliferation, and differentiation of the lymphocyte, ultimately leading to an immune response tailored to that specific antigen. Over the years, the Clonal Selection Theory has been refined and adapted to accommodate new discoveries in immunology, such as the understanding of histocompatibility and the \\"two-signal\\" activation of T cells. Histocompatibility refers to how compatible the immune cells of different individuals are, which is influenced by molecules called Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) that are present on the surface of cells. The \\"two-signal\\" model of T cell activation involves the interaction of the T cell receptor with an antigen presented by MHC molecules and the simultaneous interaction with costimulatory molecules on antigen-presenting cells. This model explains how T cells are activated in a specific and tightly regulated way. In conclusion, the medical scientist responsible for proposing the Clonal Selection Theory of Immunology is Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet. Although the theory has seen modifications and enhancement due to new discoveries over time, it remains an essential framework for understanding the immune system."},{"prompt":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: Mrs Laura Henderson (Judi Dench) has just become a widow.

Short movie review: far too sentimental Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"Based on the given short movie review, it is clear that the critic is thinking negatively about the movie. The phrase \\"far too sentimental\\" indicates that the critic found the film's emotional aspects to be excessive and overly sappy, which detracts from the overall quality of the movie. This suggests that the critic did not appreciate the movie's attempt to evoke intense emotions in the viewers, as it might have come across as forced or contrived. The use of the word \\"far\\" emphasizes the severity of the sentimentality in the movie, further reinforcing the negative viewpoint. By saying \\"far too sentimental,\\" it is implied that the movie went beyond what the critic would consider an acceptable level of emotive storytelling. This could mean that the movie heavily relied on cheap tear-jerker scenes or clichéd emotional elements to attempt to create a deep connection with the audience. However, in the eyes of the critic, these attempts failed and only contributed negatively to the overall viewing experience. The negative sentiment in the review could also be perceived as a disappointment in the lack of balance in the film. Perhaps the movie was so focused on evoking strong emotions that it neglected other vital aspects of filmmaking, such as character development, engaging plotlines, or strong dialogue. This lack of balance might have made the film fall short of creating the intended impact and left the critic unsatisfied with the overall result. In conclusion, the critic's view of the movie is undoubtedly negative due to the use of the phrase \\"far too sentimental.\\" This single phrase encapsulates the dissatisfaction and disappointment that the critic feels about the film, which mainly stems from the movie's excessive reliance on emotion to appeal to the audience. This overemphasis on sentimentality could have potentially overshadowed other critical aspects of filmmaking that the critic, and likely other potential viewers, would have preferred to see prioritized and executed effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.''

The Introduction establishes Darwin's credentials as a naturalist and author, then refers to John Herschel's letter suggesting that the origin of species \\"would be found to be a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process\\": Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): What was Isaac Newton's belief about God on the theory of natural law?","completion":"Isaac Newton's belief about God in relation to the theory of natural law was that of a rational, intelligent creator who established a law-abiding cosmos. In this view, God crafted the universe in such a way that it is governed by a set of unchanging, fundamental laws. These natural laws, which can be discovered and understood through careful observation and scientific inquiry, govern every aspect of the universe, from the movement of celestial bodies to the functioning of living organisms. Newton believed that these natural laws were an expression of God's divine plan and purpose, demonstrating His omnipotence, wisdom, and design. The regularity and predictability of natural phenomena served as evidence of God's existence and His sovereign control over the world. For Newton, understanding these laws and principles was not only the pursuit of scientific knowledge but also a means to appreciate and worship the divine intellect behind the creation of the universe. This perspective, aligned with the theological works of William Whewell and Francis Bacon, sought to harmonize science and religion, asserting that the study of natural laws can deepen one's understanding of God and His creation. In the second edition of Darwin's \\"On the Origin of Species,\\" he added an epigraph from Joseph Butler, affirming that God could work through scientific laws as much as through miracles. This notion was an acknowledgment of religious concerns while still emphasizing the importance of empirical investigation and reason."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The tweet starts with a mention of Tae Heckard, a person presumably known by the user. 2. The user then states that tequila doesn't sit well on their stomach, sharing a negative experience, which could suggest a mildly negative sentiment, but continues to imply that it's just a personal preference. 3. The user then says they will sip a Corona, implying that they are enjoying a different type of alcoholic beverage, which delivers a positive sentiment. 4. Lastly, the user offers Tae a margarita, a friendly gesture, also displaying positive sentiment. Now, we can justify each step: A. The mention of Tae Heckard as a recipient of the message suggests that friendship or a positive relationship exists. B. The negative experience regarding tequila is negated by the fact that the user is still participating in social drinking with a Corona. C. Choosing a different beverage, the Corona, is a positive sentiment because the user has found an alternative that works for them. D.

You are given a new situation: Two islands were located in the Pacific Ocean. Woo island was frequently shaken by earthquakes, but Mud island had no such problems. and a hint : Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). Please answer this question : Which island experienced fewer rocks moving several centimeters? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Mud island experienced fewer rocks moving several centimeters. Step-by-step justification: 1.

The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation—I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it’s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used. As the bus rode on, her anger simmered. She asked me what I (middle-aged white guy) would do in a spot like that. All I could answer was to offer it up to God. Hot day, no air conditioning on the bus, people just want to get to their destinations. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

We need to evaluate each of these choices in the context of what can get a prisoner in more trouble. Step 2: Assess each choice in terms of potential trouble - Dream of freedom: This is a thought or mental state, and while it may cause emotional stress for the prisoner, thinking about freedom will not necessarily get them in more trouble. - Attempt to escape: Escaping from jail represents a direct disobedience to the rules and regulations of the prison system. Making an attempt to break free is likely to bring significant consequences, such as punishment or increased security measures. - Do time: \\"Doing time\\" means serving the sentence assigned to the prisoner. This is what the prisoner is expected to do, and doing so should not get them in more trouble. - Fast for days: Fasting for an extended period may raise concerns about a prisoner's health, but it is not a direct violation of the rules in most prisons. It may draw attention, but it's not likely to create more trouble than attempting to escape. - Scape jail: This choice appears to be a misspelling of \\"escape jail.\\" Since \\"attempt to escape\\" is already included in our choice selection and offers a more accurate wording, we can eliminate this choice as redundant. Step 3: Choose the answer based on the assessed consequences - Based on our assessment, \\"attempt to escape\\" is the most likely choice to get a prisoner in more trouble. Escaping from jail involves direct disobedience to the rules and can result in increased security measures, punishment, and even a longer sentence.

Here is a goal: How can I mount a poster in my bedroom wall? How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of mounting a poster in your bedroom wall, I suggest the following steps and their justification: 1. Choose the location for the poster: Determine the wall and the specific spot in your bedroom where you'd like to mount the poster. Justification: Choosing a suitable location will ensure proper visibility and complement the overall room aesthetics. 2. Gather required tools and materials: Some possible materials you could use to mount the poster include adhesive tape, poster putty, or mounting strips. A level might also be useful for proper alignment. Justification: Having the right tools and materials helps mount the poster securely and maintain its position. 3. Prepare the poster: Carefully unroll the poster on a flat surface, and press it down gently with books or other flat objects to straighten it out if needed. Justification: Preparing the poster in advance will make it easier to handle and prevent any damage or wrinkles during the mounting process. 4. Clean and dry the wall area: Wipe down the area on the wall where you plan to mount the poster with a damp cloth, then dry it with a towel or let it air dry. Justification: Cleaning the wall surface ensures better adhesion of the mounting materials and reduces the chances of the poster falling. 5. Measure and align the poster: Hold the poster up to the wall in your chosen location and use a level to make sure it's aligned horizontally. Mark the top corners of the poster on the wall lightly with a pencil. Justification: Proper alignment ensures the poster is displayed evenly and looks pleasing to the eye. 6. Apply the mounting material to the poster: If using adhesive tape or mounting strips, apply them to the back of the poster at each corner and along the edges as needed, following the product's instructions. If using poster putty, roll it into small balls and apply it to each corner and along the edges.

But her fellow teacher said that we were celebrating her 39thbirthday! We were all surprised and puzzled. After the party I was told by the fellow teacher that American women have a special saying about birthdays. If a woman is over 40, or even if she is 80, her birthday is always the 39th. If she is in her thirties, her birthday will be the 29th. And in her twenties, it's the 19th. They usually have their \\"real\\" birthday when they are below 20. This shows that American women, especially elderly women, are very sensitive about their ages. But my teacher always says, \\"We want to be younger,\\" so about the age of Western women, my advice is that if you don't know it, don't ask about it; if you really know it, don't mention it. The writer wants to tell us _ .

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who received his first musical education from his paternal grandfather? Bennett was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, the third child and only son of Robert Bennett, the organist of Sheffield parish church, and his wife Elizabeth, née Donn. In addition to his duties as an organist, Robert Bennett was a conductor, composer and piano teacher; he named his son after his friend William Sterndale, some of whose poems the elder Bennett had set to music. His mother died in 1818, aged 27, and his father, after remarrying, died in 1819. Thus orphaned at the age of three, Bennett was brought up in Cambridge by his paternal grandfather, John Bennett, from whom he received his first musical education. John Bennett was a professional bass, who sang as a lay clerk in the choirs of King's, St John's and Trinity colleges. The young Bennett entered the choir of King's College Chapel in February 1824 where he remained for two years. In 1826, at the age of ten, he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), which had been founded in 1822. The examiners were so impressed by the child's talent that they waived all fees for his tuition and board.Bennett was a pupil at the RAM for the next ten years. At his grandfather's wish his principal instrumental studies were at first as a violinist, under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury. He also studied the piano under W. H. Holmes, and after five years, with his grandfather's agreement, he took the piano as his principal study. He was a shy youth and was diffident about his skill in composition, which he studied under the principal of the RAM, William Crotch, and then under Cipriani Potter, who took over as principal in 1832. Amongst the friends Bennett made at the Academy was the future music critic J. W. Davison. Bennett did not study singing, but when the RAM mounted a student production of The Marriage of Figaro in 1830, Bennett, aged fourteen, was cast in the mezzo-soprano role of the page boy Cherubino (usually played by a woman en travesti). This was among the few failures of his career at the RAM. The Observer wryly commented, \\"of the...

Given the following context: Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, née Collin. Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice, always considered himself a true Parisian. Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption on the first anniversary of his marriage. The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil, 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris. When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training. Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, \\"It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart.\\" The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel, in a programme that included Mozart's Piano Concerto in B♭ (K450), and Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto. Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher... answer the following question: What is the first name of the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns?

Context: I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen.

Answer this question: who did the navajo code talkers work for??","completion":"The Navajo Code Talkers worked for the United States Marine Corps during World War II, playing a crucial role in the communication and transmission of secure messages in the Pacific Theater. The concept of using the Navajo language as a basis for an unbreakable code was developed by Philip Johnston, a WWI veteran and son of a missionary who had grown up on the Navajo reservation and became fluent in the Navajo language. He proposed the idea to the U.S. military in 1942, and after a successful demonstration, the Marine Corps established the Navajo Code Talker program. The Navajo Code Talkers were a specially recruited group of young Navajo men who were native speakers of the Dine (Navajo) language. The code they utilized was kept completely confidential and was based on a combination of the Navajo language, a substitution alphabet, and a set of code words representing military terms and concepts. The complexity of the Navajo language, including its syntax, tonal qualities, and unique linguistic features, made it particularly suitable for the development of a highly secure code. As Navajo is an unwritten language with a limited number of speakers, it was extremely difficult for non-Navajo speakers to learn or understand, making it virtually impossible for the enemy to crack the code. The Navajo Code Talkers were enlisted as Marines and underwent rigorous training to become proficient radio operators and signalmen. They were also trained to encrypt and decipher messages in the Navajo code, which they could do with remarkable speed and accuracy. The first batch of 29 Navajo Code Talkers was sent to the Pacific theater in 1942, and their performance in the Battle of Guadalcanal proved the value of their skills. By the end of World War II, approximately 400 Navajo Code Talkers served in the Marine Corps. The Navajo Code Talkers participated in numerous key battles in the Pacific Theater, including the Solomon Islands, Tarawa, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. Their secure communication lines allowed the U.S. military to transmit vital information, coordinate troop movements, and call for support, making a significant impact on the outcome of these battles. The admirals and generals who oversaw the Pacific operations, including Admiral Chester Nimitz and General Alexander Vandegrift, acknowledged the crucial contributions of the Navajo Code Talkers in securing American victories in the Pacific. The Navajo Code Talker program remained classified for over two decades after World War II, and the Code Talkers' role and contributions were only fully recognized after the program's declassification in 1968. In 2001, President George W. Bush awarded the Congressional Gold Medal to the original 29 Navajo Code Talkers, followed by Congressional Silver Medals to the other Navajo Code Talkers. Today, the Navajo Code Talkers are celebrated as true American heroes, and their service and dedication to the United States Marine Corps during World War II stand as a testament to their loyalty, skill, and courage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Available choices: a). yes. b). it is not possible to tell. c). no.","completion":"To determine whether the hypothesis \\"People always say you're just crazy but old people aren't\\" is true based on the given premise, we need to examine each part of the premise and the hypothesis itself. Here's a step-by-step analysis: Step 1: Analyze the premise The premise states that if somebody tells others about a certain situation, people would generally assume that the individual who is sharing the information is senile (meaning, they are old and have mental impairments due to age). The phrase \\"that ain't right neither\\" implies that the assumption about senility is also incorrect. Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis The hypothesis \\"People always say you're just crazy but old people aren't\\" consists of two claims. The first claim is \\"People always say you're just crazy,\\" which suggests that people often dismiss such statements. The second claim is \\"But old people aren't,\\" indicating that the assumption about old people being senile is not accurate. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis Comparing the two, we can see that the premise supports the notion that people may dismiss statements from older individuals due to assumptions about their senility, and the person saying the phrase believes that this assumption is incorrect. Step 4: Determine the validity of the hypothesis Based on the premise, the hypothesis aligns with the notion that people may assume old people are senile when they express certain concerns or statements, and the fact that this is an incorrect assumption. However, the hypothesis uses the word \\"always,\\" which might be too strong and not entirely accurate, as it suggests that people exclusively react this way. Conclusion: Considering the analysis above, the closest answer choice would be: b). it is not possible to tell. Although the hypothesis aligns with the essence of the premise, the use of the word \\"always\\" makes it impossible to determine its absolute accuracy based on the given information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: The Epithelial Cell Epithelial cells are typically characterized by the polarized distribution of organelles and membrane-bound proteins between their basal and apical surfaces. Particular structures found in some epithelial cells are an adaptation to specific functions. Certain organelles are segregated to the basal sides, whereas other organelles and extensions, such as cilia, when present, are on the apical surface. Cilia are microscopic extensions of the apical cell membrane that are supported by microtubules. They beat in unison and move fluids as well as trapped particles. Ciliated epithelium lines the ventricles of the brain where it helps circulate the cerebrospinal fluid. The ciliated epithelium of your airway forms a mucociliary escalator that sweeps particles of dust and pathogens trapped in the secreted mucous toward the throat. It is called an escalator because it continuously pushes mucous with trapped particles upward. In contrast, nasal cilia sweep the mucous blanket down towards your throat. In both cases, the transported materials are usually swallowed, and end up in the acidic environment of your stomach. Q: What cells are typically characterized by the polarized distribution of organelles and membrane-bound proteins between their basal and apical surfaces? A: Available options: (a). mast cells. (b). nerve cells. (c). connective tissue. (d). epithelial cells. The answer is:","completion":"(d). epithelial cells. Epithelial cells are typically characterized by the polarized distribution of organelles and membrane-bound proteins between their basal and apical surfaces.

For instance, while certain organelles are segregated to the basal sides of epithelial cells, other organelles and extensions, such as cilia, can be found on the apical surface when present.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Color is very important in our daily life. It can influence our choice of purchase when we go shopping and can also affect the way we look and feel. A person can be naturally attracted to one particular color1 while finding another color1 repulsive. The influence of color1 on human emotions and feelings is very powerful and designers, advertisers, artists and even doctors use _ in their professions for different purposes. Every day, without even thinking about it, we use color1 to communicate our feelings. For example, the color1 we choose to wear is one way of expressing ourselves. It says something about the person, how he or she feels, and how he or she wants others to feel about the wearer. In other words, color1 talks. A person who wants to appear stylish and mature will usually wear dark color1s or black. A person who wishes to appear youngish, pure and innocent dresses in white, like the choice of a bride's wedding gown. Also clothed in white are doctors, dentists, nurses and hospital in-patients as the color1 expresses comfort, cleanliness and professionalism. Brown, blue or grey clothes are the usual color1s worn by office workers so as not to draw unnecessary attention to them. They are, in a way, conveying the message that they want to be noticed for their work, not their appearance. People who wear bright, strong color1s like to be attractive and these color1s are particularly popular with actresses, singers and party goers. In the past, common people were not allowed to wear certain color1s.

Washington (CNN) -- When Paul Ryan struggled to explain a budget-balancing timeline under Mitt Romney, he highlighted the difficulty of trying to run a substantive campaign without being too specific. While Ryan's interview Tuesday with Fox News' Brit Hume was no Sarah Palin-Katie Couric moment, the Republican vice presidential candidate's discomfort in answering when Romney's proposal would balance the budget was evident. Ryan, a seven-term congressman from Wisconsin and chairman of the House Budget Committee, said he was unsure when Romney's proposals would balance the federal budget. Romney's plans say he would \\"put the federal government on a course toward a balanced budget\\" but does not say when. Mitt Romney's 5-point plan for the economy Hume repeatedly pressed Ryan on the question of \\"when\\" Romney's budget would balance. Hume: \\"The budget plan you're now supporting would get to balance when?\\" Ryan: \\"Well, there are different -- the budget plan that Mitt Romney is supporting gets us down to 20% of GDP (gross domestic product) government spending by 2016. That means get the size of government back to where it historically has been. What President Obama has done is he brought the size of government to as high as it hasn't been since World War II.

It could be fun with the cool looking aliens and the country setting, but it just isn't. Some aliens hear the broadcast of War of the Worlds when a small country radio station plays it on Halloween. They come to Earth to kill humans, but instead of killing, they make people their slaves and act goofy. The front cover of the film shows these aliens riding surfboards in space...not really what they do. These aren't party aliens, they are stupid cartoonish idiots with annoying high pitched modulated voices. The alien with the most tolerable voice also happens to be the Jack Nicholson rip-off alien who always wears his sunglasses. Other than the aliens, the acting is terrible.

Problem:The punkah-louvres can be adjusted to direct the air flow away from the occupants of the compartment. Solution:","completion":"The task is asking you to translate an English sentence to the Xhosa language. Just to note Xhosa is a Nguni Bantu language and one of the official languages of South Africa. Guidelines and Procedure: 1. Obtain a good understanding of the English sentence: \\"The punkah-louvres can be adjusted to direct the air flow away from the occupants of the compartment.\\" From the English sentence, it implies that \\"punkah louvres\\" are a part of a ventilation system that can be adjusted to change the direction of airflow; in this case, directing it away from people occupying a certain area (the compartment). 2. Translate the sentence into Xhosa: The words \\"punkah-louvres,\\" \\"compartment,\\" and \\"air flow\\" might not have direct translations in Xhosa, since such specific technical terms often don't have equivalents in other languages. Try to use the closest words that capture the essence and function of these elements. Here is a potential translation: \\"Amagundwana amilambo angajongiswa ukuze aziphumelele into yokuthi umoya uwavalekise abantu abahlala kwi compartment.\\" Please note that this translation might still contain some English words as Xhosa may not have an absolute equivalent for every word. How to find an accurate translation? 1. For literal translations, you can use available online tools like Google Translate. However, note that these tools may not perfectly translate contextual and cultural nuances. 2. Engage with a native speaker or an expert in Xhosa language. They could help you with nuances and words that are unique to the culture and context of that language. 3. Read literature, dictionaries or study materials available in Xhosa, this could help you understand contexts, culture and get familiar with commonly used phrases in Xhosa.

Q:The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who became a symbol of resistance to the white-minority government? is inside the article: Makeba was among the most visible people campaigning against the apartheid system in South Africa, and was responsible for popularising several anti-apartheid songs, including \\"Meadowlands\\" by Strike Vilakezi and \\"Ndodemnyama we Verwoerd\\" (Watch out, Verwoerd) by Vuyisile Mini. Due to her high profile, she became a spokesperson of sorts for Africans living under oppressive governments, and in particular for black South Africans living under apartheid. When the South African government prevented her from entering her home country, she became a symbol of \\"apartheid's cruelty\\", and she used her position as a celebrity by testifying against apartheid before the UN in 1962 and 1964. Many of her songs were banned within South Africa, leading to Makeba's records being distributed underground, and even her apolitical songs being seen as subversive. She thus became a symbol of resistance to the white-minority government both within and outside South Africa. In an interview in 2000, Masekela said that \\"there [was] nobody in Africa who made the world more aware of what was happening in South Africa than Miriam Makeba.\\"Makeba has also been associated with the movement against colonialism, with the civil rights and black power movements in the US, and with the Pan-African movement. She called for unity between black people of African descent across the world: \\"Africans who live everywhere should fight everywhere. The struggle is no different in South Africa, the streets of Chicago, Trinidad or Canada. The Black people are the victims of capitalism, racism and oppression, period\\". After marrying Carmichael she often appeared with him during his speeches; Carmichael later described her presence at these events as an asset, and Feldstein wrote that Makeba enhanced Carmichael's message that \\"black is beautiful\\". Along with performers such as Simone, Lena Horne, and Abbey Lincoln, she used her position as a prominent musician to advocate for civil rights. Their activism has been described as simultaneously calling attention to..., can you guess it ? A:","completion":"The first name of the person who became a symbol of resistance to the white-minority government, as mentioned in the article, is Miriam. Miriam Makeba was a prominent anti-apartheid activist and musician from South Africa. She played a significant role in bringing global attention to the injustice of apartheid and advocating for civil rights, not only in South Africa but also for black people of African descent around the world."},{"prompt":"Process: - Salt water is contained in a factory or plant - The water is boiled to a very high tempature - The salt becomes seperated from the water - The salt is removed - The water is able to be drank at this point.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Depleted uranium is also used as a shielding material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials. While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium. Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material. Due to its high density, this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses. Depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast as well as its relatively low cost. The main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity (uranium being only a weak alpha emitter). What trait causes depleted uranium to be used in gyroscopic compasses?","completion":"Depleted uranium is used in gyroscopic compasses because it has a very high density. This high density makes it a heavy and stable material, which is important for gyroscopes to work properly. Gyroscopes need a heavy spinning wheel to help them maintain their direction and balance. Since depleted uranium is heavier than other metals, it makes the gyroscope work better and more accurately for showing direction."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 2014, there was a big incident where someone stole private photos from celebrities' phones and computers. Imagine you have a toy that you really really like and don't want to share, but someone takes it from you without asking. That's pretty much what happened here. The people who took the photos got them by breaking into the celebrities' iCloud accounts, which is kind of like a big toy box where they keep their digital stuff. As for the poor quality of the photos and videos, well it can be compared to sketching a picture. Sometimes when you draw a picture quickly, it doesn't come out as nice as when you take your time, right? Similarly, when these photos and videos are taken, they are often not intended to be seen by anyone else, so they might not look as good as photos the celebrities would share themselves. Regarding your multi-choice question, I would say that the answer is 1) no. These are not the same questions.

Write highlights for this article: Homes owned by a string of celebrities have vanished from Google’s Street View Map following draconian European privacy laws, it emerged yesterday. Mansions owned by Sir Paul McCartney, former Prime Minister Tony Blair and singer Katherine Jenkins are included in those that have disappeared from the controversial online tool. The popular map feature allows users to view homes, buildings and areas along almost every road in the world on a computer screen. Scroll down for video. Now you see it... now you don't: Tony Blair's London home has been blurred out on Google Street View. Normal scene: How the London home belonging to Mr Blair (right), which is protected by police, normally looks. A mansion owned by Sir Paul McCartney are included in those that have vanished from Street View. But following a landmark ruling in a European court in favour of people’s ‘right to be forgotten’, the computer programme has seen dozens of requests from the rich and famous to have their homes removed. The house of former Beatles star McCartney can now not be seen on the 3-Dimensional online map, despite most of the London street that it is on being visible. A click of the mouse to show the west London home of Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page also comes up against a blank. Street View users are instead left having to view the distinctive property from a long distance away – blocking out any of the home’s features. Hidden: The Cotswolds mansion owned by pop star Lily Allen (left) is hidden from the public eye of Street View, as is the Surrey home of Katherine Jenkins (right) Privacy: Street View users can only view Katherine Jenkins' mansion from far away - and parts are blurred. The same barrier is in place at the Surrey home of Welsh mezzo-soprano Katherine Jenkins. This is despite it being seen by millions of people when it featured in a series of the BBC One’s Apprentice. The world’s biggest search engine has also blurred out the £5million Georgian townhouse in central London where the former Prime Minister Tony Blair and wife Cherie live. Blair, who has made millions of pounds trading off his image and former office since leaving Downing Street, moved to the property, where he is continually protected by a police guard, in 2004. Caught on camera: A Google street-mapping car used to compile the online map. The Cotswolds mansion owned by pop star Lily Allen and her husband Sam Cooper is also hidden from the public eye of Street View. It comes as the disgraced former Royal Bank of Scotland banker Fred Goodwin’s £3.5million Edinburgh mansion was revealed to have disappeared from the Google application last month. Goodwin, who was stripped of his knighthood, was held up as a figurehead for the bank’s disastrous crash in 2008 and the epitome of capitalist excess in the UK. A Google spokesman confirmed that it has always been possible for users with a ‘compelling case’ to convince them to remove images of their homes. But it has been hit by a huge increase in requests to remove data from its search archives after European judges ruled in favour of citizens’ ‘right to be forgotten’. The legal decision means that companies holding vast quantities of data - such as search engines - can be forced to take down information which is deemed ‘inadequate, irrelevant or excessive’. It also allows people to suppress embarrassing information about their pasts if it is no longer relevant. Services such as Google Street View are thought not be covered by the ruling. Google has already disclosed that it has been asked by MPs, celebrities and public figures to have search results removed. It has employed a team of workers to evaluate each request. As seen on screen: The popular map feature allows users to view homes, buildings and areas along almost every road in the world on a computer screen. Removal: A Google spokesman confirmed that it has always been possible for users with a 'compelling case' to convince them to remove images of their homes. The Mail’s website, MailOnline has also received notification from Google of which links it has decided to remove. They include a story about Dougie McDonald, who was a Scottish top-flight football referee who was found to have lied about his reasons for granting a penalty in a Celtic v Dundee United match; a story about Tesco workers posting stories on social media attacking their workers; and a story about a Muslim man who accused Cathay Pacific, the airline, of refusing to employ him because of his name. The stories have not been removed by MailOnline, which described the move as similar to ‘burning books in a library’.

I rented Spirit on a whim, just trying to pack my life full of as much horse related material as I could, and I was surprised by the results. What I expected was a feel-good Disneyesque movie with talking animals and stereotypes every five minutes. What I got was an amazing film, filled with beautiful scenery and animation, and an amazing storyline that has the great potential to warm one's heart. Spirit is a wild mustang in the Old West, whose entire world is brought crumbling down around him when he discovers the humans slowly taking over his homeland. The story unfolds with a wide array of characters, some human, some animals, all are well written and most are pleasant to watch on screen. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good story, and who has an appreciation for history and animals. One thing I forgot to mention, but that I feel is important, is that the animals in this film do not talk. This was a really nice vacation from the Lady And The Tramp animated movies that everyone today is used to.","completion":"The sentiment of this review is very positive! The person who wrote the review expected a typical movie with talking animals, but they found an amazing film with beautiful animation and an interesting storyline.

Who manufactures Walmart's private label brand of Great Value soft drinks?","completion":"No, the two questions are not the same. Both questions pertain to Walmart's private label brand, Great Value, but they address two different product categories: milk and soft drinks. 1. Who manufactures Walmart's private label brand of Great Value Milk? This question focuses on the milk products sold under Walmart's private label brand, Great Value. It is generally known that large retailers like Walmart often do not manufacture their store-brand products themselves. Instead, they contract with different manufacturing companies to produce these goods according to their specifications. The manufacturing process for Great Value milk may involve various dairy suppliers and farms. This is because milk is a perishable item which requires a fresh supply, and Walmart operates thousands of stores across the United States. Consequently, local dairies that follow Walmart's strict quality and safety guidelines may be contracted to supply milk for the Great Value brand in specific regions. Walmart sources the milk for its private label brands from dairy farms that adhere to industry standards and regulations. 2. Who manufactures Walmart's private label brand of Great Value soft drinks? This question pertains to the soft drinks sold under the Great Value brand. Similar to the milk products, these soft drinks are produced by various manufacturing companies on behalf of Walmart. Soft drinks typically have a longer shelf life than milk, which means they can be sourced from a slightly less diverse range of suppliers compared to milk. Walmart, like other retailers, maintains confidentiality around its specific manufacturing partners. However, it is likely that the company contracts with one or more beverage manufacturers to supply soft drinks for the Great Value brand. These manufacturers follow Walmart's quality and safety guidelines to ensure that the finished products meet consumer expectations. In summary, while both questions relate to the same private label brand, they address different product categories within that brand—milk and soft drinks. The questions inquire about the manufacturers associated with these specific products, which can vary, given that Walmart may contract different suppliers for each product category."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here we go: \\"En notant avec appréciation la coopération exemplaire continue de la Nouvelle-Zélande en tant que puissance administrante en ce qui concerne les travaux du Comité spécial relatif à Tokelau et sa disposition à permettre l'accès des missions de visite des Nations Unies au Territoire,\\" Justifying my translation: 1. \\"Noting with appreciation\\" is translated to \\"En notant avec appréciation\\" in French. 2. \\"the continuing exemplary cooperation of New Zealand\\" turns to \\"la coopération exemplaire continue de la Nouvelle-Zélande\\". 3. \\"as the administering Power\\" is \\"en tant que puissance administrante\\" in French. 4. \\"with regard to the work of the Special Committee\\" converts to \\"en ce qui concerne les travaux du Comité spécial\\". 5. \\"relating to Tokelau\\" becomes \\"relatif à Tokelau\\". 6. \\"and its readiness to permit access by United Nations visiting missions\\" is translated into \\"et sa disposition à permettre l'accès des missions de visite des Nations Unies\\". 7. \\"to the Territory\\" converts to \\"au Territoire\\" in French. By breaking the sentence into meaningful fragments, the translation process becomes much easier and the result is much more accurate. The sentence structure in French can be different from English, and maintaining the structure can sometimes lead to a loss in meaning. Thus, it is essential to correctly translate the phrases and rearrange them in a way that makes sense in the target language."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The 9 August shooting of Michael Brown, 18, sparked days of violent protests in the town of Ferguson, prompting a heavy police crackdown. There is widespread anger against the mainly white police force for killing Mr Brown, who was unarmed. Mr Brown's family say his funeral will take place on Monday. US Attorney General Eric Holder is due to visit Ferguson on Wednesday to meet officials investigating the killing. Tuesday's police shooting has threatened to further inflame tensions within the community. According to police, in the early afternoon, two officers shot and killed a knife-wielding man four miles (6.4km) from the site of Mr Brown's killing. St Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said witnesses reported the man had been behaving in an erratic manner, and emphasised the officers had a right to defend themselves. \\"The suspect turned toward officers, pulled out knife in an overhand grip, told officers to 'shoot me now, kill me now',\\" he told reporters. In another development in the Michael Brown case, the St Louis county prosecutor's office on Tuesday said it would present evidence against the officer who killed Mr Brown to a grand jury on Wednesday. The citizen panel will determine whether or not to charge Darren Wilson with a crime. Both St Louis officials and the US justice department are conducting investigations into the case, which has provoked demonstrations throughout the country. Witnesses have said Mr Brown was shot as he held his hands up in a position of surrender, while the police and supporters of Mr Wilson have said he fired during a fight with Mr Brown. An autopsy commissioned by Mr Brown's family concluded he had been shot six times, twice in the head. New York pathologist Dr Baden said his body showed no signs of a struggle. He also believed Mr Brown was not shot at close range as there was no gunpowder residue on his body, suggesting the officer was more than 2ft (60cm) away. On Monday night protests in Ferguson again turned violent, despite the presence of troops from the National Guard. Missouri Highway Patrol Capt Ron Johnson, who has led the police response since Thursday, said officers were forced to use tear gas and stun grenades after they came under \\"heavy gunfire\\" and were attacked with petrol bombs and bottles. He said two people were hit by gunfire from demonstrators, insisting that officers did not use their weapons. Capt Johnson appealed to demonstrators to protest in the daytime to prevent a \\"tiny minority of law breakers\\" from deliberately sparking violence. \\"Anyone who has been at these protests understands that there is a dangerous dynamic in the night: it allows a small number of violent agitators to hide in the crowd and then attempt to create chaos,\\" he told journalists. Those arrested include people from other states, including New York and California, Capt Johnson said. Correspondents say this suggests the protests are becoming more organised. Separately, President Barack Obama said he understood the \\"passions and anger\\" provoked by the death of the teenager. \\"In too many communities, too many young men of colour are left behind and seen only as objects of fear,\\" he said. 21,205 Population of Ferguson, Missouri 65% Black or black African 6% Police officers are black 9% Unemployed 21% Families living below the poverty line Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"On Tuesday, police officers in St. Louis shot dead a man who brandished a knife at them, leading to increased tension within the community and potentially further inflaming the situation. This incident is close to the site where Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, was shot by a police officer on August 9th, sparking days of violent protests and a heavy police crackdown in Ferguson. The mainly white police force has been criticized for its handling of the situation, and US Attorney General Eric Holder is set to visit Ferguson to meet with officials investigating the killing. Both local and federal investigations are currently taking place, as protests continue. Witnesses have reported that Brown was shot with his hands up in a position of surrender, while police and supporters of the officer who killed Brown, Darren Wilson, have said he fired during a fight with Brown. Autopsy results commissioned by Brown's family concluded that he was shot six times, twice in the head, without any signs of a struggle or gunshot residue on his body. Protests have continued to turn violent, with the use of tear gas and stun grenades by officers, and reports suggesting that the protests are becoming more organized as some demonstrators travel from other states.

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Lander and Dahlia Iyad. for the following movie plot: Michael Lander is a pilot who flies the Goodyear Blimp over National Football League games to film them for network television. Secretly deranged by years of torture as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, he had a bitter court martial on his return and a failed marriage. He longs to commit suicide and to take with him as many as possible of the cheerful, carefree American civilians he sees from his blimp each weekend. Lander conspires with Dahlia Iyad, an operative from the Palestinian terrorist group Black September, to launch a suicide attack using a bomb composed of plastique and a quarter million steel flechettes, housed on the underside of the gondola of the blimp, which they will detonate over the Miami Orange Bowl during Super Bowl X. Dahlia and Black September, in turn, intend the attack as a wake-up call for the American people, to turn their attention and the world's to the plight of the Palestinians. American and Israeli intelligence, led by Mossad agent David Kabakov and Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Sam Corley, race to prevent the catastrophe. After discovering the recording Dahlia made, meant to be played after the attack, they piece together the path of the explosives into the country, and Dahlia's own movements. The bomb-carrying blimp is chased by police helicopters as it approaches the stadium. Kabakov kills Lander and Iyad, but not before Lander lights the fuse to the blimp's bomb. Kabakov lowers himself from the helicopter to the blimp, hooks it up and hauls it out of the stadium and over the ocean where it blows up.

A survey shows that the tigers are in more danger of dying out than China's most famous animal,the giant panda.Forty years ago,about 4,000 South China tigers lived in the wild.Today there are only about 30.An additional 64 live in 19 zoos in China,,which are all descendants of six wild animals seized in 1956. The cubs were born in zoos in China and removed from their mothers when they were three months old.Their first home in South Africa was a one-acre camp where they stayed for a month.Their next home was a ten acre area,where they lived for three months to help them gradually get used to life outside a cage. When the cubs first arrived in South Africa,they didn't even want to leave their cages.It took weeks to get them to eat chicken,used as they were to being fed beef at the Zoo in China where they were born.It took months of practice to hunt a live animal and then make the link between the kill and food.Now just a few months on,and living in a 150-acre camp,they have become remarkably skilled hunters. All four animals will finally return to Zoos in China while the pioneering pairs' cubs will grow up completely wild.The aim is for _ to go to reserves developed in China by 2008,when the Olympic Games will be held in Beijing.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Electric charge is a physical property. It occurs between particles or objects. It causes them to attract or repel each other. They do not even have to touch. This is unlike the typical push or pull you may be familiar with. All electric charge is based on the protons and electrons in atoms. A proton has a positive electric charge. An electron has a negative electric charge. Forces on Charged Objects Most atoms are balanced electrically. They have the same number of positive and negative charges. Therefore, the number of protons equals the number of electrons. Neutrons do not matter as they have no charge. When an object loses some electrons, it becomes positively charged. There are now more protons than electrons inside the atom. The lost electrons may remain free. Or, they may attach to another object. The new object now has more electrons than protons. It then becomes negatively charged. After reading the above, is \\"Electrons have a negative charge\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What kind of charge does an atom with more electrons than protons have?\\"? + no. + yes.","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"Electrons have a negative charge\\" is correct. Thus, the answer to the question \\"What kind of charge does an atom with more electrons than protons have?\\" would also be that it has a negative charge. In the structure of an atom, it contains protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons are positively charged, electrons are negatively charged, and neutrons carry no charge. In a neutrally charged atom, the number of protons and electrons is equal, nullifying each other's charges leading to an overall neutral charge. When there are more electrons than protons in an atom, it means there are more negative charges than positive charges. As such, the atom exhibits a net negative charge. Thus, when an atom has more electrons than protons, it becomes negatively charged due to the extra electrons, surpassing the number of protons that have positive charges. Further, when an object gains or loses electrons, this leads to the principle of charge conservation. This means the total amount of electric charge in a system does not change with time. If an atom loses an electron, it becomes positively charged, and when it gains an electron, it becomes negatively charged. This is the basic principle of the flow of electricity. The transfer or movement of these charged particles leads to what we know as electricity. Hence, the difference in the number of protons and electrons in an atom plays a crucial role in many aspects of science and technology, from the creation of electric currents to the properties of different materials. So, yes, an atom with more electrons than protons carries a negative overall electrical charge. It is the balance (or imbalance) of protons (positive charges) and electrons (negative charges) that determines the electric charge of an atom, particle, or object."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Where might a milking machine be located? - office - bar - barn - industrial area - museum The best answer is","completion":"A milking machine, a mechanical device commonly used in the dairy industry for efficient extraction of milk from cows, goats, sheep, or any other dairy-producing animals, would most likely be located in a barn or an industrial area. A barn is a popular agricultural building mainly used to house livestock. It is designed to accommodate animals, store feed, hay, and equipment in a safe and efficient manner. A milking machine in a barn setting provides various benefits for both the farmer and the animals. First and foremost, it speeds up the milking process and helps maintain consistent milking schedules, thereby increasing productivity. Furthermore, the device ensures hygiene since the milk is extracted in a sterilized closed system, reducing the chance of contamination and improving the overall milk quality. On the other hand, an industrial area usually refers to a designated zone where large-scale production, manufacturing, or processing of goods takes place. Industrial dairy farms or processing plants install milking machines to handle large numbers of animals and to streamline the milk production process. In these settings, milking machines are often part of a more extensive automated system and may include additional components such as conveyor belts, rotary parlors, or automated feeding systems for efficient milk production. It is highly unlikely that a milking machine would be located in an office or a bar, as these are places designed for human interaction and activities, quite unrelated to dairy production. Offices cater to administrative and management tasks while bars are social establishments serving beverages and sometimes food. Lastly, while it is not common to find an actively used milking machine in a museum, it is possible to encounter antique or historical displays of early milking machines or dairy farming equipment in agricultural museums or history exhibits. These displays aim to educate visitors about the evolution of the dairy industry and advancements in technology. In conclusion, the best answer is that a milking machine may be located either in a barn or an industrial area, as these settings cater to the functionality and utility required for efficient milk extraction and production."},{"prompt":"Q: You are given a review of Amazon's food products.

In 1895, members of the Gloucestershire Engineer Volunteers reenacted their famous stand at Rorke's Drift, 18 years earlier. 25 British soldiers beat back the attack of 75 Zulus at the Grand Military Fete at the Cheltenham Winter Gardens. Veterans of the American Civil War recreated battles as a way to remember their fallen comrades and to teach others what the war was all about. The Great Reunion of 1913, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg, was attended by more than 50,000 Union and Confederate veterans, and included reenactments of elements of the battle, including Pickett's Charge. During the early twentieth century, historical reenactment became very popular in Russia with reenactments of the Siege of Sevastopol , the Battle of Borodino in St Petersburg and the Taking of Azov in Voronezh in 1918. In 1920, there was a reenactment of the 1917 Storming of the Winter Palace on the third anniversary of the event. This reenactment inspired the scenes in Sergei Eisenstein's film October: Ten Days That Shook the World. Large scale reenactments began to be regularly held at the Royal Tournament, Aldershot Tattoo in the 1920s and 30s. A spectacular recreation of the Siege of Namur, an important military engagement of the Nine Years' War, was staged in 1934 as part of 6-day long show. In America, modern reenacting is thought to have begun during the 1961-1965 Civil War Centennial commemorations.

Answer: S76 Question: what type of batteries are 357 (LR44) Answer:","completion":"The LR44 battery, also known as the 357 battery, is a type of small, alkaline, button/coin cell battery primarily used in small electronic devices like watches, calculators, laser pointers, and hearing aids. LR44 batteries are widely available and easy to replace in most devices. The LR44 is not the only designation for this battery; it has several other names and model numbers used by different manufacturers, which can cause confusion among consumers. Those names include AG13, G13-A, S76, SR44W, GP76A, V13GA, PX76A, and L1154. However, these batteries typically have similar specifications and are interchangeable in most cases. The \\"LR\\" in \\"LR44\\" stands for \\"Alkaline Round,\\" while the \\"44\\" is the battery's size code. Their chemistry is alkaline, which means they use an alkaline electrolyte, usually potassium hydroxide, and have a zinc anode and manganese dioxide cathode. LR44 batteries have a nominal voltage of 1.5 volts and an average capacity of 130 to 150 milliamp-hours (mAh). They have a longer life than silver oxide batteries but may have a lower voltage, which can affect the performance of some devices. The S76 battery, on the other hand, is a silver oxide battery. Silver oxide batteries are similar in size and shape to their alkaline LR44 counterparts, but they have a different chemical composition. As a result, the S76 battery also has a nominal voltage of 1.55 volts and a slightly higher capacity than the LR44, boasting 170 to 200 mAh. Silver oxide batteries like the S76 are known for being more stable, maintaining consistent voltage output throughout their lifespan. They also have better leakage resistance and temperature tolerance, making them superior choices for applications that demand precise voltage or can be negatively impacted by voltage dips, such as in watches and medical devices. In conclusion, while the S76 and 357 (LR44) batteries may be similar in terms of size and physical appearance, they are not identical in terms of their chemical composition and performance characteristics. Therefore, the answer to the question, \\"are the LR44 (357) batteries S76 type?\\" is no. The LR44 (357) batteries are alkaline, while the S76 batteries are silver oxide."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The sentence has a subject (the owl), two verbs (hated, loved), and two objects (the evil bat, the wise eagle). It also has two adjectives (evil, wise) to describe the objects. The sentence uses a conjunction (and) to connect two independent clauses. Step 2: Check for grammaticality. The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject, verbs, objects, and adjectives all agree in number and tense. Step 3: Assess the choice of vocabulary. The vocabulary used in the sentence is appropriate and effectively conveys the intended meaning. The words \\"evil\\" and \\"wise\\" also add more depth to the objects, making the sentence more vivid. Step 4: Analyze the coherence and cohesion. The sentence is coherent, as it presents a clear and logical relationship between the subject, verbs, and objects. The conjunction \\"and\\" provides cohesion by connecting the two independent clauses and showing a relationship between them. Step 5: Examine the sentence for ambiguity. Because the sentence is simple and clear, there is no room for ambiguity. The meanings of \\"hated\\" and \\"loved\\" are clear in the context of the sentence. Step 6: Determine the sentence's stylistic effectiveness. The sentence effectively creates a contrast between the two objects by presenting one as evil and the other as wise. This may evoke feelings or create imagery for the reader, highlighting the emotions of the owl. Overall, the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"The owl hated the evil bat and loved the wise eagle\\" is strong. The sentence is grammatically accurate, clear, coherent, and stylistically effective."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Following the separate fatal police shootings of John Crawford III and Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy in Ohio, while each were holding BB guns, where grand juries decided not to indict any of the officers involved, Kasich created the Ohio Collaborative Community-Police Advisory Board \\"to address what he described as frustration and distrust among some Ohioans toward their police departments, particularly among the black community.\\" The 23-member task force (with 18 members appointed by Kasich) was appointed in January 2015 and issued its 629-page final report and recommendations in April 2015. The report recommended greater accountability and oversight for police agencies and officers, further community education and involvement in policing, and new use-of-force and recruitment, hiring, and training standards for police agencies. In April 2015, Kasich created the Ohio Collaborative Community-Police Advisory Board, a twelve-member board tasked (in conjunction with the Ohio Office of Criminal Justice Services and the Ohio Department of Public Safety) with developing statewide standards for the recruiting, hiring and screening of police officers, and for the use of force (including deadly force) by police. The advisory board, the first of its kind in Ohio, was also tasked by Kasich with developing \\"model policies and best practice recommendations to promote better interaction and communication between law enforcement departments and their home communities.\\" In August 2015, the board issued its recommendations, which placed \\"an emphasis on the preservation of human life and restrict officers to defending themselves or others from death or serious injury.\\" In August 2015, Kasich said that he was open to the idea of requiring police officers to wear body cameras.

What sentence would provide a factual answer to this question: \\"A bird in an arid place can find water, despite a lack of puddles, lakes or rainfall if it\\"","completion":"A bird in an arid place can find water, despite a lack of puddles, lakes, or rainfall if it utilizes its remarkable ability to detect moisture in the environment through efficient water-acquisition strategies such as locating condensed dew, targeting specific plants and fruits, observing the behavior of other animals, and prioritizing metabolic water production. In arid regions, birds adapt to the scarce water availability by employing various tactics. One such technique is searching for condensed dew, often found on leaves, rocks, and other surfaces during the early hours of the day. This tiny amount of moisture can provide a lifesaving drink for a bird searching for water. Additionally, birds living in arid environments often develop a deep understanding of the local flora and fauna in their quest to quench their thirst. Many plants and cacti store water in their tissues, and some even bear fruits that are high in water content. Birds can use their beaks to penetrate these sources of water and consume them, gaining both nutrition and hydration in the process. For example, some birds may rely on water-rich fruits such as melons or cacti like the barrel cactus, which store water to survive prolonged dry periods. Moreover, these resourceful birds also observe the behavior of other animals living in the same environment to locate water. For instance, they may follow larger fauna that are known to have well-developed water-finding instincts, such as antelopes, elephants, or camels. Birds can also look for animal tracks or listen for specific sounds that indicate the presence of water, such as the buzzing of insects or the splashing of birds bathing in a hidden water source. Lastly, some birds in arid regions have evolved to prioritize metabolic water production – the process whereby water is generated as a byproduct of their own metabolism, particularly during the digestion of food. Due to this biological adaptation, they can thrive on a diet of insects, seeds, and other dry food sources, and reduce their dependency on external water sources. In conclusion, a bird living in an arid place can find water if it adopts several strategies, including locating condensed dew, targeting water-rich plants and fruits, observing the behavior of other animals, and relying on metabolic water production. These remarkable adaptations highlight the incredible resilience and resourcefulness of birds inhabiting some of the harshest environments on Earth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the best way to: How do you coat cake pop in chocolate?","completion":"To coat cake pops in chocolate, follow these step-by-step instructions and justifications: 1. Prepare the chocolate coating: Choose a high-quality chocolate or candy melts for the coating. It's essential to pick a good-quality chocolate or candy melts to ensure a smooth and even coating on the cake pops. 2. Chop the chocolate: If using chocolate, chop it into small, uniform pieces to ensure even melting. Smaller pieces will melt more consistently at the same rate, reducing the chance of burning or seizing the chocolate. 3. Melt the chocolate: Using a double boiler or microwave, melt the chocolate until it is smooth and glossy. Make sure to stir the chocolate or candy melts frequently, as this will help ensure even melting and prevent overheating. - If using a double boiler, fill the bottom pan with water, and place the chocolate in the top pan. Heat the water (without boiling), and let the chocolate melt by the steam's heat. Stir often. - If using a microwave, melt the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl in 20-30 second intervals, stirring frequently to avoid overheating. 4. Thin the chocolate: If the melted chocolate is too thick to coat the cake pops evenly, add a small amount of paramount crystals, shortening, or coconut oil to thin the consistency. Adding too much will cause the coating to become greasy, so start with a little and add more if necessary. 5. Prepare the cake pops: Make sure the cake pops are chilled and firm before starting the coating process. This helps to prevent the cake pops from falling off the sticks or leaving crumbs in the chocolate. 6. Dip the tip of the cake pop stick into the chocolate: This acts as \\"glue\\" and helps to secure the cake pop onto the stick. Insert the dipped stick into the cake pop about halfway through, and then let the chocolate set before dipping the cake pop. 7. Dip the cake pop into the chocolate: Hold the cake pop by the stick and submerge it into the melted chocolate until it is completely coated. Gently tap the stick against the side of the bowl to remove excess chocolate and create a smooth surface. 8. Decorate (optional): If you wish to add sprinkles, crushed nuts, or other decorations to the cake pop, do so immediately after dipping the cake pop in the chocolate, while the chocolate is still wet. 9. Set the cake pop: Place the coated cake pop into a cake pop stand or a piece of styrofoam to hold it upright. Allow the chocolate to set and harden at room temperature or in the refrigerator. 10. Store the cake pops: Once the chocolate has set, you can store the cake pops in an airtight container in the refrigerator or at room temperature, depending on the type of chocolate used and the filling ingredients. By following these steps, you'll be able to coat cake pops in chocolate uniformly, resulting in an attractive and delicious treat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

One of the episodes that she did not appear in was the inaugural pilot episode, \\"The Seinfeld Chronicles\\", because her character was not initially intended to be a part of the series. It was only after the first episode that NBC executives felt the show was too male-centric, and demanded that creators Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David add a woman to the cast. It was revealed in the commentary on the DVD package that the addition of a female character was the condition for commissioning the show. Louis-Dreyfus won the role over several other actresses who would also eventually enjoy their own TV success, including Patricia Heaton, Rosie O'Donnell and Megan Mullally.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person who was appointed as chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London?, using the article: In 1894 Wood went to the Wagner festival at Bayreuth where he met the conductor Felix Mottl, who subsequently appointed him as his assistant and chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London. The manager of the hall, Robert Newman, was proposing to run a ten-week season of promenade concerts and, impressed by Wood, invited him to conduct. There had been such concerts in London since 1838, under conductors from Louis Antoine Jullien to Arthur Sullivan. Sullivan's concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful, because he offered his audiences something more than the usual light music. He introduced major classical works, such as Beethoven symphonies, normally restricted to the more expensive concerts presented by the Philharmonic Society and others. Newman aimed to do the same: \\"I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public by easy stages.

Which former British politician died on 8th April 2013 aged 87?","completion":"The former British politician who died on 8th April 2013 at the age of 87 was Margaret Thatcher, also known as the \\"Iron Lady.\\" Born on October 13, 1925, in Grantham, Lincolnshire, Margaret Hilda Thatcher (née Roberts) went on to become one of the most significant figures in the United Kingdom's political history. Thatcher was the first and, to date, the only woman to serve as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, holding office from 1979 to 1990. She was also the leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990. Her political career began when she was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Finchley in 1959. Thatcher held various positions within the Conservative Party, eventually becoming the Secretary of State for Education and Science in 1970 in the government of Edward Heath. In 1975, Thatcher successfully challenged Heath for the Conservative Party leadership and became the leader of the party. As the Prime Minister, Thatcher was famous for her strong conservative policies, which were hallmarked by economic liberalization, privatization of state-owned industries, and deregulation. She pursued monetarist policies to control inflation and reduced the power of trade unions. Her policies were aimed at fostering individualism and self-reliance among British citizens. Margaret Thatcher's time as Prime Minister was marked by several significant events, including the Falklands War (1982) against Argentina, a conflict that resulted in the recapture of the Falkland Islands and bolstered Thatcher's popularity in the United Kingdom. She also established a close relationship with the United States under President Ronald Reagan, sharing similar conservative political views and forging a strong partnership during the Cold War. Thatcher was eventually ousted from power in 1990 when her authority within the Conservative Party began to falter. After her resignation, she undertook various roles, including that of a global speaker, author, and member of the House of Lords with the title of Baroness Thatcher. Towards the end of her life, Thatcher's health deteriorated; she suffered from several minor strokes in the early 2000s and was diagnosed with dementia. She passed away on April 8, 2013, due to a stroke while staying at the Ritz Hotel in London. Margaret Thatcher remains a divisive figure in British politics, with her supporters praising her for reviving the country's economy and playing a significant role during the Cold War, while her detractors criticize the social divisions and inequalities that emerged during her time in office."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But the decision - and the abrupt way it was executed - represents a dramatic end to a strained relationship. Tillerson learned of his firing by an early-morning Trump tweet, according to Steve Goldstein, undersecretary of state. White House officials disputed that notion, and promptly fired Goldstein. The move left some of Trump's staunchest defenders with mixed feelings. “It’s all very Trumpian,” said James Carafano of the conservative Heritage Foundation, who helped staff the State Department as a member of Trump’s transition team. “When the president makes changes, he just abruptly makes them.” During his 14 months at the State Department, Tillerson had numerous policy differences with Trump - and the friction frequently played out in public. The animosity peaked in October, when news surfaced that Tillerson reportedly called Trump a “moron” following a July Pentagon meeting. Tillerson never explicitly denied the account. Tillerson also publicly disagreed with Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord. He reportedly opposed Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And Tillerson sometimes took a tougher stance than Trump on Russia — including this week, when he blamed Moscow for a suspected nerve agent attack in Britain.

Write some highlights for the following article: When it comes to the new \\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\\" movie, critics have found one begrudging silver lining: At least it's better than \\"Transformers.\\" Of course the live-action \\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,\\" in theaters Friday, has some things in common with that toy-based franchise, beginning with its association with Michael Bay. The \\"Transformers\\" director served as a producer on 2014's \\"Turtles\\" adaptation -- leaving the directing to Jonathan Liebesman of \\"Battle Los Angeles\\" -- and tapped former \\"Transformers\\" star Megan Fox to go along for the ride. In \\"Turtles,\\" Fox plays April O'Neil, the eager NYC TV reporter who stumbles across the titular crew of teenage mutants who are well-versed in the martial arts. As April learns, this quad of wise-cracking reptiles, who have a fondness for pizza and a rat for a mentor, are the result of a lab experiment. So there's the first sigh of relief for longtime fans of \\"turtle power\\": the new \\"Turtles\\" backstory is pretty faithful to the legacy of the comics, animated series and movies that came before it. There's a tweak involving April's childhood relationship to the turtles, but, overall, Donatello's still the brainy one; Raphael's still the hothead; Leonardo's still the leader; and Michelangelo is as party-ready as ever. The problem, critics say, isn't that Bay, Liebesman and script writers Josh Appelbaum, Andre Nemec and Evan Daugherty didn't respect the lore, or that the movie doesn't deliver on action. It's that they revived the franchise with no sense of humor or affection, or even a clear understanding of their audience. \\"The new adaptation,\\" says the Los Angeles Times, \\"often feels like some sort of corporate seminar in brand management. There is something half-hearted about the entire film, as if those behind it were involved not because they wanted to make it, not because they should make it, but just because they could.\\" It's not \\"out-and-out terrible,\\" but it's not \\"particularly memorable,\\" either. Variety wound up in the same place of ambivalence, remarking in its review that \\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\\" is a \\"back-to-basics origin saga that is neither a particularly good movie nor the pop culture travesty that some were dreading.\\" There are all the usual Bay trademarks -- \\"chaotic action, crass side jokes, visual-effects overkill, Megan Fox\\" -- but on the other hand, it's also \\"nowhere near 'Transformers'-level off-putting,\\" Variety shrugs. For The A.V. Club, it isn't \\"fidelity\\" the movie lacks, \\"but a spirit of genuine boyish fun ... . 'Ninja Turtles' exists for the sole purpose of squeezing a few more drops of milk out of an old cash cow. At least the Turtles themselves look cool, strange new nostrils and all.\\" But according to The Washington Post, those turtles -- whether you find them to be cool or simply creepy -- don't get nearly enough screen time, and are treated more like \\"sidekicks to the actual focus of this film: summer-movie sexpot Megan Fox.\\" USA Today, which found the movie \\"charmless, dull and derivative,\\" joined the party line and conceded that \\"while there's nothing particularly playful, fun or clever about this big-screen 'Turtles' re-boot, there is some good news ... the ninja turtles are more enjoyable to watch than 'Transformers.' \\" Highlights:","completion":"- The new \\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\\" movie is considered better than \\"Transformers\\" by critics. - Michael Bay, the \\"Transformers\\" director, served as a producer on the 2014 \\"Turtles\\" adaptation. - Critics praised the adherence to the original turtles' backstory and character traits. - However, the film was criticized for lacking humor, affection, and a clear understanding of the audience. - Critics also commented on the limited screen time for the turtles, with the focus being more on Megan Fox. - Overall, the movie was considered \\"charmless, dull, and derivative,\\" but still more enjoyable to watch than \\"Transformers.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Her overbearing mother is at odds with her, arguing that Edna should choose a specific song and wardrobe for the contest. At the contest, Edna swaps dresses with a blue singer named Doris, and even changes her song at the last minute, infuriating her mother, who leaves before seeing Edna win the competition. An excited Edna decides to use her grand prize winnings to record a demo. The studio producer tactfully delivers the painful truth to Edna that not only are girl singers not getting signed, the record companies are trying to get rid of the ones currently on their rosters. However, when Edna tells him that she wrote the song, he is impressed enough to direct her to Joel Milner who takes her under his wing, renames her \\"Denise Waverly\\" and invents a blue-collar persona for her.

For now, we are classifying them as an unexplained but non-threatening phenomenon.\\" Meredith listened intently, noting how the audience reacted to Dr. Wells' words. As a fellow medical professional, her main concern was understanding these new growths and ensuring the best possible care for patients presenting with them. Dr. Wells continued, \\"With the patient's consent, our team has conducted extensive testing and analysis, including biopsies of the growth to further understand its composition and numerous imaging studies for a more comprehensive view. We've found that the growths seem to be composed of human tissue, possessing a mix of epidermal, connective, and even some nervous tissue components. In that sense, they appear to be similar to teratomas - benign tumors that often proliferate from embryonic cells.\\" Meredith considered this information. While it was reassuring to know that the growths were benign, their sudden and widespread appearance remained puzzling. Dr. Wells continued to address the crowd, delving into more specifics. \\"One aspect that we find unusual is the accelerated growth rate of these growths. They seem to grow rapidly within a short period, with some patients reporting growths that appeared in just a matter of weeks. Moreover, they appear to be painless and unresponsive to external stimuli. At this stage, we believe that there is no indication of contagiousness or transmissibility.\\" As the presentation proceeded, Meredith found herself even more captivated by the new information that Dr. Wells was sharing. It was concerning that despite several weeks, the root cause of the growths had remained elusive, evading the scrutiny of even the most brilliant medical minds. This propelled her to engage in this research initiative fully. \\"With collaboration from multiple institutions and excellent interdisciplinary communication, our efforts continue to identify potential causes, risk factors, and potential treatment or management options for patients with these growths. Though our understanding is limited, we are hopeful that further research will uncover the crucial insights needed to address this medical anomaly,\\" Dr. Wells concluded. The audience, brimming with questions, gradually began discussing amongst themselves while others approached Dr. Wells to seek more information. Meredith, equally perplexed and intrigued, decided to focus her energy on this pressing issue. She knew that the answer must lie somewhere within their collective intellect and experience, and she resolved to become an active participant in unraveling the mystery of these unexplained growths. Meredith joined the research initiative alongside Dr. Wells and other experts from around the world. They shared ideas, conducted experiments, and analyzed data at a rapid pace. As they delved further into the unknown, the world watched on with bated breath, waiting for a breakthrough in understanding and addressing these strange new growths. Despite the difficulty of the task ahead, Meredith remained optimistic in the power of scientific collaboration and determination, knowing that her work was crucial not only for the patients but also for the broader community. As each discovery and milestone brought them closer to understanding the puzzling phenomenon, the medical world eagerly anticipated the day when they could provide definitive answers and effective treatments."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Detailed Instructions: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

The word 'opposite' indicates that we need to turn backward in the specified direction. So to turn backward right, we first turn left (I_TURN_LEFT). Since it's mentioned 'twice', we need to do this action two times. - I_TURN_LEFT - I_TURN_LEFT The correct sequence of actions to execute the given command would be: - I_RUN - I_RUN - I_TURN_LEFT - I_TURN_LEFT"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Nonverbal Communication When you are in another country, it is important to know the language, but it is equally important to know how to communicate nonverbally. Before saying anything, people communicate nonverbally by making gestures. According to an investigation ,only 30 to 35 percent of our communication is verbal. When people don't know the language, the most common way to communicate is through gestures. However, many gestures have different meanings, or no meaning at all, in different parts of the world. In the United States, for example, nodding your head up and down means \\"yes\\". In some parts of Greece and Turkey, however, this motion can mean \\"no\\". In Southeast Asia, nodding your head is a polite way of saying \\"I've heard you.\\" In ancient Rome, when the emperor wanted to spare someone's life, he would put his thumb up. Today in the United States, when someone puts his/her thumb up, it means \\"Everything is all right.\\" However, in Sardinia and Greece, the gesture is insulting and should not be used there. In the United States, raising your clasped hands above your head means \\"I'm the champion\\" or \\"I'm the winner\\". It is the sign that prizefighters make when they win a fight. When a leading Russian statesman made this gesture after a White House meeting, Americans misunderstood and thought he meant he was a winner. In Russia, however, it is a sign of friendship. There are other nonverbal signals that people should be aware of when they go to another country, such as the distance to maintain between speakers. Americans stand closer to each other than English people. English people don't like touching somebody or being touched. Now in America, touch is important. For example friends touch each other on the arm. They often put an arm around a friend when they say \\"hello\\" or \\"goodbye\\".

Like all matter, electrons have properties of both particles and waves: they can collide with other particles and can be diffracted like light. The wave properties of electrons are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like neutrons and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a larger De Broglie wavelength for a given energy. - An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are very small; typical sizes are around 100 picometers (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale). - Red is the color at the longer-wavelengths end of the spectrum of visible light next to orange, at the opposite end from violet. Red color has a predominant light wavelength of roughly 620740 nanometers. Light with a longer wavelength than red but shorter than terahertz radiation and microwave is called infrared. - Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths ranging from one meter to one millimeter; with frequencies between and . This broad definition includes both UHF and EHF (millimeter wave) bands, and various sources use different boundaries. In all cases, microwaves include the entire SHF band (3 to 30 GHz, or 10 to 1 cm) at minimum, with RF engineering often restricting the range between 1 and 100 GHz (300 and 3 mm). Frequencies in the microwave range are often referred to by their IEEE radar band designations: S, C, X, K, K, or K band, or by similar NATO or EU designations. - Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time. It is also referred to as temporal frequency, which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. For example, if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its periodthe time interval between beatsis half a second (that is, 60 seconds divided by 120 beats). Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio (sound) signals, radio waves, and light. - Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects. - The human eye is an organ which reacts to light and pressure. As a sense organ, the mammalian eye allows vision. Human eyes help provide a three dimensional, moving image, normally coloured in daylight. Rod and cone cells in the retina allow conscious light perception and vision including color differentiation and the perception of depth. The human eye can differentiate between about 10 million colors and is possibly capable of detecting a single photon. - Johannes (Janne) Robert Rydberg (8 November 1854 28 December 1919) was a Swedish physicist mainly known for devising the Rydberg formula, in 1888, which is used to predict the wavelengths of photons (of light and other electromagnetic radiation) emitted by changes in the energy level of an electron in a hydrogen atom. - A hydrogen atom is an atom of the chemical element hydrogen. The electrically neutral atom contains a single positively charged proton and a single negatively charged electron bound to the nucleus by the Coulomb force. Atomic hydrogen constitutes about 75% of the elemental (baryonic) mass of the universe. - A proton is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with a positive electric charge of +1\\"e\\" elementary charge and mass slightly less than that of a neutron. Protons and neutrons, each with masses of approximately one atomic mass unit, are collectively referred to as \\"nucleons\\". One or more protons are present in the nucleus of every atom. They are a necessary part of the nucleus. The number of protons in the nucleus is the defining property of an element, and is referred to as the atomic number (represented by the symbol Z). Since each element has a unique number of protons, each element has its own unique atomic number. The word \\"proton\\" is Greek for \\"first\\", and this name was given to the hydrogen nucleus by Ernest Rutherford in 1920. In previous years, Rutherford had discovered that the hydrogen nucleus (known to be the lightest nucleus) could be extracted from the nuclei of nitrogen by atomic collisions. Protons were therefore a candidate to be a fundamental particle, and hence a building block of nitrogen and all other heavier atomic nuclei. - Hydrogen is a chemical element with chemical symbol H and atomic number 1. With an atomic weight of , hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table. Its monatomic form (H) is the most abundant chemical substance in the Universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass. Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state. The most common isotope of hydrogen, termed \\"protium\\" (name rarely used, symbol H), has one proton and no neutrons. - Johannes ( Janne ) Robert Rydberg ( November 8 , 1854 -- December 28 , 1919 ) was a Swedish physicist mainly known for devising the Rydberg formula , in 1888 , which is used to predict the wavelengths of photons ( of light and other electromagnetic radiation ) emitted by changes in the energy level of an electron in a hydrogen atom . The physical constant known as the Rydberg constant is named after him , as is the Rydberg unit . Excited atoms with very high values of the principal quantum number , represented by n in the Rydberg formula , are called Rydberg atoms . Rydberg 's anticipation that spectral studies could assist in a theoretical understanding of the atom and its chemical properties was justified in 1913 by the work of Niels Bohr ( see hydrogen spectrum ) . An important spectroscopic constant based on a hypothetical atom of infinite mass is called the Rydberg ( R ) in his honour . He was active at Lund University , Sweden , for all of his working life . The crater Rydberg on the Moon and asteroid 10506 Rydberg are named in his honour . There is a pub night held in Rydberg 's honour every Wednesday at the Department of Physics at Lund University . - Light is electromagnetic radiation within a certain portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The word usually refers to visible light, which is visible to the human eye and is responsible for the sense of sight. Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400700 nanometres (nm), or 4.00 × 10 to 7.00 × 10 m, between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths). This wavelength means a frequency range of roughly 430750 terahertz (THz). - The Pauli exclusion principle is the quantum mechanical principle that states that two or more identical fermions (particles with half-integer spin) cannot occupy the same quantum state within a quantum system simultaneously. In the case of electrons in atoms, it can be stated as follows: it is impossible for two electrons of a poly-electron atom to have the same values of the four quantum numbers: \\"n\\", the principal quantum number, ', the angular momentum quantum number, \\"m\\", the magnetic quantum number, and \\"m\\", the spin quantum number. For example, if two electrons reside in the same orbital, and if their \\"n\\", ', and \\"m\\" values are the same, then their \\"m\\" must be different, and thus the electrons must have opposite half-integer spins of 1/2 and -1/2. This principle was formulated by Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli in 1925 for electrons, and later extended to all fermions with his spin-statistics theorem of 1940. - Infrared radiation, or simply infrared or IR, is electromagnetic radiation (EMR) with longer wavelengths than those of visible light, and is therefore invisible, although it is sometimes loosely called infrared light. It extends from the nominal red edge of the visible spectrum at 700 nanometers (frequency 430 THz), to 1000000 nm (300 GHz) (although people can see infrared up to at least 1050 nm in experiments). Most of the thermal radiation emitted by objects near room temperature is infrared. Like all EMR, IR carries radiant energy, and behaves both like a wave and like its quantum particle, the photon. - In physics, energy is the property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on or to heat the object, and can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton. - Ultraviolet (UV) is an electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength from 10 nm (30 PHz) to 400 nm (750 THz), shorter than that of visible light but longer than X-rays. UV radiation constitutes about 10% of the total light output of the Sun, and is thus present in sunlight. It is also produced by electric arcs and specialized lights such as mercury-vapor lamps, tanning lamps, and black lights. Although it is not considered an ionizing radiation because its photons lack the energy to ionize atoms, long-wavelength ultraviolet radiation can cause chemical reactions and causes many substances to glow or fluoresce. Consequently, biological effects of UV are greater than simple heating effects, and many practical applications of UV radiation derive from its interactions with organic molecules. - The Rydberg formula is used in atomic physics to describe the wavelengths of spectral lines of many chemical elements. It was formulated by the Swedish physicist Johannes Rydberg, and presented on 5 November 1888.

Especially, in the state's northeast part the vegetation has been cleared in the twentieth century. Wooded areas were replaced by farm lands. All these farmlands were under heavy Irrigation. At one time, in the sixteenth century, plant species like elm and oak used to be plentiful. We still had some elms and oaks in the twentieth century, but they were not great many in number. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which century plant species in northeast Michigan were in less stress, sixteenth century or twentieth century? Hint: Groundwater salinization compromises buffering properties. Vegetation clearance, along with irrigation, causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths making them more susceptible to droughts. The answer to this question is:","completion":"In the sixteenth century, plant species in northeast Michigan were in less stress compared to the twentieth century.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person given the appointment of Professor at the Conservatoire? , can you please find it? It is not clear why, in 1873, Alkan decided to emerge from his self-imposed obscurity to give a series of six Petits Concerts at the Érard piano showrooms. It may have been associated with the developing career of Delaborde, who, returning to Paris in 1867, soon became a concert fixture, including in his recitals many works by his father, and who was at the end of 1872 given the appointment that had escaped Alkan himself, Professor at the Conservatoire. The success of the Petits Concerts led to them becoming an annual event (with occasional interruptions caused by Alkan's health) until 1880 or possibly beyond. The Petits Concerts featured music not only by Alkan but of his favourite composers from Bach onwards, played on both the piano and the pédalier, and occasionally with the participation of another instrumentalist or singer. He was assisted in these concerts by his siblings, and by other musicians including Delaborde, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Auguste Franchomme.Those encountering Alkan at this phase included the young Vincent d'Indy, who recalled Alkan's \\"skinny, hooked fingers\\" playing Bach on an Érard pedal piano: \\"I listened, riveted to the spot by the expressive, crystal-clear playing.\\" Alkan later played Beethoven's Op. 110 sonata, of which d'Indy said: \\"What happened to the great Beethovenian poem ...

If you just put them here and there after playing, it would be hard to find them when you want them again, right? The same thing applies to books. Books are like magical doors to different worlds. From dragons and knights to talking animals and mystical lands, each book has a story to tell. But when we are not reading them, they need a proper place just like your toys. That's where a bookshelf comes in! But you know what? We can't just put books on the shelf any old way. We need a smart system. First, we need to make sure all our books stand upright, kind of like soldiers standing in a line. Just imagine if your books are like little people. They need to stand on their feet, right? Placing books upright helps them stay in good shape so they can take us on many more adventures! Next, we need to group our books according to their size - just like when we pair big teddy with big truck and tiny doll with tiny teacup. This makes each shelf on our bookshelf look neat and tidy, and also keeps our smaller books from getting squished by bigger ones. Put all the tall, big books together, and then the short little ones. That also makes it easier for your small hands to reach for smaller books. Last but not least, it's important to space our books carefully.

One of the largest empires in world history, stretching over three continents, the Russian Empire was surpassed in landmass only by the British and Mongol empires. The rise of the Russian Empire happened in association with the decline of neighboring rival powers: the Swedish Empire, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, Persia and the Ottoman Empire. It played a major role in 181214 in defeating Napoleon's ambitions to control Europe, and expanded to the west and south. - Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti (Georgian: - ) is a region (Mkhare) in western Georgia which includes the historical Georgian provinces of Samegrelo (Mingrelia) and Zemo Svaneti (i.e., Upper Svaneti) and has Zugdidi as its capital.

Born in Khoni , Georgia ( then part of the Russian Empire ) , he graduated from Tbilisi State University in 1931 and attended the 1st Congress of the USSR Union of Writers , 1934 , when socialist realism was laid down as the cultural orthodoxy . From 1953 to 1967 , he chaired the Union of Georgian Writers . In 1970 , he also became a vice-president of the Georgian Academy of Sciences . In 1960 he organized an expedition to the Georgian - built Monastery of the Cross at Jerusalem where his team rediscovered a fresco of Shota Rustaveli , a medieval Georgian poet . He chaired the special academic commission for the Rustaveli studies since 1963 and became the founder and an editor - in - chief of The Georgian Soviet Encyclopedia in 1967 . His poems are viewed as classical works of Georgian literature . His poetry was mostly patriotic based on Georgian cultural and religious values , but normally loyal to Soviet ideogy . He welcomed Mikhail Gorbachev 's perestroika and supported the Soviet - era dissident Zviad Gamsakhurdia when he came to power and led Georgia to the declaration of independence in 1991 . Abashidze died in Tbilisi in 1992 and was afforded a state funeral . He was 82 . - Napoleon Bonaparte (\\"Napoléon Bonaparte\\"; , born \\"\\"Napoleone di Buonaparte\\"\\"; 15 August 1769 5 May 1821) was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the French Revolutionary Wars. As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. One of the greatest commanders in history, his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. Napoleon's political and cultural legacy has ensured his status as one of the most celebrated and controversial leaders in human history. - The Ottoman Empire ('; Modern Turkish: ' or '), also known as the Turkish Empire, Ottoman Turkey, was an empire founded at the end of the thirteenth century in northwestern Anatolia in the vicinity of Bilecik and Söüt by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman. After 1354, the Ottomans crossed into Europe, and with the conquest of the Balkans the Ottoman Beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire. The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror. - The PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, formally the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, after 1791 the Commonwealth of Poland, was a dualistic state, a bi-confederation, of Poland and Lithuania ruled by a common monarch, who was both the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania. It was one of the largest and most populous countries of 16th- and 17th-century Europe. At its peak in the early 17th century, the Commonwealth spanned some and sustained a multi-ethnic population of 11 million. The union was formalized by the Union of Lublin in July 1569, but the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were in a de-facto personal union since 1386 with the marriage of the Polish queen Hedwig and Lithuania's Grand Duke Jogaila, who was crowned King \\"jure uxoris\\" Wadysaw II Jagieo of Poland.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"In order to answer these questions, I will first gather information by researching online forums, social media, and articles that discuss the perspectives of gay men on yaoi manga. After that, I will provide a balanced perspective considering various views. Step 1: Research the topic on various platforms. - I will search for online forums and communities where gay men discuss their opinions on yaoi manga, such as Reddit r/gaymers and r/LGBT. - I will also browse social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram to identify the sentiment towards yaoi among gay men. - Lastly, I will look for articles and blog posts that provide insights or opinions from gay men regarding yaoi manga. Step 2: Analyze the gathered information - I will carefully analyze the gathered information, taking note of any recurring opinions or common criticisms. I will ensure to address both positive and negative views on the subject. Step 3: Summarize the findings Based on my research, opinions of gay men on yaoi manga vary. Some gay men enjoy yaoi manga and appreciate the fact that it celebrates same-sex relationships. They may find it entertaining and relatable to their own experiences as a form of escapism. However, other gay men might not appreciate yaoi manga due to its portrayal of same-sex relationships, which is often created by and for straight women. It can reinforce harmful stereotypes or misrepresent what it means to be gay, as it is sometimes highly fantasized and might not be an accurate representation of the struggles or experiences of real gay men. Now, to answer if these questions are the same: The first question asks for a reaction of gay men to yaoi manga, which means how they feel about it when they come across yaoi. The second question is about what gay men think of yaoi in general, which could encompass not just a reaction, but also a deeper understanding of their stance toward yaoi, whether positive, negative, or neutral.

I just kept asking, 'what is ricin? What did I do?'\\" Curtis' attorney, Christi McCoy, said her client has been framed by someone who used several phrases Curtis likes to use on social media. The letters read, in part: \\"To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance.\\" They were signed \\"I am KC and I approve this message,\\" a source told CNN. They each had a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address. McCoy said she was sure someone else was to blame. \\"I do believe that someone who was familiar and is familiar with Kevin just simply took his personal information and did this to him,\\" McCoy said. \\"It is absolutely horrific that someone would do this.\\" Curtis said it was an eye-opener for him. \\"I think now, how many people are thrown in jail because of circumstantial evidence and someone can frame you that easily,\\" he said. Curtis had been accused of sending letters containing \\"a suspicious granular substance\\" to Obama; Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi; and Sadie Holland, a Justice Court judge in Lee County, Mississippi. The FBI said the substance tested positive for ricin, a toxin derived from castor beans that has no known antidote. No illnesses had been found as a result of exposure to the toxin. ||||| Law enforcement officials searched the home of a second Mississippi man in connection to ricin-laced letters sent to the president and a U.S. senator after charges were dropped without explanation against a man arrested in the case last week.

(Associated Press) Federal agents wearing hazmat suits inspect the grounds around the house owned by Everett Dutschke, in connection with the recent ricin attacks, as one of his dogs howls Tuesday, April 23, 2013 in Tupelo,... (Associated Press) Everett Dutschke, whose Tupelo, Miss., home was searched Tuesday by dozens of officials, some in hazmat suits, had feuded with Paul Kevin Curtis, a 45-year-old celebrity impersonator who had maintained his innocence since his arrest. The search began early Tuesday afternoon and ended about 11 p.m. CDT, with officials declining to comment on what they had found or on the next phase of the investigation. At one point, two FBI agents and two members of the state's chemical response team left Dutschke's property and began combing through ditches, culverts and woods about a block away from his house in the neighborhood of single-family detached homes. Dutschke, who spoke with The Associated Press by telephone during the search, said his house was also searched last week. \\"I don't know how much more of this I can take,\\" he said. No charges have been filed against Dutschke and he hasn't been arrested. Both he and Curtis, who had faced charges in the case, say they have no idea how to make the poisonous ricin and had nothing to do with sending the letters to President Barack Obama, U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi and a state judge. Referring to investigators' questions for him about the case, Curtis said after he was released from custody Tuesday afternoon, \\"I thought they said rice and I said, 'I don't even eat rice.' ... I respect President Obama. I love my country and would never do anything to pose a threat to him or any other U.S. official.\\" A one-sentence document filed by federal prosecutors said charges against Curtis were dropped, but left open the possibility they could be reinstated if authorities found more to prove their case. Prosecutors were not immediately available for comment. Since Curtis' arrest at his Corinth, Miss., home on April 17, his attorneys have said their client didn't do it and suggested he was framed. An FBI agent testified in court this week that no evidence of ricin was found in searches of Curtis' home. The dismissal is the latest twist in a case that has been strange from the beginning and rattled the country during the same week as the Boston Marathon bombing and a fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas. Dutschke (DUHST'-kee) and Curtis are no strangers to each other. Dutschke said the two had a disagreement and the last contact they had was in 2010. Dutschke said he threatened to sue Curtis for saying he was a member of Mensa, a group for people with high IQs. Hal Neilson, an attorney for Curtis, said the defense gave authorities a list of people who may have had a reason to hurt Curtis. \\"Dutschke came up,\\" he said. \\"They (prosecutors) took it and ran with it. I could not tell you if he's the man or he's not the man, but there was something there they wanted to look into.\\" An FBI intelligence bulletin obtained by the AP said the two ricin-laced letters addressed to Obama and Wicker said: \\"To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance.\\" Both were signed, \\"I am KC and I approve this message.\\" Curtis was already well known to Wicker because he had written to the Republican senator and other officials. Curtis also wrote a novel called \\"Missing Pieces,\\" about black-market body parts he claimed to have found while working at a hospital _ a claim the hospital says is untrue. Curtis posted similar language on his Facebook page and elsewhere. The documents indicate Curtis had been distrustful of the government for years. He told the AP on Tuesday that he realizes his writings made him an easy target. Multiple online posts under the name Kevin Curtis on various websites that could be seen by anyone refer to the conspiracy he claimed to uncover when working at a local hospital from 1998 to 2000. In one post, Curtis said he sent letters to Wicker and other politicians. He signed off: \\"This is Kevin Curtis & I approve this message.\\" Christi McCoy, another attorney for Curtis, said she doesn't know what new information prosecutors have, but said the plot to frame her client was \\"very, very diabolical.\\" Curtis, dressed after his release Tuesday in a black suit, red shirt, necktie and sunglasses, said he met Dutschke in 2005 but that for some reason Dutschke \\"hated\\" and \\"stalked\\" him. \\"To this day I have no clue of why he hates me.\\" Ricin is derived from the castor plant that makes castor oil. There is no antidote and it is at its deadliest when inhaled. It can be aerosolized, released into the air and inhaled. The Homeland Security handbook says the amount of ricin that fits on the head of a pin is enough to kill an adult if properly prepared. Dutschke said agents asked him about Curtis, whether Dutschke would take a lie-detector test and if he had ever bought castor beans, which can be used to make the potent poison. \\"I'm a patriotic American. I don't have any grudges against anybody. I did not send the letters,\\" said Dutschke, who was a Republican candidate for the Mississippi House of Representatives in 2007 but lost. After charges were dropped against Curtis, he said: \\"I'm a little shocked.\\" Dutschke said his attorney wasn't with him and he didn't know whether he was going to be arrested. Tuesday's events began when the third day of a preliminary and detention hearing was canceled without officials explaining the change. Within two hours, Curtis had been released, though it wasn't clear why at first. FBI Agent Brandon Grant said in court Monday that searches last week of Curtis' vehicle and house in Corinth, found no ricin, ingredients for the poison, or devices used to make it. A search of Curtis' computers found no evidence he researched making ricin. Authorities produced no other physical evidence at the hearings tying Curtis to the letters. All the envelopes and stamps were self-adhesive, Grant said Monday, meaning they won't yield DNA evidence. One fingerprint was found on the letter sent to a Lee County judge, but the FBI doesn't know who it belongs to, Grant said. The experience, Curtis said, has been a nightmare for his family. He has four children _ ages, 8, 16, 18 and 20. It also has made him reflect deeply on his life. \\"I've become closer to God through all this, closer with my children and I've even had some strained relationships with some family and cousins and this has brought us closer as a family,\\" he said. ___ Wagster Pettus reported from Jackson.

James is driving down the street in his town. For some reason today hes very curious about the things that he sees. He looks around as hes driving and the street lights catch his attention. He realizes that he's never seen someone changing the bulbs in a street light. He also wonders if its a film on the light that makes them have that color or something inside. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Given a vapor light and a regular light bulb, which one is more energy efficient, the vapor light or the regular light bulb? Hint: A vapor light produces visible light by electroluminescence. The bulb contains a small amount of solid sodium or mercury as well as a mixture of neon and argon gases. When an electric current passes through the gases, it causes the solid sodium or mercury to change to a gas and emit visible light. Sodium vapor lights, like these streetlights, produce yellowish light. Mercury vapor lights produce bluish light. Vapor lights are very bright and energy efficient. The bulbs are also long lasting. The answer to this question is:","completion":"the vapor light. According to the information provided, vapor lights, including sodium and mercury vapor lights, are very bright and energy efficient. They also have the added benefit of being long lasting. To justify the step, let's understand how both types of lights work: 1. Traditional incandescent light bulbs work by heating a tiny metal filament to create light, which makes them less energy efficient as they waste a lot of energy in the form of heat. 2. On the other hand, vapor lights, as described in the paragraph, work by electroluminescence. They involve an electric current passing through a gas, which causes the solid sodium or mercury to change to a gas and emit visible light. This is a more energy-efficient process than in traditional bulbs. So, given the choice between a vapor light and a regular light bulb, it's clear that the more energy-efficient option is the vapor light."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: How Often Do Most Couples Have Sex? As a sexual health doctor, this is the number one question I hear. But it’s not the whole story. By Dr. Harry Fisch The number one question I’m asked about sex: how often is normal? The average man has eleven erections every day (including partial erections). Teenage boys and men in their twenties with high hormonal levels might think it’s totally normal to have sex several times a day. But in my experience, I’d say that the typical average is two to three times a week. That was also the figure in the American Sexual Behavior Study, a 2006 survey reporting that the average frequency of sex for married couples went from about once every two-three days for couples between the ages of eighteen and twenty-nine, to about twice a week for couples between 30 and 50, and less than once a week for older couples. Couples of any age in the early phase of a love relationship tend to have a lot of sex—daily if not more frequently. But the frequency of sex declines as any relationship ages, although married couples have more sex than those who are single. Obviously, regular access to sex makes it more likely to happen! Remember, these are averages. Some couples are happy with more frequent sex, some happy with less frequent sex. If you only feel like having sex once or twice a week but find those encounters deeply satisfying, that’s normal for you and that’s totally fine. Not wanting any sex at all is not. And that’s really the point: not how much sex you’re having, but whether you and your partner are happy with the sex you are having. Quality wins out over quantity every time. It’s all about the satisfaction. That said, quality sex isn’t just about frequency. It’s also about the length of the sex act. There have been studies in which couples consented to be scientifically observed having sex, and one of the observers timed each session with a stopwatch to make a fairly accurate assessment about the length of the coupling. Not surprisingly, there is an extremely large variation in the time it takes a couple to have sex, ranging from the excessively short (about two minutes or less, which famed sex researcher Alfred Kinsey dryly noted was a “frequent source of marital conflict”) to the “Are you done yet?” (over forty minutes). An astonishing 45 percent of men finish the sex act too quickly, which is to say, within Kinsey’s conflicted two minutes. That’s pretty speedy. Way too speedy for the average woman to be able to have an orgasm through vaginal penetration alone. At least five minutes, and more like seven, is usually what’s needed for a woman to be able to achieve orgasm. And even though the average length of the average inter-vaginal sex session is about 7.3 minutes, that’s still not particularly long, especially for women who usually take much longer than men to become aroused enough to have an orgasm. So if your man is done within two minutes of things getting hot and heavy—or still not done 40 minutes later—you may want to gently broach the idea of getting a medical checkup to make sure everything’s functioning correctly. And don’t worry: As I discuss in The New Naked, if 7.3 minutes doesn’t seem like enough time for you to get the satisfaction you need, you and your partner can learn to express what you do need or want, so you both can be happy in bed and out.

Further, participants reported the duration of foreplay and intercourse that they felt most men and most women wanted. Ideal length of foreplay did not differ for men and women. However, men reported a significantly longer ideal duration of intercourse than did their partners. The ideal duration of foreplay and intercourse were significantly longer than the actual duration for both genders. The women, but not the men, significantly underestimated their partners' desired duration of foreplay and intercourse. Further, both genders exhibited faulty stereotypes concerning men's but not women's ideal scripts. Men were seen as desiring a significantly shorter duration of foreplay and intercourse than the ideal reported by the men in the study. Both men's and women's perceptions of their partners' ideal duration of foreplay and intercourse were found to be more strongly related to their own sexual stereotypes than to their partners' self-reported sexual desires, suggesting that people rely on sexual stereotypes when estimating their partners' ideal sexual scripts. Men's and women's ideal scripts and men's and women's sexual stereotypes concerning the opposite gender's ideal duration of foreplay were found to uniquely predict the foreplay performance script. For intercourse, men's and women's ideal scripts and men's stereotypes concerning the duration of intercourse that women want uniquely predicated the performance script. We present potential reasons for the discrepancy in individuals' performance and ideal scripts. ||||| In a piece on Nerve.com, Harry Fisch, author of the new book The New Naked: The Ultimate Sex Education for Grown-Ups, reports that “an astonishing 45 percent of men finish the sex act too quickly.” How quickly? Within two minutes, according to Fisch. This would seem to be bad news for those men's partners and good news for the posthumous reputation of sex researcher Alfred Kinsey, whose research in the 1940s and 1950s concluded that three-quarters of men usually ejaculated within two minutes. Before you conclude that Fisch's data simply represents more evidence of a male-dominated society's inherent pleasure inequality, it's worth noting that more recent scholars have looked into the question of what the different sexes actually think about it. As it happens, men may be more bothered by it than women. For a 2004 paper in the Journal of Sex Research, University of New Brunswick researchers S. Andrea Miller and E. Sandra Byers interviewed 152 heterosexual couples on their “actual and desired duration of foreplay and of intercourse.” Their subjects spanned a wide range of ages—21 to 77 years old—and relationship type—from 6-month to 50-year partnerships. Miller and Byers found that men reported a much longer ideal duration than did their partners. It's true that for both sexes, the “ideal” length of both foreplay and intercourse was much longer than the actual. But the New Brunswick results at least suggest that the men are not happy with this status quo. Fisch also points out that two minutes is “way too speedy for the average woman to be able to have an orgasm through vaginal penetration alone.” But an even older piece of research suggests that link might not be quite so clear. In a 1951 paper in the Journal of Psychology, “Correlates of orgasm adequacy in a group of 556 wives,” psychologist Lewis Terman found no significant correlation between intercourse duration and female “orgasm adequacy.” Alas, the concept of speed has not fared as well in more recent research. In a 2009 paper in The Journal of Sexual Medicine, Czech psychologists Petr Weiss and Stuart Brody found, based on surveys with 2,360 Czech women, that women’s chance of having an orgasm was much more highly correlated with duration of sex than of foreplay. ||||| Where do men last the longest?

Spreadsheets, an app which measures the 'duration, thrusts, and decibel peak' of a couple's sexual rhythm, looked at the statistics of 10,000 of its users (map courtesy of Nerve) According to the 2009 study Canadian and American Sex Therapists' Perceptions of Normal and Abnormal Ejaculatory Latencies: How Long Should Intercourse Last?, intercourse lasts anywhere from three to seven minutes on average. 'Very few people have intercourse per se [Latin for by thrust] that goes longer than 12 minutes,' explained sex therapist Barry W. McCarthy, adding that premature ejaculation refers to intercourse that lasts less than a minute or two. 'Very few people have intercourse that goes longer than 12 minutes' The Spreadsheets app, which launched in August last year, aims to help couples measure their pleasure using the accelerometer and microphone in their smartphone to time how long sex lasts, while monitoring both the speed and 'thrust' frequency, as well as the amount of noise created during sex. Users can unlock 30 'achievements ' while using the app, which is a points system enabling couples to set challenges for themselves. A session of early morning sex gets ten points, while a lazy Sunday session earns 20, for example.

Study leader Dr. Antonio Pastore of the Sapienza University of Rome said the study involved a group of 40 men ages 19 to 46 who had premature ejaculation -- defined as “ejaculation within a minute,\\" who had tried a variety of therapies, without any significant improvement. During the 12-week study period, the men were trained to exercise their pelvic floor muscles and their time-to-orgasm was measured. The study, presented at the European Congress of Urology in Stockholm, found at the start of the trial the average ejaculation time was 31.7 seconds, but by the end of the 12-weeks of pelvic floor exercises this had risen to 146.2 seconds -- a more than four-fold increase. “ This is a small study, so the effects need to be verified in a bigger trial. Nevertheless, the results are very positive. The rehabilitation exercises are easy to perform, with no reported adverse effects,\\" Pastore said in a statement. \\"Previously the men in the trial had tried a variety of treatments, including creams, behavioral therapy, antidepressants and psychological treatments -- with little success. However, we found that 33 of the 40 men in our trial improved their ejaculation time within 12 weeks. We also found that the fact that the men were able to improve their sex-lives through their own efforts helped their self-confidence.\\" [European Congress of Urology] |||||","completion":"This article provides insights into the average frequency of sexual intercourse for couples and the importance of quality over quantity. According to the data cited by Dr. Harry Fisch, the average frequency of sex for couples varies based on their age, with younger couples (eighteen to twenty-nine years old) having sex about once every two-three days, those between thirty and fifty engaging about twice a week and older couples having sex less than once a week. Relationship longevity also affects frequency, with newer couples having more sex than those who have been together longer. Beyond frequency, the article addresses the length of sexual intercourse and orgasm satisfaction. Dr. Fisch claims that an astonishing 45 percent of men may finish too quickly (within two minutes), often too soon for a woman to achieve orgasm. Many women take longer than men to become aroused enough to orgasm, typically needing at least five to seven minutes. Another study detailed in the article reports on the perceived pleasure inequality between men and women. It found that men may be more bothered than women about their performance time. Men reported a longer \\"ideal\\" duration than their partners, which suggests dissatisfaction with the status quo. The piece also provides information from an app measuring the duration, thrusts, and decibel peak of a couple's sexual rhythm. This data presents an overview of the average intercourse time across different states in the US, indicating a wide range. Lastly, the article presents some treatment options for men suffering from premature ejaculation, such as a 12-week pelvic floor exercises program. The program was found to increase the ejaculation time from an average of 31.7 seconds to 146.2 seconds, demonstrating a more than four-fold increase, and helping improve self-confidence. The findings need to be validated in larger studies. These statistics and studies highlight that what is average or ideal varies widely among individuals and couples, and what matters most is their sense of satisfaction and fulfillment, not the absolute numbers or comparisons with others."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Exhibitions The Soap Lady The Soap Lady is the name given to a woman whose body was exhumed in Philadelphia in 1875. The specimen is unique because a fatty substance called adipocere encases the remains. Adipocere formation is not common, but it may form in alkaline, warm, airless environments, such as the one in which the Soap Lady was buried. The first X-rays taken of the Soap Lady in 1986 revealed buttons and pins on her clothing that that were not manufactured in the United States until the 1830s. Dr. Joseph Leidy, known as the father of American vertebrate paleontology, procured the body of the Soap Lady after she was exhumed at a Philadelphia cemetery. He originally reported that she died in the Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic of the 1790s. Based on her lack of teeth, Leidy assumed that she had died in middle or old age. The first X-rays taken of the Soap Lady in 1987 revealed buttons and pins on her clothing that that were not manufactured in the United States until the 1830s. Leidy was wrong about her year of death. A radiology team from Quinnipiac University led by Jerry Conlogue and Ron Beckett made a new set of digital and print X-rays in 2007. These images have allowed us to revise the Soap Lady’s age at death from about 40 to significantly younger, perhaps in her late 20s. ||||| FILE – This July 12, 1999, file photo shows a portion of the two floors of the Mutter Museum, a medical museum in Philadelphia.

Australian politician Lynda Voltz is pushing for the Mutter Museum to return... (Associated Press) PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A Philadelphia medical museum said Tuesday it will return the skull of an Australian soldier who was killed in World War I to the Australian Army. A military attache for the Australian Embassy will meet with Mutter Museum officials in the coming weeks to take the skull, the museum said in a statement. \\"We can appreciate the position of, and are sympathetic to, the mission of the Australian Army,\\" said Robert Hicks, the museum's director. \\"The recovery of remains of soldiers who were lost in combat or died as prisoners of war is vital work.\\" The remains are those of 27-year-old Pvt. Thomas Hurdis, of New South Wales, according to a statement from Brig. Shane Gabriel, the military attache. The announcement came on 100th anniversary of the soldier's death. Hurdis was wounded at the Battle of Polygon Wood, near Ypres, Belgium, on Sept. 28, 1917. His injuries included a bullet that is lodged and still visible near the left eye socket. He was treated by a Philadelphia ophthalmologist in France. Five days after he was wounded, a disoriented Hurdis pulled off his bandages and bled to death. Australian politician Linda Voltz has been pushing for the skull's return. \\"Many families never knew the fate of their sons. The fact this soldier's remains were sitting in a museum after such a horrific death, where the head has obviously been separated from the body, is appalling,\\" she said in emailed comments over the weekend. She didn't immediately return a message seeking comment about Tuesday's announcement. The skull was given to the museum in 1919 by the British government, supervised by the British Medical Services, the museum said. It was part of a collection intended for study by military doctors conducting reconstructive surgery on soldiers. The museum said it hadn't been displayed in years. The museum said it was contacted by the Australian Army in August about the skull. The controversy was first reported last week by The Guardian newspaper. The Mutter is known for its collection of organs preserved in jars, deformed skeletons and lifelike wax casts of shocking medical maladies. It was founded in 1863 by The College of Physicians, which still operates it. The stated mission of the museum is to help the public \\"understand the mysteries and beauty of the human body and to appreciate the history of diagnosis and treatment of disease.\\" Exhibits include an 8-foot-long (2.4-meter-long) human colon, the body of a woman who essentially turned to soap, slides of Albert Einstein's brain and a tumor removed from President Grover Cleveland. ___ This story has been corrected to show the announcement came on the 100th anniversary of the soldier's death, not days before the anniversary. ||||| Australia likes to refer to its battlefield dead, especially in the first and second world wars, as “the fallen” whose bodies, if found, were “laid to rest” in picturesque, peaceful cemeteries of blonde statuary and rosemary bush. Our politicians invest significantly in commemorating them (some 600m-plus alone for first world war centenary events), and into finding, identifying and reburying those whose bodies the mud may surrender many decades later. Making war illegal changed the world. But it’s becoming too easy to break the law Read more So it is surprising to find the skull of a first world war Australian Anzac soldier, replete with the shocking facial injuries that killed him a century ago this week, featured online in an American medical museum’s grisly collection of sometimes freakish exhibits. The skull, part of the collection of the Mütter Museum at the College of Physicians in Philadelphia, tells a shocking and tragic story of battlefield violence and intolerable physical suffering that official commemoration – with its almost ecclesiastical language of the fighting Anzac “spirit, the “fallen” and their “sacrifice” – all too often overlooks. On 28 September 1917, the Anzac was shot in the mouth during the Battle of Polygon Wood (known also as the Third Ypres, part of the Battle of Passchendaele) in Belgium, and his right jaw destroyed by shrapnel while another bullet – still visible in his skull – struck his left sinus. The museum’s explainer reads: This Australian soldier’s skull has extensive damage caused by bullet wounds sustained in the Battle of Passchendale (or Third Ypres, Battle of Polygon Wood) in the First World War. He was shot on September 28, 1917. Most of the damage was caused by a lead bullet that entered the mouth and passed through the palate and right eye. Shrapnel destroyed the ascending ramus of the right jaw, and another bullet, visible here, struck the left frontal sinus. Philadelphia opthalmologist and surgeon WT Shoemaker treated this soldier at a battlefield hospital in France. This soldier survived his initial injuries and treatments. But, five days after his injuries, blind and disoriented, he pulled out the bandage materials in his mouth that packed the wounds. He bled to death. It says Shoemaker donated the “Adult skull with ballistic trauma” to the museum in 1917, making possible an inference, of course, that the opthalmologist removed the head from the battlefield hospital. It’s hard to imagine what, if any, consent was involved. Click on the icon reading “OUCH” and the illustration highlights the shrapnel damage to the soldier’s jaw, or, on the one reading “THE END”, to see a close up of the hole in his cheek that had been packed with bandage. “Pulling out the material that packed this space is what killed our soldier,” it explains. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Mutter Museum The Anzac skull certainly tells a story of a terrible battlefield death. But as is so often the way when human remains become institutional collection items, it is stripped of human identity and past beyond the moments of injury and death. It is objectified by death, not what life – rich and interesting or otherwise – preceded it. And, so, unfortunately, we know precious little about who this Anzac is. We don’t have his name or know who his family is or where he came from. Was he Indigenous or white? Even had he contemplated dying in war (what soldier who volunteers to go off and fight does not?) could he ever have imagined that his head would become a museum collection item and an object of popular curiosity? If the Mütter Museum knows any of this, it is not letting on. Despite my repeated requests, the museum has not detailed how: it acquired the Australian’s head; whether the rest of his body is in the museum or buried in a war cemetery; if the museum is privy to the dead man’s identity and whether the skull has been on temporary or permanent public display. It is, in fact, likely that the rest of the body is buried at either Polygon Wood Cemetery or the nearby Buttes New British Cemetery. In the past decade the bodies of several Anzacs who died in fighting around Polygon Wood have been unearthed on local properties. Several have been identified using DNA techniques. All have been officially re-buried with either “known unto God” headstones or memorials bearing their re-established identities. It is understood that the Australian Army’s office of Unrecovered War Casualties – which is mandated with recovering and identifying unaccounted for military personnel, is aware of the Mütter Museum’s Anzac skull and is making inquiries, possibly through the Australian Embassy in Washington. Mütter describes itself as “America’s finest museum of medical history” which “displays its beautifully preserved collections of anatomical specimens, models, and medical instruments in a 19th-century ‘cabinet museum’ setting. The museum helps the public understand the mysteries and beauty of the human body and to appreciate the history of diagnosis and treatment of disease”. The Anzac skull is part of a collection that also includes “the soap lady” (a body exhumed in Philadelphia in 1875), Albert Einstein’s brain, Dr Joseph Hyrtl’s human skull collection, a plaster cast and the conjoined liver of “Siamese twins” Chang and Eng Bunker, the jaw tumour of President Grover Cleveland, and hundreds of body parts that illustrate disease and terrible war injuries. The fourth and fifth divisions of the Australian Imperial Force suffered more than 5,700 casualties at the Battle of Polygon Wood, which began on 26 September 1917. It was the most devastating year of the war for the AIF; 12,000 Australians died in the extended battle of Passchendaele alone and 30,000, mostly on the western front, for the year. From a population of less than 5 million in 1914, some 324,000 Australians enlisted and served overseas, and 61,720 died. Most are buried in official war graves close to the battlefields or field hospitals where they died. But tragically some 18,000 who died on the European western front were either never found or could not be identified at death. The Anzac whose skull is displayed by Mütter would be ranked with the missing even though the museum might well be in a position to help name him due to the medical and personnel records that would have formed part of his battlefield treatment. Australia's Anzac carnival of commemoration leaves some things not talked about Read more Meanwhile, the display of the skull is anomalous with official Australian policies to remove from public display and repatriate human remains (overwhelmingly belonging to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ancestors) that are held by foreign collecting institutions – mostly museums and medical schools. The National Museum of Australia has the remains of about 500 individuals that it has repatriated to Australia from foreign institutions but, for various reasons mostly to do with unestablished identity, has been unable to return to country. The South Australian Museum, which has the largest collection of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander material culture in the world, holds the remains of several thousand Indigenous people. The government has dedicated minimal resources and energy to the identification and repatriation of Indigenous remains, however. As Australia prepares to commemorate the AIF’s actions at Passchendaele and Polygon Wood this week, the official response to the Mütter Anzac skull display will, therefore, be most illuminating. ||||| \\"I'm really pleased to hear that, on the centenary of his death, Australian authorities have confirmed that the skull is that of Thomas Hurdis and that the museum is to return it,\\" said John Hartley, a military historian and member of the forum. \\"The right thing has been done here and we can look forward to Thomas' skull being buried, along with the rest of his remains, at the Commonwealth War Graves cemetery in Le Treport, France. I hope to pay my respects to this brave man during a battlefields trip next spring.\\" ||||| Return of remains of Thomas Hurdis, who died a century ago, comes after outcry over grisly display An American medical museum has agreed to hand over to Australian authorities for burial the skull of a world war one Anzac servicemen who died of horrendous facial wounds a century ago. The Mütter Museum of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia confirmed in a statement it would hand over the skull, which has been independently established to be that of Private Thomas Hurdis of the 59th Battalion Australian Imperial Force who died on 3 October 1917. Controversy over the skull erupted last month after the Guardian reported it was on display at the museum, complete with a grisly description of the wounds that had killed Private Hurdis. The Anzac skull that tells a shocking and tragic story of battlefield violence | Paul Daley Read more In the statement Mütter said the Australian army first contacted it about the skull in August. This is when the Guardian first approached the museum with questions about the provenance – and human identity – of the skull. The museum removed the skull from display last week after the military attache at the Australian embassy in Washington contacted the institution stressing the need to repatriate the remains of missing soldiers. In a letter to the museum, the attache wrote: “The repatriation and interment of Private Hurdis’ skull is consistent with our ongoing efforts to recover, identify and formally inter human remains of our fallen from all conflicts, notwithstanding our affirmative recognition that the accession, stewardship and use of the skull is entirely consistent with the applicable laws and protocols.” The museum said in its statement that the skull “was given to the museum in 1919 by the British government, supervised by the British Medical Services. The skull was given as part of a collection intended for study by military doctors conducting reconstructive surgery on soldiers”. However, in an explainer about the skull, since removed from the museum’s website, Mütter had said the skull was donated in 1917 by Philadelphia ophthalmologist WT Shoemaker who treated Hurdis’s wounds at an American military hospital in France. The explainer read: “This Australian soldier’s skull has extensive damage caused by bullet wounds sustained in the Battle of Passchendaele (or Third Ypres, Battle of Polygon Wood) in the first world war. He was shot on 28 September 1917. Most of the damage was caused by a lead bullet that entered the mouth and passed through the palate and right eye. Shrapnel destroyed the ascending ramus of the right jaw, and another bullet, visible here, struck the left frontal sinus. “Philadelphia ophthalmologist and surgeon WT Shoemaker treated this soldier at a battlefield hospital in France. This soldier survived his initial injuries and treatments. But, five days after his injuries, blind and disoriented, he pulled out the bandage materials in his mouth that packed the wounds. He bled to death.” The rest of Hurdis’s remains are buried at Mont Huon military cemetery in Le Tréport, France, where his skull will soon be buried too. The Mütter director, Robert Hicks, said: “We can appreciate the position of, and are sympathetic to, the mission of the Australian army. The recovery of remains of soldiers who were lost in combat or died as prisoners of war is vital work. “The Mütter Museum observes a high standard of care and respect regarding human remains, and our observances of relevant laws and protocols is consistent with best practice in United States museums.” US museum under fire over display of skull of Australian soldier Read more Private Hurdis’s brother John, also an AIF soldier, went missing in the Battle of Fromelles in 1916. It is possible DNA from the skull could be used to identify his body if it is among more than 100 that have been found in mass graves but cannot be personally identified. The American and British armies have a long-established practice of allowing the collection of human medical samples without permission from the relevant soldiers or their families for medical education purposes providing the individuals from whom they were taken were not identified. Through a simple triangulation of Australian military records, however, it was possible to easily identify the skull in the Mütter collection as being that of Private Thomas Hurdis, who lived in Sydney’s inner west before he volunteered to fight. |||||Summary:","completion":"The Mütter Museum in Philadelphia has agreed to return the skull of an Australian soldier who died during World War I to Australian authorities for burial.

Question: What are the sections of the organ in a person's head that are concerned with sentimental experiences and are named after the Greek word for sea horse? Context: Emotions are thought to be related to certain activities in brain areas that direct our attention, motivate our behavior, and determine the significance of what is going on around us. Pioneering work by Broca (1878), Papez (1937), and MacLean (1952) suggested that emotion is related to a group of structures in the center of the brain called the limbic system, which includes the hypothalamus, cingulate cortex, hippocampi, and other structures. More recent research has shown that some of these limbic structures are not as directly related to emotion as others are while some non-limbic structures have been found to be of greater emotional relevance.

He told BBC Radio Bristol: \\"Sam attracts media attention, we can handle it, we laugh about it at times.

As a prominent figure in space mission history, his contributions to NASA and his impact on space exploration are truly remarkable. His journey began with strengthening his academic foundation at AFIT (Air Force Institute of Technology), where he received his M.S. in 1962. Being a fighter pilot, he demonstrated extraordinary mastery and prowess which paved the way to his pivotal role in the groundbreaking Apollo 8 mission. His professional aptitude led him to serve under NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which is responsible for the civilian space program as well as for aeronautics and aerospace research in the United States. In retrospect, Apollo 8 was a seminal mission that played a pivotal role in the history of NASA's space explorations. Apollo 8 was the second human spaceflight mission carried out by NASA as part of the Apollo program and was launched on December 21, 1968. Among the key crew members of Apollo 8 was Frank Borman, who like Anders had devoted his life to the pursuit of space exploration and the understanding of outer space. The Apollo 8 spaceflight is particularly noteworthy as it was the first mission to carry humans beyond low Earth orbit, reach the Moon, orbit it, and safely return. Within this historical context, William Anders was an indomitable figure whose contributions were essential to the operation's success, and furthermore, to the developments in following space explorations. Interestingly, the backup pilot for the Apollo 8 mission was none other than Buzz Aldrin, another illustrious name in the history of manned space flights. Aldrin is famously known for his contribution to the Apollo 11 mission, where he became the second man to walk on the Moon.

Instructions: In this task, you will be shown a prompt from a judicial decision and multiple holding statements derived from citations following text in a legal decision. Holdings represent the governing legal rule when the law is applied to a particular set of facts. There are five answer choices for each citing text. The correct answer is the holding statement that corresponds to the citing text. The four incorrect answers are other holding statements. You should find the correct option. There is a <HOLDING> token in the position of the citing text prompt where the holding statement was extracted. Input: the alleged negligence of an independent contractor. More specifically, GET argues that tour operators are not liable for the negligence of providers of transportation services. Corby, 1990 WL 488464 at 3. GET also cites numerous out-of-state cases which hold that tour operators are not liable for the negligence of third party suppliers of Grand European Inbound’s safety because GET made an inquiry into the reliability of GEI, and used it without incident for more that 10 years before Ramage’s alleged accident. B. Plaintiffs Opposition First, Ramage claims that waiver of defendant GET’s liability is contrary to public policy, and thus unenforceable and void. See Cal.Civ.Code § 1790.1. Ramage contends that he was not put on sufficient n Cal.App.3d 237, 240, 142 Cal.Rptr. 570 (1967) (<HOLDING>).

Question: The future of written English will owe more to Hollywood films than Dickens or Shakespeare, if the findings of a study into children's writing are anything to go by. Researchers who looked at the entries to a national competition found they were increasingly using Americanisms such as garbage, trash can, sidewalk, candy, sneakers, soda, and flashlight. The stories, written by pupils aged 7 to 13, show how fairy cakes are referred to as cupcakes and a dinner jacket has become a tuxedo. \\"Smart\\" is now often used for \\"clever\\" and \\"cranky\\" for \\"irritable\\". Television also has a powerful influence on children's work, with Lady Gaga and Argentinean footballer Lionel Messi among the famous names from TV cropping up repeatedly. But pupils are let down by basic spelling, punctuation and grammar, according to the study by Oxford University Press (OUP), which looked at the entries to BBC Radio Two's \\"500 Words\\" competition. Children struggled to correctly spell simple words such as \\"does\\" and \\"clothes\\" and often failed to use the past tense correctly, frequently writing \\"rised\\" instead of \\"rose\\" or \\"thinked\\" instead of \\"thought\\". Researchers also found that punctuation was underused, especially semi-colons and speech marks. Some did not know how to use capital letters. However, exclamation marks were overused. Researchers found 35,171 examples in total, with some young writers using five at a time! Popular US fiction such as the Twilight novels and films is thought to be fueling the increasing use of American vocabulary and spelling. Meanwhile, fears that texting was spoiling children's written work were unfounded, they said, with youngsters only using text language when they were referring to a text message. Samantha Armstrong from OUP said: \\"Perhaps we are catching a glimpse of the language of the future.\\" Chris Evans, whose radio show runs the competition, said the results were \\"fascinating\\", adding: \\"Who'd have thought that Messi and Gaga would be some of the most used names?\\" The passage is intended to _ .

Context: Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that wherever possible I use organic bodycare products, and that I simply adore the organic brand Botanicals. A British brand whose aim is to create products ‘which are as close to nature as possible’, their bodycare and skincare is simply second to none and they’re certified by The Soil Association. Over the past couple of years I’ve tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven’t found anything that I don’t like yet! This month I’ve been trying their Deep Peace Aromatic Body Oil which arrived with me just at the right time – my husband had man flu, I had a cold and I was looking after our 16 month old toddler alone. Deep Peace was just what my body was craving! I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift. This Aromatic Massage Oil is 99% organic and the ingredients include Lavender, Rose Geranium and Orange Peel oils. The fragrance is very subtle and perfect if you don’t like products that smell overpowering. It’s a bit ‘planty’, I think it’s the scent of the Rose Geranium that comes through the most, and personally I don’t absolutely love the fragrance, but it’s pleasant enough and it does help the head to feel calmed (even when nursing a husband with man flu!). Question: After trying the Aromatic Massage Oil, how does the author feel about the scents overall? Answer: Pick your answer from: [A].

If your pilot is forced to turn back only for his lack of passing a certain test, you will be certainly shocked. This very thing happened to the passengers on Flight BE1431 on Thursday.

Tell your parent about interesting things that happen to you, and ask them how their day is going. You don't have to talk about big, important topics.","completion":"Simply discussing everyday occurrences can lead to a deeper and more trusting relationship. As this connection strengthens over time, the conversations may begin to cover more personal and sensitive subjects. It's essential to approach these matters with delicacy and understanding – and asking about a parent's previous marriage is no exception. To inquire about your parent's past marriage, first, ensure that you have established a comfortable rapport and that the atmosphere is right for discussing personal topics. Avoid delving into such matters in front of others or during social gatherings, as it may cause discomfort or embarrassment. Instead, choose a relaxed and private setting where both of you feel at ease to open up about your lives. When you feel that the moment is appropriate, you could lead the conversation by sharing your own life experiences or reflecting on the complexities of relationships. For instance, if you recently watched a movie or read a book that dealt with the subject of divorce or past relationships, you might mention this as a way of broaching the subject. As you ease into the topic, refrain from asking prying or invasive questions. Instead, express genuine curiosity and empathy towards your parent's personal journey. A good starting point could be asking how they met their former partner or what they've learned from past relationships. Remember to be patient and offer a listening ear, rather than taking a judgmental or intrusive stance. Your parent may not immediately divulge every detail about their previous marriage, and that's alright. They might need time to process their thoughts or feel uncertain about sharing intimate information. Demonstrating compassion and understanding will encourage them to gradually open up as they become more comfortable. Moreover, make it clear that your interest in their past arises from a desire to better comprehend their life story and experiences, rather than to criticize or blame. This can help your parent feel valued and respected, as well as lessen any potential defensiveness or reluctance to discuss the subject. In the end, broaching the topic of your parent's previous marriage may not only provide you with valuable insights into their life but also strengthen your bond with them. As you continue engaging in open and authentic conversations, you'll foster a relationship founded on mutual trust, empathy, and understanding."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In later years, his poetry became filled with imagery and emotion. - A silent film is a film with no synchronized recorded sound, especially with no spoken dialogue. The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music. - Moscow (or ) is the capital and most populous city of Russia, with 12.2 million residents within the city limits and 16.8 million within the urban area.

In 1936, Sergei Prokofiev was commissioned by Natalya Sats and the Central Children's Theatre in Moscow to write a new musical symphony for children. The intent was to cultivate \\"musical tastes in children from the first years of school\\". Intrigued by the invitation, Prokofiev completed \\"Peter and the Wolf\\" in just four days.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. What are the first names of the people who discover that their creation is aging at a vastly accelerated rate? Answer the above question based on the context below: Genetic engineers Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast hope to achieve fame by splicing animal DNA to create hybrids for medical use at the company N.E.R.D. (Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized vermiform creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them from doing this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature \\"Dren\\" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsa's shirt. After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink filled with cold water. Later on Clive fully submerges Dren in the sink, and in doing so discovers that Dren is amphibious, but remains ambiguous in whether he tried to save Dren or kill her. While studying Dren, Elsa and Clive neglect their work with Fred and Ginger. At a highly publicized presentation of their work, Fred and Ginger savagely fight to the death. It is subsequently discovered that Ginger had spontaneously changed to a male, but Elsa and Clive failed to notice because they were focused on Dren.

Teacher:Generate an appropriate title for the given text. The generated title must be short and include the main topic of the text. The preferred titles are under fifteen words. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: 1. Click and collect The availability and operation of click and collect services will be limited to retailers selling essential items such as clothes, footwear, baby equipment, homeware and books. Also, outlets that sell electrical goods; do key cutting; undertake shoe repairs, plus garden centres and plant nurseries can continue the collect service. For qualifying businesses, staggered appointments will need to be offered to avoid any potential for queuing, and access inside premises for collection will not be permitted. 2. Takeaway services Customers in Scotland will no longer be allowed to go inside to collect takeaway food or coffee. Businesses will have to operate from a serving hatch or doorway. The aim is to reduce the risk of customers coming into contact indoors with each other, or with staff. 3. Alcohol consumption It will be against the law in all level four areas of Scotland to drink alcohol outdoors in public. This will mean that buying a takeaway pint and consuming on the street will not be permitted. It is intended to underline the message that people should only be leaving home for essential purposes. 4. Working from home The Scottish government is strengthening the obligation on employers to allow their staff to work from home whenever possible. The law already says that people should only be leaving home to go to work if it is work that cannot be done from home. This is a legal obligation that falls on individuals. However, statutory guidance is being introduced to make clear that employers should support employees to work from home wherever possible. 5. Home maintenance The Scottish government is strengthening provisions in relation to work inside people's houses. Current guidance says that in level four areas work is only permitted within a private dwelling if it is essential for the upkeep, maintenance and functioning of the household. This guidance is now being put into law. 6. Stay at home message The final change is an amendment to the regulations requiring people to stay at home. This is intended to close an apparent loophole rather than change the spirit of the law.

Once upon a time, a group of people who shared the same ideas and beliefs about the world started a website called Breitbart. Their ideas were strong, and some people thought they were a bit too strong, thinking that the website's ideas came off as hurtful or mean. This website became known as being \\"right-wing,\\" which means they leaned more towards certain ideas or politics that some people might not agree with. Now, in our world, websites have something called advertising. Advertising is when companies show pictures and words that talk about their products so people will want to buy them. One day, a company named Kellogg's decided to stop showing pictures of their cereals and other tasty breakfast foods on Breitbart's website. Kellogg's told Breitbart that they do not want to put advertising on their website anymore. This decision made Breitbart very sad and disappointed. Breitbart thought that Kellogg's was not being fair, and they wanted people to know how unhappy they were. So, the people at Breitbart asked their friends and those who like their website to not buy any Kellogg's products. This is called a \\"boycott.\\" A boycott happens when people stop using or buying something from a company as a way to show that they don't agree with what the company has done.

He led an attack on a machine gun position and continued to fire at the enemy despite being seriously wounded , killing two of the enemy and dispersing the remainder of the gun crew . General John Pershing listed George Dilboy as \`\` one of the ten great heroes '' who \`\` died in the battlefield of France with super-human heroism and valor . '' Dilboy is buried in Section 18 of Arlington National Cemetery . - Arlington National Cemetery is a United States military cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia, across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., in whose the dead of the nation's conflicts have been buried, beginning with the American Civil War, as well as reinterred dead from earlier wars. The United States Department of the Army, a component of the United States Department of Defense, controls the cemetery. - A battle rifle is a military service rifle that fires a full-power rifle cartridge, such as 7.62×51mm NATO, 7.62×54mmR, 7.92x57mm Mauser, .303 British, or .30-06 Springfield. Compared to assault rifles and their intermediate cartridges, the higher-caliber rounds provide greater power and range, though they have greater weight and produce stronger recoil, making them less than ideal for fully automatic fire. - Military personnel are members of the armed forces. Usually, personnel are divided into military branches roughly defined by certain circumstances of their deployment. Those who serve in a typical large land force are soldiers, making up an army. Those who serve in seagoing forces are seamen or sailors, and their branch is a navy or coast guard . Marines serve in a marine corps. In the 20th century, the development of powered flight aircraft prompted the development of air forces, serviced by airmen. Designated leaders of military personnel are officers. These include commissioned officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs). For naval forces, non-commissioned officers are referred to as petty officers (POs). military personnel are instructed to wear dog tags - Genocide is intentional action to destroy a people (usually defined as an ethnic, national, racial, or religious group) in whole or in part. The hybrid word \\"genocide\\" is a combination of the Greek word \\"génos\\" (\\"race, people\\") and the Latin suffix \\"-cide\\" (\\"act of killing\\"). The United Nations Genocide Convention defines genocide as \\"acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group\\". - The Department of the Army (DA) is one of the three military departments within the Department of Defense of the United States of America. The Department of the Army is the Federal Government agency within which the United States Army is organized, and it is led by the Secretary of the Army who has statutory authority to conduct its affairs and to prescribe regulations for its government, subject to the limits of the law, and the directions of the Secretary of Defense and the President. - A machine gun is a fully automatic mounted or portable firearm, designed to fire bullets in quick succession from an ammunition belt or magazine, typically at a rate of 300 to 1800 rounds per minute. Fully automatic firearms are generally categorized as submachine guns, assault rifles, battle rifles, automatic shotguns, machine guns, or autocannons. Machine guns with multiple rotating barrels are referred to as \\"rotary machine guns\\". - The term cult usually refers to a social group defined by their religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs, or common interest in a particular personality, object or goal. The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word \\"cult\\" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an \\"ad hominem\\" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices. Cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions. - In general, a civilian is \\"a person who is not a member of the military or of a police or firefighting force\\", as defined by Merriam Webster's Dictionary. From the perspective of the U.S. Department of Defense, Chapter 18 of Title 10 United States Code refers to non-military law enforcement officers as civilians since they are employees rather than enlisted personnel, and also in order to distinguish itself from military police. In military and law enforcement slang, the term \\"Civies\\" or \\"Civvies\\" are often used to refer civilian population or civilian clothing. - An autocannon or automatic cannon is a large, fully automatic, rapid-fire projectile weapon that fires armour-piercing or explosive shells, as opposed to the bullet fired by a machine gun. Autocannons often have a larger calibre than a machine gun (e.g., 20 mm or greater), but are usually smaller than a field gun or other artillery. When used on its own, the word \\"autocannon\\" indicates a single-barrel weapon. When multiple rotating barrels are involved, the word \\"rotary\\" is added, and such a weapon is referred to as a \\"rotary autocannon.\\" Modern autocannons are typically not single soldier-portable or stand-alone units, rather they are usually vehicle-mounted, aircraft-mounted, or boat-mounted, or even remote-operated as in some naval applications. As such, ammunition is typically fed from a belt to reduce reloading or for a faster rate of fire, but a magazine remains an option. They can use a variety of ammunition: common shells include high-explosive dual-purpose types (HEDP), any variety of armour-piercing (AP) types, such as composite rigid (APCR) or discarding sabot types (APDS). - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories.

Image copyright MARCEL MOCHET/GETTY Image caption A colony of king penguins in the Antarctic Penguins can taste only sour and salty food, scientists have discovered. A genetic study suggests the flightless birds lost three of the five basic tastes long ago in evolution. Taste is critical for survival in most animals, but may not matter in the penguin, which swallows fish whole, say researchers in China and the US. Many other birds are unable to taste sweet things, but they do have receptors for detecting bitter and umami (or meaty) flavours. The discovery was made when researchers decoding penguin genomes found some of the taste genes were missing. Their behaviour of swallowing food whole, and their tongue structure and function, suggest that penguins need no taste perception Prof Jianzhi Zhang, University of Michigan A closer look at the DNA of penguins revealed that all species lack functioning genes for the receptors of sweet, umami, and bitter tastes. \\"Based on genetic data, penguins are believed to have sour and salty tastes, but have lost sweet, umami, and bitter tastes,\\" lead researcher Prof Jianzhi Zhang, of the University of Michigan, US, and Wuhan University, China, told the BBC. The umami taste gives food the strong, savoury flavour associated with meat. Lacking this sense is surprising for a carnivorous animal, but does not matter that much in the penguin, which swallows fish without chewing. \\"Their behaviour of swallowing food whole, and their tongue structure and function, suggest that penguins need no taste perception,\\" said Prof Zhang. \\"Although it is unclear whether these traits are a cause or a consequence of their major taste loss.\\" Icy clue The findings, published in Current Biology journal, were a puzzle, he added. One clue comes from the bird's evolution on the frozen ice sheets of Antarctica. Sending signals from sweet, umami, and bitter (but not sour or salty) taste receptors to the brain does not work at very low temperatures. This may have led to the penguin gradually losing its sense of taste, say the researchers. Intriguingly, the sweet taste is missing in almost all birds. The hummingbird, which feeds on sweet nectar, is an exception. ||||| Penguins no longer taste their food the way most of the animal kingdom does, according to a new study. According to the researchers, vertebrates usually have five tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter and umami. But after studying the genetic sequencing of Adelie and emperor penguins, analyzing penguin tissue, and comparing the birds genomes to 14 other non-penguin bird species, the researchers discovered that penguins have lost all but the salty and sour tastes. “Penguins eat fish, so you would guess that they need the umami receptor genes, but for some reason they don’t have them,” said study author Jianzhi Zhang, a professor at the University of Michigan Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology in a statement. “These findings are surprising and puzzling, and we do not have a good explanation for them. But we have a few ideas.” The researchers believe that perhaps over 20 million years ago, the freezing climates of the arctic somehow interfered with the penguins’ ability to taste. The researchers of the new study, published in the journal Current Biology, were tipped off to the lack of taste among penguins when they were contacted by a genomics institute in China called BGI which had originally sequenced the genomes of the Adelie and emperor penguins and couldn’t find their taste genes. The researchers there asked the University of Michigan researchers to take a second look to see if what they found was true. Unfortunately for the penguins, they may be missing out on the variety of flavors found in their favorite fish. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Penguins are interesting birds that live in very cold places like Antarctica. Scientists have discovered that these penguins can only taste sour and salty food, but not sweet, umami, and bitter food.

From Reichenau, the Alpine Rhine flows east, passing Chur and turning north, forms the border between the canton of St. Gallen of Switzerland on the left, west side and first Liechtenstein and then Vorarlberg, Austria on the right, east side. The Swiss-Austrian border follows the historical bed of the Rhine, but today the river follows an artificial canal within Austria for the final . The Rhine Valley in this area extends to about . Its upper third has the character of an Alpine valley, enclosing a bottom plain of about across. Downstream of Vaduz, the valley widens considerably, developing into a broad plain, measuring some across at its lower end along the southern shores of Lake Constance. From the point of the Rhine's emergence from Lake Constance, it is known as High Rhine. - The Alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 metres (just over 13,000 feet). - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City.

Terminology. Most of these states have historically been a polity, but in some occasions were rather territories in respect of which a princely title is held. The prince's estate and wealth may be located mainly or wholly outside the geographical confines of the principality. - The Swiss Plateau or Central Plateau constitutes one of the three major landscapes in Switzerland alongside the Jura Mountains and the Swiss Alps. It covers about 30% of the Swiss surface. It comprises the regions between the Jura and the Alps, partly flat but mostly hilly, and lies at an average height between 400 and 700 m AMSL. It is by far the most densely populated region of Switzerland, and the most important with respect to economy and transportation. - The Rätikon is a mountain range of the Central Eastern Alps located at the border between Vorarlberg, Liechtenstein and Graubünden. It is the geological border between the Eastern and Western Alps and stretches from the Montafon as far as the Rhine. In the south, the Prättigau is its limit, in the north the Walgau. In the east, it borders the Silvretta groups. - Vorarlberg is the westernmost federal state (\\"Bundesland\\") of Austria. Although it has the second-smallest area (Vienna is the smallest) and population (Burgenland is less populated), it has the second-highest population density (after Vienna). It borders three countries: Germany (Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg via Lake Constance), Switzerland (Graubünden and St. Gallen) and Liechtenstein. The only Austrian state that shares a border with Vorarlberg is Tyrol to the east. - Liechtenstein , officially the Principality of Liechtenstein, is a doubly landlocked German-speaking microstate in Central Europe. It is a constitutional monarchy with the rank of principality, headed by the Prince of Liechtenstein. - A federal republic is a federation of states with a republican form of government. At its core, the literal meaning of the word republic when used to reference a form of government means: \\"a country that is governed by elected representatives and by an elected leader (such as a president) rather than by a king or queen\\". - A mountain range (also mountain barrier, belt, or system) is a geographic area containing numerous geologically related mountains. A mountain system or system of mountain ranges, sometimes is used to combine several geological features that are geographically (regionally) related.

Are the following two questions the same? Why can't people just shut up? On your planet, do people ever shut up? Possible answers: (a). no. (b). yes. The answer is:","completion":"(b). yes. Although the two questions might seem different at first glance, they are fundamentally asking the same thing. The first question, \\"Why can't people just shut up?\\" is seeking to understand the reasons behind why human beings often have difficulty refraining from speaking or staying silent when it may be more appropriate or beneficial to do so. This question implies that human individuals sometimes engage in excessive talking or communication that others find disruptive or irritating. The second question, \\"On your planet, do people ever shut up?\\" can be rephrased as \\"Do people on your planet ever stop talking?\\" This question is also inquiring about the ability of individuals within a society or community to stay silent or cease communicating when it may be helpful or necessary. Both questions are focused on exploring the behaviors and tendencies of people when it comes to communication and silence. They both aim to understand if, when, and why people choose not to speak or stop speaking, which may vary based on cultural, social, or personal factors. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that these two questions are essentially the same, as they focus on a similar subject matter and are seeking to uncover the same information about human behavior. In addition to the similarities in the subject matter, both questions also contain elements of frustration or dissatisfaction with the level of conversation or communication exhibited by people. The phrasing of the questions implies that the person asking is perhaps aggravated by the perceived inability of others to maintain silence when it would be warranted or preferable. This shared sense of frustration further solidifies the connection between the two questions, as they both carry a similar emotional aspect as well. Therefore, the answer is (b). yes – the two questions are indeed the same, despite differences in their phrasing and structure. They both ask about the reasons and circumstances related to human communication and silence, as well as conveying a shared sentiment of frustration with excessive talking or communication among people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Gene A broad operational definition is sometimes used to encompass the complexity of these diverse phenomena, where a gene is defined as a union of genomic sequences encoding a coherent set of potentially overlapping functional products. This definition categorizes genes by their functional products (proteins or RNA) rather than their specific DNA loci, with regulatory elements classified as gene-associated regions. Q: What sort of definition can be used to conveniently encompass the complexity of diverse phenomena?","completion":"A broad operational definition can be conveniently used to encompass the complexity of diverse phenomena related to genes. This definition categorizes genes according to their functional products, such as proteins or RNAs, rather than focusing on specific DNA loci. By doing so, the definition takes into account the various functional aspects of genes, including the overlapping nature of functional products, which may be encoded from the same genomic sequences, and the gene-associated regulatory elements that play crucial roles in gene expression and regulation. This broad definition is particularly useful because it acknowledges the complexity of the genetic architecture and offers a more holistic perspective on the functionality and roles of genes. Rather than limiting the concept of a gene to a specific segment of DNA, it accounts for the fact that genes may possess multiple functional products and that their regulation may involve a diverse array of genomic sequences. Some key components and elements captured by this broad operational definition include: 1. Genomic sequences: The full range of DNA sequences within the genome that are involved in encoding functional products or regulating gene expression. 2. Functional products: The proteins or RNA molecules that are produced as a result of gene expression and have various functional roles within the cell. 3. Overlapping functional products: Instances where multiple functional products are encoded within a single genomic region, potentially leading to the formation of multiple distinct proteins or RNAs. 4. Gene-associated regulatory elements: Additional genomic sequences that are involved in regulating the expression, splicing, or translation of the gene and its products. These elements may include promoters, enhancers, and silencers, among others. By employing this broad operational definition, researchers can better understand and investigate the intricate mechanisms underlying gene expression, regulation, and function within the context of the genome. This comprehensive approach allows for a more accurate and complete representation of genes and their roles in biological processes, enabling further advancements in areas such as genomics, molecular biology, and genetic engineering."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that overthrew the Monégasque constitution? Antoine's marriage to Marie of Lorraine was unhappy and yielded only two daughters. Monaco's constitution confined the throne to members of the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the lack of (the politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died just months later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the Monégasque constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.Jacques I assumed the name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French aristocracy showed scant respect towards the new prince who had risen from their ranks and chose to spend his time absent from Monaco. He died in 1751 and was succeeded by his and Louise-Hippolyte's son Prince Honoré III.Honoré III married Catherine Brignole in 1757 and later divorced her. Before his marriage, Honoré III had been conducting an affair with his future mother-in-law. After her divorce Marie Brignole married Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé, a member of the fallen French royal house, in 1798. Ironically, the Grimaldi fortunes were restored when descendants of both Hortense Mancini and Louis I married: Louise d'Aumont Mazarin married Honoré III's son and heir, the future Honoré IV. This marriage in 1776 was extremely advantageous to the Grimaldi, as Louise's ancestress Hortense Mancini had been the heiress of Cardinal Mazarin. Thus Monaco's ruling family acquired all the estates bequeathed by Cardinal Mazarin, including the Duchy of Rethel, and the Principality of Château-Porcien.

Write a summary based on this article: Greenland's many supraglacial lakes have been seen suddenly and mysteriously draining as climate change causes this region to warm, and now scientists have finally explained the mechanism behind this phenomenon. The findings were published in the journal Nature. The Greenland Ice Sheet, the second largest ice sheet in the world, has long been of concern to scientists as rising temperatures continue to melt its glaciers. Consequently, this meltwater forms thousands of lakes atop the ice sheet each spring and summer. And yet, these vast bodies of water can empty in a matter of just a few hours. When they drain, they send torrents of water to the base of the ice sheet thousands of feet below, lubricating the interface between rock and ice. That allows the ice sheet to flow faster to the ocean and discharge ice into ocean, which causes sea levels to rise faster. So what exactly is causing this sudden drainage? In 2008, scientists from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) and the University of Washington documented for the first time how the icy bottoms of lakes atop the Greenland Ice Sheet can crack open suddenly. Initially, they thought the sheer weight of water was putting too much pressure on the ice to the point that it cracked. However, this theory did not explain why some lake bottoms cracked while others did not. \\"Our discovery will help us predict more accurately how supraglacial lakes will affect ice sheet flow and sea level rise as the region warms in the future,\\" lead author Laura Stevens from WHOI said in a press release. Stevens and her colleagues deployed a network of 16 GPS units around North Lake, a 1.5-mile-long supraglacial lake in southwest Greenland. This lake was among those seen suddenly cracking and draining. They recorded ice movement before, during and after three rapid lake drainages in summer 2011-2013. It turns out that tension from below the ice sheet, and not above it from the lakes, was causing cracks in the ice. (Scroll to read on...) According to the data, in the 6 to 12 hours before the lake cracked and drained, the ice around the lake moved upward and slipped horizontally. The scientists say that meltwater had begun to drain through a nearby system of moulins - vertical channels through the ice - which connected the surface to the base of the ice sheet 3,215 feet below. The accumulating water creates a bulge that floats the entire ice sheet, creating tension at the surface underneath the lake. The stress builds up until it is relieved by a sudden large crack in the ice below the lake. \\"In some ways, ice behaves like Silly Putty - if you push up on it slowly, it will stretch; if you do it with enough force, it will crack,\\" Stevens explained. \\"Ordinarily, pressure at the ice sheet surface is directed into the lake basin, compressing the ice together. But, essentially, if you push up on the ice sheet and create a dome instead of a bowl, you get tension that stretches the ice surface apart. You change the stress state of the surface ice from compressional to tensional, which promotes crack formation.\\" Though once this tension initiates the crack, the volume of water in the lake does play a role. Lakewater pours into the crack and widens it even more, keeping it filled with water all the way to base of the thick ice sheet and forming what are called hydrofractures. \\"You need both conditions - tension to initiate the crack and the large volume of water to amplify it - for hydrofractures to form,\\" Stevens said. Meaning, the weight from meltwater alone is not enough to cause supraglacial lakes to suddenly drain. This entire underlying mechanism is so impactful, it can reportedly drain more than 11 billion gallons of water out of North Lake in about 90 minutes. That's even faster than the water goes over Niagara Falls. By better understanding these sudden drainages scientists hope to determine how supraglacial lakes will affect sea level rise as climate conditions shift in the future.

Now they have found a surprising mechanism that triggers the cracks. Scientists had theorized that the sheer weight of the water in these supraglacial lakes applied pressure that eventually cracked the ice, but they could not explain why some lake bottoms cracked while others did not. \\"Our discovery will help us predict more accurately how supraglacial lakes will affect ice sheet flow and sea level rise as the region warms in the future,\\" said lead author Laura Stevens, a graduate student in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (MIT/WHOI) Joint Program in Oceanography. The research was published June 4 in the journal Nature. To find out what triggers sudden lake drainages, a research team, including Stevens and colleagues from WHOI, the University of Washington, MIT, and the University of Tasmania, deployed a network of 16 GPS units around North Lake, a 1.5-mile-long supraglacial lake in southwest Greenland, where the scientists first documented large-scale cracks and lake drainages. They used these instruments to record movements of the ice before, during, and after three rapid lake drainages in the summers of 2011, 2012, and 2013. Their study showed that in the 6 to 12 hours before the lake cracked and drained, the ice around the lake moved upward and slipped horizontally. The scientists say that meltwater had begun to drain through a nearby system of moulins (vertical conduits through the ice), which connected the surface to the base of the ice sheet 3,215 feet below. The accumulating water creates a bulge that floats the entire ice sheet, creating tension at the surface underneath the lake. The stress builds up until it is relieved by a sudden large crack in the ice below the lake. \\"In some ways, ice behaves like Silly Putty--if you push up on it slowly, it will stretch; if you do it with enough force, it will crack,\\" said Stevens. \\"Ordinarily, pressure at the ice sheet surface is directed into the lake basin, compressing the ice together. But, essentially, if you push up on the ice sheet and create a dome instead of a bowl, you get tension that stretches the ice surface apart. You change the stress state of the surface ice from compressional to tensional, which promotes crack formation.\\" Once the tension initiates the crack, the volume of water in the lake does play a critical role, surging into the opening, widening and extending it, and keeping it filled with water all the way to base of the thick ice sheet. These are called hydrofractures, and the scientists have documented how they can drain more than 11 billion gallons of water out of North Lake in about 90 minutes. At times, water flowed out of the lake bottom faster than the water goes over Niagara Falls, the scientists estimated. \\"You need both conditions--tension to initiate the crack and the large volume of water to amplify it--for hydrofractures to form,\\" Stevens said. The key finding of this study is that without the former, even large supraglacial lakes will retain their water. At the base of the ice sheet, the water that drains from the lake lubricates the interface between ice and rock, allowing the ice sheet to slide faster toward the coast. That in turn accelerates the outflow of ice from land to sea and causes sea levels to rise faster. So understanding the mechanisms that trigger the drainages will help scientists predict more precisely how supraglacial lakes will affect sea level rise as climate conditions shift in the future. The GPS network also recorded the more sudden and momentous movements of the ice sheet surface at the time of the hydrofracture, showing that portions of the ice sheet bed beneath the lake can slip up to a foot and a half. That is equivalent to the movement caused by a magnitude-5.5 earthquake. \\"It's just a different type of solid crystals--ice instead of rock--breaking due to stress,\\" said Jeff McGuire, a co-author on the study and a seismologist at WHOI. The research team spanned scientific disciplines, including McGuire, a seismologist; Mark Behn, a geophysicist at WHOI who studies faults in Earth's crust; glaciologists Sarah Das of WHOI, and Ian Joughin and David Shean of the University of Washington; Tom Herring, a GPS expert at MIT, and Matt King, who studies geodesy, Antarctic ice sheets, and sea level at the University of Tasmania. Thousands of supraglacial lakes form each spring and summer on top of the Greenland Ice Sheet as sunlight returns to the region. The heat melts snow and ice into water that pools in depressions in the ice sheet to form lakes. As the region becomes warmer, more lakes will likely form, leading to a first-order prediction of more hydrofractures, more lubrication, more ice sheet slippage, and faster-rising sea levels. However, discovering the new trigger mechanism changes the equation, because the trigger is less likely to occur at lakes at higher elevations on the ice sheet--even though water volumes in those lakes can be large. Stevens explained that the ice sheet further inland is thicker and moves more slowly. The ice deeper down flows viscously, dampening impacts on the surface topography. That results in a flatter surface where fewer lake basins and crevasses form. Fewer crevasses mean less water leakage to the base, which reduces bulging that increases surface stresses. # The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution is a private, non-profit organization on Cape Cod, Mass., dedicated to marine research, engineering, and higher education.

In 2006, Greenland's North Lake, a 2.2 square-mile (5.6 square kilometers) supraglacial meltwater lake, drained almost 12 billion gallons of water in less than two hours. In a study published two years later, researchers determined that this astonishing phenomenon is possible because giant hydro-fractures(water-driven cracks) can form directly beneath the lake basin and stretch down to the bed of the ice sheet, emptying the lake of water. But just how these fractures developed has been unknown — until now. In the new study, published today (June 3) in the journal Nature, scientists using GPS technology discovered that the hydro-fractures form from tension-related stress caused by movements of the ice sheet. These movements are, in turn, triggered by the trickling meltwater. [See Gorgeous Images of Greenland's Supraglacial Lakes] The new research may help scientists better understand how much the ice sheet is contributing to sea level rise, researchers say. Most of Greenland's supraglacial lakes drain slowly when superficial streams route water into nearby, permanent crevasses or moulins (vertical conduits or shafts in a glacier). Fairly recently, however, satellite images showed that about 13 percent of the lakes drain quickly, emptying completely within 24 hours. \\"The images would show the lake there one day, and gone the next day,\\" said first author of the new study, Laura Stevens, a glaciology doctoral candidate with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (MIT-WHOI) Joint Program. \\"So we've known for the last 10 to 15 years that the water could disappear quickly.\\" A moulin, or crack, formed along the hydro-fracture through Greenland's North Lake basin continues to drain meltwater to the bed after the 2013 North Lake rapid drainage. Credit: Ian Joughin The 2008 research, led by Stevens' co-author Sarah Das, a WHOI geological scientist, showed that temporary hydro-fractures could cause rapid lake drainage on an unprecedented scale. But that research was unable to determine what triggered the cracks in the first place. Two other, similar studies of different rapidly draining supraglacial lakes were also unable to identify what caused the hydro-fractures. \\"The coverage of GPS stations was not dense enough,\\" Stevens told Live Science. \\"This study goes beyond previous studies on the lakes, because we have 16 GPS stations, as opposed to one or four.\\" When meltwater in the summer drains to the bed from the ice surface through crevasses or moulins, it can cause the area within and around the lake basin to be \\"jacked up,\\" Stevens said. Additionally, it can decrease the surface area of the ice-sheet bed that's in contact with the underlying bedrock, lubricating the bed and making it easier for the bed to move horizontally. Placed around North Lake, the team's 16 GPS stations recorded these two types of movements — called uplift and slip — between 2011 and 2013. This provided an in-depth perspective on the meltwater injected into the bed before, during and after the yearly drainages. \\"We found that before we get the main expression of the lake drainage, there is a period of time (about six to 12 hours) where uplift and slip increase,\\" Stevens said. \\"That motion is enough to take the surface of the ice sheet and put portions of it in high tension that allows cracks to start forming.\\" The study provides a clearer picture of the amount and location of the meltwater that travels down to the ice-sheet bed, which could help scientists better understand how fast the ice sheet flows during the summer, Stevens said. This is important because the inland ice that moves toward the coast gets funneled to so-called outlet glaciers, which are tonguelike protrusions that can break off to form icebergs that may drift off into the ocean and eventually melt. \\"It's half of the equation of how the Greenland ice sheet contributes to sea level rise, with the other half being the years when the ice sheet melts quicker than the snow is deposited,\\" Stevens said.

And yet, I stubbornly keep my BlackBerry in my bag and on my desk, fully charged. As with my Palm Vx of yesterday, breaking up with a beloved gadget is hard to do, especially when you have history. My BlackBerry and I go back over 10 years. We met at a telecom conference in Hong Kong. I will never forget the wonder of our first wireless e-mail. Look, I'm no softie when it comes to loving and leaving my electronics. I've thrown out old Macs. I've recycled expired Sony Ericsson handsets. I've even trashed now-antique digital cameras. But this is the longest and saddest gadget breakup I've ever gone through. I can no longer accept its limits: A disappointing apps portfolio, clunky interface, and frankly lame camera. Over the years, we grew apart. I started to dabble in social media and mobile photography. The tools on offer from other devices were far better in functionality, speed and resolution. I wanted my BlackBerry to change, and yet it never managed to deliver. And suddenly, I felt like it just wasn't there for me. I have stopped using the beloved device. But like the other 50 million BlackBerry users still out there, I just can't pull the plug. Read more: BlackBerry's dwindling users ponder uncertain future.

But not everyone was as keen to ditch the BlackBerry. My ever-compassionate colleague John Vause said, \\"Don't do it... it will get better... I promise.\\" On Monday, BlackBerry announced that it was being taken private -- a headline that raised hopes among loyalists that change is sure to come. Meanwhile, my pal Eunice Yoon implored me to keep hope alive with the reminder, \\"the typing is so much easier!\\" But the doubt has already settled in, and I'm already starting to see my BlackBerry in the past tense. \\"Just for fun, I fire up my circa 2005 Treo 750 sometimes,\\" reminisced J.

Gary Oldman's semi-autobiographical account of life lived on a South East London estate is a violent, Beckettian account of one of Dante's circles of hell, frankly. At the centre of it is Ray Winstone, who has done this sort of character before but never as well. The film opens with him ordering drinks at a pub bar - that's all - and you are already gripped with a sense of the frustration, self-loathing and barbarism that he exhibits in many different ways throughout the course of the movie. It's an acting masterclass. Of course the stymied and dispossessed need a foil in a drama such as this and Winstone is matched by Kathy Burke as his long-suffering wife, who absorbs and ultimately rejects his unbearable behaviour. Charlie Creed-Miles does an able turn as the fuse-lighting druggie son Billy although he must have wondered sometimes exactly what he let himself in for. Gary Oldman directs close up on the actors, maximising the claustrophobia of their council flat squalor. 4/10 What is the sentiment of this review?

Objective: How to ozonate your drinking water? Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","completion":"You have not provided any solutions for me to compare. If you provide different solutions, I will assess which one would be more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning. In the meantime, I can explain how to ozonate drinking water step-by-step: 1. Acquire an ozone generator: To ozonate your drinking water, you will need a device that produces ozone. Ozone generators are available in the market, and they come in varying capacities. Choose one that fits your intended usage. 2. Prepare the drinking water: Fill a clean container with the drinking water you intend to ozonate. 3. Place the diffuser stone of the ozone generator: Attach the silicone ozone-tube to the ozone outlet in the generator. Then, attach the other end of the tube to the diffuser stone. Submerge the diffuser stone into the drinking water but ensure it is not touching the bottom of the container, as it will aid in the distribution of ozone. Justification: Placing the diffuser stone in the water is essential to creating a fine stream of ozone bubbles, which increases the contact between ozone and water molecules, enhancing the ozonation process. 4. Turn on the ozone generator: Activate the ozone generator and set the desired ozone concentration and timer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Typically, 30 minutes of treatment time is recommended for general disinfection purposes. Justification: Ozone generators require time to produce and dissolve ozone gas in the water. Setting an appropriate duration for the process ensures optimum ozonation and disinfection. 5. Wait for the process to complete: Allow the system to run for the specified duration. The ozone will dissolve in the water, oxidizing contaminants and microorganisms and removing any unpleasant odors or tastes. Justification: The duration of ozonation allows enough time for ozone molecules to react with contaminants and microorganisms, ensuring a thorough disinfection and purification process. 6. Turn off the ozone generator after completion: Once the process is complete, turn off the device, remove the diffuser stone, and allow the water to rest for a few minutes. This will give time for any residual ozone in the water to dissipate. Justification: Letting the water rest allows residual ozone to convert back to oxygen, ensuring that the water is safe to drink without exposure to excessive ozone. 7. Store or consume the ozonated water: You can now store the treated water in a clean, closed container, or consume it as needed. Please provide the different solutions if you would like me to compare and assess which one is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning."},{"prompt":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: A new argument has been put forward as to whether penguins are disturbed by the presence of tourists in Antarctica. Previous research by scientists from Keil University in Germany monitored Adelie penguins and noted that the birds' heart rates increased dramatically at the sight of a human as far as 30 meters away. But new research using an artificial egg, which is equipped to measure heart rates, disputes this. Scientists from the Scott Polar Research Institute at Cambridge say that a slow moving human who does not approach the nest too closely, is not viewed as a threat by penguins. The earlier findings have been used to partly explain the 20 per cent drop in populations of certain types of penguins near tourist sites. However, tour operators have continued to insist that their activities do not adversely affect wildlife in Antarctica, saying they encourage non-disruptive behavior in tourists, and that the decline in penguin numbers is caused by other factors. Amanda Nimon of the Scott Polar Research Institute spent three southern hemisphere summers at Cuverville Island in Antarctica studying penguin behavior towards humans. \\"A nesting penguin will react very differently to a person rapidly and closely approaching the nest,\\" says Nimon. \\"First they exhibit large and prolonged heart rate changes and then they often flee the nest leaving it open for predators to fly in and remove eggs or chicks.\\" The artificial egg, specially for the project, monitored both the parent who had been 'disturbed' when the egg was placed in the nest and the other parent as they both took it in turns to guard the nest. However, Boris Culik, who monitored the Adelie penguins, believes that Nimon's findings do not invalidate his own research. He points out that species behave differently - and Nimon's work was with Gentoo penguins. Nimon and her colleagues believe that Culik's research was methodologically flawed because the monitoring of penguins' responses needed capturing and restraining the birds and fitting them with...

Given those answer options, answer the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Shape and Structure of Erythrocytes As an erythrocyte matures in the red bone marrow, it extrudes its nucleus and most of its other organelles. During the first day or two that it is in the circulation, an immature erythrocyte, known as a reticulocyte, will still typically contain remnants of organelles. Reticulocytes should comprise approximately 1–2 percent of the erythrocyte count and provide a rough estimate of the rate of RBC production, with abnormally low or high rates indicating deviations in the production of these cells. These remnants, primarily of networks (reticulum) of ribosomes, are quickly shed, however, and mature, circulating erythrocytes have few internal cellular structural components. Lacking mitochondria, for example, they rely on anaerobic respiration. This means that they do not utilize any of the oxygen they are transporting, so they can deliver it all to the tissues. They also lack endoplasmic reticula and do not synthesize proteins. Erythrocytes do, however, contain some structural proteins that help the blood cells maintain their unique structure and enable them to change their shape to squeeze through capillaries. This includes the protein spectrin, a cytoskeletal protein element. Erythrocytes are biconcave disks; that is, they are plump at their periphery and very thin in the center (Figure 18.6). Since they lack most organelles, there is more interior space for the presence of the hemoglobin molecules that, as you will see shortly, transport gases. The biconcave shape also provides a greater surface area across which gas exchange can occur, relative to its volume; a sphere of a similar diameter would have a lower surface area-to-volume ratio. In the capillaries, the oxygen carried by the erythrocytes can diffuse into the plasma and then through the capillary walls to reach the cells, whereas some of the carbon dioxide produced by the cells as a waste product diffuses into the capillaries to be picked up by the erythrocytes.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the background: When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change. and the situation: Greg is an environmental scientist. He wants to know how earth's atmosphere differed in two different time. To that end, he selected two time periods, time A and time B. Time A is set in the year one thousand when using fossil fuels was not very common. Time B is set in the year two thousand when fossil fuels are used in large quantities. Answer the following question: In which time more carbon dioxide would be realeased into the atmosphere, time A or time B? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Time B would have more carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere compared to Time A. The reasoning behind this conclusion lies in the differences between the two time periods and human activities that have an impact on the carbon cycle. Time A is set in the year one thousand, during which the use of fossil fuels was not as prevalent. Human societies primarily relied on agricultural activities, and the primary sources of energy were wind, water, and animal labor. Industrialization was yet to take place, and the overall human population was significantly lower than in Time B. Consequently, the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere due to anthropogenic activities was minimal. Natural processes, such as plant respiration, decay, and volcanic activities, contributed to the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. However, these levels were considerably balanced by carbon dioxide absorption through natural sinks, such as photosynthesis, ocean uptake, and other biological processes. On the other hand, Time B is set in the year two thousand, during which the world was heavily reliant on fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. These energy sources were essential to power industrial processes, transportation, electricity generation, and various domestic and commercial applications. The combustion of fossil fuels releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Furthermore, the global human population increased dramatically during this period, resulting in greater consumption of resources and higher levels of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. In addition to the large-scale extraction and burning of fossil fuels, other factors also contributed to higher carbon dioxide emissions in Time B. For example, widespread deforestation and land-use changes reduced the ability of terrestrial ecosystems to sequester carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. The rising demand for agricultural land and urbanization amplified these effects, further influencing the global carbon cycle. In conclusion, more carbon dioxide would be released into the atmosphere in Time B compared to Time A. The increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels during Time B is primarily driven by human activities linked to the widespread use of fossil fuels, industrialization, and associated land-use changes. These factors have significantly impacted the natural carbon cycle, leading to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and contributing to the global climate change phenomenon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","completion":"Title: Firefighting at Loch Ness: An Unrelenting Battle Against Rural Grass Fire Introduction In a dramatic overnight operation that lasted a grueling 11 hours, fire crews fought tooth and nail to contain a rural grass fire near the iconic Loch Ness. Home to the mythical Loch Ness Monster, these ordinarily tranquil surroundings were disrupted by the relentless blaze, posing a significant risk to the local ecosystem, wildlife, and nearby communities. The Incident As darkness fell on the evening of the fire, emergency services were alerted to the rapidly escalating situation near the banks of Loch Ness. The rural grass fire had quickly grown out of control, fueled by a combination of dry vegetation, unseasonably warm temperatures, and gusty wind conditions. With little time to spare, a fleet of fire crews were dispatched to the scene, ready to tackle the ferocious flames. The Challenges and Response Given the remote location and limited access routes to the site of the fire, fighting the blaze posed a unique set of challenges for the emergency services in attendance. As the clock ticked and the fire continued to devour everything in its path, firefighters employed a variety of strategies to quell the flames, including the use of aerial water drops, controlled backburning techniques, and the construction of firebreaks to prevent further spread. Throughout the course of the night, fire crews battled tirelessly against the elements, often having to navigate thick smoke and uneven terrain to extinguish hotspots and flare-ups. In addition to the inherent dangers associated with such an intense operation, fatigue and exhaustion undoubtedly took their toll on the crews as their efforts stretched across 11 long hours. Community Impact The consequences of the fire reverberated far beyond the site of the blaze itself, with concerns raised about the potential damage done to the local ecosystem. As a popular tourist destination, Loch Ness and its surrounding area support a vibrant community with numerous businesses reliant on the steady stream of visitors each year. The fire raised fears that the beauty of this idyllic landscape might suffer long-term consequences, potentially affecting the community's primary source of income. The region's abundant wildlife was also at risk, with the rapidly spreading flames threatening the habitats of numerous species native to the area. Efforts were made to evacuate any distressed and injured animals encountered during the firefighting operation, in a bid to reduce the impact on local fauna. Reflecting on the Incident As the dawn broke and the fire was finally contained, the resilience, dedication, and courage of the fire crews involved came to the forefront. Their unwavering commitment to combating the blaze ensured that a potentially devastating situation was kept under control, preventing further damage to the surrounding areas. While detailed assessments are still underway to determine the full extent of the damage wrought by the fire, early indications suggest that the quick response and persevering efforts of the emergency services helped to avert a more significant ecological disaster. As the community begins the process of recovery and regrowth, attention now turns to implementing strategies to mitigate the risk of future rural grass fires in the region. In conclusion, the overnight battle near Loch Ness serves as a potent reminder of the tireless work carried out by fire crews, who risk their lives to protect not only lives and property, but also the stunning natural landscapes that make our world so unique. Their determination and skill in the face of adversity are testament to the undying commitment exhibited by emergency services personnel all around the globe."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Please answer the following question: Information: - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - Reull Vallis is a valley on Mars that appears to have been carved by water . It runs westward into Hellas Planitia . It is named after the Gaelic word for planet . - Astrology is the study of the movements and relative positions of celestial objects as a means for divining information about human affairs and terrestrial events. Astrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium BCE, and has its roots in calendrical systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications. Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and some such as the Indians, Chinese, and Maya developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations. Western astrology, one of the oldest astrological systems still in use, can trace its roots to 19th-17th century BCE Mesopotamia, from which it spread to Ancient Greece, Rome, the Arab world and eventually Central and Western Europe. Contemporary Western astrology is often associated with systems of horoscopes that purport to explain aspects of a person's personality and predict significant events in their lives based on the positions of celestial objects; the majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems. - The Noachis quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Noachis quadrangle is also referred to as MC-27 (Mars Chart-27). - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. - The asteroid belt is the circumstellar disc in the Solar System located roughly between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. It is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets. The asteroid belt is also termed the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System such as near-Earth asteroids and trojan asteroids. About half the mass of the belt is contained in the four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. The total mass of the asteroid belt is approximately 4% that of the Moon, or 22% that of Pluto, and roughly twice that of Pluto's moon Charon (whose diameter is 1200 km). - Hellas Planitia is a plain located within the huge, roughly circular impact basin Hellas located in the southern hemisphere of the planet Mars. Hellas is the third or fourth largest impact crater and the largest visible impact crater known in the Solar System. The basin floor is about deep, deeper than the Moon's South Pole-Aitken basin, and extends about east to west. It is centered at Hellas Planitia is in the Hellas quadrangle and the Noachis quadrangle. - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. - A terrestrial planet, telluric planet, or rocky planet is a planet that is composed primarily of silicate rocks or metals. Within the Solar System, the terrestrial planets are the inner planets closest to the Sun, i.e. Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The terms \\"terrestrial planet\\" and \\"telluric planet\\" are derived from Latin words for Earth (\\"Terra\\" and \\"Tellus\\"), as these planets are, in terms of composition, \\"Earth-like\\". - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion. - An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet, moon, or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere, formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body. In contrast to volcanic craters, which result from explosion or internal collapse, impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. Although Meteor Crater is perhaps the best-known example of a small impact crater on Earth, impact craters range from small, simple, bowl-shaped depressions to large, complex, multi-ringed impact basins. - The Hellas quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Hellas quadrangle is also referred to as MC-28 (Mars Chart-28). The Hellas quadrangle covers the area from 240° to 300° west longitude and 30° to 65° south latitude on the planet Mars. Within the Hellas quadrangle lies the classic features Hellas Planitia and Promethei Terra. Many interesting and mysterious features have been discovered in the Hellas quadrangle, including the giant river valleys Dao Vallis, Niger Vallis, Harmakhis, and Reull Vallisall of which may have contributed water to a lake in the Hellas basin in the distant past. Many places in the Hellas quadrangle show signs of ice in the ground, especially places with glacier-like flow features. - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. - The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known. What is the relationship between 'reull vallis' and 'hellas quadrangle'? Answer:","completion":"Reull Vallis is a valley on Mars that appears to have been carved by water. It runs westward into Hellas Planitia.

The relationship between Reull Vallis and the Hellas quadrangle is that Reull Vallis is a geographical feature found within the Hellas quadrangle on Mars."},{"prompt":"Q: Have you ever wondered whether it’s worth your while to encourage an older person to start exercising? In 2014, the top-notch journal JAMA published the results of a fantastic research project: a study in which 1635 sedentary older adults (aged 70-89) were assigned to get either a structured exercise program, or a program of “successful aging” health education. The researchers called it the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. (You can read the full study here.) During the LIFE study, the two groups were followed for a little over 2.5 years. And by the end of the study, guess which group of volunteers was more likely to still walk a quarter of a mile (without a walker)? That’s right. When it came to avoiding “major mobility disability” — which the researchers defined as becoming unable to walk 400 meters or more — a structured exercise program was better than a program of healthy aging education. Specifically, the researchers found that 30% of the exercisers experienced a period of major disability, compared to 35.5% of the seniors enrolled in the healthy aging education program. This is a very encouraging finding! That said, it’s also a bit sobering to realize that even with exercise, almost 1 in 3 older adults experienced a period of limited mobility, of which half lasted 6 months or more. In this post, I’ll share some more details on this study, because the results provide a wonderful wealth of information that can be helpful to older adults, family caregivers, and even geriatricians such as myself. Want to know how often the exercisers experienced “adverse events”? (Hint: often!) Wondering just what the structured exercise program involved? (Hint: more than walking!) Let’s dig into the details!

Select from: (I). Line a cardboard box with clean cutting board and place ducklings into the box about 24 hours after they're born, add a 100-watt bulb inside the box to keep them warm.; (II). Line a cardboard box with clean towels and place ducklings into the box about 24 hours after they're born, add a 100-watt bulb inside the box to keep them warm.;","completion":"Between the two options provided, option (II) which involves lining a cardboard box with clean towels and placing the ducklings into the box about 24 hours after they're born, with a 100-watt bulb inside the box to keep them warm, makes more sense in accomplishing the goal of preparing a container to take care of ducklings. Allow me to detail the reasoning behind this choice and provide a step-by-step guide to creating a safe and comfortable environment for the ducklings: 1. Choose a suitable container: Select a container that is large enough to accommodate the ducklings' growth. A plastic storage container with high sides, a large cardboard box, or even a small plastic swimming pool can be suitable options depending on the number of ducklings you have. 2. Line the container: Line the container with clean towels or non-slip mats instead of the cutting board mentioned in option (I). Towels and mats provide a softer surface, are more absorbent which will keep the container dry, and are safer for the ducklings to walk on without slipping. These are crucial factors in ensuring the ducklings' comfort and preventing injuries. 3. Place the ducklings in the container when appropriate: It is essential to place the ducklings into the designed box about 24 hours after they're born. This gives the ducklings time to dry off and adapt to their new environment. 4. Provide warmth: Add a 100-watt bulb or heat lamp inside the box to keep the ducklings warm. Since their body temperature should be maintained at around 90-92 degrees Fahrenheit (32-33 degrees Celsius) in their first week, a heat source is vital. Make sure the heat source is secure and does not pose a fire risk, and ensure that there is a cooler area within the container so the ducklings can move away from the heat if needed. 5. Monitor the temperature: Gradually reduce the temperature inside the container by about 5 degrees Fahrenheit (3 degrees Celsius) per week until they can handle the ambient temperature or are ready to be placed outdoors. Monitoring the temperatures ensures the ducklings' comfort and maintains their overall health. 6. Provide water and food: Supply a shallow dish of water for the ducklings, deep enough for them to submerge their bills but not deep enough for them to climb in and get soaked. Maintain a consistent supply of high-quality, non-medicated, waterfowl-specific feed. Place the water and food dishes in separate areas of the container, with the food dish located in the cooler area to prevent spoilage. 7. Keep the container clean: Regularly change the lining of the container and keep the area free from droppings or spilled food and water. This helps maintain a hygienic environment for the ducklings and helps reduce the risk of illness. 8. Provide a safe space: As the ducklings grow, they will become more active. Ensure that their container remains a safe space by monitoring their movements and adjusting the container size or sides as needed. Also, gradually introduce them to outdoor spaces while closely supervising them. By following these steps, Option (II) will be more successful in providing a comfortable, safe, and nurturing environment for the ducklings to grow and thrive in."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article with the title: \\"Hillary Clinton: Her Notable Moments\\"","completion":"Title: Hillary Clinton: Her Notable Moments Introduction Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton, born on October 26, 1947, has been a significant figure in American politics for decades and remains a trailblazer for women in politics. As First Lady, a senator, Secretary of State, and a two-time presidential candidate, Clinton has demonstrated great resilience and determination, which has earned her admiration and critiques alike. This article delves into some of the most notable moments in her political career, showcasing her impact, achievements, and the challenges she has faced. 1. Her early political life Clinton's political journey began early in her life. As a student at Wellesley College, she served as president of the Young Republicans Club. However, her political leanings shifted during the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War, which led her to become a Democrat. She later attended Yale Law School, where she met her future husband, Bill Clinton. 2. First Lady of the United States Hillary Clinton assumed the role of First Lady when her husband, Bill Clinton, was elected president in 1993. During her time in the White House, she became one of the most active and ambitious First Ladies in history. Her high-profile involvement in policy-making and administration was highlighted by her efforts to reform the healthcare system, with the ultimate goal of providing affordable healthcare to all Americans. Though the plan, dubbed \\"Hillarycare,\\" ultimately failed to be passed by Congress, it laid the groundwork for future healthcare reform efforts, such as the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). 3. Senator from New York In 2000, Hillary Clinton made history by becoming the first First Lady to seek and win public office, being elected as a U.S. Senator from New York. During her tenure in the Senate from 2001 to 2009, Clinton built a reputation as a diligent legislator, championing issues such as job creation, access to education, and national security. Notably, she was a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and was particularly dedicated to addressing the needs of the first responders and victims of the September 11 attacks. 4. 2008 presidential campaign Hillary Clinton announced her candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2007. Despite her solid experience and grassroots support, she ultimately lost to Barack Obama after a long and competitive primary race, which became one of the major milestones in her political career. Demonstrating her commitment to the Democratic Party, Clinton wholeheartedly endorsed Obama and played an active role in his campaign, further cementing her position as a political leader. 5. Secretary of State under President Obama Following the 2008 presidential election, Barack Obama nominated Clinton to become the United States Secretary of State, a role she served in from 2009 to 2013. In this position, Clinton played a significant role in shaping American foreign policy during Obama's presidency. She established diplomatic initiatives like the \\"pivot to Asia\\" and promoted human rights and gender equality around the world. One of her most notable achievements was her role in implementing strong economic sanctions on Iran, which eventually led to the Iran nuclear deal. 6. Benghazi attack and subsequent investigation Following the tragic 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, which led to the death of four Americans, Clinton faced harsh criticism and numerous investigations from her political opponents. While the investigations found no evidence of wrongdoing on her part, the events surrounding the Benghazi attack remained an enduring political controversy and a major challenge for her during her 2016 presidential campaign. 7. 2016 presidential campaign Hillary Clinton's second run for the presidency in 2016 was groundbreaking in many ways. She made history by becoming the first woman to win the presidential nomination of a major U.S. political party. Her campaign focused on progressive policy proposals, such as criminal justice reform, raising the minimum wage, and affordable healthcare expansion. Ultimately, she won the popular vote by nearly three million votes but lost the electoral college to her Republican opponent Donald Trump, marking a shocking and unexpected end to her presidential aspirations. 8. Post-election life After the 2016 election, Clinton remained active in public life, engaging in philanthropy, delivering speeches, and publishing books. Her memoir, \\"What Happened,\\" chronicles the events, challenges, and personal reflections from her perspective during the contentious election. Furthermore, she has been vocal in supporting Democratic candidates in the subsequent elections and advocating for various social and political issues. Conclusion Throughout her political career, Hillary Clinton has seen significant wins, losses, and controversies. From being a trailblazer for women in politics to facing setbacks in her political journey, her resilience and determination have left an indelible mark on American politics. Regardless of one's political affiliations or views, there is no denying that Hillary Clinton has played a key role in shaping progressive values and policies for years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the year 2000, Dick Harper has been promoted to Vice President of Communications for a large media corporation known as Globodyne. The following day, he is on a television program with presidential candidate Ralph Nader, who calls Globodyne \\"perverters of the American dream\\", claiming it helps the super-rich get even wealthier. As they speak, Globodyne's stock value collapses, rendering all investments – including all the employees' savings and pensions – worthless.

In an outcome few could have imagined several weeks ago, Jones defeated controversial Republican candidate Roy Moore, who had the backing of President Donald Trump. In the wake of Jones' victory, Democrats are more confident about success in next year's congressional midterm elections, and Republicans are looking for a way to rebound. Late Tuesday, Jones paid tribute to the voters and staffers who supported him in his longshot victory over Moore. \\"This campaign has been about common courtesy and decency and making sure everyone in this state, regardless of which ZIP code you live in, is going to get a fair shake in life!\\" he told supporters. Moore was unable to overcome allegations of sexual misconduct stemming back decades involving several women who were teenagers at the time while Moore was in his 30s. Moore stopped short of conceding the race, however, saying, \\"We have been painted in an unfavorable and unfaithful light. We have been put in a hole, if you will, and it reminds me of a [Bible] passage in Psalms 40, 'I waited patiently for the Lord.'

Q:Process: - Human industry produces chemical compounds - Chemical compounds rise into the air - Chemical compounds mix with elements in clouds - The affected rain falls to the earth - The affected rain can harm natural and man-made objects because of its acidic content. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the climate changes dramatically happens, how will it affect less affected rain to fall. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation assumption of a dramatic climate change could indeed have both direct and indirect impacts on the process, potentially leading to less acidic rain falling. Here are some possible effects: 1. Direct Effects on Emission Sources: The key driver of acid rain is the human industry emitting chemicals like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. A dramatic change in the climate could affect the efficiency or operation of these industries. For instance, it could lead to stricter regulations on emissions to mitigate climate change, which would reduce the number of chemical compounds released into the air. Similarly, a significant shift in temperature could impact the energy consumption patterns, hence the pollution generated. Higher temperatures might reduce the demand for heating oil and coal, leading to fewer emissions, while lower temperatures could increase the need for heat and subsequently increase emissions. 2. Altered Atmospheric Chemistry: Acid rain is produced when chemicals like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides react with elements in the atmosphere. Climate change can modify these reactions. It could change the temperature, humidity, and amount of sunlight present, which can all affect how quickly and effectively these reactions occur. Therefore, alterations to the atmospheric chemistry can result in less acid rain. 3. Precipitation Patterns: Climate change can dramatically alter global precipitation patterns resulting in either more or less rain in general. If there's less rainfall overall, there will be less acid rain too. However, it's worth noting that even though less acid rain might fall, the rain that does fall might be more acidic if the concentration of pollutants is still high. 4. Effects on Natural Carbon Sinks: In addition to industrial sources, acid rain is also affected by the balance of naturally occurring carbon sinks like trees and soil. As climate change progresses, natural carbon sinks might decrease due to deforestation or changes in soil composition. This could result in less acid rain, since these carbon sinks help neutralize acid components in the rain. 5. Wind Patterns and Dispersion: Climate change can influence wind patterns, which play a critical role in the dispersion of pollutants over vast distances. If there is a shift causing pollutants to be dispersed over a greater area, the acidity of the resulting rain within a localized area might decline. Based on these factors, it's clear that dramatic climate change could indeed have an impact on the amount of acid rain that falls. It's important to note, however, that these effects could be positive or negative. While some changes might reduce the amount of acid rain, others might increase it or make it more concentrated. Therefore, while the perturbation hypothesis you suggested could cause less affected rain to fall, it's not a guaranteed outcome. Comprehensive research and climate modelling would be necessary to make more specific predictions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Background: Michael Joseph Piazza (; born September 4, 1968) is an American former professional baseball catcher who played 16 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), from 1992 to 2007. He played most notably for the New York Mets and Los Angeles Dodgers, while also having brief stints with the Florida Marlins, San Diego Padres, and Oakland Athletics. A 12-time All-Star and 10-time Silver Slugger Award winner at catcher, Piazza produced strong offensive numbers at his position; in his career, he recorded 427 home runs--a record 396 of which were hit as catcher--along with a .308 batting average and 1,335 runs batted in (RBIs). Piazza was drafted by the Dodgers in the 1988 MLB draft as a favor from Tommy Lasorda to Piazza's father. Context: After his father asked Lasorda to select Piazza as a favor, the Miami-Dade Community College student was drafted by the Dodgers in the 62nd round of the 1988 MLB amateur draft as the 1,390th player picked overall. Lasorda asked Piazza to give up his first base position and learn how to catch to improve his chances of reaching the major leagues, and helped him attend a special training camp for catchers in the Dominican Republic. Piazza became an excellent hitter, especially for a catcher. His MLB debut came with the Dodgers on September 1, 1992, against the Chicago Cubs. He drew a walk in his first plate appearance and then doubled to deep center field in his first official at-bat, against Mike Harkey of the Cubs. He hit his first home run on September 12, 1992, against Steve Reed of the San Francisco Giants. He only appeared in 21 games that season, hitting .232. He won the NL MLB Rookie of the Year Award in 1993 after appearing in 149 games, hitting .318, slugging 35 home runs, and driving in 112 RBIs. He was also selected to the 1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, his first of 10 consecutive (and 12 total) All-Star appearances. Until Joc Pederson passed him in 2015, Piazza's 18 home runs before the All Star break was a Dodgers' rookie record. In 1996, Piazza hit .336 with 36 home runs and 105 RBIs, finishing second in MVP voting, behind Ken Caminiti. Piazza's best season with the Dodgers was 1997, when he hit .362, with 40 home runs, 124 RBIs, an on-base percentage of .431, and a slugging percentage of .638. He finished second in voting MVP for the second consecutive season, behind Larry Walker. Question: Did he receive any other recognition besides MVP?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, Michael Joseph Piazza received several other recognitions and accolades throughout his career besides the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award consideration. Some of his most notable achievements include: 1. Rookie of the Year Award: Piazza won the National League (NL) Rookie of the Year Award in 1993, an outstanding achievement for a player in his debut season. He showcased an impressive performance, hitting .318 with 35 home runs and 112 runs batted in (RBIs). 2. All-Star Selections: Piazza was selected to the Major League Baseball All-Star Game 12 times during his career, with 10 consecutive appearances from 1993 to 2002. This recognition highlights his consistent high-level performance as one of the best players in the league throughout his career. 3. Silver Slugger Awards: Piazza received the Silver Slugger Award 10 times during his career, an honor given to the best offensive players at each position in both the American League (AL) and National League (NL). Winning the award 10 times at the catcher position highlights his exceptional abilities and strong offensive numbers throughout his career. 4. Hall of Fame Induction: Piazza was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2016. This prestigious honor is given to players who have made significant contributions to the sport and achieved exceptional success throughout their careers. In summary, Michael Piazza's impressive career not only included MVP considerations, but also multiple recognitions such as the Rookie of the Year Award, All-Star selections, Silver Slugger Awards, and a Hall of Fame induction, which all solidify his legacy as one of the greatest catchers and offensive players in Major League Baseball history."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Mickey is a New York City blue-collared taxi driver, unhappy over an act of infidelity committed by Heather (Cameron Diaz), his ex-fiancÃ©e. Francis is a white-collared Wall Street stock investor, who unknown to his wife, Renee (Jennifer Aniston), is having an affair. During weekends, Mickey and Francis visit their parents who live on Long Island. Their mother is never seen on screen, while they have better time interacting with their father, Frank (John Mahoney), who always gives Mickey and Francis advice to live out their lives any way they can and to always go for what drives them to succeed. While driving his cab one day, Mickey picks up Hope (Maxine Bahns), an NYU art student with whom he becomes infatuated and impulsively marries after a few days. This causes consternation for his brother, largely because he was not asked to be best man at the wedding. Mickey moves in with Hope, but later becomes disillusioned with aspects of their lifestyle, including frequent power cuts in their ramshackle apartment. Francis is also having problems in his marriage. He is concerned that he is being unfair to Heather, his mistress, the same woman Mickey left, by continuing to stay with Renee. At the same time, Renee's Italian-American family, mostly her younger sister Molly (Amanda Peet), suggest the problem with Francis' lack of interest in her is that he may be gay, so she has Mickey and their father, Frank, confront him about it. He denies being gay, but admits to being unfaithful.

The Twister is a type of amusement ride that spins around and can include tilting, shaking and bouncing elements. While this kind of ride may provoke motion sickness in some people, it certainly does not affect everyone in the same way. There are several factors that may contribute to whether a person might feel nausea or need to vomit after or during an amusement ride. These factors include but are not limited to: 1. Individual Susceptibility: Some people are more prone to motion sickness than others. This susceptibility can depend on various factors ranging from genetics to eating habits, and it's possible that some individuals may feel sick while others do not. 2. Ride Duration: The length of time one spends on a ride can impact how they feel during and after the ride. The longer the ride, the more likely it is that a person might experience some level of discomfort. 3. Pre-existing Conditions: Certain medical conditions can exacerbate feelings of nausea or motion sickness. For instance, a person who suffers from a balance disorder or has an inner ear condition could be more likely to feel unwell on such rides. 4. Stress and Fear: The emotional state of a person can also play a significant role. If someone is anxious, fearful, or stressed about the ride, they can be more susceptible to feeling sick. Therefore, the statement does not necessarily mean that all people who ride the Twister are about to vomit. Some might, but many might also enjoy the ride without any ill effects.

When someone says, \\"Well, I guess I'll have to go to face the music\\", it does not mean he is planning to go to a concert. It is something far less pleasant, like being called in by your boss to explain why you did this or that, and why you did not do this or that. Sour(; )music, indeed, but it has to be faced. The phrase \\"to face the music\\" is familiar to every American, young and old. It is at least 100 years old. Where did the expression come from? The first information comes from the American writer James Fennimore Cooper. He said in 1851 that the expression was first used by actors while waiting in the wings to go on stage. After they got their cue(,) to go on, they often said, \\"It's time to go to face the music.\\" And that is exactly what they did--- face the orchestra which was just below the stage. An actor might be frightened or nervous as he moved on to the stage in front of the audience that might be friendly or perhaps unfriendly especially if he forgot his lines. But he had to go out. So, \\"to face the music\\" came to mean having to go through something, no matter how unpleasant the experience might be, because you knew you had no choice. The other explanation comes from the army. Men had to face inspection by their leader. The soldiers worried about how well they looked. Was their equipment clean--shiny enough to pass inspection? Still, the men had to go out, and face the music of the band, as well as the inspection. What else could they do? The phrase 'to face the music\\" was first used by _ .

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context? Context: Laura Warholic; or, The Sexual Intellectual is a 2007 novel by Alexander Theroux. The plot concerns the relationship between Eugene Eyestones, the writer of an advice column called \\"The Sexual Intellectual\\", and his editor's ex-wife, Laura Warholic, whom Eyestones pities more than likes. This basic story provides the jumping off point for Theroux's satire of American culture. Hypothesis: Laura Warholic in essence helped to kick off Alexander Theroux's satire of American Culture.","completion":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that Laura Warholic in essence helped to kick off Alexander Theroux's satire of American Culture from the given context. The context mentions that the 2007 novel \\"Laura Warholic; or, The Sexual Intellectual\\" by Alexander Theroux focuses on the relationship between Eugene Eyestones, the writer of an advice column called \\"The Sexual Intellectual,\\" and his editor's ex-wife, Laura Warholic, whom Eyestones pities more than likes. The interactions and dynamic between these two characters form the basis of the satire, serving as a starting point for a broader critique of American culture. To elaborate, Theroux's novel exposes various aspects of American society through the relationship between the book's central characters, Eugene and Laura. The title itself hints at both the intellectual and the sexual aspects of their relationship, creating an ironic commentary on the complex dynamics between the two. Eugene's occupation as an advice columnist allows Theroux to delve into a variety of societal issues, including the effects of contemporary media, moral dilemmas, and the complexities of human relationships. Laura serves as the catalyst for Eugene's exploration into these societal concerns, as her presence in his life compels him to both continuously scrutinize and offer guidance on these topics. Furthermore, Laura is a representation of modern American society, with her flaws and contradictions amplifying the satire of the cultural critique. The initial sympathy Eugene feels towards her eventually transforms into a sense of frustration, reflecting the novel's ongoing exploration of different aspects of American culture. In summary, the hypothesis that Laura Warholic helped to kick off Alexander Theroux's satire of American Culture can be drawn from the context. As the titular character, Laura Warholic's relationship with Eugene Eyestones embodies the novel's central themes, allowing Theroux to launch an exploration of various aspects of contemporary American society. The novel uses the interplay between the characters to expose and critique cultural norms, highlighting the issues and complexities that exist within this social landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Joe unit, which is framed for stealing nuclear warheads from Pakistan by Zartan (Arnold Vosloo), who is impersonating the President of the United States (Jonathan Pryce). The unit is subsequently decimated in a military air strike with Duke among the casualties. The only survivors are Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Flint (D.J. Cotrona), and Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki). Meanwhile, Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) and Firefly (Ray Stevenson) rescue Cobra Commander (Luke Bracey) from an underground maximum-security prison in Germany, leaving Destro behind. Storm Shadow is injured during the escape and retreats to a temple in the Himalayas to recover. Upon learning that he is alive, the Blind Master (RZA), leader of the Arashikage Clan, sends Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and his apprentice Jinx (Ãlodie Yung), Storm Shadow's cousin, to capture Storm Shadow so he can answer for the murder of his uncle, the Hard Master. Roadblock, Flint, and Lady Jaye return to the United States where they set up a base of operations in a rundown gym. After Zartan announces that Cobra will replace the Joes as America's elite special forces unit, Lady Jaye deduces that someone is impersonating the President, and Roadblock leads them to General Joseph Colton (Bruce Willis), who provides them with weapons, and helps them infiltrate a fundraising event that the President will be attending.

Samantha and Amy were best friends and neighbors, living in a small yet charming cul-de-sac. Their house windows faced each other, making it easier for the two friends to communicate and keep an eye on each other's pets while they were away. Samantha's rat, affectionately named Remy, was quite the unusual pet compared to others in the neighborhood. Yet, Samantha adored this little creature with all her heart. Remy was an intelligent and empathetic pet, sensing his owner's emotions and always comforting her when she needed it. His curious nature led him to explore every nook and cranny of Samantha's home, mapping it all in his tiny rat brain. Amy's dog, a beautiful golden retriever named Daisy, was her pride and joy. Daisy was friendly, loyal, and loved to play fetch in the park. Amy took Daisy on long walks, hikes, and even outdoor movie nights. They were truly inseparable and had formed an incredible bond over the years. Amy considered Daisy not just a pet but a member of her family. One sunny afternoon, Samantha had to leave for a business trip and asked Amy to take care of Remy during her absence. Amy, being the good friend that she was, agreed without hesitation. Samantha provided Amy with all the necessary instructions on taking care of Remy and prepared a comfy place for him in her friend's house. As days went by, Remy started to find his new environment fascinating. He accidentally bumped into Daisy and, to his surprise, Daisy didn't look at him as prey. The gentle-hearted Daisy took a liking to the tiny rat, and they soon became friends, playing and exploring Amy's home together. During their escapades, Remy and Daisy discovered they could learn from each other. Remy's ability to navigate tight spaces and reach hidden areas meant Daisy could fetch long-lost toys and items while also locating secret treats in Amy's kitchen. On the other hand, Daisy's ability to reach high places and her persistence in solving small problems inspired Remy to venture beyond his comfort zone. As Samantha returned from her business trip, Amy excitedly shared the incredible friendship that had blossomed between Remy and Daisy. Samantha was thrilled that her rat and Amy's dog shared a unique and beautiful bond. This development further strengthened the connection between the two friends, as they now witnessed their pets' relationships mirroring their own. The neighborhood would often see Samantha and Amy walking side by side, with Daisy calmly strolling along and Remy perched on her back, observing the world from a new perspective. Both Remy and Daisy showed others that even unlikely friendships could be touching and exceptionally strong. As time went on, Samantha and Amy's houses became a sanctuary for their wonderful pets, and occasionally for neighboring pets too. Their homes were where love, compassion, and an appreciation for the eclectic nature of relationships truly flourished. Samantha, Amy, Remy, and Daisy became a perfect example of how breaking stereotypes and embracing diversity could open hearts, minds, and new horizons, creating a loving and accepting community that celebrated the strength of connection, no matter how seemingly strange or unexpected."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade.

Here is a detailed analysis of the sentences and their similarities: 1. \\"Originally from Sydney, Holmes attended the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra.\\" This sentence begins with the phrase \\"Originally from Sydney,\\" which acts as an adjective modifying Holmes. It tells us that Holmes' origins are in Sydney. The main clause of the sentence, \\"Holmes attended the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra,\\" shares the information about Holmes' attendance at the sports institute in Canberra. 2. \\"Holmes, who is originally from Sydney, attended the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra.\\" The second sentence also provides the same information about Holmes' origin and attendance at the sports institute but is structured differently. In this case, the phrase \\"who is originally from Sydney\\" is placed between commas and serves as a relative clause. This relative clause is used to give additional information about Holmes, specifying his origins in Sydney. The main clause remains the same, presenting the information about Holmes' attendance at the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra. In summary, while both sentences are structured differently and rely on different grammatical constructions to convey the information, they both ultimately mean the same thing - that Holmes is originally from Sydney and attended the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

American Airlines Flight 11: FAA Awareness. Although the Boston Center air traffic controller realized at an early stage that there was something wrong with American 11, he did not immediately interpret the plane's failure to respond as a sign that it had been hijacked. At 8:14, when the flight failed to heed his instruction to climb to 35,000 feet, the controller repeatedly tried to raise the flight. He reached out to the pilot on the emergency frequency. Though there was no response, he kept trying to contact the aircraft. At 8:21, American 11 turned off its transponder, immediately degrading the information available about the aircraft. The controller told his supervisor that he thought something was seriously wrong with the plane, although neither suspected a hijacking. The supervisor instructed the controller to follow standard procedures for handling a \\"no radio\\" aircraft. The controller checked to see if American Airlines could establish communication with American 11. He became even more concerned as its route changed, moving into another sector's airspace. Controllers immediately began to move aircraft out of its path, and asked other aircraft in the vicinity to look for American 11. At 8:24:38, the following transmission came from American 11: American 11: We have some planes. Just stay quiet, and you'll be okay. We are returning to the airport.

Information: - Nostoc is a genus of cyanobacteria found in various environments that forms colonies composed of filaments of moniliform cells in a gelatinous sheath. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Glomeromycota (informally glomeromycetes) is one of seven currently recognized divisions within the kingdom Fungi, with approximately 230 described species. Members of the Glomeromycota form arbuscular mycorrhizas (AMs) with the roots or thalli (e.g. in bryophytes) of land plants. \\"Geosiphon pyriformis\\" forms an endocytobiotic association with \\"Nostoc\\" cyanobacteria, and is the only member of the Glomeromycota known not to form arbuscular mycorrhiza in association with plants. AM formation has not yet been shown for all species. The majority of evidence shows that the Glomeromycota are symbionts with land plants (\\"Nostoc\\" in the case of \\"Geosiphon\\") for carbon and energy, but there is recent circumstantial evidence that some species may be able to lead an independent existence. The arbuscular mycorrhizal species are terrestrial and widely distributed in soils worldwide where they form symbioses with the roots of the majority of plant species (>80%). They can also be found in wetlands, including salt-marshes, and associated with epiphytic plants. - An arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (plural \\"mycorrhizae\\" or \\"mycorrhizas\\", a.k.a. \\"endomycorrhiza\\", \\"AM fungi\\", or AMF) is a type of mycorrhiza in which the fungus penetrates the cortical cells of the roots of a vascular plant. Arbuscular mycorrhizas are characterized by the formation of unique structures, arbuscules and vesicles by fungi of the phylum Glomeromycota. AM fungi help plants to capture nutrients such as phosphorus, sulfur, nitrogen and micronutrients from the soil. It is believed that the development of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis played a crucial role in the initial colonisation of land by plants and in the evolution of the vascular plants. - The Diversisporales are an order of generally hypogeous ( underground ) arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi within the division Glomeromycota . Many have vesicles for energy storage , or auxiliary cells . Species produce a wide range of spore types , hence the name . - Bryophyte is a traditional name used to refer to all embryophytes (land plants) that are non-vascular plants, namely the mosses, hornworts, and liverworts. The defining features of bryophytes are that their life cycles are dominated by the gametophyte stage, that their sporophytes are unbranched and that they do not have a true vascular tissue containing lignin, although some have specialized tissues for the transport of water. Bryophytes are usually considered to be a paraphyletic group and not a natural (monophyletic) group, although some studies have produced contrary results. Regardless of their status, the name is convenient and remains in use as an informal collective term. Bryophytes produce enclosed reproductive structures (gametangia and sporangia), but they produce neither flowers nor seeds, reproducing via spores. The term \\"bryophyte\\" comes from Greek , \\"bryon\\", \\"tree-moss, oyster-green\\" + \\"phyton\\" \\"plant\\". - A wetland is a land area that is saturated with water, either permanently or seasonally, such that it takes on the characteristics of a distinct ecosystem. The primary factor that distinguishes wetlands from other land forms or water bodies is the characteristic vegetation of aquatic plants, adapted to the unique hydric soil. Wetlands play a number of roles in the environment, principally water purification, flood control, carbon sink and shoreline stability. Wetlands are also considered the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as home to a wide range of plant and animal life. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life.

The suggestion was to shape the city like a harbor .The outer wall of the harbor would stand on steel columns resting on the sea-bed. Naturally this could only be where the water was fairly shallow. The people would like to live in flats in the fifty-metre high outer wall. The flats would be all face inwards, and would be made of concrete and glass. The glass would be specially made and colored to control the heat and strong light from the sun. The planners called this man-made harbor would be calm.

On one of the islands would be a special factory to take the salt out of sea water and turn it into fresh water. People living in the city could move around on small boats driven by electricity, so there would be no air pollution from the burning of gas.

Q:Process: - Aluminium cans are put into a recycling bin - Aluminium cans are then collected and taken to a treatment plant - At the treatment plant the aluminium is sorted and cleaned - Readied for reprocessing - The aluminum cans go through a re-melt process - Turned into molten aluminium - The molten aluminum is made into large blocks called ingots - The ingots are sent to mills and are rolled out into thin sheets - The rolls are ready to be made into new aluminum products. Question: suppose more turned into ingots happens, how will it affect MORE aluminum cans being recycled. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"If more aluminum is turned into ingots, it will have a more significant effect on the recycling of aluminum cans. This is because an increase in the production of ingots directly correlates to the amount of recycled aluminum available for use in manufacturing new products, specifically aluminum cans in this case. The perturbation mentioned in the question affects the second effect in the following ways: 1. More ingots production leads to increased availability of recycled aluminum: When more aluminum cans are melted into ingots, it means that a higher percentage of the aluminum waste collected has been recycled and processed into usable raw material. This means there will be more recycled aluminum available to be turned into new aluminum products like cans, reducing the need for producing aluminum from raw materials. 2. Positive environmental impact: Recycling aluminum conserves resources and energy, as it requires significantly less energy to recycle aluminum compared to producing it from raw materials such as bauxite. This reduced energy consumption leads to reduced greenhouse gas emissions, thus positively impacting the environment. Consequently, an increase in the production of ingots from recycled aluminum cans enhances the overall environmental benefits of the recycling process. 3. Economic benefits: In addition to the environmental benefits, recycling aluminum is also economically efficient, as the cost of producing aluminum from recycled materials is lower than the cost of producing it from raw materials. As more ingots are produced from recycled aluminum cans, it creates more economic incentives for industries to invest further in recycling, leading to more capacity expansion in aluminum recycling facilities. This will enable the process to handle more aluminum cans effectively, hence increasing the overall recycling rate. 4. More aluminum cans being recycled leads to more demand for recycling facilities: As more aluminum cans are turned into ingots, it creates a need for more recycling facilities to process and recycle the large volume of aluminum cans generated daily. This increase in recycling capacity will accommodate and process more aluminum cans to be recycled, contributing to the growth of the recycling industry as a whole and helping the aluminum industry transition to a more circular economy-based model. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of more aluminum cans being turned into ingots directly leads to a greater effect on aluminum cans recycling, as it increases the overall availability of recycled aluminum for new product manufacturing, and enhances the environmental and economic benefits of recycling aluminum. These factors together contribute to an increase in the capacity and effectiveness of recycling facilities, ultimately leading to more aluminum cans being recycled."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What suite written for military band remains a brassbands staple? Holst's settings of Indian texts formed only a part of his compositional output in the period 1900 to 1914. A highly significant factor in his musical development was the English folksong revival, evident in the orchestral suite A Somerset Rhapsody (1906–07), a work that was originally to be based around eleven folksong themes; this was later reduced to four. Observing the work's kinship with Vaughan Williams's Norfolk Rhapsody, Dickinson remarks that, with its firm overall structure, Holst's composition \\"rises beyond the level of ... a song-selection\\". Imogen acknowledges that Holst's discovery of English folksongs \\"transformed his orchestral writing\\", and that the composition of A Somerset Rhapsody did much to banish the chromaticisms that had dominated his early compositions. In the Two Songs without Words of 1906, Holst showed that he could create his own original music using the folk idiom. An orchestral folksong fantasy Songs of the West, also written in 1906, was withdrawn by the composer and never published, although it emerged in the 1980s in the form of an arrangement for wind band by James Curnow. In the years before the First World War, Holst composed in a variety of genres. Matthews considers the evocation of a North African town in the Beni Mora suite of 1908 the composer's most individual work to that date; the third movement gives a preview of minimalism in its constant repetition of a four-bar theme. Holst wrote two suites for military band, in E flat (1909) and F major (1911) respectively, the first of which became and remains a brass-band staple. This piece, a highly original and substantial musical work, was a signal departure from what Short describes as \\"the usual transcriptions and operatic selections which pervaded the band repertoire\\". Also in 1911 he wrote Hecuba's Lament, a setting of Gilbert Murray's translation from Euripides built on a seven-beat refrain designed, says Dickinson, to represent Hecuba's defiance of divine wrath. In 1912 Holst composed two psalm settings, in which...

The premise refers to a \\"7 million VSL (Value of Statistical Life),\\" which is an estimate of the financial value society is willing to pay to reduce the risk of a fatality by one. In this case, the VSL is stated to be worth 163,000 a year, based on the EPA's guideline value of a 3% discount rate. The same VSL is also worth 270,000 a year under the OMB's (Office of Management and Budget) guideline value of a 7% discount rate. Discount rates are crucial in determining the present value of future costs and benefits, as they help quantify the time preferences of individuals and organizations in evaluating projects or policies. Higher discount rates lead to lower present values, making future benefits and costs less significant than immediate ones. Conversely, lower discount rates lead to higher present values, emphasizing the importance of future benefits and costs for decision making. Taking this into account, the EPA's 3% discount rate reflects a relatively lower time preference for the agency, highlighting its consideration for the long-term consequences of projects and policies on the environment and public health, as opposed to the more substantial short-term gains sought by OMB's 7% discount rate. In conclusion, it is true that based on the given premise, \\"The EPA has a guideline value of a 3% discount rate.\\" It reflects the agency's consideration of long-term environmental and health impacts in decision-making and serves as a critical parameter when evaluating the Value of Statistical Life and other cost-benefit assessments."},{"prompt":"What are Fiddler and Fifer doing when the Wolf attacks them?

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Last week we talked about healthy eating on a budget. Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget. It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example: you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall. Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: When does the author advise that adding super foods should occur after beginning clean eating? Options: A. one does not have to eat \\"super foods\\" at any time since clean eating is possible without them B. not enough information C. when one is able to acquire produce in bulk D. after reading \\"experts\\" advice on clean eating Answer:","completion":"A. one does not have to eat \\"super foods\\" at any time since clean eating is possible without them"},{"prompt":"What is the last name of the person who suffered a heart attack at a concert after singing her hit song \\"Pata Pata\\"?

Mandela was released in February 1990. He persuaded Makeba to return to South Africa, which she did, using her French passport, on 10 June 1990. Makeba, Gillespie, Simone, and Masekela recorded and released her studio album, Eyes on Tomorrow, in 1991. It combined jazz, R&B, pop, and traditional African music, and was a hit across Africa. Makeba and Gillespie then toured the world together to promote it. In November she made a guest appearance on a US sitcom, The Cosby Show. In 1992, she starred in the film Sarafina!, which centred on students involved in the 1976 Soweto uprising.

The Council is the legislative branch of the local government of Washington, D.C., responsible for enacting laws and managing the city's budget. 4. Represented area: Nadeau represents Ward 1, one of the eight political divisions in Washington, D.C. Each ward elects a member to the Council of the District of Columbia to represent their interests. 5. Date of taking office: She took office on January 2, 2015, which means she has been serving as a Councilmember for over six years. 6.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: \\"okay you too bye-bye\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"No, don't do that.\\"?","completion":"The premise \\"okay you too bye-bye\\" and the hypothesis \\"No, don't do that\\" appear to have no direct logical correlation between them. Entailment in logic means that the truth of one statement (the premise) necessitates the truth of another statement (the hypothesis). Here's a breakdown of how that looks in this context: The premise \\"okay you too bye-bye\\" is a common, casual valediction or closing statement for a conversation. It carries no inherent negativity or prohibition, so it doesn't inherently imply any form of refusal or negation. On the other hand, \\"No, don't do that\\" is a clear negation or protest. It's a phrase that denotes disagreement, refusal or a request to halt some form of action. In this context, it's crucial to note that the above two statements could be part of a conversation but they don't necessarily entail one another. For entailment to exist, there should be a specific, logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis such that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true. However, in this case, the hypothesis \\"No, don't do that\\" could be completely unrelated to the premise \\"okay you too bye-bye\\". The premise does not provide enough information or context for us to understand whether the person being addressed is about to engage in something that may require a protest or negation. Therefore, the truth of the premise does not logically guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. It is entirely possible for someone to say \\"okay you too bye-bye\\" and not proceed with \\"No, don't do that\\". In conclusion, based on the provided premise and the proposed hypothesis, this premise does not entail the hypothesis. Even if “okay you too bye-bye” is true, it doesn't logically necessitate that \\"No, don't do that\\" is also true. Each statement exists independently of the other and can be valid or true under different circumstances. The premise does not set up a condition for the hypothesis to be valid or invalid, so they do not have entailment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The last step of the process is the elimination of the synthesized urea, as well as other waste products and toxins, from the body through the circulatory system to the kidneys, where they are eventually excreted in the form of urine. To better understand this entire process, let's briefly review the main functions mentioned and then discuss the final step in more detail: 1. Blood filtration: The liver filters blood from the digestive tract, purifying it from toxins and harmful substances. This helps maintain the overall health and balance of the body. 2. Bile production: The liver produces bile, a greenish-yellow fluid that aids in the digestion and absorption of fats. Bile is stored in the gallbladder and released into the small intestine when needed. 3. Blood plasma proteins: The liver is responsible for producing proteins that are crucial components of blood plasma, such as albumin and clotting factors. These proteins play essential roles in maintaining blood volume and pressure, as well as blood clotting. 4. Glucose to glycogen conversion: The liver helps regulate blood sugar levels by converting excess glucose into glycogen, a storage form of glucose that can be later broken down and released when the body needs energy. 5. Ammonia to urea conversion: The liver detoxifies ammonia, a toxic byproduct produced from the breakdown of proteins, by converting it into a less toxic compound called urea. The last step of the process - elimination of urea and other waste products: After the liver has completed its various functions, including converting ammonia to urea, the newly synthesized urea is released into the bloodstream. The blood carrying urea and other waste products is transported to the kidneys. The kidneys play a vital role in filtering and purifying the blood, removing excess water, electrolytes, and waste products, including urea, from the bloodstream. This filtering process occurs in structures called nephrons, which are the functional units of the kidneys. The waste products and excess water filtered out of the blood in the nephrons then form urine. This urine is then collected in the renal pelvis, which leads to the ureters that transport it down to the urinary bladder. The bladder stores the urine until it's released from the body during the process of urination. In summary, the liver is an essential organ with various vital functions, including detoxification, metabolism regulation, and blood purification. The final step of the process, after completing its main roles, is the elimination of waste products, such as urea and toxins, from the body through the circulatory system and kidneys, followed by their excretion in the form of urine."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.\\".

Article: How to Study Smarter, Not Harder Here are some of our favorite study tips that will help any student study smarter, not harder: Recite As You Study Reciting--saying things out loud should first take place as you read through each paragraph or section. Test yourself. This will help you to understand as well as learn faster because it is more active than reading or listening. It will also help you to notice your mistakes and the topics you have trouble understanding. Take Fuller Notes Notes should be in your own words, brief and clear. They should be tidy and easy to read. Writing notes will help you better than just underlining as you read, since it forces you to rewrite ideas in your own words. Study the Middle The best time to review is soon after you've learned something. You are more likely to remember the material at the beginning and the end of the lesson, so make sure you focus on the middle when you review. Sleep On It Study before going to bed, unless you are very tired. It's easier to remember material you've just learned after sleeping than after an equal period of daytime activity, because your brain continues to think even after you've fallen asleep. Combine Memory and Understanding There are two ways to remember: by memorizing and by understanding. Multiplication tables, telephone numbers, and math formulas are better learned by rote. Ideas are best learned by understanding. The more ways you have to think about an idea, the more meaning it will have; the more meaningful the learning, the better you can remember it. Pay attention to similarities in ideas and concepts, and then try to understand how they fit in with things you already know. Never be satisfied with anything less than a completely clear understanding of what you are reading. If you are not able to follow the thought, go back to the place where you first got confused and try again. Question: When taking notes, you should _ to better help you with reading.

The 1980 Bank Robbery in Central Nyack that was medically managed at the Nyack Hospital where I responded to the ONLY Code 66 of my career. That “66”indicated for us an external disaster about to unload in our emergency room. The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries. Additionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior. The friends of the injured policemen were trying to get to these villains and it was just the most awful evening of my life. To this day I remember feeling nauseous in a way I had never felt before. We had debriefing sessions for weeks and of course were very upset for months. The wounds we had to address, the insertion of chest tubes and everything else all in such a rapid manner was indeed a more than gross situation. There was even open heart massage.

Question: Given the following context: Carl August Nielsen (Danish: [kɑːl ˈnelsn̩]; 9 June 1865 – 3 October 1931) was a Danish musician, conductor and violinist, widely recognized as his country's most prominent composer. Brought up by poor yet musically talented parents on the island of Funen, he demonstrated his musical abilities at an early age. He initially played in a military band before attending the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen from 1884 until December 1886. He premiered his Op. 1, Suite for Strings, in 1888, at the age of 23. The following year, Nielsen began a 16-year stint as a second violinist in the Royal Danish Orchestra under the conductor Johan Svendsen, during which he played in Giuseppe Verdi's Falstaff and Otello at their Danish premieres. In 1916, he took a post teaching at the Royal Danish Academy and continued to work there until his death. Although his symphonies, concertos and choral music are now internationally acclaimed, Nielsen's career and personal life were marked by many difficulties, often reflected in his music. The works he composed between 1897 and 1904 are sometimes ascribed to his \\"psychological\\" period, resulting mainly from a turbulent marriage with the sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen. Nielsen is especially noted for his six symphonies, his Wind Quintet and his concertos for violin, flute and clarinet. In Denmark, his opera Maskarade and many of his songs have become an integral part of the national heritage. His early music was inspired by composers such as Brahms and Grieg, but he soon developed his own style, first experimenting with progressive tonality and later diverging even more radically from the standards of composition still common at the time. Nielsen's sixth and final symphony, Sinfonia semplice, was written in 1924–25. He died from a heart attack six years later, and is buried in Vestre Cemetery, Copenhagen. Nielsen maintained the reputation of a musical outsider during his lifetime, both in his own country and internationally.

After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries. Which country would have higher labor supply in response to their taxation? Hint: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue. A:","completion":"Based on the Laffer curve and the taxation policies implemented by West Germany and France after World War II, West Germany would likely have a higher labor supply in response to their taxation policies. West Germany implemented a tax rate below the critical rate, as mentioned in your question. This means that their pro-capitalist governments chose to keep taxes at a relatively low level to encourage economic growth and investment. According to the Laffer curve, lower taxation rates can lead to increased labor supply, as individuals and businesses have higher incentives to work and earn income. This is because they can retain a larger portion of their earnings due to the lower taxation rate. Conversely, France implemented a tax rate above the critical rate under their pro-socialist governments. This would have the opposite effect on labor supply, as higher taxes can discourage individuals and businesses from working and investing, given that they are required to pay a larger portion of their income to the government in the form of taxes. As a result, this policy can lead to a decrease in labor supply and, ultimately, a decline in government revenue. In conclusion, given the taxation policies of both countries after World War II, West Germany would likely experience a higher labor supply in comparison to France, owing to their lower taxation rate. This can be supported by the Laffer curve, which illustrates the relationship between taxation rates and their effect on labor supply and government revenue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Available options: --The narrator feels that Becca is low - maintenance . --None of the above choices . --The narrator feels that Becca is very pretty . --The narrator feels that Becca is demanding .","completion":"--The narrator feels that Becca is demanding. In the text, Becca is asking the narrator for not just one, but two favors right before they are about to leave. The narrator rolls their eyes at Becca, which shows that they feel she is being demanding. The other options don't make sense because they are not related to rolling their eyes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write some highlights for the following article: African Union soldiers in Somalia have raped and sexually exploited women and girls as young as 12 on their peacekeeping bases, a new report by an international human rights group has alleged. Human Rights Watch said the soldiers, relying on Somali intermediaries, have at times targeted women and girls who enter the bases through guarded gates seeking medical assistance or water. The New York-based group said it interviewed 21 women and girls since 2013 who described being sexually abused or sexually exploited by Burundian or Ugandan military personnel in two bases in Mogadishu. African Union soldiers in Somalia have raped and sexually exploited women and girls as young as 12, a new report by an international human rights group has alleged (file picture) Ten separate incidents of sexual abuse, including rape and sexual assault, and 14 cases of sexual exploitation were documented during the period, the rights group said. Four of the rape cases and one sexual assault involved girls under 18. The youngest victim was a 12-year-old girl who was allegedly raped by a Ugandan soldier. Several women said the soldiers refused to wear condoms, causing the women to catch sexually transmitted infections as a result, according to the report. Several also described being slapped and beaten by the soldiers who forced them to have sex. According to the 71-page report, '\\"The Power These Men Have Over Us\\":. Sexual Exploitation and Abuse by African Union Forces in. Somalia,' only two out of the 21 women and girls interviewed filed a complaint with Somali or other authorities. One 15-year-old girl went to the Burundian contingent's base to get medicine for her sick mother late 2013, the report says. The African Union Mission in Somalia, or AMISOM, was deployed in 2007. Its uniformed force, which numbers more than 22,000, comes from Uganda, Burundi, Kenya, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Sierra Leone (file picture - there is no suggestion the soldiers pictured were involved in the abuse) A Somali interpreter told her to follow two Burundian soldiers to get medicine. They took her to a remote area and one of the soldiers raped her, Human Rights Watch said. 'First he ripped off my hijab and then he attacked me,' she is quoted saying. As she was leaving, the second Burundian soldier gave her 10, the report says. Human Rights Watch said all of the Somali women and girls interviewed were internal refugees from south-central Somalia. The human rights group urged troop-contributing countries, the African Union Mission in Somalia and donors to urgently address these abuses and strengthen procedures inside Somalia to seek justice. 'Some African Union soldiers have misused their positions of power to exploit Somalia's most vulnerable women and girls,' said Liesl Gerntholtz, women's rights director at Human Rights Watch. 'Somalia has many intractable problems, but the Somali and. AU leadership could end sexual exploitation and abuse by. pressing troop-sending countries to hold abusers responsible.'

Marinating cheese in oil, herbs, and chile flakes helps to preserve and extend its shelf life, also adding flavor. The oil, acting as a barrier, protects the cheese from exposure to air, which is a primary cause of spoilage. The herbs and chile flakes add flavor and may provide additional antimicrobial properties that can further extend the cheese's shelf life. The other option, using a glass container with limes and oranges, is not the best choice for preserving cheese. Citrus fruits, such as limes and oranges, have a high acidity that can negatively affect the cheese's texture and flavor.

Flowing water can erode both rocks and soil. You have already learned that materials can dissolve in water. With enough time, even rocks can be dissolved by water. This process happens really slowly. It may take over a million years to dissolve a rock. It doesnt matter how big the rock is. With enough time, flowing water can dissolve it. Moving water also has the ability to move small pieces of rock and soil. How can water move a rock? Doesnt it need energy? Of course, water gets its energy because it is moving. Moving water has kinetic energy. Things that have more energy can do more work. When water stops moving it will have no energy. It will no longer be able to move the rock and soil. When this happens the rock and soil will settle to the bottom of the calm water. Scientists call this process deposition. Question: \\"What is it called when rock and soil settle to the bottom of calm water?\\" Answer: \\"Deposition\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"Yes, the answer is correct. The passage detailed the abilities of water - its ability to move and dissolve various materials, such as rocks and soil, as a result of its kinetic energy. It specified that when water stops moving and consequently loses its energy, it can no longer carry these materials.

It's kind of familiar territory and seemed a bit dated. The middle chapters were about linguistic, which were pretty interesting. After the end, the book seemed to lose what focus it had.The presentation is chopped up into small sections that don't always flow well (hence, the disjointed feel). It was frustrating to read and felt simplistic at times (as if the reader cannot keep up with an extensive analysis or something).TGHD is not terrible, but I've read better books on the subject.Not recommended. Is this product review negative? Answer:","completion":"Yes, this product review is negative. The reviewer expresses several issues with the book which contribute to their overall dissatisfaction. Firstly, they refer to the book's subject matter as \\"disjoined,\\" with the earliest parts focusing on biology and evolution, fields which they found to be outdated or at least not presented in a fresh or engaging way. This indicates that the reviewer found the beginning of the book to be lackluster, lacking new insights or valuable information. The reviewer does admit that there were portions they found interesting, specifically the ones concentrating on linguistics. However, this affirmative commentary is isolated and does not seem to significantly impact the overall perception. Post this lone positive comment, the reviewer goes on to note that the book seemed directionless or lacking a clear focus. They also criticize the book's structure, specifically, the decision to divide it into small sections. They found the flow between these sections to be quite choppy, and this disorganization resulted in a disjointed reading experience. The notion of the book being “simplistic” suggests the reviewer felt that the book might have been ‘dumbed down’ for readers, thus causing it to lose its depth or richness in content. They express frustration at what they view as a lack of intellectual challenge or engagement. They conclude their review with the statement that \\"TGHD is not terrible, but I've read better books on the subject.\\" This implies that while they do not categorize the book as completely worthless or poorly written, it is, according to them, significantly outperformed by other books within the same subject area. Their stated non-recommendation, coupled with their various issues with the book's overall content and structure, is a clear indication of their negative sentiment toward the product. As a summary, the reviewer’s dissatisfaction from the book stems from its disorganized presentation, lack of intellectual challenge or thought-provoking content, dated information and a sense that it lacked focus or overarching direction.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: One way to test a cause and effect hypothesis is to perform a controlled experiment. In a controlled experiment, two identical experiments are carried out side-by-side. In one of the experiments, the independent variable being tested is used, and in the other experiment, the control, the independent variable is not used. Q: What type of experiment involves two identical experiments carried out side-by-side, with and without an independent variable? A: Answer:","completion":"A controlled experiment is the type of experiment that involves two identical experiments carried out side-by-side, with and without an independent variable. In a controlled experiment, the aim is to test a cause and effect hypothesis by isolating the impact of the independent variable on the dependent variable while keeping all other factors constant. To achieve this, researchers design two parallel experiments: the experimental group and the control group. The experimental group receives the independent variable, also known as the treatment or intervention, while the control group does not receive the independent variable, remaining in the same condition as before the experiment. This contrast allows researchers to directly compare the outcomes of both groups and evaluate the effect of the independent variable. In a controlled experiment, it is crucial to keep all other variables constant across both groups, ensuring that any differences in the outcomes can be attributed solely to the presence or absence of the independent variable. This is often achieved through random assignment, which helps to minimize the risk of confounding variables or biases affecting the results. Furthermore, controlled experiments may also be performed using a double-blind design, wherein both the participants and the researchers are unaware of which group is receiving the treatment. This minimizes the risk of experimenter bias and placebo effects, increasing the reliability and validity of the results. In conclusion, a controlled experiment is a type of experiment in which two identical experiments, with and without an independent variable, are carried out side-by-side. This design allows for the direct comparison of the two groups, enabling researchers to determine the impact of the independent variable on the dependent variable while controlling for other factors that may influence the results."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Defence lawyers have withdrawn from new criminal cases requiring legal aid in protest at the changes. The ongoing dispute has stalled about 800 cases due to be heard in the Crown Court. A two-day process aimed at resolving a stand-off, will take place within the next fortnight. It is understood that both sides have agreed on an English QC to act as mediator. Some solicitors' firms have also joined in the industrial action. Senior judges adjourned an ongoing court challenge to the new rules for legal aid fees in Northern Ireland after being informed of the development. Judicial review proceedings were launched by the Bar Council and the Law Society in a joint bid to have the new payment arrangements quashed.

What was more unusual was the way in which he made his dream come true. After high school, he wanted to join the U. S. Air Force but he failed because of his poor eyesight. However, his dream remained. At the age of 33, Ted was a truck driver in Los Angeles. One day, while sitting outside in his garden, he watched planes fly overhead and an idea came to him: to use balloons to fly. A few weeks later, Ted bought 42 huge balloons. He tied them to a chair and then he sat down in the chair with some beer, sandwiches and a gun. His plan was to fly to 10 meters above his garden, enjoy a few hours in the air, and then shoot some balloons with his gun to get back down. But things did not go as he planned. Once his friends cut the ropes under Ted's chair, the 42 balloons flew into the sky at an astonishing speed until about 4000 meters above the ground with Ted and his chair. He didn't shoot any of the balloons because he was afraid he might break the balanee of his \\"plane\\". Ted stayed in the sky with his beer and sandwiches for 14 hours, cold and frightened. Planes heading towards Los Angeles' busy international airport reported the strange sight. And Ted' s balloons caused great danger to them. At last, Ted gathered his courage to shoot a few balloons and slowly landed on the ground, where many policemen were waiting for him. Ted made his dream come true, but it cost him: he was fined 1,500 for breaking the law about air safety. When asked by a reporter why he had done it, Ted answered, \\"A man can't just sit around and do nothing; he should have his dream and go for it. \\" Question: Why couldn't Ted join the American Air Force?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Math Problem Solve 17*f = 14*f for f.","completion":"Alright, let's solve this math problem step by step, like we're explaining to a five-year-old! We have to find out the value of \\"f\\" (that's what solve for f means) in the equation \\"17*f = 14*f\\". To do that, we want to get \\"f\\" by itself on one side. So, let's first see how many \\"f\\"s we have on each side of the equation: On the left side, we have \\"17*f\\", which means 17 times f. On the right side, we have \\"14*f\\", which means 14 times f. Now, we want to make them equal by moving all the \\"f\\"s to one side. We can do that by subtracting one of these amounts from both sides. Let's subtract \\"14*f\\" from both sides of the equation: 17*f - 14*f = 14*f - 14*f This gives us a new equation: 3*f = 0 (\\"17*f - 14*f\\" is 3 times f, and \\"14*f - 14*f\\" is 0, because we took away exactly the same amount.) Now we have \\"3*f = 0\\". This means that 3 times f equals 0. But how many times do we have to multiply 3 with f to get 0? Well, the only way that can happen is if f equals 0 because anything multiplied by 0 is 0. So, the answer is: f = 0 Great job! We solved it together! The value of \\"f\\" is 0."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

He was a Pediatric Cardiologist at UCLA back in 1971 who saved my life. I was eight years old at the time with a severe heart problem and I needed heart surgery. My Mom did not have the money, and without the surgery there was a real good chance I would not live to be thirteen years old. After contacting several organizations Dr. Vincent was able to get financial help for me through United Way, a Crippled Children's Organization. Dr. Vincent was a handsome man; he was also very gentle and caring. I remember being in the hospital for an Angiogram test, and during the procedure I was crying terribly, so the medical staff called in Dr. Vincent to calm me down, and he was able to comfort me when no one else could. Then the time came for me to have heart surgery; there was a fifty- percent chance that I would not make it through the surgery because it was experimental. At the time I was only the second or third person to have this procedure done. I was absolutely terrified, and again Dr. Vincent reassured me he would see to it that everything would be all right. I had a lot of confidence and trust in Dr. Vincent; He came to see me after the surgery, which was extremely painful but very successful, and brought me a stuffed animal. I was so surprised to get this gift from Dr. Vincent; I gave him a hug. I guess Dr. Vincent must have known I was feeling very lonely and scared. You see, I had no family or friends visit me while I was in the hospital except for my Mom, and I am not sure why. I do know one thing; I had a wonderful doctor who took the time to help a scared little girl who felt all alone. This was twenty eight years ago, so wherever you are Dr. Vincent, I want to thank you for not only saving my life, but you helped me live a normal productive life, and for showing me that you truly cared, for that I will be eternally grateful to you.

Please answer this question: who is the woman holding the scales of justice?","completion":"The woman holding the scales of justice is often referred to as Lady Justice or Justitia, the Roman goddess of justice. The depiction of a woman holding the scales of justice serves as a symbol of the fair and impartial administration of the law. The image of Lady Justice appears around the world in courtrooms, government buildings, legal documents, and numerous other places related to the legal system. Lady Justice is usually portrayed as a blindfolded woman holding a set of scales and a double-edged sword. Each element in her portrayal carries significant symbolism: 1. The blindfold: This represents the idea that justice should be impartial and objective. The blindfold covers Lady Justice's eyes to symbolize that she does not discriminate based on wealth, power, social standing, or any other personal attributes. It conveys the principle that justice should be meted out fairly to all, without favoritism or prejudice. 2. The scales: The scales Lady Justice holds in her hand symbolize the weighing of evidence and the balancing of competing interests. When the scales are in equilibrium, it represents a just outcome where the rights and interests of the parties involved have been given proper consideration. In legal settings, this balance can refer to the fair treatment of the accused and the accuser or the plaintiff and the defendant. 3. The double-edged sword: The sword in Lady Justice's other hand represents the power and authority of the law. It suggests that justice can be swift and final, protecting the innocent and punishing the guilty. The double-edged aspect of the sword also signifies that the law applies equally to all, and justice has the potential to cut both ways. Although Justitia has her origins in the Roman pantheon, her influence and symbolism can be traced back further to ancient Greece, where Themis and Dike were goddesses of justice and order. Themis, similar to Justitia, bore the scales of justice and represented divine law, while Dike, often portrayed with a sword, symbolized the concept of moral justice and order. Throughout centuries, the imagery of Lady Justice has evolved, incorporating various cultural and artistic elements. The blindfold, for instance, was not added to the iconic representation until the 16th century. Likewise, her portrayal has also been influenced by religious and philosophical concepts from the Renaissance and the Enlightenment. Today, Lady Justice remains a powerful and enduring symbol of the principles of fairness, impartiality, and the rule of law, inspiring confidence and trust in the legal systems all around the globe."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was the first war crimes tribunal created since Nuremberg at the end of World War II. It has indicted 161 individuals, including senior politicians and military leaders. The BBC has been allowed unprecedented access to the inner workings of the tribunal. In the bowels of the building sits a heavy, six-lever metal door, probably bomb-proof. It harks back to the time when the place was owned by an insurance firm. The door used to be the entrance to the company's vault, where its most important documents and files were kept. Today the door is unnecessary but the vault has been turned into a series of Spartan holding cells, a place for the accused at the court to sit and meet their lawyers before going upstairs to the courts. Each cell has a small, simple table and two plastic chairs and every defendant has had access to the same basic facility. All except Slobodan Milosevic. Such was the media interest in the trial of the former Yugoslav leader that Paddy Gavin, the Irish carpenter in charge of the cells, was forced to create a small bedsit for the ex-president so he could arrive very early, ahead of the media. \\"We fitted it with a bed and a wardrobe and somewhere to write and a lamp,\\" he recalls. \\"All the furniture had to be screwed together and fixed to the floors and the walls.\\" A couple of floors above the vault sit the courts themselves. The highest-profile current defendant is Radovan Karadzic, former leader of the Bosnian Serbs. He is accused of genocide and crimes against humanity, including at Srebrenica, where more than 7,000 Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) men and boys were murdered. But despite the seriousness of the charges, he has chosen to defend himself, an idea he got from watching Milosevic employ the same tactic during his trial. Mr Karadzic does get legal help however, and in a small cramped office sit eight young, eager, fresh-faced interns. Law students drawn from around the world, they are excited to be working on such a high-profile case. Cradling a signed photo of Mr Karadzic is one of the interns, 24-year-old Zygimantas Juska from Lithuania. \\"I met him and he seems really nice,\\" he says. \\"He knows a lot from his life and experience so he can provide a lot of valuable information to someone young like me. He's done a lot in his life.\\" Corralling that enthusiasm is Peter Robinson, a defence lawyer from San Francisco who is one of Mr Karadzic's legal representatives. He similarly describes the Bosnian Serb positively, talking of a \\"funny, personable, humble, grateful\\" man, but he acknowledges it is unlikely his client will ever be freed. \\"He may know in his heart [that he'll never be freed] but he's a real optimist... and I think he has some hope, maybe unrealistic, that some day he could be,\\" he said. Ranged against that hope are millions of pages of documents held behind the locked doors of the court's evidence vault. Stacked in neat brown cardboard boxes, they contain the horrors of the wars in the former Yugoslavia - the evidence of witnesses, the forensic material gathered on the ground, the transcripts of incendiary interviews given at the time. Bob Reid, a plain-speaking former Australian police officer who has worked here for nearly two decades, recalls carrying out much of the tribunal's early, grim investigative work. He said it was \\"chilling\\" to walk into the notorious Serbian detention camp, Omarska, with its torture chamber known as the White House, \\"where we knew terrible crimes had occurred\\". \\"The political elite, the police officers, the clergy - had all been put in there and none of them came out. And [we] were still finding traces of blood.\\" It is little wonder he took particular delight in securing the capture of Mr Karadzic and his erstwhile military leader, Ratko Mladic. \\"They were nice days, they were good days. There was one beer or two had in Belgrade.\\" While a lot of the evidence against Mr Karadzic and Mr Mladic, whose trial is also under way, is on paper, it is the evidence of witnesses that make the trials come alive. Several witnesses, from either the defence or the prosecution side, can pass through the court each day. The tribunal has a particular section, the Witness Support Unit, that takes care of people who travel to the court. Some have been called to testify on several occasions, giving evidence in more than one trial, not just at The Hague but in courts in the former Yugoslavia. The whole experience can put severe pressure on the witnesses, says Helena Vranov Schoorl from the unit: \\"It's like they are stuck in the past. \\"They call it a bit of a testimony fatigue. As one of the witnesses said - once a witness, always a witness. The witnesses feel exhausted, especially if you are forced to live in the past.\\" The call of The Hague on those witnesses is reducing. The last trials are under way, with verdicts expected by the end of 2014, although appeals could mean the court continuing to operate for a couple of years after that. Despite the dozens of defendants and thousands of witnesses who have passed through this ground-breaking tribunal, many staff here remain befuddled as to what caused former neighbours to turn so viciously, so violently, on each other. They may never know - so they will simply continue to work towards trying to ensure that such brutality is never repeated.","completion":"The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) is a place where important people who did bad things during a war got into trouble. The BBC got a special chance to look at what goes on in this court. In this building, there is a heavy door that used to be an entrance to a very important room when the building was owned by an insurance company. Now, that room is used for people who did wrong to meet their lawyers. Every person who did wrong got the same simple room, except one very important person named Slobodan Milosevic. Because a lot of people from TV and newspapers wanted to see him, he got a fancier room where he could spend time before the courtroom sessions. Another important person, Radovan Karadzic, is on trial, too. He is accused of really, really bad things, like hurting a lot of people. But he chose to defend himself, which means he talks in his own defense in the court, just like Milosevic did in his trial. But he has some help from young lawyers. There are lots and lots of papers that have details about all the bad things that happened during the war. Some of these papers are very scary to read because they tell about terrible things. There is also a special place in the court for people who saw bad things happen and are helping the court by telling what they saw.

High altitude is sometimes defined to begin at 2,400 meters (8,000 ft) above sea level.[5][6][7] At high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. This is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.[8].

Help as much as you can. In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency – and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress – which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . . that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the “top-of-mind” because everything that happens...

To provide a more fitting answer: ERISA, or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, was enacted in 1974 to set minimum standards for establishing pension and health plans in private industries. It was created to protect employees' retirement funds and to ensure that they receive the benefits they were promised. This legislation was prompted by a series of high-profile cases where pension funds were either mismanaged or had insufficient funds to fulfil their obligations to retired employees."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Prison reform is politically unachievable Come up with some evidence to support this claim.","completion":"While it is true that there have been some efforts towards prison reform, the political landscape, coupled with other factors, have made large-scale and long-term reform challenging to achieve. The argument that prison reform is politically unachievable can be supported by several pieces of evidence, which are listed below: 1. Politicians' dependency on the criminal justice system: Many politicians rely on the criminal justice system to ensure public safety and order, making it difficult for them to advocate for significant reform. Additionally, they may fear being perceived as soft on crime, leading to a hesitancy to push for significant changes in the prison system. 2. The influence of private prison corporations: The rise of privatized prisons in the United States has meant that there are now powerful financial incentives for certain private companies to maintain high incarceration rates. Lobbying from these corporations can significantly influence prison policy and hinder meaningful reform efforts. 3. Tough-on-crime political narratives: The decades-long \\"war on drugs\\" and \\"tough on crime\\" rhetoric often drive politicians to promote policies focused on punitive measures rather than rehabilitation or alternatives to incarceration. This narrative persists in part because voters continue to express concern about crime rates, and politicians are hesitant to challenge public opinion. 4. Inadequate funding for reform: Implementing meaningful prison reform requires significant investment in education, job training, mental health services, and substance abuse treatment programs. However, many state and federal budgets do not prioritize these types of programs, making it difficult to enact meaningful change within the prison system. 5. Fragmented criminal justice system: The criminal justice system in the United States is highly fragmented, consisting of numerous state, federal, and local agencies. This fragmentation can impede efforts to enact comprehensive prison reform, as changes may need to be implemented at multiple levels of government to truly have a significant impact. 6. Racial disparity and injustice: The criminal justice system disproportionately impacts marginalized communities and perpetuates racial inequality. For many politicians, addressing this disparity may be seen as a controversial move, limiting the likelihood that they will pursue comprehensive reform. 7. A lack of political will: Many politicians may not be genuinely interested in prison reform and may simply pay lip service to the issue. As a result, those who do want to enact changes may struggle to find allies to support and pass the necessary legislation. 8. The impact of economic and political inequality: Marginalized groups who are disproportionately affected by the criminal justice system are less likely to have a strong voice in the political process. Consequently, their concerns may not be given the attention and priority needed for reform efforts to succeed. In conclusion, while there have been some localized successes in prison reform, such as the First Step Act in the United States, the evidence indicates that achieving comprehensive and lasting reform on a larger political scale remains a considerable challenge. The factors mentioned above illustrate the significant barriers in place that may prevent significant progress in prison reform, and they demonstrate that the fight remains an uphill battle for reform advocates."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased.

The Menominee (also spelled Menomini, derived from the Ojibwe language word for \\"Wild Rice People;\\" known as Mamaceqtaw, \\"the people,\\" in the Menominee language) are a federally recognized nation of Native Americans, with a 353.894 sq mi (916.581 km2) reservation in Wisconsin. Their historic territory originally included an estimated 10 million acres (40,000 km2) in present-day Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The tribe currently has about 8,700 members. The tribe was terminated in the 1950s under federal policy of the time which stressed assimilation. The Menominee Indian Reservation is located in northeastern Wisconsin. For the most part, it is conterminous with Menominee County and the town of Menominee, which were established after termination of the tribe in 1961 under contemporary federal policy whose goal was assimilation. The tribe regained its federally recognized status and reservation in 1975. The reservation was created in a treaty with the United States signed on May 12, 1854 in which the Menominee relinquished all claims to the lands held by them under previous treaties, and were assigned 432 square miles (1,120 km2) on the Wolf River in present-day Wisconsin. An additional treaty, which they signed on February 11, 1856, carved out the southwestern corner of this area to create a separate reservation for the Stockbridge and Lenape (Munsee) tribes, who had reached the area as refugees from New York state. The latter two tribes have the federally recognized joint Stockbridge-Munsee Community. After the tribe had regained federal recognition in 1973, it essentially restored the reservation to its historic boundaries in 1975. Many small pockets of territory within the county (and its geographically equivalent town) are not considered as part of the reservation. These amount to 1.14% of the county's area, so the reservation is essentially 98.86% of the county's area. The largest of these pockets is in the western part of the community of Keshena, Wisconsin. The reservation includes a plot of off-reservation trust land of 10.22 acres (41,400 m2) in Winnebago County, Wisconsin to the south, west of the city of Oshkosh. The reservation's total land area is 353.894 sq mi (916.581 km2), while Menominee County's land area is 357.960 sq mi (927.11 km2). The small non-reservation parts of the county are more densely populated than the reservation, holding 1,337 (29.3%) of the county's 4,562 total population, as opposed to the reservation's 3,225 (70.7%) population, as of the 2000 census. The most populous communities are Legend Lake and Keshena. Since the late 20th century, the members of the reservation have operated a number of gambling facilities in these communities as a source of revenue.

Question: Aairplane is used for moving people across bodies of water, and airplanes are responsible for air, noise, and water pollution. Given these facts, what pollutes the environment among the following options: - bacteria - airplanes - deforestation - moon - sun - cells - Smoking - flooding Answer:","completion":"Among the given options, the factors that contribute significantly to the pollution of the environment are airplanes, deforestation, and smoking. Each of these factors impacts the environment in different ways, as discussed below. 1. Airplanes: Airplanes play a crucial role in global transportation, enabling people and goods to move quickly across countries and continents. However, they also contribute significantly to air, noise, and water pollution. The emissions from aircraft engines release gases and particles into the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), water vapor, and particulate matter. These emissions contribute to climate change, as CO2 is a major greenhouse gas, and NOx can lead to the formation of ground-level ozone, which has detrimental effects on human health. Additionally, the noise pollution resulting from airplanes can cause stress and sleep disturbance for communities located near airports. The noise generated by commercial jet engines can exceed 100 decibels, which can be extremely disruptive to humans and wildlife. Finally, water pollution can occur when deicing chemicals or other pollutants from aircraft maintenance are discharged into nearby waterways. These pollutants can harm aquatic life and pose risks to human health. 2. Deforestation: Deforestation refers to the clearing of forested areas, often to make way for agriculture, logging, mining, or infrastructure development. This process has significant environmental impacts, as forests are essential for maintaining Earth's biodiversity, regulating the climate, providing essential ecosystem services, and supporting human livelihoods. When forests are destroyed, carbon stored in the trees and the forest soil is released into the atmosphere as CO2, contributing to climate change. In addition, deforestation can lead to the loss of habitat for countless plant and animal species, resulting in reduced biodiversity and even species extinction. Moreover, deforestation can negatively affect the water cycle by reducing evapotranspiration (the process by which water is transferred from the land to the atmosphere), contributing to changes in rainfall patterns and an increased risk of flooding or drought. Soil erosion and degradation can also result from deforestation, as the removal of vegetation exposes soil to wind and water erosion, leading to decreased fertility and a loss of essential nutrients. 3. Smoking: Cigarette smoking causes pollution in various ways, including through air pollution, litter, and the production of toxic waste. The burning of tobacco and other additives in cigarettes produces thousands of chemicals, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, formaldehyde, benzene, and particulate matter. These chemicals can have negative impacts on both human health and the environment. Second-hand smoke from cigarettes also contributes to air pollution and can adversely affect the health of non-smokers exposed to it. In indoor environments, such as homes, offices, or public spaces, second-hand smoke can compromise air quality and increase health risks for people with asthma or other respiratory conditions. Furthermore, cigarette litter, such as discarded filters and packaging, contributes to the pollution of outdoor spaces and aquatic environments, as these items can take years to break down and can release toxic chemicals into the environment. In summary, while not all the factors listed contribute to environmental pollution, airplanes, deforestation, and smoking do have significant negative effects on the environment. As a result, it is crucial to work on reducing the pollution caused by these factors through implementing sustainable practices, innovative technologies, and raising awareness about their environmental impacts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Q: What happens to structural genes in the presence of tryptophan? A: A:","completion":"In the presence of tryptophan, structural genes involved in tryptophan synthesis are usually repressed. The process occurs step-by-step: 1. Tryptophan is present in the environment: When the cell has a sufficient amount of tryptophan available, it does not need to produce more through the expression of structural genes involved in tryptophan synthesis. 2. Tryptophan acts as a corepressor: Tryptophan binds to the trp repressor protein, a regulatory protein that controls the expression of the tryptophan biosynthesis genes. 3. Formation of the repressor-corepressor complex: When tryptophan binds to the trp repressor, it induces a conformational change in the protein, enabling it to bind to the operator site present on the DNA. 4. Binding to the operator: The repressor-corepressor complex attaches to the operator site, which is found in the trp operon – a cluster of genes involved in tryptophan biosynthesis. The operator is a specific DNA sequence located between the promoter and the structural genes. 5. Inhibition of gene transcription: By binding to the operator, the repressor-corepressor complex prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing the structural genes in the trp operon. This process is called negative control or repression. 6. Reduced expression of structural genes: As transcription is inhibited, the expression of the structural genes involved in tryptophan synthesis is reduced, stopping the production of tryptophan biosynthetic enzymes. In conclusion, the presence of tryptophan in the environment leads to the repression of structural genes involved in its synthesis, allowing the cell to conserve energy by not producing unnecessary amounts of tryptophan biosynthesis enzymes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now I'm not the only one stressed, a customer lines up during lunch, they're hungry and wish that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves so that they did not have to deal with the fact that I can't deal with a customer at the speed of light. Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere. Now my chain are pretty big in England, so if a customer wants to slap me around with a ‘customer is always right’ the script dictates that I do everything in my power to make sure they come back, and Cthulu knows this, well: I'm stressed, I don't like her face and she's given me an opportunity for me to give her the polite ‘fuck off'. All I say is ‘Good’ and move on to the next customer. Hitler-lite phones my corporation to voice a complaint, so a suit comes out and asks the team who did it, I fess up so I can save the time and not have a reason to hate one of my co-workers. I get a lecture and a warning, the end. Question: What is most likely her job? Answer: The answer is:","completion":"The person's job is most likely a barista or server at a chain cafe in England.

Independence with Partition: The British began to see India's independence as inevitable; however, only a few seemed to understand the vital role of the religious groups. Britain prepared a parliamentary democracy with majority rule, but the majority were Hindus — and Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs had been killing each other in war for many centuries. Nehru's Congress Party, largely Hindu with a socialist leadership, wanted a parliamentary democracy. As counterweight, British legislation reserved parliamentary seats for religious minorities, but the Punjab and Bengal had such a complicated mixture of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs that it was not possible to avoid fights over how separate constituencies were to be formed. The seeds of future trouble were sown. The legislation on reserving seats gave the Muslims the basis for an alternative to an India in which they were only a quarter of the population: Partition. In 1930, the poet Muhammad Iqbal proposed a separate Muslim homeland in the northwest of India. A small group of Indian Muslims at Cambridge came up with the name Pakistan, using the initials of the Punjab, Afghania (N.W. Frontier Province), Kashmir, and Sind (at the same time producing the word pak, meaning \\"pure\\"), and adding \\"stan,\\" the Persian suffix for the word \\"country. \\" The Muslim campaign for Partition was led by London-trained Bombay lawyer, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Meanwhile, Gandhi vehemently opposed any dismemberment of the country, and tried to keep people united by fasting to uphold the spirit of love, and by focussing on the common adversary: the British. Advocating civil disobedience, he led his famous Salt March to the sea, to scoop up salt and circumvent the hated British salt tax. This put more than 60,000 in jail. Against this militancy, World War II did not elicit the solidarity of the first. Indians courageously fought alongside the British troops, in Burma, the Middle East, and Europe, but Gandhi saw the British as a provocation for Japanese invasion and was jailed yet again, for launching a \\"Quit India\\" campaign in the year 1942. Some anti-British extremists saw the Japanese as an Asian liberator. Winston Churchill didn't want any Indian independence and so it was probably as well for India that he was defeated by Attlee's Labor Party in 1945. With riots growing ever more bloody in Bengal, Bihar, and the Punjab, India's last viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, kept a mandate to make the British departure as quick and as smooth as possible.

Bomb Is ‘Possibility’ in Loss of Russian Jet Over Egypt, Obama Says In a joint news conference on Thursday, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain spoke about working together to ensure the safety of both countries’ citizens. WASHINGTON — President Obama said Thursday evening that there was “a possibility” that a terrorist bomb was responsible for the destruction of a Russian passenger plane that broke apart last Saturday over the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt. Mr. Obama said in a radio interview that there may have been a bomb on the plane, but he did not go as far as his counterparts in Britain, who have suggested that the destruction of the plane, and the death of all on board, was most likely the result of a terrorist explosion. “I don’t think we know yet,” Mr. Obama told the Seattle radio station KIRO during an interview broadcast Thursday afternoon. “Whenever you’ve got a plane crash, first of all you’ve got the tragedy, you’ve got making sure there’s an investigation on site. I think there is a possibility that there was a bomb on board. And we are taking that very seriously.” “We are going to spend a lot of time making sure our own investigators and our own intelligence community figures out exactly what’s going on before we make any definitive pronouncements,” Mr. Obama added. “But it is certainly possible that there was a bomb on board.” A Russian flight crashed in the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt on Oct. 31, killing all 224 people on board. Officials are investigating what might have caused an explosion that brought down the plane. At the White House earlier in the day, administration officials said that the United States had not yet made a determination about the cause of the crash, which occurred after takeoff from the Egyptian resort city of Sharm el Sheikh. But they added that the government had not excluded the possibility of a bomb. “We can’t rule anything out, including the possibility of terrorism,” Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, told reporters in Washington. In London on Thursday, Prime Minister David Cameron said that “more likely than not a terrorist bomb” had brought down the plane as he announced plans to bring British citizens back from Sharm el Sheikh. Mr. Obama’s comments were the first direct indication by the president that the downing of the Russian airliner might have been something other than a technical malfunction. American officials have repeatedly cautioned that the cause of the crash is still under investigation. Officials have noted that no American airlines fly to or from the airport in Egypt where the Russian plane began its flight. And they said before the crash, the Federal Aviation Administration had already issued guidance to airlines to fly higher above the region. Mr. Obama’s comments came during a series of short interviews with five radio stations across the country in which the president urged people to sign up at HealthCare.gov for health insurance during the current open enrollment period. During one of the interviews, Mr. Obama was asked about the Russian plane. In recent days, administration officials have noted the differences between the crash of the Russian plane and other airline disasters. In this case, unlike the case last year of the missing Malaysian jetliner, the United States does not have F.B.I. agents working directly on the crash. “Right now there are not,” Mr. Earnest said Wednesday afternoon. “Right now this is an Egyptian investigation. The Russians are involved in it.” Officials have said American investigators were “in touch” with their counterparts in other countries who are looking into the crash. But without an American known to be on the flight — a presence that often gives officials a reason to participate in the investigation of a crash — there has been no reason for direct United States involvement, they said. The Russians and the Egyptians have also not asked for help from the United States in the investigation, officials said. Mr. Cameron made his remarks about the crash in an appearance at No. 10 Downing Street with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt. “My role is to act in the right way to keep British citizens safe and secure,” Mr. Cameron said. He did not cite what specific intelligence he had suggesting that the explosion that destroyed the Russian plane about a half-hour after it took off from Sharm el Sheikh was deliberate. Mr. Sisi, who has counseled against jumping to premature conclusions, did not criticize Mr. Cameron’s decision to temporarily suspend flights between Britain and Sharm el Sheikh, but Egyptian officials in Cairo did just that. Hossam Kamal, the Egyptian minister of civil aviation, said that the suggestion of a bomb was not based on facts — and that there was as yet no evidence for that theory. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the British government had made the decision to halt flights unilaterally. In a telephone conversation on Thursday with Mr. Cameron, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia also took exception to his comments, saying that any “assessment of the causes of the crash should be based on the data” from the investigation, the Kremlin said in a statement. While there has been much speculation about what brought down the jet, the cause largely remains a mystery. American military officials said this week that satellite surveillance had detected a flash of light as the plane was ripped apart, suggesting that it had been blown up by a bomb, an explosion caused by a mechanical failure or the ignition of fuel. Mr. Sisi, standing next to Mr. Cameron, acknowledged that Britain had previously raised safety concerns. “Ten months ago, we were asked by our British friends to send teams to Sharm el Sheikh airport to make sure that all our security procedures there were good enough, and to provide adequate safety and security for our passengers,” he said, adding that the Egyptian authorities were ready to address any outstanding concerns. The prime minister’s office announced later Thursday that British and Egyptian officials had “agreed on a package of additional security measures that is being put in place rapidly,” and that flights to Britain from Sharm el Sheikh would resume Friday. Two British airlines, Monarch and EasyJet, said they were ready to run flights to bring stranded tourists back to Britain from the Red Sea resort, where there are an estimated 20,000 British citizens. Flights to Sharm el Sheikh from Britain remained suspended. Two subsidiaries of the German airline Lufthansa, the Düsseldorf-based Eurowings and Edelweiss Air, which operates out of Zurich, suspended their Sharm el Sheikh flights on Thursday. Lufthansa said the group was working out a plan to help passengers return home. Aleksandr Neradko, head of the Federal Air Transport Agency in Russia, said investigators in Egypt looking into the crash would be examining the wreckage of the airplane, including the hand baggage and victims’ bodies to see if there were traces of explosive substances. Also on Thursday, the first two funerals were held for victims of the crash. The funeral for Nina Lushchenko, 60, who ran a school canteen, was a traditional Orthodox service at a 16th-century church in Veliky Novgorod, about 125 miles south of St. Petersburg. The funeral for another victim, Aleksei Alekseev, 31, took place in St. Petersburg.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the full name of the people that Jo Elizabeth Stafford performed duets with? Jo Elizabeth Stafford (November 12, 1917 – July 16, 2008) was an American traditional pop music singer and occasional actress, whose career spanned five decades from the late 1930s to the early 1980s. Admired for the purity of her voice, she originally underwent classical training to become an opera singer before following a career in popular music, and by 1955 had achieved more worldwide record sales than any other female artist. Her 1952 song \\"You Belong to Me\\" topped the charts in the United States and United Kingdom, the record becoming the first by a female artist to reach number one on the U.K. Singles Chart. Born in Coalinga, California, Stafford made her first musical appearance at age twelve. While still at high school she joined her two older sisters to form a vocal trio named The Stafford Sisters, who found moderate success on radio and in film. In 1938, while the sisters were part of the cast of Twentieth Century Fox's production of Alexander's Ragtime Band, Stafford met the future members of The Pied Pipers and became the group's lead singer. Bandleader Tommy Dorsey hired them in 1939 to perform back-up vocals for his orchestra. In addition to her recordings with the Pied Pipers, Stafford featured in solo performances for Dorsey. After leaving the group in 1944, she recorded a series of pop standards for Capitol Records and Columbia Records. Many of her recordings were backed by the orchestra of Paul Weston. She also performed duets with Gordon MacRae and Frankie Laine. Her work with the United Service Organizations (USO) giving concerts for soldiers during World War II earned her the nickname \\"G.I. Jo\\". Starting in 1945, Stafford was a regular host of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) radio series The Chesterfield Supper Club and later appeared in television specials—including two series called The Jo Stafford Show, in 1954 in the U.S. and in 1961 in the U.K. A:","completion":"The full names of the people that Jo Elizabeth Stafford performed duets with are: 1.

(CNN) -- The explosive found hidden in a package on a plane in the United Arab Emirates on Friday may have traveled on passenger planes to get there, airline officials said Sunday. The explosive, along with a similar device found in the United Kingdom, appear to have been designed to detonate on their own, without someone having to set them off, the top White House counterterrorism official told CNN. \\"It is my understanding that these devices did not need somebody to detonate them,\\" said John Brennan, President Barack Obama's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism. U.S. investigators believe al Qaeda bomb maker Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, 28, is linked to that package and another one found on a second airplane in Britain's East Midlands Airport on Friday, a federal official, who was briefed by authorities, told CNN Sunday. Both packages were addressed to synagogues in Chicago, Illinois. Al-Asiri, who is thought to be in Yemen, is a Saudi who was high on Saudi Arabia's list of most wanted published in February 2009. He is also believed to be the bomber who designed last year's failed Christmas Day underwear bomb. Separately, an engineering student arrested in Yemen was released Sunday, along with her mother, according to her father, Mohammed Al-Samawi. She was earlier identified as Hanan Al-Samawi, a fifth-year student at Sanaa University in the Yemeni capital, said Abdul-Rahman Barman, a human rights attorney and activist who said he was asked to represent her. A high-level source in the United Arab Emirates said Hanan Al-Samawi's name was found on the cargo manifest of the device found in Dubai.

Given the question: Title: UPS did not deliver this gift Review: THis was purchased as a gift for my daughter and UPS returned it to sender, I am not happy! Is the review positive or negative? The answer is:","completion":"The review can be identified as negative. The sentiment expressed by the reviewer is primarily based on dissatisfaction with the delivery experience of their purchase, which was intended to be a gift for their daughter but could not reach the intended recipient. This dissatisfaction is explicitly mentioned in their statement, \\"I am not happy!\\" which indicates that the reviewer's experience was unpleasant and not up to their expectations. It is important to note that the negative sentiment is directed towards the delivery service provided by UPS, rather than the product itself or the seller of the product. The reviewer does not mention any issues or concerns with the quality, usability, or value of the product – their primary concern is the failure of UPS to deliver the item to their daughter. Hence, the negativity in this review is mainly related to the logistics aspect of the transaction, rather than the product or the seller. Nevertheless, online sellers and service providers must take responsibility for their choice of delivery partners, as negative experiences associated with delivery services can greatly impact the overall satisfaction of customers. In this instance, the customer's unpleasant experience with UPS reflects poorly on the seller and may subsequently influence the purchaser's decision to make future transactions with them. This is especially true if the customer is required to select a different delivery service, which may involve additional costs, time, and effort, just to ensure the satisfactory delivery of their purchase. In conclusion, the review in question can be considered negative as it reflects the disappointment and dissatisfaction experienced by the customer regarding the delivery service provided by UPS. Despite the fact that the negativity is not directed towards the product or the seller, the situation still highlights the importance for sellers and service providers to be aware of the potential impact that negative delivery experiences can have on overall customer satisfaction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The name sounds funny but the idea is no joke: it's a personal toilet called the pee-pool, Anders Wilhelmson, a Swedish architect, is the inventor of the pee-pool. He became interested in the idea of sanitation after taking part in a research project on the social and political development of cities, One of the most common problems he found in developing countries was the lack of toilets, He wanted to do something to help, So working with others, he started the project in 2005, and the next year started a company called Peepoolple. The toilet is a single--use bag made of environmentally friendly plastics, The inside is treated with urea , a chemical commonly used as fertilizer, The hotter the weather, the more quickly the waste turns into what is needed by plants The sanitation process can be as soon as a couple of hours or as long as two to four weeks ,You can just bury it in a pot and grow whatever you like. The company expects to start selling the bags in August in Kenya and Bangladesh, But it is just beginning production and sales in Nairobi now, Full production could reach about half a million bags a day and people may be able to buy the pee-pool in countries Vietnam, Bangladesh, etc. The United Nations says more than two and a half billion people around the world do not have good sanitation .Many have no choice but to use the outdoors, which is not only bad for the environment ,but also harmful to people's health, Each year, poor sanitation leads to three fifths of those people getting an infectious disease which on average causes one out of 1,000 patients to die. Jack Smith, the founder of the World Toilet Organization, says \\" _ is quite an unacceptable situation given the fact that we are living in the modem world, And strangely, many of them own televisions, phones but have no toilet.\\" Question: What was the original purpose of Anders Wilhelmson in starting the company?

Context: WHITE HOUSE — White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, who was asked to leave a Virginia restaurant days ago, told reporters on Monday that \\"calls for harassment and a push for any Trump supporter to avoid the public is unacceptable.\\" She was referring to comments from Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who previously has called for President Donald Trump's impeachment. Waters told supporters, \\"If you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd. And you push back on them, and you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere.\\" The most prominent Democrat in the House of Representatives, however, disagreed with Walters. \\"Trump's daily lack of civility has provoked responses that are predictable but unacceptable,\\" Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi said on Twitter on Monday. \\"As we go forward, we must conduct elections in a way that achieves unity from sea to shining sea.\\" Pelosi's tweet included a link to a CNN story about Waters encouraging harassment of Trump administration officials. Trump also responded to Water's remarks, saying on Twitter that the congresswoman — whom he referred to as an \\"extraordinarily low IQ person\\" — had called for his supporters to be harassed. In the social media message, the president concluded, \\"Be careful what you wish for Max!\\" Last week, protesters yelled at Department of Homeland Security chief Kirstjen Nielsen at an upscale Mexican restaurant near the White House. Earlier, Nielsen publicly defended the policy of separating children from parents who were apprehended for illegally entering the U.S., a policy the president has since reversed.

We have an equation that looks like this: 0 = 70*y - 359*y - 2890. Our job is to find the value of \\"y\\" that makes both sides equal. First, let's combine the \\"y\\" terms. We have 70*y and -359*y. To combine them, we subtract 359*y from 70*y, and it looks like this: 70*y - 359*y = -289*y. Now our equation is 0 = -289*y - 2890. We want to get \\"y\\" all by itself, so we need to get rid of the -289 that's being multiplied by \\"y\\". To do that, we can divide both sides of the equation by -289. It will look like this: 0/-289 = (-289*y - 2890)/-289 0 = y + 10 Now we have an equation that looks like this: 0 = y + 10. We're almost there! To find the value of \\"y\\", we need to get rid of the +10. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation. It will look like this: 0 - 10 = y + 10 - 10 -10 = y Ta-da!

Summarize this article: John Romero and Adrian Carmack are seeking 700,000 (Â£480,000) on Kickstarter to make a game called Blackroom. The futuristic game will be set in a \\"holographic simulation gone rogue\\". In a video, Mr Romero said the game would hark back to the original Doom, being \\"visceral, varied and violent\\" . Mr Romero and Mr Carmack are two of the four people that founded games company iD, which created Wolfenstein, Doom, Quake and many others. John Carmack (unrelated to Adrian) who was iD's lead programmer, currently works for Facebook on its Oculus virtual reality headset. The summary on Kickstarter explained that Blackroom would use its holographic setting to let players fight in many different environments including ruined Victorian mansions, Wild West ghost towns and pirate galleons. In-game tools would let players \\"hack\\" the environment in line with its holographic theme. It would also feature the extensive gunplay seen in older titles and let players use circle-strafing and rocket jumping to take down opponents in single and multi-player maps. Software tools that let players create their own maps and modifications for the game would also be available at launch. Mr Romero said the project had been in the planning stages for some time and he had set up a company, Night Work Games, in Galway, Ireland to handle its development. The game will be released in late 2018 for both Windows and Mac computers. Sam Machkovech from tech news site Ars Technica gave the funding campaign a cautious welcome but added: \\"This is the era of Kickstarter fatigue and, as such, more hard gameplay details might assure fans that Romero is not repeating his over-promising mistakes of old.\\" Summary:","completion":"John Romero and Adrian Carmack, co-founders of iD Software, the company behind Doom, Quake and Wolfenstein, are seeking 700,000 on Kickstarter to create their new game, Blackroom.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Next question: who killed the man in thelma and louise?","completion":"In the 1991 film \\"Thelma & Louise,\\" the man who was killed was Harlan Puckett, portrayed by actor Timothy Carhart. Harlan was a violent, predatory character who attempted to rape Thelma, played by Geena Davis, in the parking lot of a roadside tavern called the Silver Bullet. However, before Harlan has a chance to carry out his crime, Louise, played by Susan Sarandon, intervenes and confronts him. Louise pulls a gun and threatens him, forcing Harlan to stop his attack on Thelma and step away. Although Harlan initially acts compliant, he surreptitiously frees himself from Louise's control by reacting provocatively and derisively, mockingly stating that he should have \\"gone ahead and fucked her\\" while bragging that neither Thelma nor Louise would have the courage to shoot him. Louise, however, proves him wrong by shooting him in the chest, killing him instantly. This murder scene is a turning point in the film, setting the stage for the remainder of the plot. Thelma and Louise, who previously led somewhat mundane lives, are now thrust into a life on the run as they try to evade law enforcement and navigate the consequences of their actions. Throughout their journey, the audience is invited to reflect on themes of female empowerment, friendship, and the power dynamics found in relationships between men and women. It is important to note that Louise's decision to kill Harlan was not premeditated but rather an impulsive reaction to Harlan's behavior and an effort to protect her friend, Thelma. The story, which unfolds in a dramatic and sometimes humorous manner, depicts the transformation of these two women as they rebel against the roles that society has enforced upon them. The murder of Harlan Puckett plays a pivotal role in propelling Thelma and Louise into their ultimate journey of self-discovery and resistance against systemic sexism and oppression."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Write a summary based on this article: The sexual assault trial of Warren Jeffs resumed Monday after a one-hour delay to review and reject a motion filed by the polygamist sect leader to have the longtime judge in his case, Texas District Judge Barbara Walther, removed. Jeffs told the San Angelo, Texas, courtroom where his trial is being held today that a revelation from God prompted him to file the motion against Walther, whom he said God labeled \\"a woman of evil intent.\\" \\"I am to now recuse you from this case,\\" Jeffs wrote in his transcription of the message he said was delivered to him by God on Sunday, according to the Associated Press. \\"Now sign order to recuse thyself; and allow this proceeding to stop ...\\" Judge Walther was forced to call a recess in order to have an outside judge review the 16-page filing from Jeffs, forcing yet another delay in proceedings as the slow-moving trial began its sixth day. Jeffs last week fired his attorneys and has been representing himself in court. Seven attorneys have appeared on his behalf since December. The switches contributed to a six-month delay to the start of his trial. The motion filed by Jeffs today marked the third time the 55-year-old head of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS) has tried to recuse Judge Walther from his case. Jeffs stands accused of sexually assaulting two underage girls in his sect and forcing them both into a \\"spiritual marriage.\\" The charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison. He faces a separate trial on a bigamy charge in October. The charges against Jeffs , the spiritual leader for the more than 10,000 members of the FLDS, a radical offshoot of mainstream Mormonism, were leveled after a 2008 raid on his sect's compound. Judge Walther is the same judge who approved the raid on Jeffs' compound that led to his eventual arrest and the charges against him. Monday's filing by Jeffs included what he said were 29 orders from the Lord when they spoke last week, including one in which God sent \\"a crippling disease upon (Walther) which shall take her life soon.\\" Walther, the Associated Press reports, contracted polio when she was younger and walks with a limp. \\"I, your Lord, say to you, I shall bring to light your evil intent now, before all people, to destroy my church on earth,\\" Jeffs wrote in the filing. Just as with the rulings in the previous two motions, the visiting judge denied Jeffs' claims that Walther is biased against the FLDS Church he leads, allowing Walther to continue the trial under the new Texas Supreme Court rules that no longer require an immediate hearing to recuse a judge after evidence in a case has been heard. Walther said a hearing would be held later. The new rules just went into effect Monday. The delay in the trial on Monday came on the same day that Jeff's brother, Lyle Jeffs, appeared in court as a spectator for the first time, according to the Salt Lake City Tribune. Lyle Jeffs is the bishop of Short Creek, the branch of the FLDS church located in Utah-Colorado City, Ariz. Silence, Then Outbursts From Jeffs After choosing to defend himself and then spending hours in silence in court on Thursday, Jeffs released a series of outburst in court on Friday, warning court officials that if they don't stop prosecuting him on two counts of sexual assault of a child, they would face an even bigger problem -- the wrath of God. After Judge Barbara Walther overruled Jeffs' objection to the proceedings against him, Jeffs, acting as his own lawyer, said he would read what he described as a statement from God. The judge dismissed the jury from the courtroom, and then Jeffs read the statement. \\"I, the Lord God of heaven,\\" Jeffs read, according to The Associated Press, \\"call upon the court to cease this open prosecution against my pure, holy way.\\" If officials did not halt the proceedings, the statement said, \\"I will send a scourge upon the counties of prosecutorial zeal to make humbled by sickness and death.\\" Walther said she'd remove Jeffs from the courtroom if he repeated the claim in front of jurors. The statement from God capped a day featuring a nearly hour-long outburst by Jeffs, begun with a cry of \\"I object!\\" in court Friday afternoon, followed by a launch into a passionate sermon defending the \\"tradition\\" of polygamy, a practice he considers the will of God. In opening statements the day before, Thursday, the only time the courtroom heard from the polygamist religious leader during was during a bizarre diatribe in which Jeffs spoke in sermon-like tones for 25 minutes on how his attorneys could not present a \\"pure defense.\\" After summarily firing his defense team, he sat alone, with his hands folded and head bowed, at the defense table, declining to make an opening statement, issue a plea or question witnesses. Jeffs' Friday outburst occurred while FBI agent John Broadway was testifying about computers and documents seized from the sect's compound. Broadway was on the verge of describing a list of people living at Jeffs' compound when Jeffs spoke up, saying the trust given to religious leadership should \\"not be touched by government agencies.\\" During his 55-minute speech, Jeffs, acting as his own lawyer, said polygamy \\"is not [all] of a sudden happening, it is of a tradition in our lives. And how can we just throw it away and say 'God has not spoken?'\\" \\"We are not a fly-by-night religious society,\\" he said. \\"We are a community of faith and principles and those principles are so sacred. They belong to God, not to man and the governments of man.\\" The jurors listened carefully, but didn't react to Jeffs' words. \\"We are derided for how we dress, how we go about our laborers in a common society,\\" Jeffs said, insisting that the Texas authorities who had conducted the April 2008 raid targeted him and his followers because they look different. He asked state Judge Walther to suspend the case and investigate whether his church's religious freedoms were violated, saying, \\"The government of the United States had no right to infringe on the religious freedom of a peaceful people.\\" After Jeffs had spoken for nearly an hour, lead prosecutor Eric Nichols said religious freedom does not extend to polygamy. Jeffs attempted to interrupt, and continued to do so until Walther finally dismissed the jury, ordering Jeffs to speak with defense attorney Deric Walpole, who had been asked to remain present as standby counsel. Jeffs' sect broke off from the mainstream Mormon Church 72 years ago. His 10,000 followers across North America consider him a prophet who serves as God's spokesman on earth. Sect teachings emphasize that polygamy is the key to exaltation in heaven, and that young girls and women are to be obedient to their husbands and serve them \\"mind, body and soul\\" to achieve salvation in the afterlife. On Thursday, the prosecution told jurors they have an audio tape of a sexual encounter between the 55-year-old Jeffs and a 12-year-old girl, and DNA evidence showing he impregnated a 15-year-old girl. \\"The stakes are very high for Mr. Jeffs,\\" ABC News legal analyst Dan Abrams told \\"Good Morning America.\\" \\"In almost all cases here someone decided to represent him or herself, it usually doesn't end well.\\" The Associated Press contributed to this report. ||||| Polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs, arrives at the the Tom Green County Courthouse for the second day of his sexual assault trial Friday, July 29, 2011, in San Angelo, Texas.

Siddhant, however, arranges for another governess. Meanwhile, a con man named Shekhar (Ajay Devgan) and his friend Jadu (Johnny Lever) have just robbed a bank and are on the run from police. Shekhar comes across the beautiful Anna (Kajol) who is to be the governess of the Rai children. Shekhar tries to woo Anna with no success.

Answer:","completion":"\\"Family Fortunes: The Ties That Bind\\" The suggested movie title, \\"Family Fortunes: The Ties That Bind,\\" highlights the central themes of the movie plot, which revolve around family, love, deceit, and personal transformation. It emphasizes the fact that, despite their differences, Siddhant's family remains connected to each other and must overcome various obstacles to protect and maintain their bond. By incorporating the words \\"Family Fortunes,\\" the title emphasizes the significance of the Rai family's wealth as a driving force for much of the narrative. Owing to their affluent status, the family attracts individuals like Shekhar who sought to exploit their riches, causing unforeseen difficulties that test the unity and resilience of the family.

Up in front of me was a giant billboard advertising yet another jeweler, in ten-foot letters and bright silver watches like massive alien machines. The traffic slowed and stopped on the ramp as it bottlenecked further into the city, and my head turned to examine the sign and the blocked view of the cityscape and land beyond. Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers.

Solve this instance: Context: Serum hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is associated with blood pressure. We investigated whether the serum HGF level differs between hypertensive and normotensive postmenopausal women (PMW) and whether hormone replacement therapy (HRT) alters the serum HGF level and blood pressure in hypertensive and normotensive PMW.', 'Prospective observational study.', 'A total of 33 PMW with mild to moderate essential hypertension controlled by antihypertensive treatment (mean age, 57 +/- 6 years) and 23 normotensive PMW (mean age, 57 +/- 7 years) received continuous HRT (0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogen combined with 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate) once a day orally for 12 months, and we measured serum HGF levels and blood pressure before and 12 months after the start of HRT.', 'The baseline serum HGF level was significantly higher in hypertensive PMW than in normotensive PMW. HRT significantly decreased the serum HGF level in hypertensive subjects, from 2.85 +/- 0.64 pmol/l to 2.49 +/- 0.65 pmol/l (P < 0.001), but not in normotensive subjects.

Write an article that answers the following question: What happened second: protracted action at Verdun or the costly Nivelle Offensive?","completion":"Title: The Story of Two Battles: Which Came Second, Verdun or the Nivelle Offensive? Hello, little friends! Today, I'm going to tell you a story about two very important battles from a long, long time ago. These battles were called the Battle of Verdun and the Nivelle Offensive, and they happened during a time called World War One. This was a big war that affected many countries all around the world, and these two battles were fought mostly by two countries: France and Germany. Now, let's talk about which one of these battles happened second. First, we have the Battle of Verdun. This battle started on February 21, 1916, and was a really long and difficult fight between the French and German armies. Verdun was a very important place in France, and the Germans wanted to take control of it. The French fought very bravely to protect this special place, and the battle lasted for a very, very long time. In fact, it lasted for almost 10 months! That's longer than a school year! Finally, on December 18, 1916, the fighting stopped, and the French kept control of Verdun. Next, let's talk about the Nivelle Offensive. This battle has the name of a French commander, General Robert Nivelle. He had a big plan to defeat the German army and win the war for France. The Nivelle Offensive started on April 16, 1917, which is a bit later than the Battle of Verdun. The battle involved both French and British armies, and they fought together against the German army. But things didn't go the way they hoped, and many soldiers were hurt or lost their lives in this fight. After about a month, General Nivelle was replaced by another commander because people were not happy with the way the battle was going. Now, let's answer the big question: Which of these two battles - Verdun or the Nivelle Offensive - happened second? Remember, the Battle of Verdun started in February 1916 and ended in December 1916. The Nivelle Offensive began in April 1917. So, when we compare those dates, we can see that the Nivelle Offensive happened after the Battle of Verdun, which means that the Nivelle Offensive was the second battle. In conclusion, the Battle of Verdun and the Nivelle Offensive were two very important and serious battles that happened during World War One. Both battles were very difficult for the soldiers involved, but through this story, we learned that the Nivelle Offensive happened second, after the long and tough Battle of Verdun."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 2: Is it true that humans only use 10% of their brains? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Question 1: Cognitive Neuroscience: How can we tap into and unleash the unused 90% of our brains? The concept of humans using only a small percentage of their brains is a widespread myth. However, for the sake of argument, let's explore how cognitive neuroscience might approach tapping into one's brain potential for the sake of improving cognitive abilities. 1. Brain training: Engaging in activities that require mental effort, such as learning new skills or languages, can help keep the brain sharp and improve overall cognitive abilities. 2. Neurofeedback: This technique involves monitoring an individual's brain activity and providing real-time feedback to help them understand and modify their own brain states. Some research has shown that neurofeedback can offer potential benefits in attention, memory, and cognitive flexibility. 3. Meditation and mindfulness: Several studies have demonstrated that regular meditation can help increase the brain's neuroplasticity, enabling one to better adapt to new situations and improve their cognitive skills. Mindfulness can also reduce stress, improve concentration, and promote emotional well-being. 4. Physical exercise: Regular physical activity is known to have a multitude of benefits for cognitive health, including increased blood flow to the brain, reduced inflammation, and increased levels of certain chemicals that promote brain health. 5. Sleep and nutrition: The quality and quantity of sleep an individual receives has a direct impact on their cognitive functioning, while maintaining a healthy diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and essential nutrients can support optimal brain function. Question 2: Is it true that humans only use 10% of their brains? This widely-held belief is actually a myth, and there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that humans only use 10% of their brains. In reality, the entirety of the human brain is constantly active, even during sleep. Each part of the brain has a specific function, with numerous regions working together to perform complex tasks and support everyday cognitive functioning. Neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans consistently show activity throughout the brain, demonstrating that humans use far more than just 10% of their brain capacity. Moreover, if humans indeed used only a fraction of their brains, severe brain damage would not cause such devastating consequences, as the \\"unused\\" portions would compensate for any loss of function. In conclusion, the answers to these two questions are not the same. Question 1 addresses the possibility of improving cognitive abilities by tapping into and enhancing the brain's potential, while question 2 addresses the misconception that humans utilize only a small percentage of their brain capacity. However, unraveling the myth behind the \\"10% brain capacity\\" belief subsequently adjusts the context for question 1 as well, encouraging a focus on optimizing brain function rather than unlocking an unused portion of the brain."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

In the 19th and (before the end of World War II) 20th centuries, the Roman Catholic Church adhered to a distinction between \\"good antisemitism\\" and \\"bad antisemitism\\". The \\"bad\\" kind promoted hatred of Jews because of their descent. This was considered un-Christian because the Christian message was intended for all of humanity regardless of ethnicity; anyone could become a Christian. The \\"good\\" kind criticized alleged Jewish conspiracies to control newspapers, banks, and other institutions, to care only about accumulation of wealth, etc. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Who did not make a distinction between \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" antisemitism?","completion":"It is difficult to pinpoint specific individuals or groups who did not make a distinction between \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" antisemitism, as views on antisemitism varied widely among different people, communities, and time periods. However, we can broadly discuss groups and ideologies that did not adhere to the distinction as proposed by the Roman Catholic Church during the 19th and early 20th centuries. 1. The Nazi regime and its collaborators: The most notorious example of antisemitism in the 20th century, the Nazi regime under Adolf Hitler, did not differentiate between \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" antisemitism. Instead, they viewed Jews as a racially inferior and dangerous group, leading to the systematic persecution and eventual genocide of around six million Jews in the Holocaust. 2. Early Christian communities: Prior to the distinction made by the Roman Catholic Church, several early Christian communities accused Jews of deicide (killing Jesus) and promoted negative stereotypes of Jews. These views, often based on religious grounds, did not differentiate between \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" antisemitism. 3. Radical nationalist and far-right movements: Throughout history, various far-right and nationalist movements have espoused antisemitic views without differentiating between \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" versions. Their understanding of antisemitism often involved conspiracy theories, racial hatred, and discrimination against Jews as a monolithic group. 4. Martin Luther and some Protestant reformers: The Protestant Reformation also features instances of antisemitism, notably from Martin Luther, who authored a virulently antisemitic treatise titled \\"On the Jews and Their Lies.\\" His views were not grounded in the distinction between \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" antisemitism but were rooted in religious differences, accusations of Jewish malice, and the perceived threat they posed to Christianity. It is worth noting that attitudes towards antisemitism changed over time, including within the Roman Catholic Church itself. The Second Vatican Council sought to address and condemn antisemitism through the document \\"Nostra Aetate\\" in 1965, significantly changing the Church's stance on the matter by repudiating the charge of collective Jewish guilt for the crucifixion of Jesus and promoting understanding and respect between Catholics and Jews."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Information: - The Greenland Sea is a body of water that borders Greenland to the west, the Svalbard archipelago to the east, Fram Strait and the Arctic Ocean to the north, and the Norwegian Sea and Iceland to the south. The Greenland Sea is often defined as part of the Arctic Ocean, sometimes as part of the Atlantic Ocean. However, definitions of the Arctic Ocean and its seas tend to be imprecise or arbitrary. In general usage the term \\"Arctic Ocean\\" would exclude the Greenland Sea. In oceanographic studies the Greenland Sea is considered part of the Nordic Seas, along with the Norwegian Sea. The Nordic Seas are the main connection between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans and, as such, could be of great significance in a possible shutdown of thermohaline circulation. In oceanography the Arctic Ocean and Nordic Seas are often referred to collectively as the \\"Arctic Mediterranean Sea\\", a marginal sea of the Atlantic. - Geologically, a fjord or fiord is a long, narrow inlet with steep sides or cliffs, created by glacial erosion. There are many fjords on the coasts of Alaska, British Columbia, Chile, Greenland, Iceland, the Kerguelen Islands, New Zealand, Norway, Novaya Zemlya, Labrador, Nunavut, Newfoundland, Scotland, and Washington state. Norway's coastline is estimated at with fjords, but only when fjords are excluded. - The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate. - The Canadian Arctic Archipelago, also known as the Arctic Archipelago, is a group of islands north of the Canadian mainland. - Liverpool Land is a peninsula in eastern Greenland. Geography. The peninsula is bounded by Scoresby Sund in the south, \\"Carlsberg Fjord\\" in the northwest, \\"Kangerterajiva\\" (Hurry Inlet) in the southwest, the Greenland Sea in the east, and Jameson Land in the west. It was named by William Scoresby, who thought that Hurry Inlet had a confluence with Carlsberg Fjord, separating Liverpool Land from Jameson Land. The fjord-rich peninsula is long from Kap Greville in the north to Uunarteq in the south, up to wide, and measures about in area. It is connected to Jameson Land over a length of . - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - The Danish Realm is a realm comprising Denmark proper, The Faroe Islands and Greenland. - Greenland is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island. - Global warming and climate change are terms for the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system and its related effects. Multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming. Although the increase of near-surface atmospheric temperature is the measure of global warming often reported in the popular press, most of the additional energy stored in the climate system since 1970 has gone into the oceans. The rest has melted ice and warmed the continents and atmosphere. Many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented over tens to thousands of years. - The Arctic (or ) is a polar region located at the northernmost part of Earth. The Arctic consists of the Arctic Ocean, adjacent seas, and parts of Alaska (United States), Canada, Finland, Greenland (Denmark), Iceland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden. Land within the Arctic region has seasonally varying snow and ice cover, with predominantly treeless permafrost-containing tundra. Arctic seas contain seasonal sea ice in many places. - Inuit (pronounced or ; Inuktitut: , \\"the people\\") are a group of culturally similar indigenous peoples inhabiting the Arctic regions of Greenland, Canada and Alaska. Inuit is a plural noun; the singular is Inuk. The oral Inuit languages are classified in the Eskimo-Aleut family.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person who is assigned to train the new missionary?, using the article: The Best Two Years portrays the experience of four missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints living in the same apartment in Haarlem in the Netherlands. The movie begins with Elder Rogers finding out that his new companion will be a \\"greenie\\", a newly trained missionary fresh from the Missionary Training Center. He and the other two missionaries that reside in the same apartment, Elder Johnson and Elder Van Pelt, go to the train station to meet the new elder. Elder Rogers finds out that the new missionary, Elder Calhoun, is exactly what he had jokingly predicted his new companion would be like. Elder Rogers used to be an excellent missionary, until his girlfriend married one of his former mission companions. That is why he and the other two missionaries residing in the same apartment are surprised that the mission president has assigned him to be the trainer (first companion and mentor) to a missionary new to the mission. The new missionary, Elder Calhoun, tackles mission work with unbounded enthusiasm. He attempts to talk to anyone although he has little knowledge of the Dutch language. Despite his poor Dutch, he continues to have an eager attitude. Fortunately for him, he soon encounters a man from the United States that speaks English. They speak briefly in the park before the man goes off with his girlfriend. Later, when he encounters the same man in a market, Calhoun gives him a Dutch Book of Mormon with his telephone number. Despite what the other three missionaries expect, the man does call and asks for Calhoun., what would be the answer ?

Summarize this article: Ricciardo beat Rosberg by 0.169 seconds as Hamilton salvaged third after a troubled session in which he suffered an engine problem in final qualifying. The issue meant Hamilton only had one run to everyone else's two and could manage only 0.320secs off the pace. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel took fourth ahead of Force India's Nico Hulkenberg. Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix is live on the BBC Sport website and radio 5 live from 13:00 BST Hamilton had to be wheeled back to the Mercedes garage after his car lost power in the pit lane at the start of the top 10 shoot-out. But he was actually fastest of all in the first sector on his final lap of the session, after doing three build-up laps to try to get the ultra-soft tyres in the best condition. However, his pace dropped off in the final two sectors and he was left to rue yet another technical problem affecting his season. He is 43 points behind Rosberg in the championship, after problems affected his results in three of the first four races - all of which the German won - before the two crashed out together on the first lap in Spain two weeks ago. Hamilton said: \\"I don't really know what to say right now. It was a difficult qualifying but the good thing is I did get out to do a lap, so it is not as bad as some of the races have been. \\"I'm grateful to be up in third and I will do what I can to salvage what I can from today's result.\\" Ricciardo's pole time, the first of the Australian's F1 career, marks an impressive debut for a new, upgraded Renault engine which is worth an extra 30bhp. It is still not quite as powerful as Mercedes' engine but it is close enough for the excellence of the Red Bull chassis in slow corners to make up the difference. Allied to Ricciardo's liquid but exuberant attacking style, it made for a formidable combination around the demanding Monaco street circuit. \\"I knew coming into the weekend we had a strong chance and it looked good from Thursday,\\" Ricciardo said. \\"I feel like I have been driving well the last few races but hadn't got maximum reward. I came into the weekend feeling I could be in this position now. \\"It feels good. I have always enjoyed this place. We have a good package and it is nice to make the most of it.\\" Ricciardo has chosen an alternative strategy for the race - he will start the grand prix on the slower super-soft tyre, using the ultra-soft in the second stint. That means he can run longer before his pit stop and may be able to control the race even more easily than would anyway be the case from pole. Ricciardo's team-mate Max Verstappen crashed heavily early in the first session and will start 21st. The Dutchman, who won the last race in Spain on his debut for Red Bull, misjudged his entry to the second part of the Swimming Pool complex and clouted the barrier on the inside with his right front wheel. That broke his front suspension, and threw him across the track, over the kerbs of the second part of the corner and into the wall. The 18-year-old said: \\"Of course that is not the way you want to start for tomorrow. \\"I turned in a bit too early, broke the suspension and then couldn't recover from it. It's a case of misjudgement - that is all. A miscalculation - I just misjudged the grip a little bit.\\" Further down the field, McLaren's pre-event prediction that they would get both cars into the top 10 fell flat. Fernando Alonso did manage it, qualifying 10th, but team-mate Jenson Button was only 13th. McLaren were surprised by the pace of the Force India and Toro Rosso cars, who they had not expected to be so quick. Behind Hulkenberg, Kimi Raikkonen's Ferrari was sixth, but will start 11th because of a five-place penalty for a gearbox change. Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz was seventh, ahead of Force India's Sergio Perez, the second Toro Rosso of Danill Kvyat and Alonso.

Moore chronicles how GM had previously defined his childhood while growing up in Flint, Michigan, and how the company was the primary economic and social hub of the town. He points out that Flint is the place where the 1937 Flint Sit-Down Strike occurred, resulting in the birth of the United Auto Workers. He reveals that his heroes were the Flint natives who had escaped the life in GM's factories, including the members of Grand Funk Railroad, Casey Kasem, the spouses of Zubin Mehta (Nancy Kovack) and Don Knotts, and \\"Flint's most famous native son,\\" game show host Bob Eubanks.Initially, he achieves his dream of avoiding the dreary tradition of blue-collared factory life that lays for the majority of the population of Flint; by moving to California and working for a magazine in San Francisco, but this venture fails for him and he ultimately travels back to Flint. As he returns (in 1985), General Motors announces the layoffs of thousands of Flint auto workers, the jobs of whom will go to cheaper labor when the plant relocates to Mexico. GM makes this announcement even though the company is (according to Moore) experiencing record profits.Disguised as a TV journalist from Toledo, Ohio, Moore interviews some auto workers in Flint and discovers their strong antipathy to General Motors chairman Roger B.

Conversely, Stylus Magazine's Edwin Faust wrote in 2003 that the album \\"embraces the listener with a drugged out sincerity; a feat never accomplished by the more pretentious and heavy-handed psychedelia of that era. It is for this reason Smiley Smile flows so well with the more experimental pop of today\\". According to music theorist Daniel Harrison, Smiley Smile is not a work of rock music as the term was understood in 1967, and that portions of the album \\"can be thought of as a kind of protomiminal rock music\\". He continues: Smiley Smile can almost be considered a work of art music in the Western classical tradition, and its innovations in the musical language of rock can be compared to those that introduced atonal and other nontraditional techniques into that classical tradition. The spirit of experimentation is just as palpable in Smiley Smile as it is in, say, Schoenberg's op. 11 piano pieces. Yet there is also a spirit of tentativeness in Smiley Smile. We must remember that it was essentially a Plan B—that is, the album issued instead of Smile. The Beach Boys recorded using what was predominantly radio broadcasting equipment, which lacked many of the technical elements and effects found in an established studio. This led to unconventional ways of achieving particular sounds at the home, such as a replacement for what would be achieved by an echo chamber.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: Twenty-year-olds who started antiretroviral therapy in 2010 are projected to live 10 years longer than those first using it in 1996, it found. Doctors say that starting treatment early is crucial to achieve a long and healthy life. Charities say there are still too many people unaware they have the virus. This is particularly true in the developing world, where the majority of HIV deaths occur because access to drugs is limited. The study authors, from the University of Bristol, said the extraordinary success of HIV treatments was a result of newer drugs having fewer side effects and being better at preventing the virus from replicating in the body. It is also more difficult for the virus to build up a resistance to the most recent drugs. Improved screening and prevention programmes and better treatment of health problems caused by HIV are thought to have helped, too. But many people with HIV still do not live as long as expected, especially those infected through injecting drugs. Antiretroviral therapy involves a combination of three or more drugs which block the normal progress of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). They have been called \\"one of the greatest public health success stories of the past 40 years\\". Jimmy Isaacs, 28, discovered he had been infected with HIV by a former partner nearly three years ago. He takes three drugs once a day at 18:00 and will continue to do so for the rest of his life. \\"My health is absolutely fine. I'm eating healthily and drinking healthily,\\" he said. \\"It doesn't impact on my job and hasn't impacted on my social life either.\\" Although it took two changes of medication to find the right combination for him, he says he now has no side effects at all. \\"I had heard a lot of bad stories about the drugs back in the '90s - but when I did some research, I realised the drugs had completely changed.\\" Not all his employers have been supportive since his diagnosis and he says that is down to ignorance. His current employer has given him time off to tour the country and speak to students and school pupils about HIV prevention and treatment. The researchers looked at 88,500 people with HIV from Europe and North America who had been involved in 18 studies. They based their life-expectancy predictions on death rates during the first three years of follow-up after drug treatment was started. They found that fewer people who started treatment between 2008 and 2010 died during this period compared with those who began treatment between 1996 and 2007. The expected age at death of a 20-year-old patient starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) after 2008, with a low viral load and after the first year of treatment, was 78 years - similar to the general population. Dr Michael Brady, medical director at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said the study showed how much things had changed since the start of the HIV epidemic in the 1980s. But he said it also meant people aged over 50 now represented one in three of all those living with HIV. \\"As it stands, the healthcare, social care and welfare systems simply aren't ready to support the increasing numbers of people growing older with HIV. \\"We need a new model of care to better integrate primary care with HIV specialist services, and we need a major shift in awareness and training around HIV and ageing, so that we're ready to help older people live well in later life,\\" he said. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said: \\"It's a tremendous medical achievement that an infection that once had such a terrible prognosis is now so manageable, and that patients with HIV are living significantly longer. \\"We hope the results of this study go a long way to finally removing any remaining stigma associated with HIV, and ensuring that patients with HIV can live long and healthy lives without experiencing difficulties in gaining employment and - in countries where it is necessary - obtaining medical insurance.\\" She said steps were being taken to increase appropriate HIV testing by GPs. The proportion of people with undiagnosed HIV has fallen steadily over the past 20 years. But one in eight people with HIV is still thought to remain undiagnosed.

Article: Apple a day may poison children Children who eat an apple or pear a day may be exceeding the pesticide safety limit because of remains on the fruit,according to research. Using data of the British Department of Environment on pesticides on fruit collected from supermarkets,scientists thought that each day some children would get a poisonous level of pesticides. The research,published on Sunday,says the government repeatedly claims that the levels of pesticide are safe because,instead of measuring individual apples, researchers buy 10,crush them and take an average reading to see if they are safe. This is the internationally agreed method of checking remains. But government figures show that the pesticide is not averagely spread across the batch ,and one or two apples could contain 90% or more of the pesticide in the batch. It used mathematical modeling to measure exposure to pesticides for children aged between 18 months and four years old. The pesticides involved can destroy children's hormones and some are suspected of causing cancer. The good news for British fruit growers is that samples grown in this country had lower _ level than imported fruit,so buying home-produced fruit will reduce the danger,said Emily Diamand,one of the Earth's senior food researchers and one of the authors of the report.

The research, which was published on Sunday, challenges the government's claims that pesticide levels are safe. The current method of measuring pesticide levels involves taking an average reading from a batch of 10 crushed apples. However, government figures indicate that pesticides are not evenly distributed across the batch and that one or two apples could contain 90% or more of the total pesticide amount. This poses a risk to children between the ages of 18 months and four years old who may be exposed to higher levels of pesticides than initially believed. The pesticides in question are known to disrupt children's hormones and have been suspected of causing cancer. However, the article does provide some good news for those who consume British-grown fruit, as the research found that samples grown in the country had lower levels of pesticides compared to imported fruit. This suggests that buying home-produced fruit could help reduce the potential dangers associated with pesticide residue on apples and pears."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

If \\"A cowboy in a rodeo trying to beat the 8 second clock.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A cowboy is about to be bucked off a bull.\\"?","completion":"From the given statement, \\"A cowboy in a rodeo trying to beat the 8-second clock,\\" certain conclusions can be derived, but it is important to examine the context and various elements involved in a rodeo to determine if it logically follows that \\"A cowboy is about to be bucked off a bull.\\" A rodeo is a competitive and entertainment event that often involves various timed activities involving cowboys, bulls, and horses. One of the most iconic events in a rodeo is the bull riding competition. The objective of this sport is for a cowboy to stay mounted on a bull for as long as possible, with the ultimate goal of reaching or exceeding the 8-second mark. Bull riding is dangerous and requires a high level of skill, physical strength, and mental focus for the cowboy. The phrase \\"trying to beat the 8-second clock\\" suggests that the cowboy is attempting to stay on the bull for at least 8 seconds, which is considered the minimum amount of time to earn points and achieve a successful bull ride. If a cowboy is able to remain on the bull for the complete duration of 8 seconds without touching the bull or himself with his free hand, he can potentially score points based on his performance and the bull's bucking action, spin, and agility. A bull in a rodeo is typically restless and attempts to buck off the rider as quickly as possible. Given the unpredictable nature of bulls and the inherent difficulty of bull riding, the likelihood of a cowboy being bucked off is high. However, it is important to note that, at any given moment during the 8-second ride, the cowboy may or may not be on the verge of being bucked off. Success in bull riding depends on factors such as the cowboy's experience, the bull's temperament and bucking patterns, and the rider's ability to maintain the right balance and grip. While it is plausible that a cowboy may be bucked off during the 8-second attempt, the given statement does not explicitly imply that the cowboy is \\"about to be\\" bucked off the bull. This statement could also refer to a skilled cowboy who is doing well in their attempt to stay mounted for the full 8 seconds. In conclusion, the statement \\"A cowboy in a rodeo trying to beat the 8-second clock\\" does not necessarily and logically lead to the conclusion that \\"A cowboy is about to be bucked off a bull.\\" Although the possibility of being bucked off is high in the sport of bull riding, it is important to consider the skill of the cowboy, the bull's behavior, and the specific circumstances during the ride. The statement merely indicates that a cowboy is participating in a bull riding event, attempting to achieve a successful ride to beat the 8-second mark."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The only home Hamilton ever owned was a Federal style mansion designed by John McComb Jr., which he built on his 32-acre country estate in Hamilton Heights in upper Manhattan. He named the house, which was completed in 1802, the \\"Grange\\" after his grandfather Alexander's estate in Ayrshire, Scotland. The house remained in the family until 1833 when his widow sold it to Thomas E. Davis, a British born real estate developer, for 25,000. Part of the proceeds were used by Eliza to purchase a new townhouse from Davis (Hamilton-Holly House) in Greenwich Village with her son Alexander. The Grange, first moved from its original location in 1889, was moved again in 2008 to a spot in St. Nicholas Park on land that was once part of the Hamilton estate, in Hamilton Heights, a neighborhood in upper Manhattan. The historic structure was restored to its original 1802 appearance in 2011, and is maintained by the National Park service as Hamilton Grange National Memorial. Alexander Hamilton served as one of the first trustees of the Hamilton-Oneida Academy in New York state.

Article: Spiders are not insects as many people believe. They belong to a class of animals called arachnids . Spiders have eight eyes, four pairs of legs, and can grow a new leg if they lose one. A spider's body is divided into two sections: the abdomen and the thorax .The legs, eyes, and mouthparts are in the thorax section. Most spiders have poison glands and sharp teeth. They use their sharp teeth to force poison into the insects they catch for food. This poison can make an insect lose the ability to move, and the helpless insect is then _ by the spider. Spiders usually have silk glands under their abdomen. They produce a liquid that is thicker than water from their glands. When the liquid comes into the air, it dries into silk. Many spiders use this silk to form webs to catch insects and to make cocoons that protect their eggs. This amazing silk is also used to create lines that spiders hang onto as they travel to new areas. Spiders live in almost everywhere on earth. The only places where there are no spiders are the coldest places, the highest mountains and the seas. Question: According to the passage, which of the following is WRONG?

Brooks has written on Frank Lloyd Wright and the Prairie School and on the early years of Le Corbusier. - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America. With over 2.7 million residents, it is the most populous city in the state of Illinois and the Midwestern United States, and the county seat of Cook County. The Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland, has nearly 10 million people and is the third-largest in the U.S. - Prairies are ecosystems considered part of the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome by ecologists, based on similar temperate climates, moderate rainfall, and a composition of grasses, herbs, and shrubs, rather than trees, as the dominant vegetation type. Temperate grassland regions include the Pampas of Argentina, southern Brazil and Uruguay as well as the steppes of Eurasia. Lands typically referred to as \\"prairie\\" tend to be in North America. The term encompasses the area referred to as the Interior Lowlands of Canada, the United States, and Mexico, which includes all of the Great Plains as well as the wetter, somewhat hillier land to the east. In the U.S., the area is constituted by most or all of the states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma, and sizable parts of the states of Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, and western and southern Minnesota. The Central Valley of California is also a prairie. The Canadian Prairies occupy vast areas of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. - The American Foursquare or American Four Square is an American house style popular from the mid- 1890s to the late 1930s . A reaction to the ornate and mass - produced elements of the Victorian and other Revival styles popular throughout the last half of the 19th century , the American Foursquare was plain , often incorporating handcrafted \`\` honest '' woodwork ( unless purchased from a mail - order catalog ) . This style incorporates elements of the Prairie School and the Craftsman styles . It is also sometimes called Transitional Period . The hallmarks of the style include a basically square , boxy design , two - and - one - half stories high , usually with four large , boxy rooms to a floor , a center dormer , and a large front porch with wide stairs . The boxy shape provides a maximum amount of interior room space , to use a small city lot to best advantage . Other common features included a hipped roof , arched entries between common rooms , built - in cabinetry , and Craftsman - style woodwork . A typical design would be as follows : first floor , from front to back , on one side , the living room and dining room ; while on the other side , the entry room or foyer , stairway and kitchen . Sometimes a bathroom was also included . Second floor , front to back , on one side , bedroom , bathroom and bedroom ; while on the other side , bedroom , stairway and bedroom . The bedrooms had a slightly longer dimension along the front and back of the house with side by side closets between the bedrooms . This gave a very efficient layout with a bedroom in each corner and a centralized bathroom and stairway . The top floor was generally just a big open space with one to four dormers . The basement generally contained a large natural convection furnace or boiler . - Prairie School was a late 19th- and early 20th-century architectural style, most common to the Midwestern United States. The style is usually marked by horizontal lines, flat or hipped roofs with broad overhanging eaves, windows grouped in horizontal bands, integration with the landscape, solid construction, craftsmanship, and discipline in the use of ornament. Horizontal lines were thought to evoke and relate to the native prairie landscape. The term \\"Prairie School\\" was not actually used by these architects to describe themselves (for instance, Marion Mahony used the phrase \\"The Chicago Group\\"); the term was coined by H.

A slush fund can be seen as a financial safety net, providing a cushion for individuals or organizations when unforeseen circumstances arise. This financial back-up plan can be highly beneficial in maintaining stability and avoiding potential crises. A slush fund, essentially, is a reserved amount of money set aside for emergencies or unforeseen expenses that are not part of the standard budget. It is often kept separate from savings accounts or other designated funds, allowing individuals or organizations to access it quickly when necessary. It is important to keep in mind that a slush fund should not be used for everyday expenses or frivolous purchases. It is meant to protect against unexpected expenditures, such as medical emergencies, vehicle repairs, sudden job loss, or natural disasters. There are several key reasons why having a slush fund is useful: 1. Financial security: A slush fund acts as a buffer against sudden financial shocks. For example, if someone loses their job and their primary source of income, a slush fund can cover essential expenses while they search for new employment. 2. Reduced stress and anxiety: Knowing that there is a financial cushion available in case of unexpected events can alleviate stress and anxiety associated with money-related issues. 3. Improved mental well-being: Having a slush fund can lead to a sense of financial responsibility and control, boosting confidence and self-reliance. 4. Greater flexibility: With a slush fund in place, individuals and organizations can more effectively address unplanned needs when they arise, such as urgent repairs, without impacting their regular budget or allocated resources. 5. Better financial planning: A slush fund encourages individuals to prepare for the unexpected and be mindful of their financial well-being. This proactive approach can help prevent significant financial disasters in the long run. To build a slush fund, it is essential to first determine the appropriate amount to set aside based on individual or organizational needs. Factors to consider include monthly expenses, existing savings, and unique circumstances such as health conditions or job stability. One common recommendation is to maintain a slush fund sufficient to cover three to six months' worth of living expenses. The fund should be kept in a separate, easily accessible account, such as a high-yield savings account or a money market account. In conclusion, having a slush fund is an essential part of responsible financial planning. It helps individuals and organizations to manage unexpected expenses without jeopardizing their regular budget, providing a safety net that promotes financial stability, reduced stress, and improved mental well-being. By taking the time to establish a slush fund, individuals and organizations can protect themselves from financial crises and navigate unforeseen events with greater ease and confidence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She took into consideration any specific treatments she knew Kayla particularly enjoyed, making sure that the spa she chose offered those options. Jessica did not want to risk anything going wrong, as she knew Kayla really needed a pick-me-up. After selecting a highly-rated spa, Jessica discretely made a reservation for two, requesting private spa rooms and a schedule that included massages, facials, and a manicure-pedicure experience. Jessica felt that these treatments would help Kayla feel relaxed and rejuvenated, while also giving her a confidence boost. Knowing that Kayla would be curious about her plans, Jessica created a loose cover story she could use in case Kayla asked her what they would be doing that day. She decided to tell Kayla that they would be going shopping, which was something they enjoyed doing together. This way, she could ensure that Kayla would dress appropriately for a spa day and would not suspect the true nature of the surprise.

Movie title: Ratatouille Movie plot: Remy is an idealistic and ambitious young rat, gifted with highly developed senses of taste and smell. Inspired by his idol, the recently deceased chef Auguste Gusteau, Remy dreams of becoming a cook himself. When an old French woman discovers Remy's clan in her house, they are forced to flee, and Remy becomes separated from his family in the panic. He ends up in the sewers of Paris and eventually finds himself at a skylight overlooking the kitchen of Gusteau's restaurant. As Remy watches, a young man named Alfredo Linguini is hired as a garbage boy by Skinner, the restaurant's devious current owner and Gusteau's former sous-chef. When Linguini spills a pot of soup and attempts to recreate it, Remy recognizes that he is ruining it instead, and repairs Linguini's mistakes. Linguini catches Remy, but hides him when he is then confronted by Skinner for tampering with the soup. As the two argue, the soup is accidentally served and proves to be a success. Colette Tatou, the staff's only female chef, convinces Skinner to retain Linguini, who is assumed to be the soup's creator.

Answer:","completion":"Given the context provided, it can be inferred that Addison would likely feel a variety of emotions and physical sensations after eating tacos at the park and getting full quickly. We must consider multiple factors to explore the possible feelings Addison might experience. Firstly, let's consider the physical sensations that Addison would experience as a result of eating tacos and getting full rapidly. When a person consumes food quickly and becomes full, they might encounter feelings of discomfort or bloating. It is also possible that Addison could feel lethargic after eating a filling meal. This could lead to a decreased inclination towards participating in any physical activities in the park or engaging in social interactions with others. Secondly, let's examine the emotional aspect. Depending on the circumstances surrounding Addison's decision to eat tacos, several emotions might come into play following the meal. If Addison had been craving tacos and was excited at the prospect of eating them, they might initially feel satisfied and content once they have satisfied their craving. However, if the overly full sensation becomes unpleasant, Addison might experience a range of negative emotions, such as regret or disappointment in overeating or eating too quickly. Additionally, if they were eating in the company of friends or family, they might feel self-conscious or embarrassed about suddenly feeling full or uncomfortable. Moreover, it's essential to consider the context and environment in which Addison ate the tacos. The park setting might contribute to their feelings in different ways. If the weather was pleasant and the park's atmosphere was relaxing, Addison might feel more inclined to find a soothing place to sit or lie down and let their fullness subside. On the other hand, if the park was crowded, noisy, or chaotic, they might feel overwhelmed or agitated, especially if they are already experiencing physical discomfort from their meal. Lastly, Addison's personal disposition and temperament would also play a role in how they feel after consuming the tacos. If they are generally an optimistic and resilient person, they might be more capable of managing the physical discomfort and focusing on the positive aspects of their experience, such as the enjoyment of a satisfying meal or the opportunity to spend time outdoors in the park. Conversely, if they are more inclined to dwell on negative feelings or have had a stressful day, the discomfort of getting full quickly could exacerbate their negative emotions and impact their overall mood. In conclusion, while it is difficult to pinpoint precisely how Addison would feel after rapidly becoming full from eating tacos at the park, it is likely that they would experience a mixture of physical sensations and emotions. Factors such as their personal disposition, the circumstances surrounding their meal, and the environment of the park would all play a role in shaping their feelings.

French investigator now suggests the snow plough crossed the runway and then mysteriously reversed back into the jet's path. Francois Hollande leads mourners at funeral service in central Paris.","completion":"Title: The Tragic Loss of Christophe de Margerie: Unraveling the Mystery of a Fateful Crash Introduction The shocking and untimely death of Christophe de Margerie, the charismatic former CEO of Total, the world's fourth-largest oil and gas company, has left a profound impact on the international business community. On October 20, 2014, de Margerie's private Falcon 50 jet collided with a snow plough at Moscow's Vnukovo airport, taking the life of one of the most influential figures in the global energy sector. Five years on, French investigators have unveiled new information about the incident, suggesting the snow plough may have played a decisive role in the fatal crash. The funeral service for de Margerie was a somber and heartrending affair, graced by the presence of French President François Hollande. The Enigmatic Crash Christophe de Margerie's death transpired in a puzzling fashion. The Falcon 50 jet, carrying him and a crew of three, was poised for takeoff when a snow plough crossed the runway and mysteriously reversed its course, placing itself directly in the jet's path. The resulting collision caused the plane to burst into flames, claiming the lives of all aboard. In the immediate aftermath, the focus of investigators was primarily aimed at determining whether the snow plough driver, Vladimir Martynenko, was intoxicated at the time. French Investigator's New Findings However, recent findings by French investigators have shifted the focus of the inquiry. Their latest probe reveals that the snow plough inexplicably crossed the runway before reversing into the jet's path. This new twist raises a plethora of questions, including whether the accident was a mere coincidence or if there had been a catastrophic failure in airport coordination and communication. The crash has triggered a broader discussion on the inherent challenges and risks associated with operating complex machinery in extreme weather conditions. In the case of de Margerie's fatal incident, the visibility at Moscow's Vnukovo airport was down to a mere 350 meters due to thick fog and snowfall. The revelation by French investigators adds to the growing demands for enhanced safety measures and better coordination protocols at airports worldwide. François Hollande at the Funeral Service Following the tragic event, former French President François Hollande led the mourners at the funeral service held in central Paris. The ceremony was attended by numerous dignitaries, politicians, and business leaders who gathered to pay their respects to Christophe de Margerie. Hollande's presence at the service was emblematic of de Margerie's standing in French society, where he was considered a national icon in the business world. Christophe de Margerie's Enduring Legacy Though the final moments of his life were shrouded in mystery and controversy, Christophe de Margerie's professional legacy continues to thrive. He was a leader who was remembered for his vibrant personality, strategic acumen, and unparalleled dedication to his company's success. In his 37-year tenure at Total S.A., de Margerie helped transform the company into a leading global energy player with operations in over 130 countries. His passing left an indelible mark, with people worldwide mourning the loss of a visionary leader and an iconic figure in the energy sector. Conclusion The renewed investigation into Christophe de Margerie's fatal crash has brought the tragic incident into the spotlight once more. While his untimely death remains a mystery, one thing is clear: Christophe de Margerie's legacy will continue to inspire, motivate, and shape the energy industry for years to come. The funeral service was a moving testament to the esteem and love he inspired in countless individuals, and François Hollande's presence was a reflection of his enduring impact on the French business community. As the inquiry continues and new findings shed light on the circumstances leading up to the accident, we can only hope to unravel the enigma behind this fateful crash and pursue greater safety measures to prevent similar incidents in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

President Barack Obama, in a chilling assessment of international efforts to stem a deadly Ebola outbreak, said the world has not done enough to respond to a health crisis that poses a growing threat to regional and global security. 'There is still a significant gap between where we are and where we need to be,' Obama said Thursday in remarks to a high-level United Nations meeting on Ebola. The U.S. president asserted that 'if we move fast, even if imperfectly, then that could mean the difference between 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 deaths versus hundreds of thousands or even a million deaths.' While Obama touted the progress the OPTIONS: - Barack Obama has made on the issue, he warned other nations that there's more to be done. - Ebola has made on the issue, he warned other nations that there's more to be done. - New York has made on the issue, he warned other nations that there's more to be done. - Obama has made on the issue, he warned other nations that there's more to be done. - U.S. has made on the issue, he warned other nations that there's more to be done. - United Nations has made on the issue, he warned other nations that there's more to be done.","completion":"While Obama touted the progress the U.S. has made on the issue, he warned other nations that there's more to be done. He emphasized the importance of international cooperation and collaboration in addressing this global health crisis, underscoring that no single country can tackle the problem alone. The United States had taken significant steps to combat the Ebola outbreak, including deploying military personnel to West Africa to help with logistics, constructing treatment centers, and providing financial support and resources to the affected countries. President Obama urged other nations to increase their efforts and contributions in the fight against Ebola, highlighting the dire consequences of inaction. He noted that Ebola had the potential to devastate not only the healthcare systems of affected countries but also their economies, education systems, and overall stability. In an effort to galvanize the international community, Obama called on leaders and organizations worldwide to step up their commitment to this pressing issue by providing additional healthcare workers, supplies, and financial support to the region. He also underscored the need for better coordination and communication among various nations and agencies working on the ground to ensure that resources are effectively deployed where they are most needed. While the global response to the Ebola outbreak had been sluggish initially, President Obama's call to action helped catalyze an increased commitment from a range of countries and international organizations. In the following weeks and months, countries such as the United Kingdom, China, France, and Germany ramped up their contributions to the response efforts, providing critical resources and expertise. Moreover, global health agencies such as the World Health Organization and non-governmental organizations like Doctors Without Borders bolstered their presence on the ground. These collaborative international efforts ultimately played a crucial role in containing the Ebola outbreak and helped save countless lives. While the crisis exposed the vulnerabilities of the global health infrastructure and the need for improved preparedness for future pandemics, it also demonstrated the power and potential of concerted, global action in the face of a common threat. In conclusion, President Barack Obama's remarks at the United Nations meeting on Ebola served as a wake-up call for the international community, urging countries and organizations to step up their response to the epidemic. His warning that the world had not done enough to tackle the issue pushed countries to collaborate and contribute more, which ultimately played a significant role in successfully containing the outbreak and minimizing its devastating toll."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Does beer make you shlur your wordsh? You're not alone: drunk zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) sing songs that are blurrier and more disordered than those of their sober counterparts. What's more, binge drinking may permanently impair juvenile finches' ability to learn new songs – which could have implications for our understanding of the effect of heavy drinking on adolescents. Having a unique and interesting song is important for zebra finches to mate, and each male develops his own signature tune as he matures, says Christopher Olson of Oregon Health and Science University in Portland. Because zebra finch song is so well studied, Olson and colleagues decided to find out how alcohol would affect it. First, they had to find out whether finches are even interested in alcohol. When they gave a group of adult finches 6 per cent ethanol in their water bottles, the birds drank enough of it that their blood alcohol content sometimes reached 0.8 per cent: the legal limit for drivers in many places. Husky bar voice The birds were also happy to sing while drunk. Using audio analysis software, the researchers determined the degree of \\"white noise\\", or disorganised sounds, in their songs. The drunk birds' songs were significantly more broken and disorganised. \\"It's their husky bar voice,\\" says Olson. Next, the researchers tested how alcohol affects song learning by putting 3 per cent ethanol in the water bottles of birds who were only 40 days old and had just been weaned. They left the spiked water there for 90 days and measured the birds' songs periodically. Almost immediately, significant differences appeared between these birds and controls. Normally, Olson says, young birds \\"babble\\" and experiment with disordered noises before settling on their own song, which is inspired by their fathers and cagemates . But the drinking finches experimented less, and settled on a simple song at day 55. It's surprising how early the researchers could see the effects in the adolescent birds, says Ofer Tchernichovski at the City University of New York. He says it is the first study of the effects of a drug on such a well-understood learned behaviour, and adds that he is curious to know what happens when the alcohol is withdrawn. The researchers hypothesise that alcohol might be suppressing the young birds' creativity by hurting the plasticity, or flexibility of their brains to learn. In general, finches are no longer able to learn new songs as adults, Olson says, so the effects could be long-term. They are now following these birds for longer to determine whether adult birds become dependent on alcohol, and whether the young birds' songs develop any further if alcohol is withdrawn. Olson presented the results at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana, this week. He says the work may also tell us something about how learning behaviour in the adolescent human brain is affected by binge drinking.

Christopher Olson and his colleagues at Oregon Health and Science University recently set out to find if the same was true for birds, specifically zebra finches. \\"We just showed up in the morning and mixed a little bit of juice with 6 percent alcohol, and put it in their water bottles and put it in the cages,\\" Olson told All Things Considered's Arun Rath. \\"At first we were thinking that they wouldn't drink on their own because, you know, a lot of animals just won't touch the stuff. But they seem to tolerate it pretty well and be somewhat willing to consume it.\\" The finches long have been used as a model to study human vocal learning, or how people learn to communicate using language, Olson said. Obviously, alcohol affects human speech, so Olson and his team checked for similar problems with the birds. The blood alcohol levels achieved — .05 to .08 percent — would be laughed off by many college students, but because birds metabolize alcohol differently it was plenty to produce the effects the scientists were looking for. Listen to the audio, and you'll hear that the finches' song gets a bit quieter and just a little slurred, or as Olson puts it, \\"a bit less organized in their sound production\\" — like a roommate calling from a bar to get a ride home. In the future, Olson wants to find out whether alcohol affects not just how birds sing but how they learn new songs — like a roommate partying so late he's still drunk in class the next morning. |||||Summary:","completion":"Scientists found that when zebra finches drink alcohol, their songs become more disorganized and harder to understand. They wanted to see if alcohol would have the same effect on birds as on humans. They gave the birds alcohol mixed with juice, and the birds drank it. Then they analyzed the noises that the birds made. Just like when people drink too much and their speech gets slurred, the birds' songs became messy and hard to understand. The scientists want to learn if alcohol affects not only how the birds sing but also how they learn new songs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here is a news article: While North Korea’s missile test on August 28, reportedly of the intermediate range Hwasong-12 (KN-17), broke up into three pieces during flight only flying 2,700 kilometers—far short of its 4,000 kilometer range—the launch was a disturbing development in Pyongyang’s continuing program to develop long-range missiles. Why Fly Over Japan? The test launch had two primary objectives. First, Kim Jong Un likely sought to take measure of the international community’s response to the overflight of Japanese territory. Though North Korea twice before attempted to launch a satellite using a flight path that passed over Japan, the Hwasong-12 is the first ballistic missile to overfly the island nation. If the US response to the test firing is judged to be mild by Pyongyang, North Korea may feel that future flights will be similarly accepted by Washington and its regional allies. Second, the flight was likely intended to evaluate the missile’s performance and reliability under operational conditions. Before the Hwasong-12 and the intercontinental range Hwasong-14 can be deployed, engineers must demonstrate that they work reliably when flown to maximum range. To date, the two missiles have been launched on steep flight paths that reach high altitudes, ensuring that the mock warheads land in the sea just short of Japan. Much can be learned from the tests, but full-range flights replicating the conditions a combat-capable missile would experience are needed. This flight begins to address that requirement. Is North Korea Testing a Post-Boost Vehicle (PBV)? The most recent Hwasong-12 flight ended with the mock warhead landing in the Pacific Ocean about 2,700 km from the launch site, well short of its maximum range. North Korean engineers may have shut the Hwasong-12’s engine down early, resulting in a shorter flight. Turning off the engine roughly five seconds early would yield a range and apogee matching the reported values. Or the payload mass of the first test may have been considerably lighter than that of North Korea’s nuclear warhead, allowing the missile to achieve a much higher altitude, thus exaggerating the derived maximum range when the missile is flown on a standard flight path. For example, if the May flight carried a payload of 250 kg, and the most recent test fitted the Hwasong-12 with a 1,250-kg package, the range is reduced to about 2,700 km, with a peak altitude of roughly 550 km. Finally, the Hwasong-12 may have been flown on a non-optimal trajectory, one that was steeper or flatter than a normal flight path employed to maximize achievable range. However, the reported apogee of the Hwasong-12 flight is inconsistent with this explanation. An alternative disturbing hypothesis is that tests of the missile have included a small post-boost vehicle (PBV) to provide extra boost to the payload after the main stage is discarded. The May 14 test of the Hwasong-12 was previously modeled, but could not replicate the flight’s reported apogee and range, without the addition of a small PBV. The increased velocity provided by the PBV allows the payload to reach an apogee of 2,000 km and travel about 700 km in range. The hypothesis is consistent with observations made by others, including Norbert Brugge, who identified the existence of fuelling ports located just under the Hwasong-12’s reentry vehicle. There are logical reasons for employing a PBV. In addition to boosting range, it can be used to make fine adjustments to payload’s velocity after engine shut-down. ICBMs fielded by the US, Russia, France and China all employ PBVs to achieve better accuracy. PBVs also provide a platform to carry a warhead, plus lightweight decoys or other penetration aids capable of impairing effectiveness against missile defenses. The presence of a PBV on the Hwasong-12 is just a hypothesis for now, although reports that the missile “broke into three pieces” are consistent with PBV engine failure. As the PBV separates from the main booster, its engine should activate and accelerate the reentry vehicle to the pre-defined velocity. If the PBV’s engine fails to initiate, and the reentry vehicle separates from the PBV, all three components (main booster, PBV and warhead) follow an approximately similar trajectory. To a distant radar, the missile appears to separate into three disparate pieces at the end of boost for no obvious reason. Without the added velocity provided by a properly functioning PBV, the reentry vehicle along with the main stage and PBV, land in the ocean 2,700 km from the launch site—well short of the missile’s maximum range. In other words, the dead weight of the non-functioning PBV, if it was fully fuelled, is equivalent to launching the missile with a 1,200 to 1,300 kg payload, as described above. While it is impossible to know with certainty why the most recent test flew only 2,700 km, if it was the result of a failed PBV, its use on North Korea’s long-range missiles is ominous. It is another sign that Pyongyang is deadly serious about developing and fielding nuclear-tipped missiles capable of striking the US mainland, and critical US military bases in the Pacific Ocean. North Korea has much work remaining—perhaps a year or two—before it matures the technologies and systems needed to credibly threaten the US. ||||| The U.S. has been talking to North Korea, and paying them extortion money, for 25 years. Talking is not the answer! ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated By Courtney Kube and F. Brinley Bruton WASHINGTON — U.S. forces shot down a medium-range ballistic missile off the coast of Hawaii Wednesday as part of a test conducted amid heightened regional tensions. Early Wednesday local time, U.S. Navy sailors on the USS John Paul Jones \\"successfully conducted a complex defense flight test,\\" according to a statement by the Missile Defense Agency, a section of the Defense Department. \\"We are working closely with the fleet to develop this important new capability, and this was a key milestone,\\" the agency's director Lt. Gen. Sam Greaves said in a statement. \\"We will continue developing ballistic missile defense technologies to stay ahead of the threat as it evolves.\\" This is not the first time the U.S. forces have conducted this sort of test. Related: Why It's So Hard for U.S. Spies to Figure Out North Korea Wednesday's move by the U.S. came after a series of North Korean missile tests and threats by Kim Jong Un. On Monday, Pyongyang fired a ballistic missile over Japan. This prompted President Donald Trump to say the U.S. is \\"100 percent with Japan.\\" On Wednesday, Trump tweeted that, \\"The U.S. has been talking to North Korea, and paying them extortion money, for 25 years. Talking is not the answer!\\" Later Wednesday morning, Secretary of Defense James Mattis said, \\"We're never out of diplomatic solutions.\\" Mattis, appearing alongside his South Korean counterpart, Defense Minister Song Young Moo, added, \\"We continue to work together and the minister and I share responsibility to provide for the protection of our nation our populations and our interests, which is what we are here to discuss.\\" In a statement released by the White House on Tuesday, Trump reiterated that \\"all options are on the table\\" when it comes to North Korea. He added: \\"Threatening and destabilizing actions only increase the North Korean regime’s isolation in the region and among all nations of the world.\\" The U.S. and South Korea are currently conducting war games, and North Korea typically reacts with anger to such military drills. North Korea aims to build an arsenal of nuclear missiles that can reliably target the United States. In addition, leader Kim has conducted several long-range ballistic missile tests this year, including firing two intercontinental ballistic missiles. Courtney Kube reported from Washington, F. Brinley Bruton reported from London ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"North Korea reportedly had two objectives with its recent missile test, which flew over Japan. The first was to gauge the international response to such an aggressive action, while the second was to evaluate the missile's performance under operational conditions. Although the missile only flew 2,700 kilometers out of its potential 4,000, experts have put forth hypotheses explaining the shortened flight. One such hypothesis is that a post-boost vehicle (PBV), designed to provide extra payload boost, failed during the test flight, consistent with reports of the missile breaking into three pieces. The use of a PBV would indicate that North Korea is serious about developing nuclear-tipped missiles capable of reaching the US mainland and could be one to two years away from doing so."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Several types of gases form in the atmosphere - May come from different sources - The gases remain trapped in the atmosphere - Through the suns light the gases hold in heat and energy - Trap them in our atmosphere - The earth may become warmer this way. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose fewer gases will be trapped happens, how will it affect a GREATER greenhouse effect. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis presented here suggests that fewer gases would be trapped within the atmosphere, leading to potentially altered effects on the greenhouse effect. To properly address this hypothesis, we must first understand the greenhouse effect and the role of greenhouse gases in this process. The greenhouse effect is a natural process through which certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere, known as greenhouse gases, absorb and trap thermal energy emitted from the Earth's surface. This trapped energy helps keep the planet warm enough to sustain life. The primary greenhouse gases include water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, among others. These gases can come from various sources such as deforestation, burning fossil fuels, and agricultural activities. Now that we have established the importance of greenhouse gases in maintaining the Earth's temperature, let's analyze the perturbation hypothesis - that is, assuming fewer gases will be trapped in the atmosphere, and how this might affect the greenhouse effect. If fewer greenhouse gases were to be trapped in the atmosphere, two possible scenarios could arise: 1. Decreased greenhouse effect: A decrease in the number of greenhouse gases may result in a decrease in the greenhouse effect. In this case, less heat would be trapped in the Earth's atmosphere, which could potentially lead to a decline in global temperatures. This situation could have various consequences on the environment, such as affecting the growth of plants, availability of water resources, changes in weather patterns, and overall impact on the ecosystems. 2. Increased greenhouse effect due to indirect consequences: Though the initial hypothesis suggests less trapping of gases, a decrease in some greenhouse gases in the atmosphere might have indirect effects resulting in an increase in other greenhouse gases. For example, lower global temperatures might lead to increased amounts of ice and snow, which reflect sunlight back into space. With less solar radiation being absorbed by the Earth, lower temperatures could indirectly cause higher concentrations of water vapor, a potent greenhouse gas, in the atmosphere. This increase in water vapor might lead to even more heat being trapped in the atmosphere, amplifying the greenhouse effect. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis supposes that fewer greenhouse gases would be trapped in the atmosphere, but its actual effect on the greenhouse effect remains uncertain. This perturbation could either directly result in a decreased greenhouse effect or indirectly contribute to a greater greenhouse effect through a series of feedback mechanisms. Both scenarios highlight the complexity of Earth's atmosphere and the intricate relationships between various factors that contribute to climate change.

Liverpool players had a double celebration on Sunday night as they threw a surprise party for Glen Johnson's birthday after victory in their Premier League opener against Southampton. Dressed in masks of the full back's face made specially for the occasion, Johnson was greeted by his team-mates Joe Allen, Brad Jones, Lucas Leiva, Philippe Coutinho, Sebastian Coates and Fabio Borini to try and frighten him for his 30th. And, considering his milestone birthday isn't until this coming Saturday, the chances are he won't have seen his colleagues' tribute coming.

Considering the story involves Glen Johnson's surprise birthday, it would make the most sense to end the story with Glen Johnson since the plot revolves around him. None of the non-human entities like Anfield, Premier League or Spanish would be accurate as they cannot play a match. Hence, logically and contextually, taking into account the mentioned information in the plot, the most appropriate choice is; \\"Glen Johnson started the game in his less-favoured left back position, with new signing Javi Manquillo preferred on the right-hand side of defence.\\" This adds an interesting aspect to Glen Johnson's character in the narrative, increasing the complexity of the story by adding a layer of professional challenge on top of his personal celebration. It is also a surprise element, as starting in a less-favored position is unexpected, parallel to the surprise birthday celebration, thus winding up the story neatly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to Finnish","completion":"\\"EIT:n tarjoaman lisäarvon suhteen on ollut skeptisyyttä.\\" EIT (Euroopan innovaatio- ja teknologiainstituutti) on Euroopan unionin aloite, joka pyrkii edistämään innovaatiota ja kilpailukykyä Euroopassa. Se on luotu erilaisten innovaatioyhteisöjen kautta, jotka yhdistävät yliopistot, tutkimusorganisaatiot ja yritykset yhteistyöhön yhteisten tavoitteiden saavuttamiseksi. EIT:n tavoitteena on lisätä Euroopan kilpailukykyä sekä kehittää tieteellisiä ideoita ja löytöjöjä kaupallisiksi sovelluksiksi. Silti osa ihmisistä ja organisaatioista on ilmaissut epäilyksiä ja skeptisyyttä EIT:n toiminnan lisäarvosta. Tämä johtuu monista syistä, kuten EIT:n mielestä olemassa olevista vastaavista organisaatioista ja ohjelmista sekä huolista siitä, että EIT saattaa toimia rajoittavana tekijänä sen sijaan, että se kannustaisi eurooppalaista innovaation ekosysteemiä. Tämän vuoksi on tärkeää analysoida EIT:n toiminta ja tehdä vertailuanalyyseja arvioidaksemme sen tarjoamaa lisäarvoa. Yksi tekijä, joka voi auttaa ymmärtämään EIT:n tarjoamaa lisäarvoa, on sen kyky tuoda eri alojen osaajat ja toimijat yhteen. Toisin kuin monissa muissa organisaatioissa ja ohjelmissa, EIT auttaa yhteistyön luomisessa erilaisten osapuolten välillä, kuten poliittisten päättäjien, akateemisten asiantuntijoiden ja yrityssektorin edustajien kesken. EIT:n merkittävä etu on sen monialainen lähestymistapa innovaation suhteen. Tämä tarkoittaa sitä, että EIT:n innovaatioalueisiin kuuluvat terveys, energia, ilmasto, digitaaliteknologia ja raaka-aineet. Tällainen laaja näkemys ja yhteistyö eri alojen kesken saattaa johtaa aidosti mullistaviin innovaatioihin ja ratkaisuihin, jotka voivat osaltaan auttaa Eurooppaa vastaamaan yhteiskunnallisiin ja taloudellisiin haasteisiin. Lisäksi EIT:n kautta on luotu panostus koulutukseen, jota ei ehkä ole saatavilla samassa laajuudessa muissa organisaatioissa ja ohjelmissa. EIT tarjoaa koulutusohjelmia, jotka yhdistävät tekniset taidot yrittäjyysosaamiseen, auttaen osallistujia ymmärtämään innovaatioketjun eri vaiheita ja kehittämään ratkaisuja, jotka ovat sekä käytännöllisiä että kaupallisesti kannattavia. Kuitenkin on myös syytä tunnistaa ja toimia EIT:n heikkouksien ja skeptisyyden syiden parantamiseksi. Esimerkiksi resurssien tehokasta käyttöä voidaan parantaa, ja EIT:n tavoitteiden ja toiminnan tulisi olla avoimempia ja läpinäkyvämpiä. Näin varmistetaan, että EIT:n toiminta tuottaa konkreettisia tuloksia ja todistettavaa lisäarvoa Euroopalle. Yhteenvetona EIT:n skeptisyyden keskellä on tärkeää tunnistaa sen mahdollinen lisäarvo ja mitä se voi tarjota, samalla kun kohdistetaan huomio sen heikkouksiin ja mahdollisiin parannuksiin. EIT:n rooli eurooppalaisessa innovaatioekosysteemissä voi olla merkittävä, jos se pystyy edistämään tehokasta yhteistyötä ja tuottamaan innovaatioita, jotka vastaavat Euroopan yhteiskunnallisiin ja taloudellisiin tarpeisiin."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Epicurean Delights offers an extensive array of dishes that cater to various dietary preferences and tastes, including gluten-free, vegan, and vegetarian options. Their innovative culinary creations combine classic and contemporary techniques, showcasing an impressive level of expertise and creativity. The food itself was nothing short of outstanding. I decided to start with their signature appetizer, the truffle-infused mushroom tart. The perfectly flaky crust, combined with the rich, earthy flavors of the mushrooms and truffle, truly blew me away. The presentation was also an exquisite treat for the eyes, garnished with edible flowers and a delicate drizzle of truffle oil. For my main course, I opted for the pan-seared sea bass with a delightful citrus beurre blanc sauce, served on a bed of seasonal vegetables and roasted fingerling potatoes. The fish was cooked to perfection, featuring a crispy skin and tender, flaky meat that melted in my mouth. The accompanying sauce brought a vibrant freshness to the dish, beautifully complimenting the well-seasoned vegetables and succulent potatoes. Dessert was another outstanding experience. I indulged in the decadent chocolate soufflé served with a side of raspberry coulis and freshly whipped cream. The soufflé itself had a warm, molten center that oozed out gracefully as I dove in, creating the perfect balance of rich chocolate and tangy raspberry. I would be remiss not to mention the superb wine list available at Epicurean Delights. With an extensive variety of options ranging from local to international wines, the sommelier was extremely knowledgeable and helpful in suggesting the perfect pairing for my meal. The wine truly enhanced the flavors present in each dish, elevating the overall dining experience. The impeccable service only added to the wonderful ambiance at Epicurean Delights. Each member of the waitstaff was attentive, friendly, and professional, making me feel truly pampered throughout my meal. They were able to provide recommendations and answer any questions I had about the menu, further showcasing their dedication and passion for providing a top-notch experience for their guests.

Driven by the urgency of creating jobs & protecting #hcr #wsr , Social Security & Medicare, I am running for Dem Leader. ||||| Nancy Pelosi has announced that she will run for House Democratic Leader. \\"Driven by the urgency of creating jobs & protecting #hcr, #wsr, Social Security & Medicare, I am running for Dem Leader,\\" she tweeted on Friday. On Thursday, Blue Dog Democrat Heath Shuler said he would challenge Pelosi for the post if she ran. Several other Democrats have said they would prefer a leader other than Pelosi, but in an interview with Ryan Grim, Pelosi told The Huffington Post on Thursday that she was canvassing for votes. In a Wednesday interview with ABC, Pelosi told Diane Sawyer that she has \\"no regrets\\" about her time as Speaker of the House, and evaluated her performance as a \\"job well done.\\" Ohio Republican John Boehner, the Speaker-in-waiting, said on Thursday that \\"there seems to be some denial on the part of the president and other Democratic leaders of the message that was sent by the American people,\\" a statement which presumably referred in part to Pelosi. More from the AP: WASHINGTON — Despite widespread complaints about massive losses that will put Democrats in the minority, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday she will try to stay on as leader of her party in the House. The decision exposed a rift between Pelosi's liberal allies and the dwindling number of moderate Democrats, who feel besieged and eager for substantive and symbolic changes in direction after Tuesday's Republican rout. It also is likely to trigger leadership battles farther down the ladder. Pelosi, the nation's first female speaker, said many colleagues urged her to seek the post of minority leader in the new Congress that convenes in January. That will be the Democrats' top post, because Republicans, who grabbed more than 60 Democratic-held seats Tuesday, will elect the next speaker. It will be John Boehner of Ohio, who will swap titles with Pelosi if she succeeds in her bid. \\"We have no intention of allowing our great achievements to be rolled back,\\" Pelosi, 70, said in a letter to her colleagues. Allies said Pelosi would not make the bid unless she felt she had the votes. Some cautioned, however, that House members vote by secret ballot when electing the leaders of their respective parties at the start of each new Congress. Pelosi's caucus is more heavily liberal now that many moderate Democrats lost on Tuesday, but even some Pelosi admirers are distressed by the magnitude of the losses. Several moderates, and even some longtime Pelosi supporters, had openly criticized her in their re-election campaigns, and had urged her to step aside. Pelosi's Friday announcement caught some off guard. Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Ky., had told a Louisville TV station on Thursday, \\"as good a leader as she has been, I don't think she's the right leader to take us forward.\\" He reversed field Friday after she announced her intentions, and after a senior Pelosi ally, Rep. George Miller of California, called him. Pelosi \\"has proven time and time again that she is able to build consensus in a caucus comprised of members from all across the ideological spectrum,\\" Yarmuth said. Other House Democrats held their ground. Rep. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., said he was \\"disappointed that Speaker Pelosi is going to seek the position of Minority Leader.\\" North Carolina Rep. Larry Kissell's office said he hopes Pelosi \\"will change her mind and step aside.\\" Reps. Dan Boren of Oklahoma and Mike Ross of Arkansas also said they opposed Pelosi. They were among the many House Democrats whom Republicans criticized for their loyalty to the California liberal, who was a forceful though generally well-liked speaker. During her four years as Speaker, Pelosi used all her political muscle to enact contentious measures such as President Barack Obama's health care overhaul. Republicans were giddy in learning the news. Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele, in a meeting with reporters, put his hands over his head and applauded. \\"My breath is taken away by that announcement,\\" he said, grinning. In a statement, White House spokesman Bill Burton said the president appreciates the work of Pelosi and the Democratic leadership team \\"who have been great partners in moving the country forward\\" and he looks forward to working with them. Pelosi's announcement set off a likely battle for the No. 2 Democratic leadership job, now held by Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland. The party's third-ranking leader, House Whip Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, said he will try to keep the job, which will become the second in command when Democrats become the minority. If Clyburn – the House's highest-ranking African-American – prevails, Hoyer would be forced out of the leadership ranks for the first time in many years. Hoyer said he would make a decision after consulting with lawmakers, adding, \\"I have received an outpouring of support from Democratic colleagues who have told me that I should remain in our party's leadership.\\" Hoyer is more centrist than Pelosi, and the two have long had a cordial but somewhat wary relationship. Pelosi's bid presumably will keep her atop the Democratic caucus, which will number about 190 members next year. But it would mark a big drop from being speaker, which carries tremendous power to influence legislation and is second only to the vice president in the line of presidential succession. Among those defending her was Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill. \\"We're in a political storm,\\" he said, \\"but we don't need to adopt an 'any leader in a storm' mentality.\\" Several Democratic lawmakers in conservative districts had vowed to oppose Pelosi as speaker, but some of them lost their re-election bids all the same. One survivor, Rep. Heath Shuler of North Carolina, had said he might challenge Pelosi because the party needs a more moderate leader. Shuler noted that he lost his job as Washington Redskins quarterback in 1997 after the team performed poorly. As the magnitude of Tuesday's election losses sunk in, even some longtime supporters of Pelosi said she needed to step aside as the party leader. \\"I voted for everything she asked me to vote for,\\" said Rep. Albio Sires, D-N.J. \\"You know, sometimes in this business it's difficult to know when to move on.\\" \\"With all the losses that we had with governors and all the redistricting that's going to be done, we don't need the target,\\" Sires said, referring to the once-a-decade House redistricting process about to begin nationwide. If Pelosi remains as the Democrats' House leader, it's possible the party will absorb historic election losses without making significant leadership changes. In the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., will keep his post. Pelosi's decision also may enable Republicans to keep demonizing her as an emblem of Democratic liberalism, as they did in so many campaigns this fall. ___ Associated Press writers Philip Elliott, Andrew Taylor, David Espo, Ben Evans, Henry C. Jackson, Julie Pace and Stephen Ohlemacher contributed to this report. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Nancy Pelosi has announced her intention to run for House Democratic Leader, despite facing criticism from some moderate Democrats who would prefer a different leader.

It is part of breeding programme and will soon be released into the wild. Predator is learning hunting skills at Mukuni Big 5 Safari in Livingstone, Zambia. Article:","completion":"Title: Big Cat Trains Hunting Skills at Mukuni Big 5 Safari, Prepping for Release Into the Wild An incredible display of nature and technology recently took place at Mukuni Big 5 Safari in Livingstone, Zambia, where a big cat was seen chasing a fake chicken along a zip-wire. This encounter was far from accidental – it is an innovative part of a breeding and rehabilitation programme focused on preparing the predator for eventual release into the wild. The Mukuni Big 5 Safari is a renowned wildlife reserve and conservation facility located in Zambia, where they work tirelessly to ensure the survival and preservation of endangered species. The zip-wire technology allows the big cats, including lions, leopards, and cheetahs, to fine-tune their natural hunting instincts in a controlled and safe environment. The use of a fake chicken as bait may seem unorthodox, but it provides the perfect opportunity for the big cat to practice its hunting skills without endangering any real prey. The intriguing chase is all part of the predator's training regime, aimed at mentally and physically preparing them for life in the wild. Once the predator has successfully chased and \\"captured\\" that fake chicken on multiple occasions, the staff at Mukuni Big 5 Safari deem it sufficiently prepared to face the challenges of the wild. This outcome can be credited to the dedication and efforts of the staff, who work diligently to provide education, guidance, and hands-on training tailored to each animal's specific needs. The programme at Mukuni Big 5 Safari intends to combat the rapidly decreasing numbers of big cats found in the wild due to habitat loss, poaching, and other man-made threats. By reintroducing these animals into their natural habitats, it not only gives them a chance to thrive but also contributes to the continued existence and genetic diversity of their species. The successful implementation of this method has garnered attention and recognition from wildlife conservationists and researchers worldwide. Such pioneering techniques have the potential to be integrated into other breeding and rehabilitation programmes, allowing conservation facilities to save and restore more animal populations that face similar threats. As part of their innovative programme, Mukuni Big 5 Safari is an active contributor to local and international conservation and research initiatives. Their preservation efforts not only focus on raising awareness but also on inspiring the support of local communities, businesses, and tourists. By doing so, they involve all relevant stakeholders in their mission to prevent species extinction and secure a brighter future for some of Earth's most majestic creatures. In summary, the remarkable scene of a big cat chasing a fake chicken along a zip-wire at Mukuni Big 5 Safari underpins a critical initiative that harbors the power to change the fate of these magnificent animals. Combining ingenuity, technology, and a thorough understanding of animal behavior, the staff at Mukuni perseveres in their mission to restore the delicate balance of nature and ensure that big cats can survive and flourish in the wild for generations to come."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: An earthquake strikes Mexico, resulting in the overnight birth of a new volcano. Sent to study this phenomenon are geologists Dr. Hank Scott and Dr. Arturo Ramos. En route to the village of San Lorenzo, the two men witness a destroyed house and police car. They find a dead policeman nearby, as well as an abandoned infant. They take the infant to San Lorenzo and give it to friends of the child's now missing parents; they are welcomed by the village's priest, Father Delgado. In addition to the disappearances of locals and the destruction of their homes, there have been wholesale slaughters of livestock and strange roaring noises in the night. The villagers believe the culprit to be a demon bull and have been pestering Delgado for divine assistance. Undaunted, Hank and Arturo begin their geological survey as members of the Mexican army, led by Major Cosio, arrive in San Lorenzo to begin disaster relief efforts. Hank meets and falls in love with local rancher Teresa Alvarez and makes friends with a young boy named Juanito. The volcano erupts again and the true culprits behind the disappearances and deaths are revealed as giant prehistoric scorpions. After killing a staff of telephone repairmen, the scorpions turn their attention to San Lorenzo itself, with the guns of Major Cosio's troops having no effect on them. The next morning, the scorpions have returned to their underground lair (which, in addition to the scorpions, is home to giant worms and spiders), leaving the authorities to seek the help of renowned entomologist Dr. Velasco. It is up to him, Hank, and Arturo to figure out a way to either destroy the scorpions or seal off the entrance to their cavern home, before more innocent lives are lost. Despite collapsing the cave entrance, the giant scorpions make it to the surface and destroy a train, killing some passengers before fighting amongst themselves. In the end, one scorpion, the largest of the group and presumably the alpha scorpion, kills all of the smaller ones, making it the last scorpion alive,...

Process: - Food leaves the esophagus and enters the stomach - The stomach churns the food - With the aid of stomach acids - The food becomes a thick liquid - Is then passed to the small intestine. Question: suppose the government is disinterested happens, how will it affect in the thick liquid produced. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","completion":"C: No effect The process of digesting food is a biological function that primarily takes place within the human body's gastrointestinal (GI) tract. It does not correlate with any governmental processes or decisions. A disinterested government will not have a direct impact on the production of the thick liquid in the stomach, known as chyme. The digestion process begins when food enters the mouth, where it is broken down by chewing and mixed with saliva. As the food progresses down the esophagus through a series of muscular contractions called peristalsis, it reaches the stomach, where the bulk of the digestion occurs. The stomach's muscular walls churn the food, and stomach acids chemically break it down. This process transforms the food into a thick liquid consistency, called chyme. Chyme then moves into the small intestine, where it is mixed with bile from the liver and digestive enzymes from the pancreas. The small intestine is where nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream, and the remaining undigested materials continue into the large intestine for further processing and eventual elimination. In the context of a disinterested government, there will be no direct impact on an individual's digestive process. However, indirect consequences could arise from the government's lack of interest in certain areas. For example, a disinterested government may not prioritize food safety regulations, leading to an increased risk of consuming contaminated or unhealthy foods. Poor food regulation could result in an overall decline in health among citizens, including digestive issues, but this would not directly affect the production of chyme during the digestion process. Additionally, a disinterested government could disregard public healthcare policies, limiting people's access to medical care, nutritional advice, and the importance of healthy lifestyles, which could subsequently influence their overall health and well-being. Ultimately, these indirect consequences may contribute to a range of health issues, including those that affect the digestive system. However, the direct and immediate impact of a disinterested government on the production of chyme in an individual's stomach will be nonexistent. The process of chyme production occurs within the body and is not influenced by external factors such as government decisions and policies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For every household that used both brands of soap, 3 households used only brand B soap. Let's use these guidelines to solve the task. Step 1: Find the total number of households that used only brand B or both brands of soap. We know that 80 households used neither brand, and 60 used only brand A. So, the remaining households either used only brand B or both: 260 (total households) - 80 (neither A nor B) - 60 (only A) = 120. Step 2: Set up equations to find households that used both brands. Let x be the number of households that used both brands of soap and y be the number of households that used only brand B soap. We have: x + y = 120 (from step 1, households using only B or both) Also, we know that for every household that used both brands, 3 households used only brand B soap. So, y = 3x. Step 3: Solve the equations. Substitute y = 3x into the first equation (x + y = 120): x + 3x = 120 4x = 120 x = 30 So, 30 households used both brands of soap.

In a brief voiceover, Colin tells us that running is the way his family has always coped with the world's troubles, but that in the end, the runner is always alone and cut off from spectators, left to deal with life on his own.Next, we see Colin in handcuffs with a group of other similarly encumbered young men. They are being taken to Ruxton Towers, what we would today term a medium security prison for young juvenile offenders. It is overseen by \\"The Governor\\" (Michael Redgrave), who believes that the hard work and discipline imposed on his charges will ultimately make them useful members of society. Colin, sullen and rebellious, immediately catches his eye as a test of his beliefs.An important part of The Governor's rehabilitation program is athletics, and he soon notices that Colin is a talented runner, able to easily outrun Ruxton's reigning long distance runner. As The Governor was once a runner himself, he is especially keen on Colin's abilities because for the first time, his charges have been invited to compete in a five-mile marathon against a nearby public school, Ranley, and its privileged students from upper class families. The Governor sees the invitation as an important way to demonstrate the success of his rehabilitation program.As the Governor takes Colin under his wing, offering him outdoor gardening work and eventually the freedom of practice runs outside Ruxton's barbed wire fences, we learn in a series of flashbacks how Colin came to be incarcerated.

Select from: [-] No; [-] Yes;","completion":"[+] Yes; Your description accurately captures the essence of the minimalism trend. Minimalism, as a movement, is indeed about reducing the subject to its essential elements by eliminating non-essential forms, features, or concepts. It's a trend that can be observed not only in art and music, but also in design, architecture, and even lifestyle. It aims for simplicity and clarity, and favors functionality. Minimalist art, for instance, tends to use a limited number of colors and shapes, and avoids decoration or embellishment. In lifestyle, minimalism promotes living with less and prioritizing the truly important aspects of life. As such, your definition effectively captures the core principles of this trend."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We need to find the value of \\"l\\" in this equation: 50708 = -679*l - 11760 First, let's make the -11760 move to the other side of the equal sign by adding 11760 to both sides: 50708 + 11760 = -679*l Now, we add those two numbers on the left side: 62468 = -679*l Now, we want to find out what \\"l\\" is.

(C). are more used to sunny days. (D). have lower levels of happiness. Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Rainy days don't have to get you down, a happiness expert has claimed. Paul Dolan, Professor of Behavioral Science at the London School of Economics, said that people only feel _ in bad weather because they think about it too much. Studies have shown that people who live in warm, sunny climates are no happier than those in chilly, wet climates, he says. So the British talking about the weather may be making us gloomier than the weather itself. He said: \\"A study was done that measured the happiness levels of people in California compared to the North West. \\"They expected that people in California would be happier because it is more sunny, but they found that levels of happiness were exactly the same. \\"If it is sunny every day you get used to it and the sunshine doesn't make you any happier. \\"Most of the time the weather doesn't affect our well-being at all. But when we think about it, and think that it does, that's when we get miserable.\\" In his new book, Happiness By Design, Dolan argues that we can think ourselves happy by taking our attention away from what makes us sad. \\"Most of our anxieties come from what might be,\\" he argues. \\"If you want to be happier, pay attention to the things that make you feel good.\\" He also claimed that a problem shared was not always a problem halved. He claimed that humans are actually very good at being able to get over tragedy and loss. Professor Dolan also admitted for the first time that he had a stammer , which had made his early life miserable. He claimed it only got better when he learned not to pay attention to his speech problem. \\"Things are never as bad as you imagine them being,\\" he said. Question: People in California _ compared to people in the North West. Answer: A:","completion":"People in California are more used to sunny days (C) compared to people in the North West. According to the study mentioned in the article, happiness levels of people in California and the North West were found to be exactly the same. The consistent sunshine in California doesn't make its residents any happier in comparison to those living in the chillier, wetter climates of the North West. This implies that people get used to the weather conditions they live in, and thus, the sunny days in California become a normal part of life for its residents. The weather itself does not have a significant impact on one's well-being, and focusing too much on it can lead to feelings of misery. To increase their happiness, individuals should pay attention to the things that make them feel good instead of dwelling on factors that are believed to cause unhappiness."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: The previous 100 (Â£82) limit has been lifted, meaning most visitors could bring home up to 100 cigars and several bottles of rum. The latest measures reflect continuing moves by the former Cold War rivals to normalise relations after 53 years. President Barack Obama paid a historic visit to Cuba in March. What next for US-Cuba relations? Passengers on an 'emotional' crossing The latest raft of measures are in an administrative order by the president, meaning he can sidestep the Republican-controlled Congress. Analysts say he wants to cement the new trade relations before he leaves office in January. Other measures in the latest batch include: But the cigar and rum measures will be the most beneficial for Cuba. Given the high value of some cigars in particular, the Cuban government could benefit to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Analysis: Will Grant, BBC Cuba correspondent The most important announcement is probably the move to lift a restriction on cargo ship travel between the old enemies that had prevented them from docking in US ports for at least 180 days after visiting Cuba. But undoubtedly the most eye-catching was the decision to lift the 100 limit on rum and cigars. The fact that the record numbers of US visitors to Cuba can now buy much more is welcome news for the Castro government. That said, it will still reiterate its calls for the US economic embargo to be lifted entirely. The Cuban delegation plans to put a resolution in front of the UN General Assembly by the end of the month, which is likely to be resoundingly supported. President Obama cannot lift the embargo without the US Congress, but he can weaken it significantly. He has done that on several occasions over the past two years. Mr Obama said in a statement: \\"Challenges remain - and very real differences between our governments persist on issues of democracy and human rights - but I believe that engagement is the best way to address those differences and make progress on behalf of our interests and values.\\" More than 160,000 Americans went to Cuba in 2015 and the figure could double this year. In July, Cuba and the United States formally re-established relations. Summary:","completion":"US President Barack Obama has removed trade restrictions on Cuban cigars and rum. The move lifts the previous 100 limit on Cuban goods brought back to the US, allowing travellers to bring back numerous bottles of rum and up to 100 cigars. The change is part of a number of measures designed to normalise relations between the former enemies and is expected to see the Cuban government benefit by hundreds of millions of dollars annually."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Legal assistance for battered women is hard to come by. But it just got a little easier to find in Tarrant County. This month, the federal Violence Against Women Office awarded a two-year, 350,000 grant to the Women's Haven of Tarrant County. The money will allow the shelter to add a second full-time attorney to its staff and contract with the law school clinic at Texas Wesleyan University for pro bono and student services. Most important, the funds will help fill a frustrating gap. The Women's Haven, which provides shelter and outreach to domestic-violence victims, already has a full-time attorney. But that person is prohibited (by funding parameters) from representing women in matters of divorce or child custody. That's not a problem for most of the shelter's indigent residents, who can access free legal aid locally from West Texas Legal Services. But many of the clients served by the Women's Haven outreach programs are the working poor, who don't qualify for free legal services. Divorces and custody battles are simply out of their financial reach. \\"They can't begin to save up enough money for a divorce, so they're stuck,\\" says Sonyia Hartwell, the Women's Haven's associate director. \\"They're completely shut out of the civil-law system.\\" In Texas, unlike in some other states, women who aren't divorced can't gain full control over their portion of assets. And they can't obtain child support. The grant will also provide law students with valuable experience working these types of cases. \\"They can't go to court, but they can interview clients and do all the initial intake work that needs to be done\\" as well as investigative work, says Hartwell. And there's no shortage of abuse victims who need this kind of help. \\"Within 60 days of hanging out her or his shingle,\\" says Hartwell of the yet unhired new attorney, \\"we'll have an active caseload of 20 or more.\\" According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What will the Women's Haven be able to add with its grant money?\\" is \\"Add a second full-time attorney to its staff and contract with the law school clinic at Texas Wesleyan University for pro bono and student services\\"?","completion":"Yes, that is correct. With the 350,000 grant from the federal Violence Against Women Office, the Women's Haven of Tarrant County will be able to add a second full-time attorney to its staff and contract with the law school clinic at Texas Wesleyan University for pro bono and student services. This funding will help bridge the gap for domestic-violence victims who are in need of legal assistance but do not qualify for free legal aid due to their financial status. By providing additional legal resources, the Women's Haven aims to support working-poor clients who struggle to afford legal representation in divorce and child custody cases, enabling them to escape potentially abusive situations and access the civil law system. Additionally, the partnership with Texas Wesleyan University's law school clinic will offer valuable experience for law students, who can assist with interviewing clients, handling initial intake work, and conducting investigations as part of their training."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Jennifer is looking to move to a new city. She has always wanted to live in a coastal town, and she has narrowed her options down to two. She is looking to live in either Malarn or Trainlan. Malarn is known for its peppersteaks and its active nightlife. Malarn also regularly gets a large amount of dust in the air from a desert located across the ocean. Trainlan has a very famous art museum in its city, and being an art fanatic, that greatly appeals to Jennifer. She is planning to take a trip to both cities sometime in the near future to see them in person before making her decision. But I can use this background: During mid-summer (July in the northern hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.There are local names for winds associated with sand and dust storms. The Calima carries dust on southeast winds into the Canary islands. The Harmattan carries dust during the winter into the Gulf of Guinea. The Sirocco brings dust from north Africa into southern Europe because of the movement of extratropical cyclones through the Mediterranean. Spring storm systems moving across the eastern Mediterranean Sea cause dust to carry across Egypt and the Arabian peninsula, which are locally known as Khamsin. The Shamal is caused by cold fronts lifting dust into the atmosphere for days at a time across the Persian Gulf states. What is an answer for this question: Which city is worse for Jennifer's health? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Malarn is likely worse for Jennifer's health due to the regular presence of a large amount of dust in the air from the desert located across the ocean. This dust negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. In comparison, Trainlan does not have any mentioned issues with air quality or factors that would negatively affect Jennifer's health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Set in New France in 1634 (in the period of conflicts known as the Beaver Wars), the film begins in the settlement that will one day become Quebec City. Jesuit missionaries are trying to encourage the local Algonquin Indians to embrace Christianity, with thus far only limited results. Samuel de Champlain, founder of the settlement, sends Father LaForgue, a young Jesuit priest, to find a distant Catholic mission in a Huron village. With winter approaching, the journey will be difficult and cover as much as 1500 miles. LaForgue is accompanied on his journey by a non-Jesuit assistant, Daniel, and a group of Algonquin Indians whom Champlain has charged with guiding him to the Huron village. This group includes Chomina – an older, experienced traveller who has clairvoyant dreams; his wife; and Annuka, their daughter. As they journey across the lakes and forests, Daniel and Annuka fall in love, to the discomfort of the celibate LaForgue. The group meet with a band of Montagnais, First Nations people who have never met Frenchmen before. The Montagnais shaman, the \\"mestigoit\\", is suspicious (and implicitly jealous) of LaForgue's influence over the Algonquins. He accuses him of being a devil. He encourages Chomina and the other Algonquins to abandon the two Frenchmen and travel instead to a winter hunting lodge. This they do, paddling away from the Frenchmen. LaForgue accepts his fate, but Daniel is determined to stay with Annuka and follows the Indians as they march across the forest. When one Indian tries to shoot Daniel, Chomina is consumed by guilt at having betrayed Champlain's trust. He and a few other members of the Algonquin tribe return with Daniel to try to find LaForgue.

John has usurped the true ruler, King Richard, whom Sir Hiss hypnotized into going off on a Crusade. Robin and Little John disguise themselves as fortune tellers, and make off with a number of items from John's royal carriage.Eventually, Prince John and Sir Hiss make it to Nottingham, wherein taxes are collected by the 'honorable' Sheriff of Nottingham (a wolf). After collecting funds from the local blacksmith (a dog), the Sheriff pays a visit to a windowed bunny and her family. Her eldest son Skippy has turned 7, and his present of a farthing is snatched away by the Sheriff for tax-reasons. As the Sheriff leaves, an old blind fox enters, and reveals to the family that he's Robin Hood.

Write a summary based on this article: The Navy SEAL killed during combat in Somalia on Friday was Kyle Milliken, 38, a Falmouth native, the Department of Defense announced Saturday. Milliken, a senior chief special warfare officer, was killed during an operation against the terrorist group al-Shabab in Barii, about 40 miles west of Mogadishu, the Somali capital. Two other service members were wounded, the Pentagon said Friday. A Press Herald file photo shows Kyle Milliken (seated, front) with the state-record-setting Cheverus High School relay team in April 1998. Also pictured, standing from left, are Ryan Toothaker, Nick Nappi, and Ryan Demers. Staff photo by Doug Jones Related Headlines Navy SEALs one of U.S. military’s most elite forces ‘Advise and assist’ mission took Falmouth SEAL into harm’s way In a statement released through the Department of Defense, the Milliken family thanked the community for its interest but asked for privacy. “He was a devoted father and son, a true professional and a wonderful husband,” the family said. Milliken grew up in Falmouth and graduated in 1998 from Cheverus High School, where he was one of the school’s top track stars. He and three teammates set the record for the 1,600-meter relay for Class A schools in 1998, according to the Maine Principals’ Association. “His former teachers, administrators, coaches and friends pray that eternal rest be granted to him, perpetual light shine upon him and that he rest in peace,” said the Rev. George E. Collins, president of Cheverus. U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, who represents Maine’s 1st District, which includes Falmouth, said in a statement that Milliken was “an amazing athlete who could do flips on skis and run for miles.” SPECIALIZED IN FREE-FALL PARACHUTING Milliken enlisted in the Navy in 2002 and quickly joined the special operations forces. He underwent special warfare training in Coronado, California, and specialized in free-fall parachuting. He was based out of Virginia Beach, Virginia, starting in 2004. Milliken served combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and earned four Bronze Stars, among at least 30 medals and commendations. “We were a nation at war when he enlisted,” said Capt. Jason Salata, spokesman for the Naval Special Warfare Command. “He has four Bronze Stars. You don’t get that from sitting at home. You’re getting those kind of awards for valor.” According to Pingree, Milliken operated for many years with SEAL Team 6, an elite counterterrorism unit. “May we never forget his extraordinary bravery and incredible sacrifice,” Pingree said. Another member of Congress, Rep. Scott Taylor of Virginia, a former Navy SEAL whose district includes Virginia Beach, described Milliken as a “great friend, family man, and teammate” in a Facebook post Saturday afternoon. The fallen SEAL was “brilliant, witty and fiercely loyal,” Taylor wrote. In a written statement late Saturday night, Gov. Paul LePage expressed condolences from himself and his wife, Ann, to Milliken’s family. “On behalf of all Mainers, to the family and loved ones of Senior Chief Special Warfare Operator Kyle Milliken, there are no words that may provide comfort during this difficult time, but know he is a man we are forever indebted (to) for his service, sacrifice and protection of the freedoms we hold dear,” LePage said. In a joint statement, U.S. Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King of Maine said they were deeply saddened to learn about Milliken’s death. “He defended our nation with bravery and with distinction, and his sacrifice will never be forgotten,” the senators said. Milliken was assigned to an East Coast-based special warfare unit that was supporting Somali National Army-led operations. He was the first U.S. service member to die in Somalia since 1993, when 18 U.S. servicemen were killed after two helicopters were shot down over Mogadishu. Among them were two Mainers: Army Master Sgt. Gary Gordon of Lincoln and Army Staff Sgt. Thomas Field of Lisbon. The incident was recounted in the book and film “Black Hawk Down.” “Senior Chief Kyle Milliken embodied the warrior spirit and toughness infused in our very best Navy SEALs,” said Rear Adm. Timothy Szymanski, commander of the Naval Special Warfare Command. “We grieve his death, but we celebrate his life and many accomplishments. He is irreplaceable as a husband, father, son, friend and teammate – and our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and teammates,” Szymanski said. “His sacrifice is a stark reminder that Naval Special Operators are forward doing their jobs, confronting terrorism overseas to prevent evil from reaching our shores.” MILITARY TARGETS AL-SHABAB COMPOUND Milliken was killed during a raid Friday on an al-Shabab compound. A firefight broke out after U.S. aircraft delivered Somali troops to the target area and U.S. troops were a distance back from the buildings, The Associated Press reported. The compound was targeted because it had been associated with attacks against U.S. and Somali forces. Al-Shabab militants have been fighting the Somali government and foreign forces for almost a decade and are responsible for numerous terrorist attacks, including assaults against civilian targets in Kenya. A Somali intelligence official told the AP that U.S. forces killed at least six people in the raid that targeted a building housing al-Shabab’s radio station and the dead included al-Shabab journalists. The battle comes as the U.S. is intensifying military operations in Somalia. In late March, President Trump authorized expanded offensive airstrikes against al-Shabab and the deployment of dozens of regular troops to the country, the largest deployment in decades. The Pentagon had increased special forces activity and airstrikes in Somalia under President Barack Obama. Somalia has been plagued by civil war since the government was overthrown in the early 1990s. The current national government is supported by the U.S. and an African Union peacekeeping force that is scheduled to leave the country in 2018. Staff Writer Megan Doyle contributed to this report.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated By Phil McCausland The Navy SEAL killed in Somalia during an operation against terrorist group al-Shabab was identified Saturday as a decorated 15-year veteran. Kyle Milliken, a 38-year-old senior chief special warfare operator from Falmouth, Maine, was killed Thursday in a far-flung area of Somalia — about 40 miles west of the capital of Mogadishu — after he and his team came under fire from al-Shabab fighters. The attackers were \\"neutralized,\\" but Milliken was killed and two others were injured. Kyle Milliken, 38, of Falmouth, Maine. Navy SEAL Rear Adm. Timothy Syzmanksi, the commander of the Naval Special Warfare Command, said Milliken \\"embodied the warrior spirit and toughness\\" that represent the Navy SEALS. Milliken was also a member of SEAL Team Six, the elite unit credited with killing Osama bin Laden in 2011, and he earned four Bronze Stars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \\"We grieve his death, but we celebrate his life and many accomplishments,\\" Syzmanksi said in a statement. \\"He is irreplaceable as a husband, father, son, friend and teammate — and our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and teammates.” Milliken is the first U.S. service member to be killed in action in Somalia since the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu that led to the death of 18 service members and wounded 73 others — an event that inspired the book and later Hollywood film, \\"Black Hawk Down.\\" Related: Trump’s Army Secretary Pick Mark Green Withdraws Name From Consideration Milliken was part of the operation that had been coordinated between the Somali National Army and U.S. Africa Command. He first joined the Navy in 2002 and was assigned to an East Coast-based special warfare unit as a SEAL. Milliken and two others were injured in Thursday's attack and were medevaced to neighboring Djibouti, but Milliken died of his wounds. While the U.S. military is still analyzing intelligence to find out if the targets of the mission were among the dead, the Somali government declared it a victory. Omar Mohamud Elmi, the deputy governor of the Lower Shabelle region in Somalia, said the aim of the operation was to \\"surgically target\\" two elements: senior members of al-Shabab hiding in the area and a pro-al-Shabab media station. \\"The joint operation, the special operation, has successfully carried out a surgical strike on these two main elements killing many of the terrorists,\\" Elmi said. There are currently 50 American special forces members working in Somalia as part of the African Union mission. They are collaborating with local national commandos to “train and advise,” which is part of a ramped up effort to fight al-Shabab, an al Qaeda-allied group that has imposed Sharia law in areas of the country under its control. President Donald Trump approved the use of aggressive airstrikes and military operations to fight the group last month. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Kyle Milliken, a 38-year-old Navy SEAL from Maine, was killed during an operation against terrorist group al-Shabab in Somalia.

In fact, they found that electrons only have a certain chance of being in any particular place. They could only describe where electrons are with mathematical formulas. That’s because electrons have wave-like properties as well as properties of particles of matter. It is the \\"wave nature\\" of electrons that lets them exist only at certain distances from the nucleus. The negative electrons are attracted to the positive nucleus. However, because the electrons behave like waves, they bend around the nucleus instead of falling toward it. Electrons exist only where the wave is stable. These are the orbitals.

The famous and powerful wizard Merlin (James A. Stephens) had three apprentices to whom he entrusted all of his knowledge of magic and cast spells over them to ensure they didn't age. However, one of his apprentices, Maxim Horvath (Alfred Molina), betrayed Merlin for his greatest enemy, the sorceress Morgana (Alice Krige). The other two apprentices, Balthazar Blake (Nicolas Cage) and Veronica (Monica Bellucci) arrive at Merlin's stronghold in time to learn of the deception and discover that Morgana was attempting to steal a spell from Merlin's spell book that would allow her to awaken dead wizards and sorcerers and rule the world, The Rising.Morgana overpowers Merlin with Horvath's help and fatally wounds him before retrieving the evil spell. Balthazar and Veronica duel with Morgana while Horvath escapes. As a last resort, Veronica uses a spell to absorb Morgana's soul into her own body to stop her but Morgana begins to kill Veronica from the inside. To ensure Veronica's survival Balthazar traps her, with Morgana, in the Grimhold, a large nesting doll. Both facades of Veronica and Morgana are displayed on the outer shell. Before he dies, Merlin tells Balthazar that he must find the child that will be born endowed with all of his powers, the Prime Merlinian, and gives him a small, metal dragon; a symbol of his magic. The Prime Merlinian will be the only one to stop Morgana. Balthazar searches the globe for the Merlinian, with no success. Over time, he battles evil sorcerers and adds them, in layers, to the Grimhold until, finally, he captures Horvath and seals him in the outermost layer.Centuries pass to the year 2000.

Rolfe first examined the bedroom that he had seen Inspector Chippenfield enter. It was a small room, containing a double bed. It was prettily furnished in white, with white curtains, and toilet-table articles in ivory to match. A glance round the room convinced Rolfe that it was impossible for a man to secrete himself in it. The door of the wardrobe had been flung open by the inspector, and the dresses and other articles of feminine apparel it contained flung out on the floor. There was no other hiding-place possible, except beneath the bed, and the ruthless hand of the inspector had torn off the white muslin bed hangings, revealing emptiness underneath. Rolfe went out into the hall again, and entered the room next the bedroom. This apartment was apparently used as a dining-room, for it contained a large table, a few chairs, a small sideboard, a spirit-stand, a case of books and ornaments, and two small oak presses. Plainly, there was no place in it where a man could hide himself. The next room was the bathroom, which was also empty.

First question: \\"Is Spotify the next Napster?\\" Spotify is a popular music streaming service where we can listen to a lot of songs by paying a monthly fee or using it for free with ads. Napster was an early way to share songs on the internet, but it got into trouble because it didn't have permission from the people who made the music. Even though both are about listening to music, they are not the same thing. Spotify follows rules and shares money with musicians, while Napster caused problems for musicians and was shut down. Second question: \\"What is the history of Napster?\\" Napster was a program for sharing music files, mainly MP3s, on the internet. It started in 1999, when two college students created it to make it easy for people to search and download songs. However, many artists and music companies got upset because they did not get paid for their music, and Napster was breaking rules about copyrights. They took Napster to court, and eventually, Napster was shut down in 2001. Nowadays, there are different ways to listen to music legally, like Spotify."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Theodore Roosevelt Jr. ( ROH-z@-velt; October 27, 1858 - January 6, 1919) was an American statesman and writer who served as the 26th President of the United States from 1901 to 1909. He also served as the 25th Vice President of the United States from March to September 1901 and as the 33rd Governor of New York from 1899 to 1900. As a leader of the Republican Party during this time, he became a driving force for the Progressive Era in the United States in the early 20th century. His face is depicted on Mount Rushmore, alongside those of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln. In the 1896 presidential election, Roosevelt backed Speaker of the House Thomas Brackett Reed for the Republican nomination, but William McKinley won the nomination and defeated William Jennings Bryan in the general election. Roosevelt opposed Bryan's free silver platform, viewing many of Bryan's followers as dangerous fanatics, and Roosevelt gave campaign speeches for McKinley. Urged by Congressman Henry Cabot Lodge, President McKinley appointed Roosevelt as the Assistant Secretary of the Navy in 1897. Secretary of the Navy John D. Long was more concerned about formalities than functions, was in poor health, and left many major decisions to Roosevelt. Influenced by Alfred Thayer Mahan, Roosevelt called for a build-up in the country's naval strength, particularly the construction of battleships. Roosevelt also began pressing his national security views regarding the Pacific and the Caribbean on McKinley, and was particularly adamant that Spain be ejected from Cuba. He explained his priorities to one of the Navy's planners in late 1897: I would regard war with Spain from two viewpoints: first, the advisability on the grounds both of humanity and self-interest of interfering on behalf of the Cubans, and of taking one more step toward the complete freeing of America from European dominion; second, the benefit done our people by giving them something to think of which is not material gain, and especially the benefit done our military forces by trying both the Navy and Army in actual practice. On February 15, 1898, the Maine exploded in the harbor of Havana, Cuba, killing hundreds of crew members. While Roosevelt and many other Americans blamed Spain for the explosion, McKinley sought a diplomatic solution. Without approval from Long or McKinley, Roosevelt sent out orders to several naval vessels, directing them to prepare for war. George Dewey, who had received an appointment to lead the Asiatic Squadron with the backing of Roosevelt, later credited his victory at the Battle of Manila Bay to Roosevelt's orders. After finally giving up hope of a peaceful solution, McKinley asked Congress to declare war upon Spain, beginning the Spanish-American War.

It will come as no surprise to those working in the UK’s higher education (HE) sector that universities are currently suffused with anxiety. The University and College Union (UCU) has recently been in dispute with employers over proposed changes to the USS pension scheme, and the most sustained period of industrial action in the sector’s history has highlighted the fears staff have for the security of their futures post-retirement. Such unprecedented strike action needs to be situated within the wider context of a public sector undergoing transformation: while the concept remains contested, the influence of “neoliberal” ideas on universities can most clearly be seen in Success as a Knowledge Economy – the government white paper that preceded the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act – which states: “Competition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. Higher education is no exception.” Yet what might “raising our game” mean for academic staff? The university has been described as an “anxiety machine”: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now “consumers”), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit – such as the REF and TEF – to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour. In 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts – a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration. In addition to pressures facing many staff in universities – such as time-management, meeting growing employer expectations, and the evaluation of performance – “casualised” contracts present particular challenges for those facing employment uncertainty: in a material sense, this can be a case of keeping up with...

The next day, Jim's live-in girlfriend Linda sees Brandon's ouija board (which Brandon left behind from the previous night) and tries to contact David. It is revealed that the spirit is actually a ghost of a deceased murderer named Carlos Malfeitor acting under the guise of David. This malicious spirit initially starts being nice and helpful to her, informing Linda where her lost diamond engagement ring is. Meanwhile, at the construction site where Jim is working, his Lloyd is killed from fallen sheetrock by the murderous spirit. After Jim is questioned by Lieutenant Dewhurst at At Lloyd's funeral, she again contacts Malfeitor (still believing to be David) about the accident, and the spirit lies that he did not cause it. Soon, Linda begins to fall under progressive entrapment, in which the spirit changes and starts to terrorize the user, rendering the person weak and easy to possess.

Police in Pamplona are searching for a bull runner who they believe snapped a selfie as he ran just inches ahead of several charging bulls weighing more than a half a tonne each. As the young man slowed to take a photo in one of the final stretches of the fifth bull run of the San Fermín festival on Friday, he was captured on camera by several Spanish media. He now faces a fine of up to €3,000 under regulations passed this year by the city of Pamplona. The regulations, designed to crack down on dangerous behaviour during the festival, prohibit the unauthorised use of any kind of recording device during the bull runs. The festival, which traces its roots back to the 13th century, has come under pressure in recent years to fight back against daredevils as its global profile increases. Images of the thousands of runners dressed in red and white as they tear through the narrow streets of Pamplona pursued by stampeding bulls have now become commonplace in foreign media, and tens of thousands of Spanish and foreign tourists descend on the city to take part in the festival's nine days of alcohol-fuelled partying and bull runs. As pictures of the man circulated on social networks under the hashtag #eltontolmóvil, meaning the idiot with the mobile, many criticised his lack of respect for the other participants in the run. El Mundo's José Luis Vadillo wrote that the photo was \\"one of the best examples of human stupidity I've ever seen\\", pointing out that he had put other runners in tremendous danger. Fifteen people have been killed in the festival since record-keeping began in the early 1900s. Dozens more are injured each year in the festival, most of them during the panicked chaos of the morning bull runs. ||||| Alex Dunham · 11 Jul 2014, 16:33 Published: 11 Jul 2014 16:33 GMT+02:00 A participant in Friday's running of the bulls in the Spanish city of Pamplona may be slapped with a €3,000 (4,100) fine after he dared to take a selfie just inches away from a group of charging San Fermin bulls. Authorities in the northern region of Navarre have passed a bylaw this year aimed at clamping down on the usage of filming devices during the treacherous ‘encierros’ (running of the bulls). So far three people, all of them British citizens, have been fined. One of the men had to pay €200 for crossing a security line (despite his claims that the information was only announced via megaphone in Spanish and Euskera) whereas another Brit had to cough up €650 for filming the bull run with a drone. If anyone does seriously disturb the encierro and put other people’s lives in danger by filming or taking pictures while running with the bulls, they will have to pay €3,000. The daredevil in the photo above may be the first to have to do so after Spanish public television TVE filmed him taking a selfie with his phone as the 700-kilo bulls came within centimetres of goring him. Ironically, TVE producers have got themselves into a spot of trouble after they encouraged participants to “send their best San Fermin selfies in to win a prize”. Since the controversial photo above went viral, they have tweeted: “Be careful, we didn’t quite mean that” in response. San Fermin has become a global tourist attraction, with tens of thousands of Spaniards and foreigners pouring into the Navarran capital. Many bull run participants take part after drinking and dancing almost all night. Fifteen people have been killed in the bull runs since records began in 1911. The most recent death occurred five years ago when a Spanish man was gored. Story continues below… Four Spaniards and one American have been gored so far this year in the festival, which wraps up on Monday. A 2011 study by Pamplona city hall found that of the 20,500 people who took part in the festival's eight bull runs that year, only six percent were women. Nearly half of the people who took part in the bull runs that year came from outside Spain, mostly from Australia, Britain and the United States. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"A man participating in Pamplona's San Fermín festival is facing a fine of up to €3,000 for taking a selfie while running just inches ahead of several charging bulls.

She publicly revealed their marriage in a video montage at the listening party for her third studio album, I Am... Sasha Fierce, in Manhattan's Sony Club on October 22, 2008. I Am... Sasha Fierce was released on November 18, 2008 in the United States. The album formally introduces Beyoncé's alter ego Sasha Fierce, conceived during the making of her 2003 single \\"Crazy in Love\\", selling 482,000 copies in its first week, debuting atop the Billboard 200, and giving Beyoncé her third consecutive number-one album in the US. The album featured the number-one song \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\" and the top-five songs \\"If I Were a Boy\\" and \\"Halo\\". Achieving the accomplishment of becoming her longest-running Hot 100 single in her career, \\"Halo\\"'s success in the US helped Beyoncé attain more top-ten singles on the list than any other woman during the 2000s. It also included the successful \\"Sweet Dreams\\", and singles \\"Diva\\", \\"Ego\\", \\"Broken-Hearted Girl\\" and \\"Video Phone\\".

Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of increased pollution can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of air intake and respiration. Direct effects: When air pollution increases, the air we breathe contains more harmful particles and chemicals. These pollutants can be inhaled through the mouth and enter the lungs, mixing with the air inside the lungs. This may cause inflammation, irritation, or damage to the lung tissues. As a result, the air sacs in the lungs may not fill with as much oxygen, reducing the efficiency of the oxygen transfer process. Additionally, the pollutants might hinder the effective removal of carbon dioxide from the lungs, potentially leading to respiratory problems or reduced lung function. Indirect effects: Increased air pollution can also impact the environment and climate on a larger scale, leading to changes in air quality and weather patterns. This may indirectly influence the amount and quality of the air available for humans to breathe, further exacerbating any negative effects on the respiratory system.

Well, that time has come. The \\"Mexican food\\" chain is testing a Waffle Taco at three Southern California restaurants, and the Los Angeles Times reports that it's pretty popular already (or maybe just novel): On Tuesday, a \\"steady stream\\" of people ordered as many as 10 or more of the 89-cent \\"tacos\\" (a waffle folded around a sausage patty folded around some scrambled eggs, served with a side of syrup) at a time at one location. Gawker suggests we call it the \\"wafflaco.\\" The Times found the waffle too \\"mushy\\" and the sausage too \\"rubbery,\\" but the Instagrammer who first broke the news of the Waffle Taco tagged it, #itsdelicious. Delicious it may be, but many are wondering: Is it really a taco? The Consumerist sums it up with this headline: \\"Is The 'Waffle Taco' Really A Taco, Or Just A Folded Waffle With Stuff In It?\\" And on BuzzFeed, Erin La Rosa points out that almost anything can be folded in half and called a taco, including your hand folded around some ice cream and chocolate syrup. You may soon be able to judge for yourself: If the Waffle Taco is a success, \\"we'll roll it out to all of our restaurants that serve breakfast,\\" a Taco Bell rep tells USA Today.

The Waffle Taco features a waffle folded around a sausage patty and scrambled eggs served with a side of syrup, priced at just 89 cents. According to the Los Angeles Times, a steady stream of curious customers are already flocking to try this unique food item. One Taco Bell location reported that individuals ordered up to 10 or more Waffle Tacos at a time. The term \\"wafflaco\\" has been coined by Gawker to represent this distinct menu offering. Despite the excitement surrounding the Waffle Taco, not everyone is convinced that it qualifies as a true taco. The Times' review suggested that the waffle was too mushy and the sausage too rubbery. Meanwhile, The Consumerist poses the question: \\"Is the 'Waffle Taco' really a taco, or just a folded waffle with stuff in it?\\" BuzzFeed's Erin La Rosa also chimed in, highlighting how virtually any item can be folded in half and deemed a taco, even a hand folded around ice cream and chocolate syrup. Should the Waffle Taco prove to be a hit among customers, Taco Bell has plans to expand its availability. A representative of the company shared with USA Today, \\"If the Waffle Taco is a success, we'll roll it out to all of our restaurants that serve breakfast.\\" This innovative breakfast option is part of the ever-evolving fast food landscape, with other chains like Burger King also introducing new items, such as their version of the McRib. Regardless of whether the Waffle Taco is granted the \\"taco\\" label or not, the buzz and interest surrounding this item demonstrates the ongoing allure of inventive fast food menu offerings.

Step 3: Weigh the potential for improvement against the current state. The reviewer suggests that if the app's issues were resolved, they would give it a higher rating. This indicates that there is potential for the app to become better and more functional in the future. Step 4: Determine the recommendation based on the evaluation. Considering the current state of the app and its potential for improvement, I would choose \\"Maybe\\" for the recommendation. The app's issues make it difficult to recommend without reservation, but its potential for improvement suggests there could be value in the app once the problems are addressed."},{"prompt":"Q: Question: HOW MANY BROTHELS WERE THERE IN THE UNITED STATES IN 1840'S? Would \\"It was at one time considered to be a vagrancy crime.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","completion":"No, the statement \\"It was at one time considered to be a vagrancy crime.\\" does not answer the question about the number of brothels in the United States in the 1840s. Instead, this statement refers to the legal status or perception of prostitution during a certain period."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. – The Washington Post explores a provocative question about Google in its Outlook section tomorrow: Do we need laws in place to safeguard against the company deliberately manipulating elections? It may sound far-fetched on the surface, but the story follows the experiments of psychologist Robert Epstein, who showed that it's relatively easy to sway potential voters by manipulating search results. Epstein, though, isn't talking about Google bombs, in which outsiders try to rig results. What if the folks inside Google—if not the current leaders, but the next generation 20 years from now—subtly changed their algorithms to give an edge to a favorite candidate? It would be nearly impossible to detect, and the very possibility should have us worried, argues Epstein. Others agree. \\"Elections are won among low-information voters,\\" says Eli Pariser, former president of ­MoveOn.org. \\"The ability to raise a negative story about a candidate to a voter ... could be quite powerful.\\" Epstein will formally present his findings this spring at a psychology forum, but Google disputes the premise. \\"Providing relevant answers has been the cornerstone of Google’s approach to search from the very beginning,\\" it says. \\"It would undermine people’s trust in our results and company if we were to change course.\\" (Click for the full story, which notes that Epstein's research was prompted by a public beef he had with the company.) Expand this summary.","completion":"The Washington Post recently published a story about an experiment by psychologist Robert Epstein. He demonstrated that it's possible to influence voters by manipulating search results, and he is worried that in the future, people inside companies like Google might change their algorithms to favor a certain candidate in an election. This is a serious concern because it would be very hard to notice if this is happening, and it could affect the way people vote. Elections can be won by just a few votes, so if someone can change the search results to make a candidate look better or worse, it might help them win. Google disagrees with this idea and says that their goal is to provide the most relevant answers for their users. They believe that if they tried to change search results for their own benefit, people would stop trusting Google. This is an important issue to think about as technology continues to play a big part in our lives and elections."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Identify the context of intrinsic factor 2. Search for the cell type responsible for its secretion Step 1: Identifying the context of intrinsic factor Intrinsic factor is a glycoprotein secreted in the stomach. It is essential for the absorption of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) in the small intestine. Step 2: Search for the cell type responsible for the secretion of intrinsic factor Parietal cells, also known as oxyntic cells, are primarily responsible for the secretion of intrinsic factor. They are found in the gastric glands located in the lining of the stomach. In conclusion, parietal cells are primarily responsible for the secretion of intrinsic factor."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Sentence 4: Greg tried to return them.","completion":"Answer: Unfortunately, since he had thrown away all of the packaging, there was no return possible for the painful headphones. Explanation: I used the definition of the task to understand that I needed to provide a single sentence that logically and coherently continued from the given sentences while addressing the title \\"No Return\\". The previous sentences discussed Greg ordering headphones, discarding the packaging, experiencing discomfort, and attempting to return the headphones. The logical continuation was to emphasize that without the packaging, a return would not be possible and connected it to the title \\"No Return\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The whole story is written in the first point - of - view since we only know what the main character knows and everything is seen from her eyes . The words written are supposed to be some type of journal or a diary she keeps for herself . Every time she is interrupted or some else is coming she stops writing and continues later . Select from the following. A). It is written poorly .; B). It is written stream of conscious .; C). There are torn pages in it .; D). None of the above choices .; Q: Why are there so many interruptions and gaps in the novel ?","completion":"B). It is written stream of conscious. The many interruptions and gaps in the novel \\"The Yellow Wallpaper\\" are due to the story being written in a stream of consciousness style. This writing style aims to depict the continuous flow of a character's thoughts, feelings, and experiences, often lacking clear structure and punctuation. In this story, the main character's diary entries are abruptly interrupted by external events or her own mental state, which creates a sense of realism and allows readers to understand her perspective more deeply. A) It is written poorly: This option is incorrect as the style of the writing isn't poor, but intentionally depicts the protagonist's thoughts and emotions as they occur. The unconventional structure helps convey the main character's declining mental health. C) There are torn pages in it: This option is incorrect because the text itself doesn't mention torn pages. The interruptions and gaps are a result of the stream of consciousness writing style, not physical damage to the diary. D) None of the above choices: This option is incorrect since option B accurately explains the reason for the interruptions and gaps in the novel."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},Y={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],D={key:0},R={key:1};function N(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",Y,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",j,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
