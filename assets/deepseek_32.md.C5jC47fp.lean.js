Options: - downtown area - middle of town - large city - london - lot of people Explain why a human would choose \\"middle of town\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"middle of town\\" as the ideal location for a gallery to be an equal distance from everyone because it represents the central point in a given area. The middle of town typically refers to the geographical center or a commonly acknowledged central district, making it the most easily accessible location for a majority of residents. Here are some reasons why the middle of town is the most appropriate choice among the options provided: 1. Downtown area: Although downtown is usually considered a bustling part of a city with plenty of foot traffic, it may not necessarily be the central point of the town, and hence might not be an equal distance from everyone. It can also be congested, with limited parking, making it less accessible to some people. 2. Large city: A large city may have multiple downtown areas or neighborhoods, making it difficult to pinpoint a specific central location that would be an equal distance from everyone. In addition, a large city likely has a more dispersed population, further complicating the goal of equal accessibility. 3. London: London is a specific city and may not have any relevance to the question if the inquiry is not specifically about London. If the user's question is about locating a gallery in general, placing it in London would not necessarily be an equal distance for everyone who might want to visit the gallery. 4. Lot of people: A location that has \\"a lot of people\\" might be a densely populated area, but it may not be the central point of the town and might not be an equal distance from everyone. Like the downtown area option, this choice places emphasis on the concentration of people rather than the geographical centrality that provides equal accessibility. In summary, a human would choose \\"middle of town\\" as the best answer for placing a gallery at an equal distance from everyone due to its central positioning, ease of access, and fairness regarding accessibility for a majority of residents. It offers the most reasonable balance between population density and geographical centrality compared to the other options provided."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This will give us: 333*p - 327*p = -6 Now, we'll combine the p values on the left side. So, we have: (333-327)*p = -6 This simplifies to: 6*p = -6 Now, we need to get p by itself.

The reviewer had two main complaints about the product, which they expressed explicitly and in detail. First, they mention that the product they received was 18 1/2\\" long, which was too long for their needs. This implies that the product was not as described, or at least not as expected by the customer, therefore leading to their dissatisfaction.

Question: Who is King Arthur preparing a great battle against? Movie plot title: Camelot Movie plot: During the opening credits, like the Broadway production, the studio orchestra plays a potpourri overture that features the \\"Camelot March\\" and the title song. The action begins in early morning darkness as a chorus sings a few lines from \\"Guenevere.\\" Arthur (Richard Harris) talks to his unseen teacher, Merlyn (Laurence Naismith), asking him why everything that has happened to them happened. Before a battle begins at dawn with Lancelot (Franco Nero) and his Joyous Gard knights, Arthur, talking as much to himself as to Merlyn, tries to determine where he went wrong. Merlyn appears and urges the mighty King to think back to one of the most important days of his life. Almost all of the rest of the film is a flashback. It first flashes back to Arthur as a youngster (Nicholas Beauvy); he is walking in the woods in the early morning when he encounters Merlyn, who calls Arthur \\"Wart.\\" Then suddenly, Merlyn interrupts to chide Arthur for going too far back in his memory. The important day Arthur is supposed to remember, Merlyn says, is the day he met Guenevere (Vanessa Redgrave).The following scene shows Arthur in a large snow-laden tree watching people pass on the road beneath. From his perch, Arthur sings \\"I Wonder What the King Is Doing Tonight?\\" He imagines that his subjects are pondering what he is doing in the final hours before his arranged marriage. Arthur admits that even though he has faced battle bravely, he's terrified of facing his bride-to-be. As the song ends, a procession approaches (\\"Camelot March\\") carrying Guenevere. She is not at all thrilled that her wedding is an inconvenient marriage of convenience. In despair, Guenevere sings \\"The Simple Joys of Maidenhood.\\" The lyrics question how she missed the normal life of a maiden and all its simple pleasures like knights tilting for her and \\"kith not kill their kin\\" for her.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information: - Hans Asperger (18 February 1906 21 October 1980) was an Austrian pediatrician, medical theorist, and medical professor. He is best known for his early studies on mental disorders, especially in children. His work was largely unnoticed during his lifetime except for a few accolades in Vienna, and his studies on psychological disorders only acquired world renown posthumously. He wrote over 300 publications, mostly concerning a condition he termed \\"autistic psychopathy\\" (AP). There was a resurgence of interest in his work beginning in the 1980s, and due to his earlier work on autism spectrum disorders, Asperger syndrome (AS), was named after him. Both Asperger's original paediatric diagnosis of AP and the eponymous diagnosis of AS that was named after him several decades later have been controversial. - The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), offers a common language and standard criteria for the classification of mental disorders. It is used, or relied upon, by clinicians, researchers, psychiatric drug regulation agencies, health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, the legal system, and policy makers together with alternatives such as the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), produced by the World Health Organization (WHO). The DSM is now in its fifth edition, DSM-5, published on May 18, 2013. It evaluated the patient on five axes or dimensions rather than just one broad aspect of 'mental disorder'. These dimensions relate to biological, psychological, social and other aspects. The DSM evolved from systems for collecting census and psychiatric hospital statistics, and from a United States Army manual. Revisions since its first publication in 1952 have incrementally added to the total number of mental disorders, although also removing those no longer considered to be mental disorders. - ICD-10 is the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), a medical classification list by the World Health Organization (WHO). It contains codes for diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or diseases. - Asperger syndrome (AS), also known as Asperger's, is a developmental disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. As a milder autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it differs from other ASDs by relatively normal language and intelligence. Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and unusual use of language are common. Signs usually begin before two years old and typically last for a person's entire life. The exact cause of Asperger's is unknown. While it is probably partly inherited, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying problem. The diagnosis of Asperger's was removed in the 2013 fifth edition of the \\"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\\" (DSM-5), and people with these symptoms are now included within the autism spectrum disorder along with autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. It remains within the tenth edition of the \\"International Classification of Diseases\\" (ICD-10) as of 2015. There is no single treatment, and the effectiveness of particular interventions is supported by only limited data. Treatment is aimed at improving poor communication skills, obsessive or repetitive routines, and physical clumsiness. Interventions may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems such as mood or anxiety. Most children improve as they grow up, but social and communication difficulties usually persist. Some researchers and people on the autism spectrum have advocated a shift in attitudes toward the view that autism spectrum disorder is a difference, rather than a disease that must be treated or cured. In 2013, Asperger's was estimated to affect 31 million people globally. The syndrome is named... - International Organization is a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal that covers the entire field of international affairs.

A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the United Nations is in Manhattan, New York City, and experiences extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict. - A social skill is any skill facilitating interaction and communication with others. Social rules and relations are created, communicated, and changed in verbal and nonverbal ways. The process of learning these skills is called socialization. For socialization, Interpersonal skills are essential to relate one another. Interpersonal skills are the interpersonal acts a person uses to interact with others which are related to dominance vs. submission, love vs. hate, affiliation vs. aggression, control vs. autonomy categories (Leary, 1957). Positive interpersonal skills include persuasion, active listening, delegation, and stewardship among others. Social psychology is the academic discipline that does research related to social skills, the discipline studies how skills are learned by an individual through changes in attitude, thinking, and behavior. - High-functioning autism (HFA) is a term applied to people with autism who are deemed to be cognitively \\"higher functioning\\" (with an IQ of 70 or greater) than other people with autism. Individuals with HFA or Asperger syndrome may exhibit deficits in areas of communication, emotion recognition and expression, and social interaction. HFA is not a recognized diagnosis in the DSM-5 or the ICD-10. - Developmental disorders is a group of psychiatric conditions originating in childhood that involve serious impairment in different areas. There are several ways of using this term. The most narrow concept is used in the category \\"Specific Disorders of Psychological Development\\" in the ICD-10. These disorders comprise language disorders, learning disorders, motor disorders and autism spectrum disorders. In broader definitions ADHD is included, and the term used is neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet others include antisocial behavior and schizophrenia that begins in childhood and continues through life. However, these two latter conditions are not as stable as the other developmental disorders, and there is not the same evidence of a shared genetic liability. - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three. Autism is due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some cases are strongly associated with certain infections during pregnancy including rubella and use of alcohol or cocaine. Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example, the vaccine hypotheses, which have since been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. In the DSM V, autism is included within the autism spectrum (ASDs), as is Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which was diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome were not met. Early speech or behavioral interventions can help children with autism gain self-care, social, and communication skills. Although there is no known cure, there have been reported cases of children who recovered. Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful. An autistic culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder. Globally, autism is estimated to affect 21.7 million people as of 2013. As of 2010, the number of people affected is estimated at about 12 per 1,000 worldwide. It occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls.

In the United States the DSM serves as a universal authority for psychiatric diagnoses. Treatment recommendations, as well as payment by health care providers, are often determined by DSM classifications, so the appearance of a new version has significant practical importance. - Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC, , or OPEP in several other languages) is an intergovernmental organization of 13 nations, founded in 1960 in Baghdad by the first five members (Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela), and headquartered since 1965 in Vienna. As of 2015, the 13 countries accounted for an estimated 42 percent of global oil production and 73 percent of the world's \\"proven\\" oil reserves, giving OPEC a major influence on global oil prices that were previously determined by American-dominated multinational oil companies. - Hungary is a unitary parliamentary republic in Central Europe. It covers an area of , situated in the Carpathian Basin and bordered by Slovakia to the north, Romania to the east, Serbia to the south, Croatia to the southwest, Slovenia to the west, Austria to the northwest, and Ukraine to the northeast. With about 10 million inhabitants, Hungary is a medium-sized member state of the European Union. The official language is Hungarian, which is the most widely spoken Uralic language in the world. Hungary's capital and largest metropolis is Budapest, a significant economic hub, classified as an Alpha- global city. Major urban areas include Debrecen, Szeged, Miskolc, Pécs and Gyr. - Vienna is the capital and largest city of Austria and one of the nine states of Austria. Vienna is Austria's primary city, with a population of about 1.8 million (2.6 million within the metropolitan area, nearly one third of Austria's population), and its cultural, economic, and political centre. It is the 7th-largest city by population within city limits in the European Union. Until the beginning of the 20th century, it was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had 2 million inhabitants. Today, it has the second largest number of German speakers after Berlin. Vienna is host to many major international organizations, including the United Nations and OPEC. The city is located in the eastern part of Austria and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. These regions work together in a European Centrope border region. Along with nearby Bratislava, Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3 million inhabitants. In 2001, the city centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. - The Czech Republic, also known by the short name Czechia, is a nation state in Central Europe bordered by Germany to the west, Austria to the south, Slovakia to the east and Poland to the northeast. The Czech Republic covers an area of with mostly temperate continental climate and oceanic climate. It is a unitary parliamentary republic, has 10.5 million inhabitants and the capital and largest city is Prague, with over 1.2 million residents. The Czech Republic includes the historical territories of Bohemia, Moravia, and Czech Silesia. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.

Movie title: Force 10 from Navarone Movie plot: In 1943, after their successful mission on the Greek island of Navarone, Major Keith Mallory (Robert Shaw) and Sergeant John Miller (Edward Fox) are sent to find and kill Nicolai. Originally thought to be a traitor who informed the Germans about Miller and Mallory during the Navarone mission, Nicolai is now known to be Colonel von Ingorslebon, a dedicated German spy believed to have infiltrated the Yugoslav Partisans as \\"Captain Lescovar\\" (Franco Nero). To get to Yugoslavia, the two men pair with \\"Force 10\\", an American sabotage unit, led by Colonel Mike Barnsby (Harrison Ford), which has its own mission there. To maximise security, Force 10 steals a Lancaster bomber from a British air base in Termoli, Italy, rather than requisitioning one; but they are spotted by Military Police MPs before they can take off. Weaver (Carl Weathers), a US Army sergeant under arrest by the MPs, joins with Force 10 and forces his way onto the plane.

Catus Decianus, was involved in provoking the rebellion of what queen of the British Celtic Iceni tribe who led an uprising against the occupying forces of the Roman Empire in AD 60 or 61? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The answer to this question is Queen Boudica. Boudica was the queen of the British Celtic Iceni tribe who led a fierce uprising against the occupying forces of the Roman Empire in AD 60 or 61. She was a symbol of British resistance against Roman rule and remains a prominent figure in British history. Catus Decianus, a Roman procurator, played a crucial role in provoking the rebellion led by Queen Boudica. The Iceni tribe initially had a relatively peaceful relationship with the Romans, as they were recognized as a client kingdom under the rule of their king, Prasutagus. However, when Prasutagus died, he left a will naming both his two daughters and the Roman Emperor Nero as joint heirs, presumably hoping that this arrangement would protect his kingdom and family from Roman exploitation. Contrary to Prasutagus' expectations, the Romans did not honor the will. Instead, they decided to seize Iceni lands and annex the kingdom as a Roman province. Along with this territorial annexation, the Romans imposed heavy taxes and other forms of exploitation on the Iceni people. Catus Decianus, in his capacity as procurator, oversaw the financial administration of the newly annexed province. His harsh policies and oppressive actions further fueled the resentment of the Iceni people towards the Roman occupiers. One of the most deplorable acts committed by Decianus was the brutal treatment of Boudica and her daughters. After the death of Prasutagus, Roman soldiers flogged Boudica and raped her daughters, dishonoring the royal family and intensifying the Iceni people's fury. As a result of these Roman atrocities, Queen Boudica rallied the Iceni tribe, along with other neighboring tribes, to rebel against the Roman Empire. The ferocious rebellion led by Boudica initially achieved considerable success, as the insurgents managed to destroy several major Roman settlements, including Camulodunum (now Colchester), Londinium (London), and Verulamium (St. Albans). Despite the early victories, however, the revolt ultimately failed due to the superior military tactics and discipline of the Roman forces led by Governor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus. The brutal and humiliating treatment of Boudica and her daughters at the hands of Catus Decianus, coupled with Roman oppression and greed, spurred the fierce rebellion led by the queen of the Iceni tribe. Although the uprising did not expel the Romans from Britain, Queen Boudica's fight against tyranny remains an enduring symbol of resistance against oppression in British history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve this problem.","completion":"To solve for y in the equation -2002 = 55*y + 177*y + 292 + 722, we would follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation by grouping like terms together. In this instance, we have two y terms (55*y and 177*y) and two constants (292 and 722). So the equation would now become -2002 = (55*y + 177*y) + (292 + 722) Step 2: Add 55*y and 177*y to find the total y term and also add 292 and 722 to find the total constant. So the equation would look like: -2002 = 232*y + 1014 Step 3: Isolate the variable y by moving the total constant (1014) from the right side of the equation to left side. This will give us our new equation: -2002 - 1014 = 232*y Step 4: Simplify the left side of the equation by subtracting 1014 from -2002. This would give us: -3016 = 232*y Step 5: Lastly, to solve for y, you need to divide both sides of the equation by 232 (which is the coefficient of y) So it will look like y = -3016 / 232 Step 6: Perform the division Doing the division, we find that y approximately equals to -13.

The sweet piebald cob called Gizmo is battling to survive after he was found without his mother and seriously underweight near Ridgewell Caravan Park in Essex on Tuesday. He has been left so weak he can barely stand and was suffering from hypothermia, dehydration and pneumonia when he was rescued by the RSPCA along with police and veterinary staff. Gizmo, the four-month-old foal, was left abandoned in freezing conditions and dumped by a caravan park. He was rescued by the RSPCA on Tuesday and underwent an operation at Catley Cross Veterinary Clinic, where he is continuing to fight for his life. Sarah Elmy, from the charity, said: 'Poor Gizmo was just abandoned without his mum and left to die by the side of the road. 'He was so weak he was just collapsed and couldn't - and still can't - stand, and you can see every bone in his body, he's so thin. 'We had to carry him to the van on a rug. He was so keen to live, though, bless him. 'Even though he was lying flat out, he was trying to reach forward and crawl himself along the ground to get to grass. He was suffering from hypothermia, dehydration and pneumonia and could barely stand when he was found. Gizmo was so weak he had to be carried to the rescue van on a rug (pictured) 'As soon as we propped him up he was nibbling, trying to eat from our hand. It was so heartbreaking. I just really hope he pulls through - he's certainly trying his best.' An Essex Police spokesperson said: 'We assisted the RSPCA in recovering a sick horse in Yeldham Road in Ridgewell on February 17.' Gizmo underwent surgery at Catley Cross Veterinary Clinic and following a post on its Facebook page, people have stepped in to raise £11,000 to cover his care. Veterinary surgeon, Carolyn Wise, from the centre, said: 'It is touch and go at the moment. Gizmo is walking a fine line. 'But he is eating and trying to live so we have everything crossed he will pull through - he is such a lovely foal. He has melted all our hearts. 'It seems we are not the only ones as we have been overwhelmed by people phoning us wanting to help, after we put up a short appeal on our Facebook page. 'We are so grateful for such a heartwarming response. It just shows you how much people care.' More than £3,000 has already donated by 220 well-wishers in less than 24 hours, which already covers more than half his medical costs. The RSPCA, which has more than 600 horses in its care nationally, says any surplus funds will be used for the rescue and treatment of other horses in a similar situation.

First question: What the type of mosquito that transmits dengue virus to humans? How does it transmits the virus and how can it be prevented? Second question: Are there organisations doing social impact tourism in India? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. They are inquiring about separate topics. One is about the transmission and prevention of the dengue virus, a health-related concern, and the other is concerning social impact tourism in India, which is more of a societal and economic matter. First question: The type of mosquito that transmits dengue virus to humans is primarily the Aedes aegypti mosquito. There is also a second potential vector, Aedes albopictus, but Aedes aegypti is the major spreader of the virus. This transmission happens when a mosquito bites a person infected with the dengue virus. The virus then enters the mosquito, and when the mosquito bites another person, it can transmit the virus. Thus, the dengue virus spreads. This type of disease transmission is known as vector-borne transmission because the disease is transmitted through a 'vector', in this case, a mosquito. Several measures can be undertaken to prevent the spread of the dengue virus: 1. Removal and modification of mosquito habitats: Reducing mosquito breeding areas by managing waste and standing water can help decrease mosquito populations. 2. Chemical controls: Insecticides can be sprayed to kill larvae or adult mosquitoes. Larvicides can be used in areas where it's hard to remove standing water, while adulticides could be used during outbreaks to manage adult mosquitoes and minimize disease transmission. 3. Personal protection: Using personal protective measures like wearing long sleeves, using mosquito nets, and applying insect repellent could reduce the chances of mosquito bites. 4. Community awareness: Public health education about dengue and its transmission can increase local disease surveillance and incidence reporting, leading to more effective control strategies. Your second question relates to social impact tourism, also known as responsible tourism, in India. India has many initiatives and organizations that promote this kind of tourism, which aims to create a positive impact on the environment, economy, and cultures of the places visited: 1. Reality Tours and Travel: They organize tours of the Dharavi slum in Mumbai and donate 80% of their profits back into the community through their NGO, Reality Gives. 2. Responsible Tourism India: RTI partners with responsible tourism businesses and organizations to promote tourism that is sustainable and helps local economies 3. Grassroutes: They organize rural journeys and tourism experiences that help uplift rural economies and promote local culture and traditions. 4. Goonj: Although primarily a relief agency, Goonj has been involved in rural tourism and disaster tourism, focusing on the \\"dignity\\" aspect of donating. Note that the impact of tourism can be both positive and negative. In line with this, responsible tourism aims to maximize the positive impacts and minimize the negative ones. This is done by respecting local cultures, supporting small-scale businesses, and reducing environmental impacts. The ultimate goal is to bring about a positive change in these areas."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

The water is then heated by an internal heating element within the dishwasher. 3. This heated water is forced up through pipes which are connected to spinning paddles. 4. The pressure of the water forces these paddles to spin, functioning somewhat akin to sprinkler system, and effectively distributing water around the interior of the dishwasher. 5. As the water is ejected from small holes in these paddles, it cleans the dishes inside the dishwasher. 6. The water is then recycled and used again to continue cleaning the dishes until they are clean. 7.

Look for sunglasses in brightly colored frames, such as peach, bright blue, or pink. This can add another level of summer to your look. Brimmed hats are great for staying cool in hot weather, as they protect your face from the sun and keep your body cool in the heat. Look for hats made of cotton or woven materials. Hats with a wide brim all the way around, sun hat style, or baseball hats are ideal for staying cool in hot weather. Many people suffer from swollen, sweaty feet in hot weather. You can prevent this by wearing shoes that are comfortable and not constraining. Look for shoes with comfortable soles made of breathable materials like canvas or cotton. Avoid shoes that are made of non-breathable material like leather, rubber, or other man-made materials. You should also make sure your shoes fit your feet properly so they do not get irritated by your shoes.

The first principle is the commitment to sustainable development. It recognizes the need for each member state to seek long-term and sustainable forms of energy. This need arises from the growing global concern about the environmental impact of conventional energy sources such as fossil fuels. Sustainable energy forms such as solar, wind, hydro and geothermal not only provide a long-term solution to energy needs, but also help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, thereby aiding in the fight against climate change. The second principle referred to is the principle of subsidiarity. This is a fundamental principle of the European Union. At its core, the principle of subsidiarity means that decisions should be taken as closely as possible to the citizen - in other words, at the local, regional or national level - wherever that makes the most sense. When it comes to energy policy, this means that each member state should have the ability to determine its own energy mix, taking into account its specific circumstances, resources and needs. This allows for flexibility and tailor-made solutions, while still working towards the common goal of energy sustainability.

Here, \\"That\\" is translated as \\"Se\\", \\"has clarified\\" as \\"on selventänyt\\", and \\"the matter\\" as \\"asiaa\\". Finnish uses postpositions instead of prepositions; hence, \\"the matter\\" became \\"asiaa\\", not \\"asian\\". 2. \\"and I wanted to pass on this explanation\\" - This phrase is translated in Finnish as \\"ja halusin välittää tämän selityksen\\". In this case, \\"and\\" is translated as \\"ja\\", \\"I wanted\\" as \\"halusin\\", \\"to pass on\\" as \\"välittää\\", \\"this\\" as \\"tämän\\", and \\"explanation\\" as \\"selityksen\\". 3. \\"to the House\\" - The Finnish equivalent for this phrase is \\"eduskunnalle\\".

Question: I read this background article the other day: Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc. I am facing a new situation today: Two scientist, Pete and Gill, studied the Earth's crust and geology. Pete studied earthquakes, while Gill studied mantles and volcanos.

Write an article based on this summary: The British biathlon team have pulled out of the Russian leg of a World Cup event.","completion":"Title: British Biathlon Team Withdraws from World Cup Event in Russia: A Stand against Doping and Political Tensions Introduction The British biathlon team has made the bold decision to withdraw from the Russian leg of a prestigious World Cup event. This unexpected move has reverberated through the sporting community, not only in the United Kingdom but across the world. As the news spread, speculation arose as to what prompted this surprising action. Primarily, it showcases a clear stance against the issue of doping in sports and the political tensions surrounding Russia and the United Kingdom. In this article, we delve into the various factors that contributed to this decision and analyze its potential impact on future sporting events. Doping Scandals and the Russian Sporting Community Over the years, Russia has faced numerous doping scandals that have tarnished the reputation of its athletes and the nation as a whole. The widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs in Russian sports has led to frequent suspensions and bans on their athletes. Notably, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) banned Russia from the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, forcing clean athletes to participate as neutrals under the Olympic flag. The British biathlon team's withdrawal is a powerful statement, emphasizing the importance of fair competition and a zero-tolerance policy towards doping. By making this decision, British athletes are taking a stand against a tainted sporting culture and sending a message that their dedication to ethics takes precedence over the pursuit of medals. Political Tensions Between the UK and Russia In recent years, political tensions between the United Kingdom and Russia have been steadily escalating. The situation worsened after the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia on British soil. The UK government attributed the attempted murder to the Russian state, inciting diplomatic tensions and the expulsion of Russian diplomats from the UK. The British biathlon team's withdrawal from the Russian leg of the World Cup could be interpreted as a continued manifestation of the strained relations between the two countries. While clear political motivations might not have been the primary reason for their withdrawal, the context adds weight to the team's decision and reaffirms the stance against any form of cooperation with a country that has been involved in alleged instances of state-sponsored violence. Implications for Future Sporting Events The decision by the British biathlon team has the potential to influence other sporting teams and associations. It emphasizes the importance of fair and ethical competition, and it might encourage other teams to reevaluate their participation in events hosted by nations facing doping scandals. This could prompt countries with tainted reputations to take decisive action to reform their sporting communities. At the same time, there could be a potential backlash, with some arguing that sports and politics should not mix. Critics may claim that the British team's withdrawal could exacerbate existing tensions rather than promote cooperation and understanding through sports diplomacy. Conclusion The British biathlon team's decision to withdraw from the Russian leg of a World Cup event has prompted significant conversations around issues of doping, ethics, and fair competition in sports. While this move may have been primarily driven by a commitment to ethical practices, it is difficult to ignore the political context. Ultimately, regardless of the motivations behind their withdrawal, the British biathlon team's stance against unfair competition and doping highlights the ongoing struggle to maintain integrity in sports and sends a powerful message that underscores the importance of fair play and adherence to the rules, both on and off the field."},{"prompt":"Read the article and select the best answer.

He meets opposing player Nick Brophy (Jon Gofton) at center ice to start the Hyannisport game, and Nick reveals he is drunk and resents that his coach put him in the game. In the broadcast booth, Chiefs player Dave Carlson (Jerry Houser), who supposedly was injured in a previous game, reveals that he isn't playing because he actually has a cold. The lone quality player for the Chiefs is Ned Braden (Michael Ontkean), who is not only the highest-scorer in the Federal League (he makes his record shot during the Hyannisport game), but he is also a Princeton grad who plays for the love of the game.Joe McGrath (Strother Martin), the team's manager, seems to be receiving encouragement by the mysterious team owner to come up with publicity stunts for the players.

And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the equation: -236537 = -6759n + 588061 for n, follow these steps: Step 1: Subtract 588061 from both sides of the equation in order to isolate the -6759n (or n term) on one side of the equation: -236537 - 588061 = -6759n + 588061 - 588061 This simplifies to: -824598 = -6759n Step 2: Now, you need to isolate n. To do so, divide both sides of the equation by -6759: -824598 / -6759 = -6759n / -6759 This simplifies to: n = 122 So, the solution of the equation -236537 = -6759n + 588061 for n is 122. This means that if you substitute n = 122 into the original equation, both sides of the equation should balance. Let's check: -236537 =? -6759*122 + 588061 When you do the arithmetic, you find: -236537 = -825418 + 588061 And indeed, -825418 + 588061 equals -236537, confirming that n = 122 is the correct solution to the equation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The phenomenon of biochemical processes' serving to regulate distant tissues by means of secretions directly into the circulatory system is called endocrine signaling. The major endocrine glands include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, and adrenal glands. The endocrine system is in contrast to the exocrine system, which secretes its hormones to the outside of the body using ducts. The endocrine system is an information signal system like the nervous system, yet its effects and mechanism are classifiably different. The endocrine system's effects are slow to initiate, and prolonged in their response, lasting from a few hours up to weeks. The nervous system sends information very quickly, and responses are generally short lived. In vertebrates, the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems. The field of study dealing with the endocrine system and its disorders is endocrinology, a branch of internal medicine. Special features of endocrine glands are, in general, their ductless nature, their vascularity, and commonly the presence of intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones. In contrast, exocrine glands, such as salivary glands, sweat glands, and glands within the gastrointestinal tract, tend to be much less vascular and have ducts or a hollow lumen. - A hormone (from the Greek participle ) is any member of a class of signaling molecules produced by glands in multicellular organisms that are transported by the circulatory system to target distant organs to regulate physiology and behaviour. Hormones have diverse chemical structures, mainly of 3 classes: eicosanoids, steroids, and amino acid derivatives (amines, peptides, and proteins). The glands that secrete hormones comprise the endocrine signaling system. The term hormone is sometimes extended to include chemicals produced by cells that affect the same cell (autocrine or intracrine signalling) or nearby cells (paracrine signalling). - An anesthesiologist (American English) or anaesthetist (British English) is a physician trained in anesthesia and perioperative medicine. - The pancreas is a glandular organ in the digestive system and endocrine system of vertebrates. In humans, it is located in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach. It is an endocrine gland producing several important hormones, including insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide which circulate in the blood. The pancreas is also a digestive organ, secreting pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes that assist digestion and absorption of nutrients in the small intestine. These enzymes help to further break down the carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids in the chyme. The pancreas is also known as mixed gland. - The stomach is a muscular, hollow, dilated part of the gastrointestinal tract that functions as an important organ in the digestive system. The stomach is present in many animals including vertebrates, echinoderms, insects (mid-gut), and molluscs. In humans and many other vertebrates it is involved in the second phase of digestion, following mastication (chewing). - Liver transplantation or hepatic transplantation is the replacement of a diseased liver with some or all of a healthy liver from another person (allograft). The most commonly used technique is phototropic transplantation, in which the native liver is removed and replaced by the donor organ in the same anatomic location as the original liver. Liver transplantation is a viable treatment option for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure. Typically three surgeons and two anesthesiologists are involved, with up to four supporting nurses. The surgical procedure is very demanding and ranges from 4 to 18 hours depending on outcome. Numerous anastomoses and sutures, and many disconnections and reconnections of abdominal and liver tissue, must be made for the transplant to succeed, requiring an eligible recipient and a well-calibrated live or cadaveric donor match. - A cadaver, also called corpse (singular) in medical, literary, and legal usage, or when intended for dissection, is a deceased body. The obsolete British term \\"lich\\" for \\"corpse\\", sometimes spelled \\"lych\\", is no longer even listed in major British dictionaries such as Longman, Macmillan, Cambridge, or Oxford Online Dictionaries. However, the term \\"lich\\" has been revived in modern fantasy fiction for a type of \\"undead\\" creature. - Echinoderm is the common name given to any member of the phylum Echinodermata (from Ancient Greek, , \\"echinos\\" \\"hedgehog\\" and , \\"derma\\" \\"skin\\") of marine animals. The adults are recognizable by their (usually five-point) radial symmetry, and include such well-known animals as sea stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, and sea cucumbers, as well as the sea lilies or \\"stone lilies\\". Echinoderms are found at every ocean depth, from the intertidal zone to the abyssal zone. The phylum contains about 7000 living species, making it the second-largest grouping of deuterostomes (a superphylum), after the chordates (which include the vertebrates, such as birds, fishes, mammals, and reptiles). Echinoderms are also the largest phylum that has no freshwater or terrestrial (land-based) representatives. - Pancreatic juice is a liquid secreted by the pancreas, which contains a variety of enzymes, including trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, elastase, carboxypeptidase, pancreatic lipase, nucleases and amylase. The pancreas is located in the visceral region, and is a major part of the digestive system required for proper digestion and subsequent assimilation of macronutrient substances required for living. - Endocrine glands are glands of the endocrine system that secrete their products, \\"hormones\\", directly into the blood rather than through a duct. The major glands of the endocrine system include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, hypothalamus and adrenal glands. The hypothalamus and pituitary gland are neuroendocrine organs. Local chemical messengers, not generally considered part of the endocrine system, include autocrines, which act on the cells that secrete them, and paracrines, which act on a different cell type nearby.

Obama advances U.S. goals in India One of the more common criticisms of President Obama’s foreign policy from the right is that he’s scaled back U.S. efforts to influence the world, withdrawing America from its traditional leadership post. The Republican whining has always been more ironic than credible, largely because Obama has spent six years doing the exact opposite. The parade was the visual centerpiece of Mr. Obama’s three-day trip, a colorful mélange of modern-day military hardware, soldiers in traditional turbans and costumes riding camels, and a series of floats from myriad states capturing different aspects of India’s rich and complicated cultures. The invitation to Mr. Obama to attend in the position of honor was an important diplomatic gesture. […] Mr. Obama’s decision to accept the invitation to be chief guest was seen here as a great tribute to India, heralded by politicians and the news media as a sign of the country’s importance on the world stage. An announcer told the crowd that it was “a proud moment for every Indian.” What’s more, the NYT report added that Obama and Modi “renewed the 10-year defense pact between the two countries on Sunday and agreed to cooperate on aircraft carrier and jet engine technology. They also agreed to work on joint production of small-scale surveillance drones.” There’s also the broader, geo-political landscape to consider. Clearly, Obama has prioritized improved relations with India, seeing it as an important goal on its own, but there’s also a context to remember. Obama came into office hoping to make a “pivot to Asia,” and he’s spent six years trying to shift U.S. foreign policy in that direction, despite distractions and rebuffs, in an effort to align U.S. interests with those of the world’s most rapidly growing populations and economies. As part of that strategy and an effort to counterbalance China, Obama has looked to bolster India – which is on course to overtake China as the world’s most populous nation – to make sure China has a strong rival in the region. But for Obama, like Bill Clinton and George W. Bush before him, the Indian relationship itself has so far been a huge investment of American time and money with little to show. So now, on the first foreign trip of his final two years and with a mind on building his legacy, Obama’s spending three days in New Delhi trying again. China, said Jon Huntsman, Obama’s first ambassador in Beijing, “will be implied in everything they do, and everything they discuss.” If Republicans see all of this and continue to assume the president is retreating from the world stage, they’re just not paying close enough attention.

During the 19th century, steamers had begun to visit Hirta, enabling the islanders to earn money from the sale of tweeds and birds' eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists regarded them as curiosities. It is also clear that the St Kildans were not so naïve as they sometimes appeared. \\"For example, when they boarded a yacht they would pretend they thought all the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy\\". The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially tetanus infantum, which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century. The cnatan na gall or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.By the early 20th century, formal schooling had again become a feature of the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Scottish Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end. contains an answer for the question: Who did the tourists regard as curiosities?, what is it ? A:","completion":"The tourists regarded the islanders of Hirta, who are also known as St. Kildans, as curiosities. This was emphasized when the locals began to interact more with the outside world, as steamers brought tourists to the remote islands, exposing the St. Kildans to modern lifestyles and culture. These tourists observed the St. Kildans' way of life with fascination and sometimes even condescension, treating them as exotic or unusual attractions. This, in turn, affected the islanders' self-esteem as they engaged in trade with these visitors and felt diminished by the outsider's perception of their culture and daily life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: Sardines and pilchards belong to which family of fish?","completion":"Sardines and pilchards are small, oily fish that belong to the family Clupeidae, within the order Clupeiformes. This family is particularly diverse and contains several subfamilies, genera, and species. Clupeids are often characterized by their silver bodies, single dorsal fin, and strong, deeply forked tails. These fish are commonly found in both marine and freshwater environments around the world, with a notable presence in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans. Sardines and pilchards are not distinct species in themselves but rather terms used to describe various species of small, oily fish within the Clupeidae family. The common name \\"sardine\\" is derived from the Mediterranean island of Sardinia, where these fish were once abundant and today, sardines generally refer to young, small-sized fish of numerous species within the Clupeidae family. Similarly, \\"pilchards\\" is a term used to describe larger adult fish of specific species within the same family, particularly those found in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. One of the most commonly known species classified as sardines is the European pilchard (Sardina pilchardus), which is widespread across the Northeast Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea, and the Black Sea. Other commonly recognized species include the American Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), and the American Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus). The Clupeidae family has great ecological and economic significance, as these fish serve as essential components within their respective ecosystems. Sardines and pilchards are crucial prey for a wide range of marine predators, such as larger fish, seabirds, and marine mammals, making them vital contributors to the marine food chain. Furthermore, these fish are primary consumers that feed on plankton, playing a significant role in connecting the primary producers (phytoplankton) to higher trophic levels. In addition to their ecological importance, sardines and pilchards hold substantial economic value. They are captured worldwide for human consumption and are typically marketed as fresh, canned, or smoked products. Due to their rich nutritional profile, which includes high protein content, omega-3 fatty acids, and essential vitamins and minerals, these fish are considered an important dietary source and are consumed in various global cuisines. Additionally, they serve as a crucial source of fishmeal and fish oil used in the aquaculture and agricultural industries. In conclusion, sardines and pilchards are vital members of the Clupeidae family, a diverse group of small, oily fish that hold tremendous ecological and economic significance. This family encompasses numerous subfamilies, genera, and species, with members serving as essential links in marine food chains and contributing to the overall health of aquatic ecosystems. Sardines and pilchards provide vital nutritional benefits to humans and serve as crucial sources of fishmeal and fish oil for various industries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While the description \\"A man with glasses standing wearing a suit and bowtie holding a piece of paper\\" might make one think of an agent, especially in the context of movies and television, it is not enough information to conclude that he is indeed an agent. An agent can be understood as someone who represents another person or organization and is authorized to perform actions on their behalf. Agents can be found in various professions and settings, such as real estate, talent representation, law enforcement, or intelligence agencies. In the given description, several elements might be associated with agents, specifically intelligence or law enforcement agents, such as the suit, bowtie, and glasses. These elements might be part of a \\"typical\\" representation of an agent in popular culture. However, these elements are also common in various other professions and social situations. For instance, the man described could be: 1. A businessman: Wearing glasses, a suit, and a bowtie might be standard attire for many businessmen, especially in formal settings. The paper in his hand could be a report or a presentation he is about to give. 2. A professor or academic: People in academia, like professors or researchers, may wear glasses and suits in certain situations. The paper might be a research study or a lecture manuscript. 3. A lawyer: Lawyers routinely wear suits and, if they need vision correction, glasses. The piece of paper in his hand could represent a legal document or contract. 4. An event attendee: The man could be attending a formal event or party where suit and bowtie attire is required. The piece of paper might be his invitation or a program provided by the event organizers. 5. A performer or public speaker: Some performers or public speakers wear a suit and bowtie while giving presentations or performances. The paper may be containing their speech notes or information regarding their performance.

Answer based on context: Blanche of Navarre, however, proved to be an incredibly strong and efficient regent, and had devoted herself for the past 15 years to ensuring the legal status of her son Theobald IV as rightful heir. Blanche was aided in securing her powerbase during the first few shakey years of her regency by the fact that so many lords and knights of the county, who might have posed a challenge to her, had left to fight on the Fourth Crusade from 1202 to 1204. Queen Mother Adèle of Champagne also took Blanche under her wing, giving Blanche vital counsel during the early years of her regency until Adèle's death in 1206 . By 1216, despite the fact that Erard rallied most of the local barons of the county against Blanche, she had built up such strong alliances with both King Philip II as well as Pope Innocent III that Erard never gained any official legal support for his claims. From the start of the conflict, Pope Innocent III began excommunicating rebel barons, negatively affecting their efforts. Further, while Theobald IV was still an underaged youth of 13 years, he had acquitted himself so valiantly in combat at the decisive Battle of Bouvines that King Philip II threw his full support behind him . Who was the mother of Theobald IV","completion":"The mother of Theobald IV was Blanche of Navarre.

Matthew Mugg, an Irish fishmonger, meets his young friend Tom Stubbins, as Matt wheels his fish barrow around the wharf collecting fresh seafood for his customers. Matthew rescues an injured duck from a fisherman who intends to eat it for his dinner. As soon as Matthew finishes his rounds, he tells Tom they will take the duck to John Dolittle, the greatest animal doctor in the world. Matthew explains that Dolittle talks to the animals to determine what ails them. To explain further, Matthew sings \\"My Friend the Doctor.\\" During the song Tom accompanies Matthew as he makes his deliveries to his customers. By the time the song ends, they have arrived at Dolittle's house. When a chimpanzee and a parrot answer the door, Matthew introduces Chee-Chee and Polynesia to Tom. After the introductions, they go into the library where Dr. Dolittle is trying to converse with some goldfish. He explains to Matthew and Tom that he is attempting to gather information about the legendary Great Pink Sea Snail. He soon plans to embark on a voyage to find the creature. Tom takes the duck out of his coat where he has been keeping it safe and hands it to the doctor. After a few quacks back and forth, Dolittle is certain that the drake has had a row with his wife. The doctor invites Tom and Matthew to dinner and instructs Polynesia, the parrot, to prepare for two more guests.

If you build a campfire, you start with a large stack of sticks and logs. As the fire burns, the stack slowly shrinks. By the end of the evening, all that is left is a small pile of ashes. What happened to the matter that you started with? Was it destroyed by the flames? It may seem that way. What do you think happened? The truth is that the same amount of matter still exists. The wood changed not only to ashes, but also to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. The gases floated off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Although matter was changed, it was not created or destroyed. Because the same amount of matter still exists, we can say that matter is conserved.

It includes three regions: Highland Karabakh (historical Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh), Lowland Karabakh (the southern Kura-steppes), and a part of Syunik. - Armenia ( tr. \\"Hayastan\\"), officially the Republic of Armenia (tr. \\"Hayastani Hanrapetutyun\\"), is a sovereign state in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. Located in Western Asia on the \\"Armenian Highlands\\", it is bordered by Turkey to the west, Russia and Georgia to the north and Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to the south. - Azerbaijan, officially the Republic of Azerbaijan, is a country in the South Caucasus region, situated at the crossroads of Southwest Asia and Southeastern Europe. It is bounded by the Caspian Sea to the east, Russia to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia to the west and Iran to the south. The exclave of Nakhchivan is bounded by Armenia to the north and east, Iran to the south and west, while having an 8 km border with Turkey in the north west. - Nagorno-Karabakh, officially the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR; \\"Lernayin Gharabaghi Hanrapetut'yun\\"), Artsakh Republic or Republic of Artsakh (\\"Arts'akhi Hanrapetut'yun\\"), is an unrecognised republic in the South Caucasus. The region is considered by the UN to be part of Azerbaijan, but is under the control of ethnic Armenian separatists. The NKR controls most of the territory of the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast and some of the surrounding area, giving it a border with Armenia to the west, Iran to the south, and the uncontested territory of Azerbaijan to the north and east. - The Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (\\"Lernayin arabai Inknavar Marz, LIM\\") was an autonomous oblast within the borders of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, mostly inhabited by ethnic Armenians. According to Robert Service, in 1921 Joseph Stalin, then acting Commissar of Nationalities for the Soviet Union, included Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic and Karabakh under Azerbaijani control to try to placate Turkey to join the Soviet Union. Had Turkey not been an issue, Stalin would probably have left Karabakh under Armenian control. As a result, the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast was established with the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic on July 7, 1923. According to Karl R. DeRouen it was created as an enclave so that a narrow strip of land would separate it from Armenia proper. According to Audrey L. Altstadt, the borders of the \\"oblast\\" were drawn to include Armenian villages and to exclude as much as possible Azerbaijani villages, so that the resulting area was sure to have an Armenian majority. - Arkadi Ghukasyan ( Armenian : , born 22 June 1957 ) was the third President of the self - proclaimed Nagorno - Karabakh Republic . He was elected as the President on 8 September 1997 and re-elected in 2002 , until his term ended on 19 July 2007 and was succeeded by Bako Sahakyan .

It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center. - The Caucasus or Caucasia is a region at the border of Europe and Asia, situated between the Black and the Caspian seas. What is the relationship between 'arkadi ghukasyan' and 'armenians'? Answer:","completion":"Arkadi Ghukasyan is an important figure in the Armenian community, particularly for the ethnic Armenians in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Born in Stepanakert, in the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Republic of the Azerbaijan SSR, he grew up among Armenians and went on to hold influential positions in the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR), which is predominantly inhabited by ethnic Armenians. Ghukasyan, who graduated from the Yerevan State University with a degree in linguistics, initially started his career in the field of journalism, working as a correspondent for the \\"Soviet Karabagh\\" newspaper. Eventually, he became the Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the paper. His involvement in the media allowed him to connect with the Armenian community and represent their interests in the media sphere. In 1991, Ghukasyan was elected to the first Parliament of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, marking the beginning of his political career. He took on important roles and responsibilities within the NKR, including being appointed Political Adviser to the Chairman of the State Defense Committee, heading the NKR delegations during OSCE negotiations with Azerbaijan, and becoming a member of Nagorno-Karabakh's Security Council. On July 23, 1993, Ghukasyan assumed the position of the first Foreign Minister of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. As Foreign Minister and later the President of the NKR, he played a crucial role in representing the voice and interests of the ethnic Armenians living in the region. His leadership and tenure in these positions demonstrated his commitment to the Armenian cause and the establishment of the unrecognised republic, which is considered by the United Nations to be part of Azerbaijan. Arkadi Ghukasyan was elected as the third President of the NKR on September 8, 1997, and re-elected in 2002, serving until July 19, 2007, when he was succeeded by Bako Sahakyan. During his presidency, Ghukasyan faced significant challenges, including an assassination attempt in 2000, which he survived. The alleged orchestrator of the attack was Samvel Babayan, the former defense minister, who was later convicted and sentenced to 14 years in prison. In conclusion, the relationship between Arkadi Ghukasyan and Armenians is deeply rooted in his personal background and his political career, which has largely focused on advocating for and representing the interests of the ethnic Armenians, particularly those living in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. His positions as Foreign Minister and President of the NKR showcase his dedication and commitment to the Armenian cause, making him an essential figure in the Armenian community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The premise states that Toni Morrison's Paradise continues to divide critics. This means that there is an ongoing divide among critics regarding the novel. 2. The hypothesis says that critics are divided on Toni Morrison's Paradise. This statement agrees with the premise, as it refers to the same division among critics regarding the novel. 3. Comparing the premise and the hypothesis, one can notice that they convey the same information. The only difference is that the premise specifies that the divide is ongoing, while the hypothesis does not explicitly mention this. However, the division among critics in the hypothesis implicitly suggests an ongoing situation. Based on these steps, the premise entails the hypothesis. Therefore, the answer is a). yes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

American traveler Stacey Addison says she was detained for months in East Timor because she unwittingly shared a taxi with a stranger carrying methamphetamine. Now she's out of jail -- and a guest of a former East Timor leader. Addison, 41, of Oregon, was released from an East Timor prison Thursday, nearly four months after her initial arrest in the small Southeast Asian nation in a drug case in which she says she's innocent. Addison appeared before reporters Thursday at the home of former East Timorese President and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jose Ramos-Horta, who says he'll host her temporarily at his home. \\"Of course we are now hoping that her passport will be returned and she will be able to return home to OPTIONS: - Addison very soon. - American very soon. - East Timor very soon. - East Timorese very soon. - Jose Ramos-Horta very soon. - Nobel Peace Prize very soon. - Oregon very soon. - Southeast Asian very soon. - Stacey Addison very soon. - United States very soon.","completion":"\\"Oregon very soon.\\" The paragraph is discussing the plight of Stacey Addison, an American traveler who was detained in East Timor and is currently staying with former East Timorese President, Jose Ramos-Horta. The last cue hints towards her return, so logically we could conclude that she should return home. As it's mentioned earlier in the paragraph that she is from Oregon, the correct next line should be \\"Oregon very soon\\" signifying that they are hoping for her soon return to her home in Oregon. The incorrect options: - \\"Addison very soon\\" and \\"Stacey Addison very soon\\" don't make sense because the sentence is about her possible return to a certain place, not to herself. - \\"American very soon\\", \\"United States very soon\\" could possibly be correct, but since a more specific location within the US (Oregon) is mentioned earlier in the paragraph, it is the best fit. - \\"Jose Ramos-Horta very soon\\", the sentence is about Addison's return, not Jose Ramos-Horta. - \\"East Timor very soon\\", Addison just got out of prison in East Timor, she wouldn't be returning there. - \\"East Timorese very soon\\" refers to a nationality not a location, so this doesn't fit the context. - \\"Nobel Peace Prize very soon\\", this is not a location and does not fit the context. - \\"Southeast Asian very soon\\" it's not a specific location and it's the region from where she's trying to leave."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the title of this article: Seal script, which had evolved slowly in the state of Qin during the Eastern Zhou dynasty, became standardized and adopted as the formal script for all of China in the Qin dynasty (leading to a popular misconception that it was invented at that time), and was still widely used for decorative engraving and seals (name chops, or signets) in the Han dynasty period. However, despite the Qin script standardization, more than one script remained in use at the time. For example, a little-known, rectilinear and roughly executed kind of common (vulgar) writing had for centuries coexisted with the more formal seal script in the Qin state, and the popularity of this vulgar writing grew as the use of writing itself became more widespread. By the Warring States period, an immature form of clerical script called \\"early clerical\\" or \\"proto-clerical\\" had already developed in the state of Qin based upon this vulgar writing, and with influence from seal script as well. The coexistence of the three scripts – small seal, vulgar and proto-clerical, with the latter evolving gradually in the Qin to early Han dynasties into clerical script – runs counter to the traditional belief that the Qin dynasty had one script only, and that clerical script was suddenly invented in the early Han dynasty from the small seal script.

Meet the guy who, to date, has visited 11,733 locations of the mega coffee chain. According to his website, Starbucks Everywhere, Winter (yep, that’s his name) has, since 1997, “been on a personal mission to drink coffee from every (company-operated) Starbucks in the world.” (If you’ve got four minutes to burn, you can watch what happens when he hits store number 10,000 here.) Despite his dedication to the drink, he’s not the type to kick back on his couch with a cup of joe. “I have only once made coffee at home — I enjoy the social aspect of actually visiting a coffeehouse,” he says. He’s spent about 100,000 attempting to reach his goal, and his travels have taken him as far as Asia and the Middle East. One way he’s managed to fund it? Getting rid of his permanent residence. “For the last three years I have lived out of my car, and the 10,000 to 15,000 in rent savings has allowed me more discretionary income to both save, fund my travels, and donate to charity,” he tells PEOPLE. But the real question is, besides the social aspects, what motivated him to embark on this kind of challenge? “My original motivation was simply to accomplish something singularly unique. However, since that time, I have discovered many joys in the traveling, the photography, and the puzzle-like challenge of my mission,” he writes on his web site.

The first part of the film follows the actions of former Colonel and current Sergeant \\"Nicotine\\" Crockett (Alan van Sprang). In the opening scene, Colonel Crockett, after a failed raid of sorts that ends in the deaths and reanimation of several fellow National Guardsmen and his getting demoted to Sergeant, deserts his post with fellow soldiers Kenny (Eric Woolfe), Francisco (Stefano Colacitti) and Tomboy (Athena Karkanis). The four fugitive soldiers go on where they rob the protagonists of the previous film (see 'Diary of the Dead').Meanwhile, off the coast of Delaware lies Plum Island, home to two Irish-American feuding families - the O'Flynns and the Muldoons. The former family, lead by Patrick O'Flynn (Kenneth Welsh), rounds up a posse and kills the undead of the island, learning that the Muldoons, led by Seamus Muldoon (Richard Fitzpatrick) are keeping their undead loved ones \\"alive\\" until a cure is found. A brief standoff ends with the Muldoons exiling Patrick and several other O'Flynns, under the suggestion of Patrick's daughter Janet (Kathleen Munroe).Three weeks later. The four National Guard deserters find themselves joined by a young teenager known only as Boy (Devon Bostick) after an encounter with some fellow zombie-killers whom the four rouge soldiers are forced to kill when the hunters attempt to kill them as well. Crockett and his group steal an abandoned armored truck nearby and decide to drive north to Canada. Through Boy and an Internet connection they learn of Plum Island - a video that was recorded by Patrick O'Flynn. They head to a nearby dock off the deserted interstate highway as instructed, and a gunfight starts between the O'Flynns bunkered down in a fishing shop and Crockett's group. Francisco jumps off the pier and swims out to a large ferry steamer, successfully commandeers the unmanned ship for the group.

Gary Mulholland of The Observer considers the release of Is This It a \\"world-changing moment\\" and notes that its impact was \\"immediate and dramatic\\" on both music and attire. BBC Radio 1's Zane Lowe suggests that the album moved popular opinion from DJs and pop music to \\"skinny jeans and guitars\\", \\"the template for rock 'n' roll in the modern day\\". Tam Gunn of FACT agrees and explains that it \\"caused a sea change\\" in mainstream music in the US and the UK, while Anthony Miccio of Stylus points out that the Strokes' success created the commercial context for \\"other new-wavers\\" to flourish. Rolling Stone writes that Is This It inspired \\"a ragged revolt\\" in Britain, led by the Libertines and Arctic Monkeys, and continued its influence in the US on the success of bands like Kings of Leon. The Observer shares a similar view and concludes that \\"a fine brood of heirs\\", like the Libertines and Franz Ferdinand, would not have existed and been successful if the Strokes had not reinvigorated \\"rock's obsession with having a good time\\". Jared Followill of Kings of Leon notes that the album was one of the main reasons that he wanted to get into a band; he states, \\"The title track was one of the first basslines I learned ... I was just 15 at the time.\\"Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald argues that, although Is This It provided substantial musical influence, its biggest success was in revamping the music industry and making A&R delegates scout and promote alternative bands. Gunn links the success of alternative music in British charts throughout the 2000s to the album, but notes that \\"the copyists\\" could never match the attention to detail and heartfelt emotion of the Strokes. Mulholland adds that even the pop stars of that decade who rediscovered disco, electro, and synthpop owe a debt to the record, because its commercial success \\"made every forgotten art-pop experiment of the late 70s and early 80s instantly hip and ripe for reinvention\\".

Syria has four chemical weapons facilities that it did not previously disclose to the United Nations, a Western diplomat told CNN on Tuesday. The diplomat said Sigrid Kaag, the U.N. special envoy overseeing the destruction of Syria's chemical stockpiles, briefed the U.N. Security Council. Three of the sites are research and development facilities and one is a production facility, according to the source. Syria disclosed the information during ongoing meetings between the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and Syrian authorities, Kaag told the council members, according to the source. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power tweeted shortly after: \\"Must keep pressure on regime so it doesn't hide (chemical weapons) capability.\\" In August 2013, U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters that a team of experts had gathered to go to Syria to investigate reports of chemical weapons. In September 2013, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon released the inspectors' report, which says there was \\"clear and convincing evidence\\" that sarin, a nerve agent developed for chemical warfare, was used in a Damascus attack. Later that month, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution requiring Syria to eliminate its chemical weapons arsenal, and President Bashar al-Assad promised to adhere to the resolution. The following month, Syria began dismantling its chemical weapons program. In July, 600 metric tons of chemical weapons from Syria were transferred to a U.S. ship for destruction in what marked the demise of the last of the country's declared chemical weapons stockpiles. At the time, officials said it was a major milestone. But inspectors have said they couldn't say for sure whether some undeclared weapons were still lurking somewhere in the country. And in August, there were new allegations of chlorine attacks, officials said. After inspectors' findings were detailed in Tuesday's closed-door Security Council briefing, diplomats took to Twitter with statements that echoed accusations aimed at the Syrian government a year ago. \\"Witnesses of chlorine gas attacks described them as carried out by helicopters, which only Syrian regime has. All fingers point to Assad,\\" Power said. \\"Connect the dots: @OPCW sure chlorine used in #Syria, witnesses saw it dropped by helicopters, which only Assad has. Who's responsible? #UNSC,\\" the Lithuanian mission to the United Nations, a current member of the Security Council, tweeted. The Syrian mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to CNN. Asked about the revelation of additional Syrian chemical weapons facilities, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki pointed to a recent statement from Secretary of State John Kerry, which said the United States was \\"gravely concerned\\" about the recent reports of chlorine attacks in Syria. \\"This finding, coupled with deep concerns regarding the accuracy and completeness of Syria's declaration to the (Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons), raises especially troubling concerns that continued chemical attacks on the Syrian people by the regime could occur,\\" Kerry said last month.

Burton reprised the role of Kunta Kinte in the 1988 television film Roots: The Gift.

Write a summary based on this article:  Republican City Councilman Kevin Faulconer won a decisive victory over Democratic Councilman David Alvarez in the San Diego mayor’s race Tuesday, signaling a new chapter for the city after the scandal-plagued tenure of former Mayor Bob Filner. Faulconer had 54.5 percent compared to Alvarez’s 45.5 percent of the vote with all precincts reporting. A Faulconer victory breathes new life into the local Republican Party by restoring its control of the Mayor’s Office that its candidates have occupied for much of the past four decades. Faulconer also becomes the only Republican mayor of a top 10 U.S. city, making him one of the party’s highest-profile leaders in the state. The results dashed the hopes of Alvarez to become San Diego’s first Latino mayor and its youngest in nearly 120 years. It also blunted a push by Democrats to have a like-minded mayor join the party’s 5-4 majority on the City Council to shepherd a new era of progressive politics for America’s Finest City. The runoff election will fill the vacancy left by Democrat Bob Filner’s Aug. 30 resignation stemming from a sexual harassment scandal. Faulconer will finish the remaining 33 months on Filner’s term and be up for re-election in 2016.

Alvarez later told U-T San Diego that the issues confronting the city won’t change, regardless of the election results. “We still have a lot of work ahead regardless of the outcome,” he said. “I look forward to that as mayor or as a member of the council.” He later said on Twitter that he called Faulconer and conceded the election. “I want to congratulate Kevin Faulconer. It’s clear that he will be the next mayor of San Diego. I look forward to working with him,” he wrote. Faulconer responded to Alvarez via Twitter: \\"Thank you for a respectful campaign. As mayor, I look forward to working with you to move our city forward.\\" Conventional wisdom held that Faulconer would have a lead among the mail ballots collected before Election Day, but the 13-point edge he held at 8 p.m. when those results were released was much larger than most pundits expected. An early advantage for Faulconer was anticipated because Republican-leaning voters have historically been consistent and reliable voters in most elections, especially in special ones. ||||| SAN DIEGO -- Republican Councilman Kevin Faulconer defeated Democratic Councilman David Alvarez, 54.5% to 45.5%, to become the city's next mayor, according to unofficial results tallied by the county registrar of voters. The tally includes all absentee votes and votes from all 582 precincts. Unofficial turnout for the special election was 37%. Alvarez, 33, said he called Faulconer to offer his congratulations and say that he looks forward to working with the new mayor. If elected, Alvarez would have been the youngest and first Latino mayor in modern San Diego history. Faulconer, a former public relations executive before entering politics, promised that he and Alvarez will work together \\"to move our city forward.\\" Acting Mayor Todd Gloria, a Democrat who endorsed Alvarez, praised the Alvarez campaign: \\"Son of a janitor and fast-food worker; his story is proof that anything is possible in San Diego.\\" Faulconer, 47, told cheering supporters Tuesday night that he \\"can't wait to be the next mayor of this fabulous and great city.\\" He also allowed himself a not-so-veiled reference to the now-passed era of ex-Mayor Bob Filner, who resigned Aug. 31 after months of a chaotic management style at City Hall followed by multiple accusations of sexual harassment. \\"This city has gone through a lot in the last year, but we knew that as San Diegans we were better than that,\\" Faulconer said. Faulconer is to be sworn in March 3 to serve the final 33 months of Filner's term. Filner, 71, was the city's first Democratic mayor in two decades. He is now serving a 90-day home-confinement sentence after pleading guilty to three charges of mistreating women.

With all precincts reporting, Faulconer received 54.5% of the votes, while Alvarez got 45.5%. This victory restores the local Republican Party's control of the Mayor's Office that its candidates have occupied for much of the past four decades. Faulconer will become the only Republican mayor of a top 10 U.S. city, placing him among the party's highest-profile leaders in the state. The results dashed Alvarez's hopes of becoming San Diego’s first Latino mayor and its youngest in nearly 120 years. Faulconer will complete the remaining 33 months of Filner's term and will be up for re-election in 2016."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Today, he is seeing two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A is infected with HIV, but patient B is not infected with HIV. Mike is trying to figure out how HIV-infected patient is different from the patient who is not infected with HIV. But I can use this background: As time passes, the number of HIV copies keeps increasing, while the number of helper T cells keeps decreasing. The graph in Figure below shows how the number of T cells typically declines over a period of many years following the initial HIV infection. As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections. Medicines can slow down the virus but not get rid of it, so there is no cure at present for HIV infections or AIDS.

Prot translates for the dog, eats, learns about Dr. Powell's family problems, and plays with the children until the sprinkler turns on and he freaks out.Prot exhibits considerable influence over the other patients at the Institute, each of whom believes unquestioningly that he is indeed from K-PAX. Prot has explained that he can take one person with him when he returns; thereafter most of the patients at the institute ask to be taken to K-PAX.Upon learning that many of his patients expect to leave Earth on July 27, Dr. Powell confronts Prot, who explains that it is a predetermined date. However, Powell believes this to be a significant date in Prot's life, a day on which he suffered a severe psychological trauma.

Ministers are being urged to take ‘urgent action’ after cancer patients in Scotland were given access to another drug not available in England and Wales. Axitinib, aimed at kidney cancer patients who have stopped responding to other treatments, is to be given the green light north of the border after it was shown to significantly extend life. The drug – which costs £3,000 a month – could potentially help 6,000 sufferers a year, but has so far been deemed not cost effective by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) for use on the NHS in England and Wales. The body is currently considering an appeal against its decision. Price of life: At a cost of £3,000 a month Axitimib is expensive but it has been shown to prolong life in cancer sufferers who have stopped responding to other treatments. Experts have expressed dismay at the latest example of ‘health apartheid’ between patients north and south of the border. The decision of the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) to give the go-ahead for the drug in Scotland means taxpayers in England and Wales will have to contribute to the funding of the drug north of the border, but not benefit from it. Critics of NICE say it is judging drugs using criteria from the last century and said the case for a fundamental overhaul was now overwhelming. This year alone, the body has given only one positive recommendation for a new cancer medicine for NHS use, from the 12 ‘single technology’ appraisals on which it has made final or preliminary decisions. At the Conservative Party’s annual conference last month, David Cameron was forced to announce a two year extension to the £200million a year Cancer Drugs Fund – an emergency fund which funds treatments denied by NICE. But there are growing calls for more sweeping reforms. Professor Tom Powles, a consultant oncologist at Barts Health NHS Trust in London, said: ‘Whilst the SMC decision is good news for patients in Scotland, it’s important that all patients across the UK have routine access to innovative treatments. There is a clear need for kidney cancer treatments and it’s therefore very important that patients can have access to treatment options at all stages of the disease.’ Jonathan Emms, the UK Managing Director of Pfizer, which manufactures Axitinib, said: ‘Government needs to play its part in fixing age-old problems to ensure that innovative new medicines are used by the NHS and get to the patients that need them. ‘By continuing to focus on medicines as a cost not an investment, Government will not solve these issues. Instead it sends a clear message that innovation is not valued in the UK and it is not prepared to invest in life-saving and life-changing discoveries. Outdated: Critics of NICE say it is judging drugs using criteria from the last century and said the case for a fundamental overhaul was now overwhelming. ‘Decisions like today’s, where a vital cancer medicine is denied to patients in England and Wales by NICE, but at the same time approved for Scottish patients, further highlights the fundamental problems. We cannot allow this to become the norm. ‘The Prime Minister must take urgent action. A new pro-innovation mandate for NICE is needed to get patients the new medicines they need and prove that the UK is open for business.’ Ben Osborn, the firm’s oncology business unit head, added: ‘Whilst we welcome this decision for patients in Scotland, yet again we find ourselves in a situation where two health bodies, which have assessed similar information, reach an entirely different conclusion on the value of a medicine.’ Axitinib, which is marketed under the tradename Inlyta, is designed to treat adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma after failure of prior treatment with other drugs - sunitinib or a cytokine. One trial suggested it extended life by two months on average, with some patients surviving significantly longer. Patients in England will have to appeal to the Cancer Drugs Fund, though funding is not guaranteed. Patients in Wales have no access to any second line advanced treatment for kidney cancer and have to prove ‘exceptional circumstances’ in order to even be considered. Public Health England has warned that more people are being diagnosed with and dying from kidney cancer in England today, compared to ten years ago. Around 30 per cent currently present with late stage disease. Kidney cancer is the eighth most common cancer in the UK, with an estimated 3,850 people dying from the disease each year. Andrew Dillon, chief executive of NICE, said: ‘Axitinib is currently being looked at for NICE by an independent appraisal committee. Earlier this year a draft decision to say no to Axitinib was appealed and the drug is being considered again. ‘Decisions on which drugs to approve are often finely balanced. Health services have to be confident that the extra benefit to patients justifies the price. If we are not sure, we have to say so, in the interests of all those of us who expect the NHS to apply its resources equitably across all of the demands we make of it. ‘NICE is, quite properly, scrutinised closely on its decisions and the methods we use to arrive at them. 'We regularly review our methods to ensure they are consistent with the ambitions set for the NHS and we are currently considering ways to make sure that we take full account of the impact of the severity of different diseases and conditions, together with the wider benefits to society of new treatments. 'We have always relied on feedback to draft the very best processes and guidance. We have asked patients’ groups, industry and our other stakeholders to help us develop this new value assessment approach. Drugs, especially those for cancer, which extend life for terminally ill people, have been given special weight by NICE since January 2009.’ What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

The Speck brothers are stopped by Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), a German dentist-turned-bounty hunter from DÃ¼sseldorf, who asks to buy one of the slaves.

This being Friday , and with a hurricane spooling up in the Atlantic , there was a line of about four or five people waiting to use the machine , but I had no trouble finding a place to park . As I waited in line , a large Chevy Suburban pulled up to the curb and parked in the driveway . A woman got out and got in line , leaving the behemoth in the driveway in spite of the large NO PARKING sign right next to it . Why does the forthcoming hurricane lead many people to want to use the ATM ?","completion":"The forthcoming hurricane leads many people to want to use the ATM for several reasons. When a natural disaster such as a hurricane is approaching, it disrupts normal routines and creates a heightened sense of urgency in the community. This prompts people to take several precautionary measures, and one of them is ensuring they have enough cash on hand. Here are some reasons why: 1. Loss of power: There is a high possibility of power outages during and after a hurricane. With no electricity, electronic payment methods, such as credit and debit cards, cannot be processed. ATMs might also become inoperable during the storm or its aftermath. Therefore, individuals prefer to have sufficient cash in advance to make essential purchases without relying on electronic transactions. 2. Limited access to banks and ATM machines: As a hurricane approaches or passes, local banks might close temporarily in order to protect their infrastructure and personnel. In addition, wide-spread flooding and damage might render some ATMs inaccessible or non-operational. With uncertainties about the availability of banking services, people prefer to withdraw a reasonable amount of cash before the storm hits to ensure they have necessary resources to carry on. 3. Emergency supplies and essentials: Knowing a hurricane is on its way, individuals and families often stock up on essential items, such as food, water, fuel, batteries, and other supplies. Anticipating a potential increase in demand, they might find themselves competing with others for limited resources. Cash transactions are generally faster, and having cash on hand could prove beneficial in such situations. 4. Evacuation or displacement: If the hurricane poses a significant threat to their homes and belongings, people may choose to (or be ordered to) evacuate to safer locations. Having cash readily available eases the process of finding temporary accommodation, transportation, and other necessities, especially if electronic transactions are not possible. 5. Helping others and making donations: In the aftermath of a hurricane, many people find themselves in need of assistance or relief. In such situations, having cash on hand allows individuals to provide immediate help to others in need or make donations to relief organizations and community efforts. In conclusion, the approach of a hurricane leads many people to want to use the ATM as a proactive measure. It is essential to have enough cash on hand to weather potential disruptions to daily life, sustain themselves and their families, and provide support to others in their community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You can add corned beef to sandwiches, casseroles and eggs for a delicious meal. Here are five tips to making the heartiest, yummiest corned beef: Corned beef is traditionally made using brisket, which is taken from the cow’s front breast section. Since the cow usually exercises these parts, the precooked cuts are relatively lean. When possible, try to buy fresh meat directly from a butcher, instead of pre-packaged cuts. If you do have to use packaged meat, keep an eye out for a high grade. To select a good cut, first make sure the meat has a deep red color. Avoid graying meat, as that likely means the cut has been refrigerated for too long. You should also look out for a nice layer of fat over the meat. Note that the meat will shrink as you cook, so pick up generous portions. Brisket usually comes in point cuts or flat cuts. Point cuts are rounder and have more marbling, which means you can get more flavor and juiciness from the fat. The leaner flat cuts are easier to slice uniformly. Choose the cut that best fits your needs. While point cuts may be tastier, well-cooked flat cuts offer a great deal of flavor. Leftover flat cuts are usually better for making sandwiches, since the lean meat slices and dices so cleanly. The less tender cuts of meat require slow, moist cooking to achieve their full potential. Excessively high heat will only make your meat tough, so make sure to simmer slowly. Your cooking time will depend on the amount of meat you are preparing. A good time gauge is approximately 50 minutes for every pound of beef, but you should keep an eye on it and simply stop when the meat is nice and tender. Cooking too long can cause the meat to fall apart, which is worse for sandwiches. To be on the safe side, U.S. Food and Safety Inspection recommends cooking raw corned beef to a minimum of 145 degrees Fahrenheit. In short, give yourself a lot of time, since the simmering process can take as long as 5 hours. Munch on a lot of snacks, as the anticipation of cooking corned beef will definitely whet your appetite. Don’t be shy about spice Corned beef often comes with a packet of spices, but you may want to start from scratch. You can pick up a pickling spice blend from the grocery store or make one up from your own spice rack. Common corned beef spices include peppercorn, bay leaves, allspice, cinnamon, ginger, coriander, cloves, nutmeg and mustard seed. You can also throw in some fresh garlic for added flavor. If you have purchased packaged corned beef brisket, the beef may already be seasoned. Cook a small piece to find out whether you still need to add spices. If you are looking for that extra kick, a glass of beer might do the trick. The beer will soak in and infuse your meat with flavor while adding moisture. Opt for an Irish stout beer, but be aware that stronger varieties can be bitter. As a complement to the beer flavor, season your corned beef with brown sugar. Once your meal is ready, you can easily pair the corned beef dish with your beer for a sublime St. Patrick’s Day (or any day) dinner. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"To make the perfect corned beef, choose a high-quality cut of meat with a deep red color and a nice layer of fat, and opt for a point cut or flat cut depending on your desired outcome.

Q: SEOUL — In addition to growing concerns that North Korea will pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S., prospects for improved inter-Korean relations have also stalled, as Pyongyang demands that U.S.-South Korea joint military drills be scaled back, and a group of defectors be returned. Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program.

Summarize this article: × Infant’s death at unlicensed Fairfield daycare now ruled a homicide FAIRFIELD — The death of an infant at an unlicensed Fairfield daycare center in March has been ruled a homicide, police say. Deputy Police Chief Chris Lyddy confirmed that the 4-month old Shelton boy, who was found dead on March 22, died due to toxic levels of over-the-counter drugs in his system. The infant was first thought to have succumbed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), but extensive postmortem testing conducted over the months that followed revealed otherwise. Medical inspectors working the case told Fairfield detectives in July that the baby had extremely high levels of diphenhydramine, or Benadryl, in his blood. Now, police are investigating how the infant could have ingested such a heavy dose. To do so, they will need to determine whether the homicide was committed intentionally or accidentally due to negligence. Police have not made any arrests or pressed any charges on employees who manage the daycare. In addition to the death investigation, Fairfield Police said they will be pursuing criminal infractions against the makeshift daycare for operating out of a private home without a license. Diphenhydramine, most commonly known as Benadryl, is an antihistamine meant to treat moderate to severe cold symptoms in adults. The FDA warns against administering the medication to infants under two-years-old without a doctor’s supervision, due to increased risk of overdosing. For more information on the hazards of giving cough and cold medicine to infants, read this FDA disclaimer. ||||| Death of 4-Month-Old Baby at Connecticut Daycare Caused by High Levels of Benadryl: Police Toxicology tests on a 4-month-old boy whose March 22 death at an unlicensed home daycare in Connecticut was ruled a homicide show he died from high levels of Benadryl in his system, police say.\\"It's a parent's worst nightmare and our hearts are broken for the parents of this young child,\\" Fairfield Police Chief Gary MacNamara tells PEOPLE. \\"We have an obligation to the parents to do a thorough investigation and determine who is responsible for this.\\"Since the death of Adam Seagull, the home-based daycare has been shuttered by state officials, according to MacNamara, who says the child wasn't sick at the time of his death and his body showed no signs of trauma.MacNamara tells PEOPLE that while no charges have been filed yet, someone at some point will be held accountable for Adam's death.\\"The consumption of the medication wasn't accidental,\\" says MacNamara. \\"This baby was 4-months-old. Someone administered Benadryl to this child. I am not saying there was intent to kill the baby, but as a result of that Benadryl, this child died. We are working to determine who, when and why this baby was given these meds.\\"MacNamara says Adam's death should serve as a cautionary tale for parents.\\"This daycare center had been operating without the proper licensing,\\" the chief says. \\"Without that licensing, there are no checks and balances. Without the proper training, you can't ensure a child's safety.\\" ||||| Shelton infant’s death being investigated as a homicide by Fairfield Police FAIRFIELD - What was originally believed to be a case of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome is now being investigated as a homicide. The infant, Adam Gregory Vasaturo Seagull, was called \\"little prince,\\" \\"tootie muffin,\\" and \\"little man\\" by his family. “His infectious smile brought immediate joy to everyone who had the privilege of experiencing it,” his obituary read. “As he would look at you with his beautiful brown eyes, your heart became bigger and fuller with love.” Deputy Police Chief Chris Lyddy confirmed Saturday the death of the 4-month old Shelton boy in March at an unlicensed home day care has been ruled a homicide. According to the state medical examiner, toxicology reports showed high levels of Benadryl in the infant’s system. “The investigator is being extremely diligent and to date, we have not been able to rule out anybody,” Lyddy said. The unlicensed day care was run by Carol Cardillo at her home at 63 Edgewood Road and had been in operation for 11 years, Lyddy said. A lawyer representing Adam’s parents, Matthew and Michelle, confirmed that the family is aware that the case is being investigated as a homicide. The lawyer, along with Adam’s grandfather, Lewis Seagull, said that they were not ready to comment on the development in the case. The police announcement comes just days after the death of Stamford 2-month-old girl was also ruled a homicide. That child was rushed to the hospital from an East Side day care facility with severe head trauma. Neighbors of Cardillo, the woman who ran the day care where Adam was found dead on March 22, were surprised to learn that the case was being investigated as a homicide. Dimitri Gregorio, 19, was away at college in March when Adam died but heard the news through text messages from his mother, including images of first responders lining the normally quiet and uncluttered Edgewood Road. He has watched children coming to and from for years. “The family is very nice, the mother, the grandmother—they’re very nice,” he said. Cardillo did not return requests for comment by phone and at her home. A relative confirmed that she still resides there. “She was so sad,” said Cliff, a neighbor of Cardill’s who asked that his last name not be used, of Cardillo’s reaction after the accident. “(Intentional wrongdoing) is last thing that I would expect; it’s a wonderful family.” Police were called to the home March 22 just after 3 p.m., when Cardillo dialed 911 to report an unresponsive infant. According to Lyddy, Deputy Police Chief, Cardillo told police the baby had been given a bottle around noon and then put down in a play crib for a nap. When she went to check on the baby around 2:55 p.m., she could not wake him up. There were seven other children being cared for at the time, five toddlers and two other infants. There were four adults in the home at the time, according to the report. “The baby had not been sick, and there were no signs of trauma,” Lyddy said, which led to the belief that SIDS was the cause of death. However, due to the fact that the death was untimely, the infant’s body was sent to the state medical examiner’s office for an autopsy. The autopsy concluded the baby died from acute diphenhydramine intoxication. Lyddy said Cardillo has denied administering Benadryl to the baby. The day care center has been closed since the incident, and any charges regarding the operation of an unlicensed day care center would likely come from state authorities, Lyddy said. As for criminal charges in the baby’s death, Lyddy said, “It is very much an active investigation.” He said it is possible that it could be determined the Benadryl overdose was accidental, “but certainly, negligence would be a factor in administering a lethal dose of anything to an infant” and could still result in criminal charges. “It’s very important that parents check into day care facilities,” Lyddy said. “There are several ways to check if a center is licensed. The easiest is call 211, and you would be provided with a list of licensed day care facilities in your area.” He said parents should also check to make sure a facility has the proper child to staff ratio and that caregivers are properly trained in first aid, including CPR. ||||| Summary:","completion":"The death of a four-month-old baby at an unlicensed daycare center in Fairfield, Connecticut has been ruled a homicide after toxic levels of over-the-counter drugs were found in his system.

Article: People in South Korea who feel they can no longer bear the stress of everyday life now can choose to stay in a prison to relax and think deeply. In a society where pressure to do well in school and find highly-paid jobs is intense, a former lawyer came up with an extreme relaxation idea. Kwon Yong-seok created the \\"Prison Inside Me\\"--a stress-reduction center with a punishment theme. People come here to cut themselves off from the outside world and pay to be kept in 60-square-foot (5.6-square-meter) cells . Located on the outskirts of Hongcheon, about 58 miles (93 km) northeast of Seoul, \\"Prison Inside Me\\" came to life after Mr. Kwon voluntarily asked to spend time behind bars for \\"healing reasons,\\" but his request was turned down. \\"I didn't know how to stop working back then,\\" he said. \\"I felt like I was being swept away against my will, and it seemed I couldn't control my own life.\\" So, Kwon and his wife Roh Ji-hyang decided to take matters into their own hands, and designed and built a prison-like spiritual center. The construction was completed in June last year and cost about 2 billion won (19 million). The facility includes 28 cells, furnished with only a toilet, a sink and a small table, where guests can spend time alone, thinking about life and enjoying private thinking periods. Moreover, guests can also join group thinking periods in the hall, where they are given instructions on how to free themselves from what Mr. Kwon calls the \\"inner prison\\" to find inner peace. According to the Wall Street Journal, hundreds of stressed South Koreans are checking in at the stress-reduction facility to think about their lives and regain control of it. A two-night stay at \\"Prison Inside Me\\" costs 150,000 won (146). Mr. Kwon and his wife explained that at the beginning they had a different plan for the \\"relaxation center,\\" and imagined a longer stay for their guests, but, given that people weren't able to take more time off, they had to reduce the length of stays to just two days.

Context: Increased potassium intake has been shown to lower blood pressure (BP) even in the presence of high sodium consumption however the role of dietary potassium on vascular function has received less attention. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between habitual intake of sodium (Na) and potassium (K) and measures of arterial stiffness and wave reflection.', 'Thirty-six young healthy adults (21 M, 15 F; 24 ± 0.6 yrs; systolic BP 117 ± 2; diastolic BP 63 ± 1 mmHg) recorded their dietary intake for 3 days and collected their urine for 24 hours on the 3rd day. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) and the synthesis of a central aortic pressure waveform (by radial artery applanation tonometry and generalized transfer function) were performed. Aortic augmentation index (AI), an index of wave reflection, was calculated from the aortic pressure waveform.', 'Subjects consumed an average of 2244 kcals, 3763 mg Na, and 2876 mg of K. Average urinary K excretion was 67 ± 5.3 mmol/24 hr, Na excretion was 157 ± 11 mmol/24 hr and the average Na/K excretion ratio was 2.7 ± 0.2. An inverse relationship between AI and K excretion was found (r =u2009-0.323; p < 0.05). A positive relationship between AI and the Na/K excretion ratio was seen (r = 0.318; p < 0.05) while no relationship was noted with Na excretion alone (r = 0.071; p > 0.05). Reflection magnitude, the ratio of reflected and forward waves, was significantly associated with the Na/K excretion ratio (r = 0.365; p <0.05) but not Na or K alone. PWV did not correlate with Na or the Na/K excretion ratio (p > 0.05) but showed an inverse relationship with K excretion (r =u2009-0.308; p < 0.05). Answer: These data suggest that lower potassium intakes are associated with greater wave reflection and stiffer arteries in young healthy adults.

Hot land surfaces will show up as dark-grey or black. One disadvantage of infrared imagery is that low cloud such as stratus or fog can be a similar temperature to the surrounding land or sea surface and does not show up. However, using the difference in brightness of the IR4 channel (10.3–11.5 µm) and the near-infrared channel (1.58–1.64 µm), low cloud can be distinguished, producing a fog satellite picture. The main advantage of infrared is that images can be produced at night, allowing a continuous sequence of weather to be studied. What is the answer to this question: Along with Cirrus, what types of clouds are cold and high?","completion":"Along with Cirrus clouds, Cumulonimbus clouds are also cold and high. Both of these cloud types form in the upper levels of the troposphere and consist of ice particles due to the low temperatures at those altitudes. Cirrus clouds are characterized by their thin, wispy appearance and can sometimes indicate an approaching weather system, while Cumulonimbus clouds are large, towering clouds associated with thunderstorms and severe weather."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

But have you ever thought about what they mean to your eyes? According to a study, half of the British people own smartphones and they spend an average ( ) of two hours a day using them. There has been a 35% increase in the number of people in the U.K who suffer from short-sightedness since smartphones were introduced there in 1997. Staring at smartphones for a long time gives you dry eyes. When looking at something in the distance, your eyes automatically blink a certain number of times. However, when you look at the things closer to your face, the blink slows down. This reduces the amount of tears and causes discomfort in your eyes. Another bad habit is using smartphone in dark rooms before going to sleep. If you look at a bright screen while your pupils become larger, too much light goes into your eyes. This can be bad for your eyes and causes a disease called glaucoma . Maybe it is possible for you to stop using your smartphone, but there are a few things you can do to protect your eyes. * Hold your phone at least 30 centimeters away from your eyes when using it. *Take a break every hour and try the following: look at something at least 5 meters away from you and then focus on your nose.

To begin with, the decade started off with the ongoing Recession of 1969–70. Following that, the 1970s energy crisis ensued which included the 1973–75 recession, the 1973 oil crisis as well as the 1979 energy crisis beginning as a prelude to a disastrous economic climate injected with stagflation; the combination between high unemployment and high inflation. However, on November 14, 1972, the average closed above the 1,000 mark (1,003.16) for the first time, during a brief relief rally in the midst of a lengthy bear market. Between January 1973 and December 1974, the average lost 48% of its value in what became known as the 1973–1974 stock market crash; with the situation being exacerbated by the events surrounding the Yom Kippur War. The index closed at 577.60, on December 4, 1974. During 1976, the index went above 1000 several times, and it closed the year at 1,004.75. Although the Vietnam War ended in 1975, new tensions arose towards Iran surrounding the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Other notable disturbances such as the Lebanese Civil War, the Ethiopian Civil War, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 and the Angolan Civil War which the U.S. and Soviet Union considered critical to the global balance of power, seemed to have had little influence towards the financial markets.

HBO’s “The Jinx” has been all over the news for concluding with an apparent murder confession by its subject, Manhattan real estate scion Robert Durst. But that’s just the most extreme example. Less splashy films such as “Marwencol” (2010) and “The Overnighters” (2014) pulled revelatory, last-act rabbits out of the hat as well. In most cases the twists are all the more impressive because not even the filmmakers (presumably) saw them coming. Such a reversal jolts “An Honest Liar,” Justin Weinstein and Tyler Measom’s freewheeling and beguiling documentary about master illusionist and disillusionist James “The Amazing” Randi. Now 86, the white-bearded, fast talking, gnomic Randi first fell under the spell of magic when as a boy in Toronto he watched Harry Blackstone levitate a woman onstage. He couldn’t figure out how Blackstone did it, but he wanted to do the same. At the age of 17, in a move that would lack all credibility in a fictional narrative, Randi ran away from home and joined a carnival. Thereafter, Randi’s life played much like a history of TV talk shows. In a montage of clips, he’s seen dazzling hoary hosts such as Mike Douglas, Merv Griffin, and amateur magician Johnny Carson with his tricks, many of which are masochistic improvements on escape stunts by Houdini. At times it seems as though the film is becoming a chronology of Carson’s different suit jackets and ties. But at the age of 55, after Randi nearly died while locked inside a milk can filled with water, he called it quits. “There comes a time,” he explained, “when you don’t want to see a little old guy come out of a can.” Then began his career of disillusionment. As one of his admirers and fellow magicians relates, in a Faustian moment early in his career Randi found himself swarmed by desperate people who saw him as a seer and offered him money to reassure them about their future. More tempting than the money was the feeling of power that comes with such grandiose deception. But Randi rejected the temptation, and became — again, like Houdini — a debunker of phony faith healers, charlatans and, repeatedly, Uri Geller. But it takes one to show one. Randi employed deceits of varying complexity to unmask the deceivers, some with unexpected consequences. He promoted his young partner Jose Alvarez as a mystic who could channel “Carlos,” a prophetic, 35,000-year-old spirit. Carlos became an overnight superstar until Randi exposed the believers’ credulousness by uncovering the man behind the curtain. But the repercussions of the well-intended fraud would haunt him in his old age. It would violate a taboo to relate how this movie magic, masterfully orchestrated by Weinstein and Measom, is done. Their film is as smooth as Randi’s patter and demonstrates how the documentarian’s camera is quicker than the eye.

A federal judge, a congressional aide and four others were killed and 12 other people suffered wounds. U.S. District Judge Larry Burns sentenced Loughner to serve the rest of his life in prison without the possibility of parole. The punishment includes seven consecutive life terms plus 140 years. \\"The evidence clearly shows that he knew what he was doing, despite his mental illness,\\" the judge said. Loughner, 24, spoke just once, confirming to the judge that he would make no statement before sentencing. \\"That is true,\\" he said. Giffords shooting survivors seek federal help in tightening gun laws Beside the dramatic appearance by Giffords and her husband, nine other victims spoke at the sentencing hearing held in a packed federal courtroom in Tuscon. Kelly, in an interview Thursday evening with CNN's Piers Morgan, said hearing what they had to say \\"was really a tough thing\\" for Giffords. \\"Gabby said afterwards, for her the biggest emotion was just sadness,\\" Kelly said. \\"To hear story after story of what the impact of this horrible day had on people was really difficult.\\" Answer the following questions: 1.

These two questions are not paraphrases of each other as they address completely different topics. I'll provide detailed answers for both questions below. 1) Learning to dance: Starting to learn how to dance can be an exciting and rewarding endeavor. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you begin: Step 1: Choose a dance style First, decide which dance style you want to learn. Some popular choices include salsa, hip-hop, ballet, ballroom, swing, and breakdancing. Make sure to pick something you feel passionate about, as this will make your learning journey enjoyable and keep you motivated. Step 2: Do your research Research about the dance style you have selected. Read articles and watch videos to understand its history, variations, techniques, and performances. This knowledge will help you appreciate the dance more and provide context for your learning. Step 3: Find a dance class or teacher Look for local dance classes or instructors who specialize in your chosen dance style. Joining a class will provide structure and guidance in your learning journey. If you prefer one-on-one attention, you may want to consider taking private lessons. Step 4: Set realistic goals Before starting your dance lessons, set clear and realistic goals for yourself. This will help keep you motivated and on track. Make sure your goals are specific, measurable, and time-bound. For example, you could aim to master a particular dance move within a certain number of weeks. Step 5: Practice consistently Like any skill, practice is crucial for improvement in dancing. Make time for regular practice sessions, even outside of your designated class time. This will help build muscle memory, increase endurance, and improve overall technique. Step 6: Monitor your progress Keep track of your progress as you move through your dance journey. Analyze your performances and identify specific areas you need to improve on. This will help you tailor your practice sessions better and highlight areas of achievement. Step 7: Stay positive and be patient Learning to dance takes time and dedication. It's essential to stay positive and be patient with yourself as you progress. Understand that setbacks and frustrations are common, and your determination to overcome them will ultimately make you a better dancer. 2) Adding your face to Mini Militia: Mini Militia is a popular mobile game that allows players to customize their avatars. Unfortunately, the game does not natively support adding your face to the avatar. However, you can still achieve this by using an external editing technique. Here are the steps: Step 1: Download an image editing software Choose an image editing software that offers layering and editing options, such as Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, or Paint.NET. Download and install the chosen software on your computer. Step 2: Acquire your Mini Militia avatar image Open the Mini Militia game and take a screenshot of your game avatar on a plain background. You can find the avatar under \\"Settings > Avatar.\\" Step 3: Get a high-quality image of your face Take a clear picture of your face with good lighting and minimal shadows. Ideally, the photo should be taken against a neutral background to make editing easier. Step 4: Edit the images In your image editing software, open both the Mini Militia avatar screenshot and your face photo. Use the software's selection tools to cut out your face from your photo. Make sure to remove any background present in the selection. Step 5: Combine the images Copy your selected face image and paste it as a new layer onto the Mini Militia avatar image. Resize and position the face accordingly to appropriately fit it on the avatar. Once you are satisfied with the placement, merge the layers. Step 6: Save and share Save the edited image in a suitable format (e.g., JPEG or PNG). You can now share this custom avatar with your friends or on social media. Keep in mind, though, that this edited image will not display as your avatar in the game itself; it is just for sharing and personal use."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Title: Plastic is best Review: Our grandson had two erector type sets to have fun with at Christmas.

Process: - Gases cause pressure beneath the earth - The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface - The magma cools - With enough time the pressure builds up greatly - The resulting volcano may explode. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is a great deal of underground activity happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER eruptions. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis, in the context of volcanic activity, suggests that an increase in underground activity may affect the frequency and intensity of smaller eruptions. This could be due to changes in the processes governing magma movement and the release of volcanic gases, which can subsequently impact the pressure dynamics within the Earth's crust. When there is a great deal of underground activity, such as increased seismic activity, movement of magma chambers, or the release of volcanic gases, this can lead to several potential consequences for the eruption process: 1. Increased pressure: The greater activity might cause an increase in pressure beneath the Earth's surface as more gases, such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide, are released and accumulate in the subsurface. This increase in pressure could cause more frequent, smaller eruptions; the pressure would be released more often through these events, preventing the build-up of pressure that can lead to larger, more explosive eruptions. 2. Changes in magma viscosity: Underground activity could also change the properties of magma, such as its viscosity (i.e., its resistance to flow). Seismic waves and the release of gases can cause the magma's temperature and composition to change, affecting its viscosity. Thinner, less-viscous magma may result in more frequent, smaller eruptions, as it can rise to the surface more easily. Conversely, thicker, more-viscous magma may be more prone to causing larger eruptions because it takes longer to reach the surface and can cause more intense pressure build-up. 3. Altered pathways of magma: Increased underground activity may alter the subterranean pathways through which magma travels to the surface. This can lead to changes in the locations and intensities of eruptions. For example, new fractures or faults in the crust may open up, allowing magma to reach the surface more easily, potentially causing more frequent, smaller eruptions. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that increased underground activity can have direct and indirect effects on the volcanic eruption process. This activity may lead to more frequent, smaller eruptions due to changes in pressure dynamics, magma properties, and the pathways through which magma travels to the surface. However, the specific consequences of the perturbation will depend on various factors, such as the type of underground activity, the properties of the magma, and the geology of the given region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I read this background article the other day: Air pollution is harmful to human beings and other living things. About 22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can also harm the environment. I am facing a new situation today: Michael and Thomas are brothers whose careers have taken them to different cities. Michael lives in Beijing, where the levels of air pollution are fairly high due to the extensive manufacturing industry. Thomas, on the other hand, lives in Seattle, which has low levels of air pollution thanks to government initiatives and culture attitudes in the region. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who has a higher risk of developing lung cancer? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Michael has a higher risk of developing lung cancer.

The term \\"Great Plains\\", for the region west of about the 96th or 98th meridian and east of the Rocky Mountains, was not generally used before the early 20th century. Nevin Fenneman's 1916 study, Physiographic Subdivision of the United States, brought the term Great Plains into more widespread usage. Before that the region was almost invariably called the High Plains, in contrast to the lower Prairie Plains of the Midwestern states. Today the term \\"High Plains\\" is used for a subregion of the Great Plains. Much of the Great Plains became open range, or rangeland where cattle roamed free, hosting ranching operations where anyone was theoretically free to run cattle. In the spring and fall, ranchers held roundups where their cowboys branded new calves, treated animals and sorted the cattle for sale. Such ranching began in Texas and gradually moved northward.

Article: Speakers of different languages not only describe the world differently but think about it differently too, according to a new study. Researchers used a cartoon cat Sylvester to study how language was reflected in the gestures people made. Dr. Sotaro Kita of the University of Bristol's Department of Experimental Psychology , showed the cartoon to a group of native English, Japanese and Turkish speakers and then watched their gestures as they described the actions they had seen. He found speakers of the three different languages used different gestures to describe the same event, which appeared to reflect the way the structure of their languages expressed that event. For example, when describing a scene where the cat swings on a rope, the English speakers used gestures showing an arc trajectory and the Japanese and Turkish speakers tended to use straight gestures showing the motion but not the arc. Dr. Kita suggests this is because Japanese and Turkish have no proper verb to express the English meaning \\"to swing\\". While English speakers use the arc gesture as their language can readily express the change of location and the arc-shaped trajectory, Japanese and Turkish speakers cannot as easily express the idea of movement with an arc trajectory so they use the straight gesture. Dr. Kita said, \\"My research suggests that speakers of different languages cause different spatial images of the same event in a way that matches the expressive possibilities of their own languages. In other words, language influences spatial thinking at the moment of speaking.\\" Question: 70.What is mainly discussed in the text? - Differences between languages. - Differences between gestures. - How people use different gestures to express the same event. - That language influences the way people think.

Using a study involving native English, Japanese, and Turkish speakers watching a cartoon and describing the scenes through gestures, Dr. Sotaro Kita discovered that each group used different gestures to depict the same event. This difference in gestural representation was found to mirror the way their respective languages expressed that event. For instance, English speakers used arc gestures to describe the swinging motion of a cat on a rope since English has a specific verb for \\"to swing\\" which is suggestive of an arc trajectory. In contrast, Japanese and Turkish speakers used straight gestures as their languages lack a specific verb equivalent to \\"to swing\\", meaning they could not as easily express a movement with an arc trajectory. Therefore, Dr. Kita concluded that the language one speaks influences their spatial thinking and how they represent and perceive events, exhibiting how people use different gestures to express the same event due to the differences between their languages."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The outrage against the bullying tactics of the Emergency Fleet Corporation spread to other unions. Please remove spaces between words.","completion":"TheoutragetowardsthebullyingtacticsoftheEmergencyFleetCorporationspreadtootherunions. The outrage against the bullying tactics of the Emergency Fleet Corporation can be traced back to the early 20th century when the United States was facing a rapidly changing global landscape. Due to the growth of the shipping industry and international commerce, shipping companies found themselves facing a major challenge: how to maintain an efficient, robust fleet of vessels capable of meeting the country's growing maritime requirements. As the shipping industry strived for improved performance and profitability, a significant change in corporate culture permeated various maritime companies, eventually transforming the industry's perception of labor and unions. The Emergency Fleet Corporation (EFC), a key player in this new, aggressive corporate landscape, became notorious for its ruthless approach to managing labor disputes and undermining the power of unions. EFC aimed to control the shipbuilding industry and employed various bullying tactics to suppress the efforts of workers and unions seeking fair working conditions and wages. As tensions between unions and the EFC grew, the heavy-handed tactics implemented by the management of the Emergency Fleet Corporation resulted in widespread outrage among labor unions; not only within the shipping industry, but also amongst other associated unions. One such example of a bullying tactic was the EFC's utilization of a system known as \\"double-breasting\\" or having a separate \\"union\\" and \\"non-union\\" workforce within the same company. This practice allowed the EFC to exploit workers, deny collective bargaining power, and cause rifts between unionized and non-unionized workers. The conflict arising from this tactic led to a domino effect: other unions began aligning themselves with affected shipping industry workers, reinforcing solidarity and reinforcing their collective power. Additionally, the EFC's aggressive approach towards labor disputes inspired the adoption of various controversial methods, such as the use of strikebreakers or \\"scabs\\"; workers hired to replace striking workers, typically at a lower wage. This further exacerbated tensions, as it was seen as a direct assault on the principles of labor rights and the importance of collective bargaining. Furthermore, it was not uncommon for EFC management to engage in extensive, and often illegal, surveillance of union activities. This might involve infiltrating union meetings with informants or engaging in other forms of espionage. This invasive and controlling approach led to a lack of trust between employees and the EFC, further galvanizing resistance. As outrage against the Emergency Fleet Corporation's tactics spread, a ripple effect occurred, with other unions recognizing the potential damage that the EFC's actions could have on their own bargaining power and ability to protect their members. This recognition led to increased inter-union solidarity, as a growing number of labor organizations began coordinating their efforts in fighting against these oppressive measures. Ultimately, the spread of outrage against the Emergency Fleet Corporation's bullying tactics to other unions within and beyond the shipping industry served as a catalyst for collective action and unity amongst diverse labor organizations. This alliance allowed for increased efficiency and effectiveness of strikes, boycotts, and other demonstrations aimed at securing fair working conditions and wages. Over time, this unified resistance achieved significant milestones in the struggle for workers' rights, serving as a testament to the power of solidarity and collective action against oppressive corporate practices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The management of Rockefeller Center shifted around this time. In November 1936, John Todd was featured in two New Yorker articles that emphasized his role in the complex's construction. At the same time, Nelson was gaining clout within Rockefeller Center Inc., and he disagreed with nearly all of Todd's suggestions. Nelson's father, John, was relinquishing his responsibilities, since the Rockefeller family's youngest son David had moved out of the family home at 10 West 54th Street, and John was now focusing on his own personal life. By April 1937, Todd regretted his decision to be featured in The New Yorker. In March 1938, Nelson became the president of Rockefeller Center Inc. He then fired Todd as the complex's manager and appointed Hugh Robertson in his place. Nelson and Robertson wanted to avoid workers' strikes, which would delay the completion of construction. Nelson, Robertson, and the workers' unions agreed to a contract in which the unions would not strike, Robertson would not lock out union workers, and both would agree to arbitration if a labor dispute arose.

With the baby sleeping in their tent, the family is enjoying a barbecue with their fellow campers when a cry is heard. Lindy returns to the tent to check on Azaria and is certain she sees a dingo with something in its mouth running off as she approaches.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Process: - An enzyme in saliva begins to break down carbohydrates - Food is squeezed down the esophagus when you swallow - Acid and enzyme in the stomach break the food down - Releases nutrients - Food then pumped into small intestine - Fluid and enzymes from liver and pancreas pumped into small intestine - Help break food into smallest molecules - Nutrients pass through wall of small intestine - Nutrients absorbed into blood stream - Unused materials passed into large intestine to become fecal matter. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the stomach is not producing enough acid happens, how will it affect MORE food being digested. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis inquiry suggests an interference with the production of stomach acid. If the stomach does not manufacture sufficient levels of acid, it may have both direct and indirect impacts on the digestion process. Primarily, stomach acid, scientifically known as hydrochloric acid (HCl), plays an essential role in the digestion process. Its primary function is to aid in the breakdown of food, making it simpler for the body to absorb nutrients. For example, it helps in the digestion of proteins by activating enzymes responsible for their breakdown, such as pepsin. It also protects against microbes present in the food we eat and helps to neutralize enzymes to prevent injury to the stomach lining. If the stomach does not produce enough acid, it can lead to a condition known as hypochlorhydria, which can inhibit proper digestion. Notably, it can lead to inefficient digestion of proteins, causing them to pass into the small intestine in larger pieces than ideal. Consequently, this can lead to problems like malabsorption of nutrients and can indirectly affect the absorption efficiency of certain vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin B12, calcium, iron, and magnesium. Moreover, inadequate stomach acid can alter the pH balance in the digestive system. The stomach usually maintains a highly acidic environment. When under-acidic, the low pH level can inhibit the release of enzymes in the small intestine designed to further break down food particles. This scenario can affect the digestion process, as these enzymes need a specific and typically acidic environment to function correctly. Furthermore, low levels of stomach acid can hinder the release of other digestive enzymes from the pancreas and the gallbladder's bile into the small intestine. This lack of enzyme release hinders further digestion of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, disrupting their breakdown into smaller molecules, thus influencing further stages of digestion. This perturbation could slow down the digestive process as the body struggles to break down and absorb nutrients efficiently. Over time, this may lead to a variety of health issues, including nutritional deficiencies, complications due to undigested food, and chronic health issues. Therefore, the stomach producing insufficient acid directly affects the breakdown and absorption of food and nutrients, leading to a slower, less efficient digestive process. It can also indirectly affect the subsequent steps in digestion by modifying the digestive tract's hormonal signaling and the release of digestive enzymes. The body needs a balanced level of stomach acid to ensure it thoroughly breaks down food, absorbs nutrients efficiently, and maintains overall digestive health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The trip to Prague was frustrating for Sarah but not for Rachel because Options: (a). Sarah spoke the language there.. (b). Rachel spoke the language there..","completion":"(b). Rachel spoke the language there. While it was a serendipitous adventure for Rachel and Sarah, not knowing Czech proved to be a significant barrier for Sarah. Rachel, on the other hand, excelled at understanding and speaking the language, thanks to her semester in Prague during college. Upon arriving, Rachel took the lead, navigating the picturesque city streets with ease while Sarah struggled to decipher street signs and menus. As the days progressed, Sarah began feeling more like a burden than an exploratory companion. Step 1: Begin with their arrival in Prague, enhance the character's experiences. As their flight touched down in Prague, the excitement of exploring a new city was palpable for both Sarah and Rachel. While Rachel effortlessly conversed with locals, collected information about the best places to visit, and navigated public transportation, Sarah tried her best to participate but found herself feeling isolated and out of her element. Step 2: Incorporate an event that highlights the language barrier for Sarah. One evening, the girls decided to attend a traditional Czech marionette show. As Rachel enthusiastically chatted with the elderly puppeteer, Sarah found herself unable to participate in the conversation, silently watching in envy as her friend's eyes lit up in a moment of cultural exchange. This growing sense of isolation only heightened Sarah's frustration with the language barrier. Step 3: Explore the realization of the impact of the language barrier on their friendship and trip. As the trip progressed, it became evident that the barrier wasn't just linguistic - it was also driving a wedge between the friends. Rachel found herself having to mediate every interaction Sarah experienced, and the once-independent woman was forced to rely heavily on her friend. This dynamic made both of them uncomfortable, and the tension was palpable. Step 4: Introduce a turning point that initiates change and growth for the characters. One day, while sitting in a cozy cafe, a kind-hearted local woman heard Sarah's frustration and offered a helpful suggestion. She introduced Sarah to a language app that would help her learn to speak and understand Czech at a beginner's level. Sarah decided to give it a try, and over the next few days, began making efforts to communicate in the local language. Step 5: Show the growth and improvement in the friendship and overall trip experience. As Sarah's language skills improved, even if only slightly, the mood of the trip changed for the better. She felt empowered, as she was now able to engage in simple interactions and understand what was happening around her. Rachel was relieved to see her friend regaining her independence, and their camaraderie strengthened. Both friends began fully enjoying the beauty and intrigue of Prague, from the majestic castle and Charles Bridge to the quaint, cobblestone alleys of the Old Town. In the end, the trip to Prague started as a frustrating experience for Sarah but ultimately led to personal growth and a deepened friendship with Rachel, who was able to guide her through the language barrier and see her true spirit shine through adversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Process: - A person breathes in oxygen - The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs - The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream - Circulates through the body - The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide - The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs - The lungs expel the carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth. Question: suppose the bacteria is virulent happens, how will it affect a GREATER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"In the case of a virulent bacterial infection, the respiratory system's normal functioning may be affected, leading to a range of consequences on oxygen delivery to the bloodstream. Considering the process highlighted above, the perturbation can have various effects depending on the location and severity of the infection. 1. If the infection occurs in the bronchial tubes, it might lead to inflammation, narrowing, and blockage of the tubes, making it harder for oxygen to enter the lungs. The result would be a reduced amount of oxygen passing through the bronchial tubes and, ultimately, less oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. 2. For infections occurring within the lungs – such as pneumonia – the lungs' ability to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide can be severely compromised due to the accumulation of fluids, pus, and cellular debris within the lung tissues. As a consequence, oxygen transfer from the lungs to the bloodstream would be impaired, leading to less oxygen being delivered to the blood. 3. Furthermore, a virulent bacterial infection can cause systemic inflammation and impede circulation throughout the body. Increased cellular metabolism in response to the infection may also increase oxygen consumption, creating a higher demand for oxygen. This, combined with impaired oxygen delivery, may contribute to a decrease in the overall amount of oxygen delivered to the bloodstream. In conclusion, when considering the second effect mentioned in the process — the oxygen moving into the bloodstream — a virulent bacterial infection is likely to have a negative impact, leading to less oxygen being delivered to the blood. The extent of this effect will depend on the severity of the infection and the individual's immune response. Effective treatment and management of the infection are vital to restoring normal oxygen levels and preventing further complications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Switching off a 'fat' gene could prevent you from piling on the pound even if you stick to a high-fat diet, say researchers. A two-year study found that removing this gene in mice made them resistant to obesity. The animals showed unusual restraint when fed a high-calorie diet and were more active as well. 'When fed a diet that induces obesity. these mice don’t get fat,' said study author Professor James McManaman from the University of Colorado. 'It may be. possible to duplicate this in humans using existing technology that. targets this specific gene.' The absence of the gene may cause fat to be broken down faster by the body, he said. The research team created a strain of mice without the Plin2 gene, which humans also possess. It produces a protein that regulates fat storage and metabolism. They found their fat cells were 20 per cent smaller than typical mice and did not show the kind of inflammation usually associated with obesity. Obesity-associated fatty liver disease, common in obese humans and rodents alike, was absent in the mice without the Plin2 gene. 'The mice were healthier,' Prof McManaman said. Fat cells were 20 per cent smaller in mice without the Plin2 gene. 'They had lower triglyceride levels, they were more insulin-sensitive, they had no incidents of fatty liver disease and there was less inflammation in the fat cells.' The findings suggest switching off the Plin2 gene may lower the risk of heart disease (triglycerides are fatty molecules involved in the hardening of the arteries) and diabetes. 'It could mean that we have finally. discovered a way to disrupt obesity in humans. That would be a. major breakthrough,' Prof McManaman. The team next want to know how the gene alteration works physiologically and better understand how it affects food consumption. According to the study, understanding how Plin2 is involved in the control of energy balance will provide new insights into 'the mechanisms by which nutrition overload is detected, and how individuals adapt to, or fail to adapt to, dietary challenges.' The study, funded by the. National Institutes of Health was published in The Journal of Lipid Research. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"The key points of this article are: 1.

General Martin Dempsey says the hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment demonstrates that the military superiority enjoyed by the U.S does not necessarily carry over to the cyberworld. As chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Dempsey serves as President Barack Obama's chief military adviser. Dempsey was recently asked whether the U.S. was vulnerable to a 'Cyber Pearl Harbour.' He said such an attack could disable critical infrastructure and would be hugely disruptive. General Martin Dempsey says the hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment demonstrates the military superiority enjoyed by the U.S does not necessarily carry over to the cyberworld. Dempsey was recently asked whether the U.S. was vulnerable to a 'Cyber Pearl Harbour' and said that such an attack could disable critical infrastructure and would be incredibly disruptive. Dempsey said the U.S. has peer competitors in cyberwarfare and went as far as calling it a level playing field. That makes him very uncomfortable, Dempsey said. He did not go into detail about steps the U.S. could take to beef up its cyber defences. Dempsey's comments follow an attack on Sony pictures late last year by a North Korean hacking group calling themselves 'Guardians of Peace'. The hackers released a series of embarrassing emails, including correspondence between Sony Pictures co-chairwoman Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin, who referred to Angelina Jolie as 'a minimally talented spoiled brat'. Among correspondence released was emails between producer Scott Rudin, middle, and Sony Pictures co-chairman Amy Pascal; in the emails Rudin called Angelina Jolie 'a minimally talented spoiled brat' Parts of the script for the new James Bond film Spectre, which is due to be released in 2015, were also released by the hackers, as well as emails about the plot lines. The Sony letters were published ahead of the release of 'The Interview', a film which takes the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un as its subject matter. Several cinemas refused to show the film, which Sony first pulled but later made available on the internet. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

On the train was a young man with a big suitcase. He was called William Warbler, and he looked very common indeed. What made him most unusual, though, was the fact that whenever he needed to communicate he did it by singing opera . It didn't matter to William whether it was simply a matter of answering a brief greeting, like \\"good day\\". He would clear his voice and respond, \\"Gooood dayyy to youuuuuuuu... toooooo!\\" No one could get a normal spoken word out of him and no one knew how he made his living. As he lived quite simply, always wearing his same old second-hand suit, people often looked down on him.

Everyone in the capital went to see it, and it was a great success. Everyone in Cheekyville felt it was a surprise. But something more surprising was, when William was being interviewed by reporters, he answered their questions by speaking rather than singing. And he did it with great manners, and with a clear and pleasant voice. From that day, William gave up singing at all hours. Now he did it only during his stage appearances and world tours. Some people suspected why he had changed, but others continued believing him to be somewhat mad. They wouldn't have thought so if they had seen what William kept in his big suitcase. It was a large stone, with a hand-carved message on it. The message said: \\"Practice, my boy.

Question 2: What are your thoughts on AI and the recent deep learning trend? What do you think about the links between statistical physics and deep learning? (i). no (ii). yes Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Hi there! I'll try to explain this to you in a simple way. Question 1: A master's in bioinformatics is like being a superhero who fights diseases using computers! Bioinformatics uses a lot of computer stuff, math, and biology to understand living things. A PhD in AI or deep learning is like becoming a super-smart robot builder! You learn how to make computers and robots really smart and learn all by themselves. So, you learn some useful things in bioinformatics that can help in AI or deep learning, but it's not exactly the same thing. You might need to learn more robot-building skills to be really good at AI or deep learning. Question 2: AI and deep learning are really amazing things that lots of people are excited about. AI is like building smart robots, and deep learning is like teaching those robots to learn from examples, just like how you learn from watching and listening. Now, statistical physics is a way to understand how lots of tiny things (like atoms or particles) behave in groups. Some smart people think that deep learning and statistical physics could be connected because they both use similar math and ideas. It's like if you knew how to build a great sandcastle, you might have some good ideas for building a snowman too! Now about the two answers, (i) and (ii): (i) says \\"no,\\" which means the two answers wouldn't be the same. (ii) says \\"yes,\\" which means the two answers would be the same. So based on what we talked about: Question 1: A master's in bioinformatics could help you in a PhD in AI or deep learning, but you might need more skills. So, the answer is not exactly \\"yes\\" or \\"no.\\" Question 2: Many people are excited about AI, deep learning, and connections with other areas like statistical physics. In this case, the answer \\"no\\" (i) might be a better choice since the answers to the two questions are not exactly the same. But it's important to remember that things can be connected in many ways, just like the sandcastle and snowman!"},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

On June 1, 1922, in Helsinki, Finland and Soviet Russia signed an Agreement between RSFSR and Finland about the measures providing the inviolability of the Soviet-Finnish border. Both parties agreed to reduce the number of border guards and to keep those who do not reside permanently in the border zone from freely crossing the border from either side to the other. Towards the end of the uprising some 30 000 East Karelian refugees evacuated to Finland. The Karelian Worker's Commune was renamed into the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1923, and its autonomy was further expanded. However the cultural autonomy practically ended in 1933 - 1935 when the émigré Finnish leaders Edvard Gylling and Kustaa Rovio were purged and teaching of Finnish language was prohibited. Gylling had promoted the adoption of Finnish rather than Karelian within the KASSR as he and the other émigré Finns who dominated the leadership of Karelia prior to 1935 did not consider Karelian to be anything more than a rustic dialect of Finnish. It may also be argued they held the same view of the essential unity of the Karelians and Finns as one Finnic people as their nationalist counterparts, and also wished that they be unified .

Did you know that although peanuts look like nuts and taste like nuts, they aren't nuts at all? They belong to the pea family, so they are called peanuts. The peanut grows flowers above ground, but its \\"fruit\\" grows underground. It grows in more countries than most other \\"nuts\\". The peanut is a native South American plant. Scientists believe that it grew wild in Brazil long ago. They think that for several thousand years the early peoples of South America made it a part of their diet. These peoples were nomads who moved on when a natural food could no longer be found in one area. Along the way they probably let fall some peanuts, which got into the ground and grew. This is believed to be the way the plant reached the place where the Incas lived. The Incas, from about 1100 to 1532, thought highly of peanuts. The peanuts were eaten in several forms and used as sacrificial offerings to the Incan Sun God. Later in the 16thcentury, European soldiers had brought peanuts to other parts of the world, including North America, Africa, Asia, Europe, and Pacific Islands. Although peanuts were found native in South America, they are now grown in almost every country that has warm weather. India produces the most peanuts. China's production is next, followed by the United States. The peanut is special in more ways than one. It can be eaten raw, boiled, roasted, or fried. Hundreds of widely different products have been made from it. Carver, an American scientist, set himself the task of discovering new uses for eating and for many other products. Peanuts are very highly _ and are also high in protein . Americans use about seven-tenths of their protein in the form of meat. In India, where the poor can't pay for meat or milk, peanut meal and peanut milk have been produced. These have been a great help to the poor. New products are continually being made from peanuts, among them peanut cheese and a powder that becomes peanut butter when water is added. The fact is that peanuts are so healthy...

I joined a club recently where I met a true Indian. I asked him about the most vivid memory of his life. One morning, as he was heading towards his office, he realized that the road he regularly takes was unusually bumpy. Upon inspection, he came to the conclusion that a truck carrying stones passed by on that road and unintentionally scattered few stones along the way. He believed that the authority of the truck will take care of this later that day. Next morning, the road situation was unchanged with stones still scattered. He parked his vehicle nearby, put on some music and started kicking the stones off the road. Within a few minutes, a school bus stopped by, students gathered around and started clapping for this true Indian. As he turned around, he said “Helping hands are better than clapping hands”. As a repercussion, the students started helping this man kick the stones off the road. A task that would have taken hours to be done by one person was completed in a couple of minutes. What a great example of team work! It was this man’s discretionary efforts that brought a change in the thought process of the students, India’s next generation. We all point fingers and blame one another for societal problems but never act upon it. If this man, a true Indian, would have just blammed the truck driver and went on his way, would the road still be cleared? The next time we point fingers at someone for a social cause, we must keep in mind that that someone is an Indian just like us. Will a true Indian point fingers at an Indian?

Let's first simplify the left-hand side of the equation, meaning we should perform the calculations: -3078 + 6572 - 2988. - First, add -3078 and 6572, which equals to 3494. - Then subtract 2988 from that sum, 3494 - 2988 = 506. So, the simplified equation becomes 506 = 22*j. The next step is to solve for 'j'. This process involves isolating 'j' on one side of the equation, which we can do by dividing both sides of the equation by 22 (since j is being multiplied by 22 in the equation). So, divide 506 by 22 to solve for 'j': 506 ÷ 22 ≈ 23. So, the solution to the given equation is j ≈ 23."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the year 2000, Dick Harper has been promoted to Vice President of Communications for a large media corporation known as Globodyne. The following day, he is on a television program with presidential candidate Ralph Nader, who calls Globodyne \\"perverters of the American dream\\", claiming it helps the super-rich get even wealthier. As they speak, Globodyne's stock value collapses, rendering all investments – including all the employees' savings and pensions – worthless. Dick arrives home, where his wife Jane tells him that she quit her job as a travel agent following his promotion to spend more time with the family. Dick breaks the news of the company's failure over dinner. Despite his attempts, Dick is unable to find another job with comparable pay, and within a short time, the family faces bankruptcy. After accepting the prospect of being poor, Dick and Jane apply for low-paying jobs. Both are unable to keep them, and soon their utilities are cut off, forcing them to sell off personal property to stay afloat. When they are confronted with a 24-hour eviction notice, Dick decides to turn to a life of crime. After several failed robbery attempts, Dick and Jane successfully rob a head shop. They begin nightly robbing sprees and become more comfortable and professional over time. They soon steal enough money to pay off their debts including their house and car, both of which were about to be repossessed. For one last heist, Dick and Jane plan to rob a local bank.

A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What town could you take a tour of the Chalcedony Forest from? is inside the article: After the Southwest became part of the U.S., explorers continued to look for good east–west routes along the 35th parallel. In 1853, a crew led by U.S. Army Lieutenant Amiel Whipple surveyed along a sandy wash in the northern part of the Petrified Forest. So impressed was Whipple by the petrified wood along the banks of the arroyo that he named it Lithodendron Creek (Stone Tree Creek). Geologist Jules Marcou, a member of the Whipple expedition, observed that the petrified trees were from the Triassic.A slightly later route along the parallel was a wagon road, built between 1857 and 1860, that involved experimental use of camels as transport. In the late 19th century, settlers and private stagecoach companies followed similar east–west routes. Homesteaders who stayed in the area developed cattle ranches on the grasslands, and cattle grazed in the Petrified Forest until the mid-20th century.Also close to the 35th parallel was the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. Its opening in the early 1880s led to the founding of towns like Holbrook and Adamana. Visitors could stop at the Adamana train station, book a hotel room, and take a tour of what was then called the Chalcedony Forest. Over the years, the line changed hands, becoming the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, and then the BNSF. More than 60 BNSF trains, mostly carrying freight, pass through the park every day. U.S. Route 66, a former transcontinental auto highway developed in 1926 from part of the National Old Trails Road, ran parallel to the railroad tracks until it was decommissioned in 1985. The park has preserved within its boundaries a small grassy section of the road. Interstate 40, which crosses the park, replaced the older highway., can you guess it ?

Question: Which happened first, the United States declared independence or the decisive defeat at Yorktown? Context: During the 1760s and early 1770s, relations between the Thirteen Colonies and Britain became increasingly strained, primarily because of resentment of the British Parliament's attempts to govern and tax American colonists without their consent. This was summarised at the time by the slogan \\"No taxation without representation\\", a perceived violation of the guaranteed Rights of Englishmen. The American Revolution began with rejection of Parliamentary authority and moves towards self-government. In response Britain sent troops to reimpose direct rule, leading to the outbreak of war in 1775. The following year, in 1776, the United States declared independence. The entry of France to the war in 1778 tipped the military balance in the Americans' favour and after a decisive defeat at Yorktown in 1781, Britain began negotiating peace terms. American independence was acknowledged at the Peace of Paris in 1783. A:","completion":"The United States declared independence happened first, followed by the decisive defeat at Yorktown.

Plot title: Buried Movie plot: On October 23, 2006, Paul Conroy, an American civilian truck driver working in Iraq, wakes up and finds himself buried alive in a wooden coffin, bound and gagged, with only a Zippo lighter and a BlackBerry phone at hand. Although he initially has no idea how he got there, he starts to piece together what has happened to him. He remembers that his and several other trucks were ambushed by terrorists, who killed his colleagues; he was hit by a rock and passed out. He receives a call from his kidnapper, Jabir, demanding that he pay a ransom of 5 million by 9PM or he will be left in the coffin to die. Conroy calls the State Department, which tells him that due to the government policy of not negotiating with terrorists, it will not pay the ransom but will try to rescue him. They connect him with Dan Brenner, head of the Hostage Working Group, who tells Conroy they are doing their best to find him. His kidnapper calls Conroy and demands he make a ransom video, threatening to execute one of his colleagues who survived the attack. Conroy insists that no one will pay 5 million, so the kidnapper drops the amount to 1 million. Despite his compliance in making a video, the kidnappers execute his colleague and send him the recording of it, which he watches in horror. Shortly afterwards, distant explosions shake the area, damaging his coffin, which begins to slowly fill with sand. Conroy continues sporadic phone calls with Brenner, skeptical of the man's promises of help. To reaffirm his wholehearted intentions, Brenner tells Conroy about a 26-year-old named Mark White who was rescued from a similar situation three weeks previously, telling him that the kid is home with his family and happy. Later on, Conroy receives a phone call from his employers, who inform him that he was fired from his job due to an alleged prohibited relationship with a colleague (the one who was executed), and thus he and his family will not be entitled to any benefits or pension he earned during his time with the company.

Context: Juliette Murray was, like me, a kid at school who got 5 “A”s, which in the West of Scotland put a certain degree of pressure on one’s shoulders to study either medicine or law. I studied European Law, and became a teacher - that's what a European Law degree does to you. She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next. Murray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors. She set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other’s blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like? Starting with her local hospital, Wishaw General in NHS Lanarkshire, she set about overcoming what she describes as a “culture of obstacles”. Two years later, though, and students are indeed undertaking real life surgery work experience, experiencing a live operation theatre and seeing the pressure of the job first hand.

White was born Barry Eugene Carter in Galveston, Texas on September 12, 1944, and grew up in South Central Los Angeles. White was the older of two children. His brother Darryl was 13 months younger than Barry. He grew up listening to his mother's classical music collection and first took to the piano, emulating what he heard on the records. White wanted to work with another act but decided to work with a solo male artist. While working on a few demos for a male singer, he made three song demos of himself singing and playing, but Nunes heard them and insisted that he re-record and release them himself as a solo recording artist. After arguing for days about it, White was finally persuaded to release the songs himself, although he was initially reluctant to step out in front of the microphone. He then wrote several other songs and recorded them for what eventually became an entire album of music. He was going to use the name \\"White Heat,\\" but decided on using his given name instead. White was still hesitating up to the time the label copy was made. It eventually became White's first solo album, 1973's I've Got So Much to Give. It included the title track and his first solo chart hit, \\"I'm Gonna Love You Just a Little More Baby\\", which also rose to #1 on the Billboard R&B charts as well as #3 on the Billboard Pop charts in 1973 and stayed in the top 40 for many weeks.

The Foreign Office ;issued the new advice for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community in the wake of new legislation in North Carolina and Mississippi. Previously, the Foreign Office had only issued general advice for LGBT people to \\"take care abroad\\", but lacked specific information about the US. It follows the introduction last month of new legislation passed in North Carlina that allows businesses to “turn away” LGBT people on religious grounds. The state's bathroom law, which has been described as \\"anti-trans\\", says people must use the public toilet designated for the biological sex they were born with, rather than the gender they identify with. Virginia and Tenneesee have recently overturned a similar law. In Mississippi, critics have branded a bill passed three weeks ago that allows people to deny services to gay couples on religious grounds the most sweeping anti-LGBT legislation in the US. Supporters have said it will protect religious freedom, but others have condemned it as a free pass to discrimination. It is scheduled to become law on 1 July. The new Foreign Office advice states: “The US is an extremely diverse society and attitudes towards LGBT people differ hugely across the country. Laws vary from state to state. When you are physically present in a state, even temporarily, you are subject to that state’s laws. You must carry a passport showing that you have leave to enter or remain with you at all times. “LGBT travellers may be affected by legislations passed recently in the states of North Carolina and Mississippi.” “Before travelling please read our general travel advice for the LGBT community. \\"You can find more detail on LGBT issues in the US on the wesbite of the Human Rights Campaign.\\" I have signed House Bill 1523.

See Post @HRC 3 hours ago ||||| US president expected to warn that leaving the European Union would jeopardise special relationship with US Barack Obama is due to arrive in London on Thursday to enter the debate about Britain’s future in Europe, amid fresh warnings that leaving the European Union would jeopardise the special relationship with the United States. The US president and his wife Michelle will attend a celebratory lunch on Friday to mark the 90th birthday of the Queen, with whom they are said to enjoy a warm rapport, but the president is also expected to add his voice to those calling for Britain to remain in the EU. With polling suggesting the referendum result will be close, Downing Street has called on the support of a string of global policymakers, from the International Monetary Fund director general, Christine Lagarde, to New Zealand’s prime minister, John Key, to add weight to the remain case. But David Cameron and his allies hope Obama’s star quality will help to win over waverers. The prime minister told the House of Commons on Wednesday that while, “this decision is a decision for the British people and the British people alone... personally I believe we should listen to advice and I struggle to find the leader of any friendly country who thinks we should leave”. Nick Clegg, the former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister, on a visit to the US, said that leaving the EU would plunge Britain into a “new era of isolation”. Speaking at Princeton University, Clegg said: “Those campaigning for us to leave the European Union like to evoke a sentimental, nostalgic vision of Britannia, proud and independent, ruling the waves once again. But the truth is leaving cannot return us to a halcyon age – if such an age ever existed – and may even mean sacrificing the United Kingdom itself.” Pro-Brexit campaigners sometimes suggest Britain could strengthen transatlantic ties if its connection to the EU was severed, but Clegg insisted the two relationships were mutually reinforcing. “If we choose to remain, we will be voting for Britain’s continued leadership position in world affairs; for continued influence in Washington as much as in Brussels or Berlin; and for our reputation as a proud, outward-looking, internationalist power,” he said. Vote Leave chief executive Matthew Elliott hit back at the former deputy prime minister, saying: “Nick Clegg lied about tuition fees to get himself into government six years ago. He promised a referendum but then backtracked on it. He used to warn we’d disappear off the map if we didn’t join the euro. “Now he’s telling us it would be a disaster if we vote leave, along with his backers at Goldman Sachs. Voters will be in no mood to be lectured by a politician with more broken promises than there are Lib Dem MPs left in parliament.” But Clegg’s view was supported by Peter Westmacott, Britain’s ambassador to Washington until January, who writes in the Guardian that, “in America we are seen as more of a force for good, and a more potent ally, inside the EU than outside.” Barack Obama has a right to be heard on Europe. And Britain should listen | Peter Westmacott Read more He adds: “During my time in the US I have found no takers for the fantasy that we can somehow leave Europe and rejoin the world as America’s, or the old Commonwealth’s, best friend and ally.” Westmacott’s words echoed those of eight former US Treasury secretaries, who served presidents from Richard Nixon onwards, who wrote a letter to Wednesday’s Times warning that the special relationship would be under threat. Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary Larry Summers said Brexit would be “most isolationist deed in the last century”. Obama’s arrival as the referendum campaign is in full swing will be controversial, with former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith claiming earlier this week that he was only coming, “because the prime minister has gone on bended knee to him and said, ‘come over and help us bully the British people into making a decision’”. Cameron faces a tough task in reunifying his party once the referendum is over, with almost every day bringing one cabinet minister rubbishing the claims of the opposing camp. Michael Gove, the pro-Brexit justice secretary, used a speech on Tuesday to argue that warnings about the dire consequences of a vote to leave were, “a great, grotesque, patronising and preposterous Peter Mandelsonian conceit”. It is also ironic as the US president is said to have advised Cameron against holding a referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU according to David Laws, the former Liberal Democrat cabinet minister and author of a new history of the coalition. Laws said that Cameron told Clegg that he knew he was taking a risk with the referendum but was only staging one in order to keep Ukip at bay and retain party unity. Laws reveals that Clegg formed an alliance with the Americans, including the then US ambassador to London, Louis Susman, to try to persuade Cameron that his increasingly Eurosceptic stance was a profound strategic mistake based on short-term party management. Clegg advised Susman to persuade Obama to tell Cameron directly he was making a mistake, Laws claims. The ambassador told Clegg the US administration was worried that “you guys may soon not count in Europe any more”. In particular, Laws says Susman expressed his concerns that “David Cameron was not being listened to on Europe, and that the UK was no longer acting as a bridge to Europe for America”. Hilary Benn, the shadow foreign secretary, said: “The USA is a really important ally and one of our most important strategic and economic partners, so we should take what President Obama has to say seriously. The reason why the leave campaign are trying to attack him is because they fear what he might say about the UK’s place in the EU. The fact that there isn’t a single country wanting us to leave, apart probably from Russia, says a lot about the importance of membership to our future.” But some leftwing campaigners associate the White House with the controversial Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, known as TTIP, currently being negotiated with the EU, which they fear will strengthen the power of multinational corporations. Nick Dearden, of pressure group Global Justice Now, said: “There’s a huge contradiction in Obama coming to the UK to support the remain campaign, and Obama coming to Europe to promote TTIP, the toxic trade deal between the EU and the US. This massive corporate power grab being cooked up in Brussels is emblematic of what is wrong with Europe and is a big motivation for people to vote leave in June.” Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had hoped to meet the US president, but his team said on Wednesday evening no firm arrangement had yet been made. • This article was amended on 22 April 2016. An earlier version quoted Nick Dearden describing TTIP as “the toxic trade deal between the EU and the UK”. That was how the quote was supplied to us by Global Justice Now, but the organisation has since made clear that it should have said “the toxic trade deal between the EU and the US”. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"The UK Foreign Office has issued new advice for the LGBT community warning against travel to parts of the United States in the wake of anti-gay legislation in North Carolina and Mississippi, stating that LGBT travelers may be affected by the legislation.

When the band launches into an upbeat swing tune, Liz engages in an exotic dance that for better or for worse draws the attention of every person in the club. Mac finally asks the band to make an end and play something else, which is heeded to Liz's disappointment. Her lover escorts her from the premises and takes her to spend the rest of the night on a beach near the base.Morning breaks over the unnamed heavy cruiser commanded by Captain Rockwell 'Rock' Torrey (John Wayne), who is nonplussed to find that his executive officer, Liz's husband Paul Eddington (Kirk Douglas), has overslept reveille, the latest of a number of blemishes on his record that (along with his mounting alcoholism) can be laid to his unhappy marriage. He tells Eddington to 'fish or cut bait' and gives him one last chance to pull himself together. Eddington apologizes for his conduct, but is left wondering what Liz has gotten herself into in recent hours.In Pearl Harbor, Mac reports for duty as Officer of the Day on his destroyer, the U.S.S.

Its unique location offers stunning views of the Orkney Islands across the Pentland Firth. The castle dates back to the 16th century when it was built by the 4th Earl of Caithness, George Sinclair, as a fortress to protect the northern Scottish mainland. Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother came across the castle in a rather serendipitous manner. Following the death of her husband, King George VI, in 1952, the Queen Mother set out on a journey to the northernmost part of mainland Britain to lift her spirits and establish a personal connection with the country. During her journey, she stumbled upon the dilapidated and abandoned Castle of Mey. Seeing potential in the neglected fortress, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother decided to purchase the castle and oversee its extensive restoration. She worked closely with architects and local craftsmen to restore the Castle of Mey to its former glory, paying special attention to preserving its historical architecture. The castle then served as the Queen Mother's private holiday retreat for several weeks every year until her death in 2002. The Castle of Mey boasts remarkable architectural features, including its traditional Scottish tower house and a beautiful walled garden. The interiors hold an impressive collection of art, antiques, and cherished personal items that belonged to the Queen Mother. Visitors to the castle can also spot her favored race horse named \\"Meynell,\\" whose life-sized portrait adorns one of the rooms. Following the death of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, the castle was passed on to her grandson, Prince Charles. Today, the Castle of Mey is owned and operated by the Queen Elizabeth Castle of Mey Trust. The trust aims to preserve the castle's rich heritage, maintain its grounds, and open the castle to the public for visits during the summer months. In summary, the Castle of Mey in Caithness served as the personal retreat and cherished property of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother for five decades. Its significance in the history of the British royal family, combined with its architectural beauty and picturesque location, make the Castle of Mey a noteworthy destination for anyone visiting this region of Scotland."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield. I am facing a new situation today: Two farms used AM fungi for the plants. Brown farm also decided to grow cover crops on those parcels of land to help mycorrhizal growth.

Japan says its whaling programme is for scientific research - one of the exceptions in which whaling is allowed under international rules. But in 2014 the International Court of Justice (ICJ) said its Antarctic hunt was not scientific and should cease. Activists say the programme is inhumane and unsustainable. Japan insists it is trying to prove the whale population is large enough to justify a return to whaling for commercial purposes, and says it has to kills the mammals to carry out its research. In the 2014/2015 season Japan said it would respect the ICJ's decision and did not catch any whales in the Antarctic, although it did go ahead with a smaller hunt in the Pacific. Japan's Fisheries Agency said on Monday that it has taken into account the ICJ's ruling and this year aims to catch only 333 Antarctic minke whales - about one-third of previous targets. Several nations, including Australia, which brought the ICJ case against Japan, have voiced their dismay at the resumption of the hunts, as have environmental activists. \\"It's not scientific research, it's straight-up commercial whaling, and it's been declared illegal by the International Court of Justice,\\" Nathaniel Pelle from Greenpeace Australia told the AFP news agency. An 8,000 tonne ship - the Nisshin Maru - and three smaller harpoon ships departed from Shimonoseki in south-western Japan. Tomoaki Nakao, the mayor of Shimonoseki, was wholeheartedly behind the resumption. \\"There's nothing as happy as this day,\\" he said at a ceremony for the fleet's crew before they set sail. The hunt itself will run from late December until March next year, according to Japan's Fisheries Agency. The decision to resume was announced just days before Tuesday's sailing. The International Whaling Commission (IWC) that regulates the industry, agreed a pause - commonly now known as the moratorium - on whaling, to begin from the 1985/6 season. Japan agreed to the moratorium but has since continued whaling under the scientific research exemption. Some other whaling nations, for example Norway, continue having simply lodged formal objections to the moratorium. While indigenous groups that whale are permitted under an \\"Aboriginal subsistence\\" exemption.

The school is owned, though, by Delassalle's teacher wife, the frail Christina (Clouzot). Delassalle also has a relationship with Nicole Horner (Signoret), another teacher at the school. Rather than antagonism, the two women are shown to have a somewhat close relationship, primarily based on their apparent mutual hatred of Michel, who is physically and emotionally abusive to both, as well as unkind to the children. Unable to stand his mistreatment any longer, Nicole devises a plan to get rid of Michel forever. Though hesitant at first, Christina ultimately consents to help Nicole. Using a threatened divorce to lure Michel to Nicole's apartment building in a remote village several hundred kilometers away, Christina sedates him. The two women then drown him in a bathtub and dump his body in the school's neglected swimming pool. When his corpse floats to the surface, they think it will appear to have been an accident. Almost everything goes according to their plans until the body fails to surface. Michel's corpse is nowhere to be found when the pool is drained. Nicole sees in the paper that the police have found the corpse. However, when Christina goes to the morgue, she learns it is not actually Michel's body. There she meets Alfred Fichet (Vanel), a retired private detective. He becomes involved in the case, much to Nicole's chagrin. When Christina and Alfred come back, a boy is punished for breaking a window; the boy says it was Michel who punished him. After hearing this, Christina becomes very sick and is unable to be photographed for the school photo. However, it appears that Michel appears in the photo standing in the back next to a window.

Worrell works as a maintenance man at Kamp Kikakee but hopes to become a counselor. He quickly becomes a valuable addition to the staff, skilled at Plains Indian Sign Language, used by Kikakee's owner, Chief St. Cloud. A small group of juvenile delinquents, the Second Chancers, come to Kikakee. Head Counselor Tipton assigns Kikakee's most experienced counselor, Ross Stennis, to be the boys' counselor. Stennis is unhappy with this assignment, and he treats the boys harshly. After he goes too far by intentionally causing Moustafa Jones, the smallest boy in the group, to nearly drown in the lake during swimming, only for Moustafa to be rescued by Ernest, the boys retaliate against Stennis's cruelty by toppling his lifeguard perch into the lake, badly injuring Stennis's leg in the process.

The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. The nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water bodies. Since there is a lot of nitrogen it causes algae to grow out of control. Figure below shows a pond covered with algae. Algae may use up so much oxygen in the water that nothing else can grow. Soon, even the algae die out. Decomposers break down the dead tissue and use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Slow and steady wins the race. At least that's what former senator Rick Santorum seems to be saying his strategy is to win the GOP nomination. But is it working? Presidential candidate, former senator Rick Santorum, is here. Good evening, sir. RICK SANTORUM, GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Hi, Greta. VAN SUSTEREN: So I guess -- I understand that you think the American people, Republican voters, want to shake things up a little bit with the front-runner. SANTORUM: Yes. There's no question. I heard it in Florida. I've heard it in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, where I'm spending a lot of time, is that they're tired of the Mitt and Rick show, that they want to hear from the other candidates. I think that's why you've seen Herman getting a bump. We've gotten a bump in -- you know, obviously, we finished fourth in the straw poll in Florida, which was a big help to us. Our fund-raising has jumped up in the last couple of weeks as a result of the debate. The most constant thing I hear is, I wish they'd ask you more questions. I wish I'd hear from some of the other candidates. And so I think there's a dissatisfaction with the choices that have been presented to the American public, which all the papers, everybody's saying it's just this two-candidate race. And I think you're seeing -- you're starting to see a rebound -- a response to that. VAN SUSTEREN: And you think that's the reason -- or not the only reason, but... VAN SUSTEREN: ... a big reason behind the surge for Herman Cain, and you're gotten a bump up. SANTORUM: Yes, we feel like we've gotten a bump. Herman certainly has. And that's -- you know, obviously, when people are looking at other places than the top two, that's an opportunity for us. And we're going to exploit that. We're going to spend a lot of time in those early primaries. VAN SUSTEREN: All right, big controversy right now over the primary schedule. You like the primary schedule, the caucus in Iowa followed by New Hampshire and South Carolina. VAN SUSTEREN: And Florida -- Florida's sort of stirring up trouble. What's the problem with Florida doing that? SANTORUM: For the life of me, I don't understand what Florida is trying to accomplish because whatever they're going to accomplish, they're going to fail. You know, they're going to move their primary up -- it's talked about moving up to January. All these four primary -- early primary states, Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada, will move ahead of them. And all you've effectively done is cut off one month of the lead-up time to this primary process. VAN SUSTEREN: And they're going to lose half their delegates. SANTORUM: And they're going to lose half their delegates. VAN SUSTEREN: Supposedly. Will that really be imposed upon them? SANTORUM: Well, the RNC -- here's the way I look at this. The RNC, it's their nomination. It's the nomination of the Republican Party, the national Republican Party. And they should be able to set the rules. And they set the rules that these four states are going first. And some states don't like it and want to jump ahead. Well, they're not going to jump ahead. All you're going to do is move up the process. What I believe is going on is somebody in Florida is shilling for Mitt Romney and probably Rick Perry. They want to shorten the playing field now that these guys are ahead, so what -- we'd rather have this election -- I'm sure that they'd like to have the election tomorrow. So by moving up the calendar, you help the favorites. And there's somebody in Florida who wants to help the favorite. They certainly don't want to help the people of Florida because they're going to be denied their delegates and they're going to -- they're going to run afoul of the RNC, who was kind enough to pick them as the host state. So I didn't really see a whole lot of advantage to the people of Florida doing it. I'm very disappointed they're doing it. I've heard if from a lot of people in Florida that they're not happy to do it. Their national committee people aren't happy they're doing it. But I suspect the Romney and Perry camps are very happy they're doing it. VAN SUSTEREN: Well, who -- who in Florida -- who's the in the Perry, Romney, to take your -- your thought... SANTORUM: Well, the chairman or the person -- the chairman or the person who's organizing this is a Perry supporter, so you can just sort of take it from there. VAN SUSTEREN: Why would he want to help Romney, though? Why would a Perry supporter want to help Romney now? SANTORUM: Well, he's helping -- he's helping the favorite candidates. Again, if you -- if you shave off a month and you're looking at the top two candidates, you want this election to be as quickly as possible. VAN SUSTEREN: But that's going to -- I mean, they -- they can't both win, though. SANTORUM: Well, no, they can't both win, but you're advantaging -- you're advantaging the candidates who are at the top of the polls right now by having the election sooner, rather than later. That's really what's happening. VAN SUSTEREN: Why -- why should Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and whatever other next state's going to... VAN SUSTEREN: Why should -- why should -- and Nevada -- why should they pick the nominee for the Republican Party? SANTORUM: Well, first off, they don't. VAN SUSTEREN: Well, they do! VAN SUSTEREN: Well, they -- actually, they do! SANTORUM: They do a very good job. First off, there's two reasons. Number one is the obvious reason, which is the RNC says they're first. VAN SUSTEREN: Well, of course, but why is the RNC doing it for these states, you know, every four years? SANTORUM: And that's the second reason. The second reason is, is because these states have a tradition of doing that. They've been doing this for a long time, and they've had pretty good track record of actually taking the responsibility very seriously. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"In this interview, former Senator Rick Santorum discusses his strategy for winning the GOP nomination, dissatisfaction with the top candidates, and controversy surrounding the primary schedule. He suggests that the push to move up the Florida primary is driven by supporters of Mitt Romney and Rick Perry to benefit their campaigns, while expressing disappointment in the decision and emphasizing the importance of the early primary states, Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada, in the nomination process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: City traffic is a great problem. More cars are produced every year and the streets are getting more and more crowded. So during \\"rush hours\\", when people are going to or from their work, traffic is brought to a standstill. It has been suggested that commuters--the people who travel to work every day from outside the city--should share their cars and give each other lifts. So each car would carry four or five people instead of only one. It is an excellent idea., however, so far nobody has been able to think of a way to make people do so. To discourage motorists from leaving their cars in the streets all day, parking meters are used. When you park at a meter, you must put a coin in the slot . This pays for a certain amount of time. The meter records this and it shows when the time that you have paid for is finished. If the car is still there then, you have to pay a fine. Traffic wardens look after the meters. They walk around the streets and check that every meter shows that money has been paid for the car parked there. If a meter shows 'TIME EXPIRED', the motorist who has left his car there is fined. Of course, the traffic warden can not wait for the owner of the car to return. He carries many printed forms, and on one of these he writes down all the details, such as the number of the car, where it is parked, how much the driver must pay and where he must send the money. He leaves this form on the car, where the driver will be able to see it easily; he usually pushes it under one of the windscreen wipers so that it will not be blown away. And in case it rains before the motorist returns, the form is put in a little plastic envelope to protect it. When the driver comes back, he gets an unpleasant surprise, but it is his own fault for leaving his car too long at parking meter. Question: The passage implies_. Options: A: cars with more people are needed to solve traffic problems B: commuters should go to work by bike C: cars with fewer people are needed to solve traffic problems D: we should reduce car production","completion":"A: cars with more people are needed to solve traffic problems"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Jonathan Swift said, “Everybody wants to live forever, but nobody wants to grow old.” Wouldn’t it be nice if we could stay healthy and young and live as long as possible? Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier. Question: Health problems come: Options: A. before one recognizes the symptoms B. during fetal development C. after aging D. not enough information === The correct answer is","completion":"C. after aging."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: The demolition of the citadel was a half-hearted job, however, and there's plenty left to see today, from ramparts and castle walls to ruined chapels, stone stairways, and quaint cobbled streets. Hypothesis: There is nothing else to see besides the citadel demolition. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise infers that the demolition of the citadel was not completely done, leaving behind various remnants of structure like ramparts, castle walls, ruined chapels, stone stairways, and quaint cobbled streets. Therefore, contrary to the hypothesis that suggests there is nothing else to see beyond the citadel's demolition, the premise very much implies contrary. These remnants represent considerable historical infrastructure that can be viewed and explored. The so-called 'half-hearted job' of demolishing the citadel has resulted in numerous elements remaining intact or semi-intact, serving as echoes of the past and piquing the curiosity of the onlookers or visitors. A deeper explanation of these remnants is as follows: 1. Ramparts: These are defensive walls with a broad top with a walkway, typically enclosing a castle. They are often reinforced with a parapet or protective barrier. The ramparts draw visitors by offering scenic vantage points and the feeling of walking in the steps of history. 2. Castle Walls: The remaining castle walls echo the luxurious past and the architectural wonder that it was. They carry numerous stories of the lords, ladies, battles, and ceremonies of the time. 3. Ruined chapels: These religious edifices can offer a unique perspective on the religious practices and spiritual aesthetics of the era when they were fully functional. 4. Stone Stairways: The stone stairways offer the nostalgic charm of the medieval period. They can lead to various parts of the rest of the castle, showcasing the impressive engineering of the time. 5. Cobbled Streets: Cobbled streets give a quaint and rustic charm to the place. Transporting guests back in time, they could run through the whole complex, offering a sense of the lively activity that once filled the streets. Instead of complete demolition, each of these elements adds to the overall historical monument - the Citadel, telling tales, reflecting the architectural prowess of the time, and the lifestyle of the inhabitants. Therefore, the hypothesis stating that there is nothing else left after the citadel's demolition to see is incorrect. Visitors have a wide range of structures to explore and observe, each contributing uniquely to the overall experience. They are all part of the Citadel's history and grandeur and are significantly valuable to archaeologists, historians, and tourists alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hill farm used GMO seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. Valley farm used only organic methods and non-GMO seeds. But I can use this background: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination... What is an answer for this question: Which farm had fewer iron deficiencies in some crops? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Valley farm had fewer iron deficiencies in its crops. This is because Valley farm used organic methods and non-GMO seeds, which do not have the same concerns associated with glyphosate usage as GMO seeds do. Glyphosate, which is often used in herbicide-tolerant GMO crops like those grown at Hill farm, has been linked to iron deficiencies in some crops. Therefore, by not using GMO seeds or glyphosate-based herbicides, Valley farm likely experienced fewer issues with iron deficiencies in their crops. However, it's important to note that this is a general assumption based on the information given, and other factors such as soil health, crop management, and environmental conditions can also influence the levels of iron deficiencies in both farms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I was thinking that the main character, the astronaut with the bad case of the runs(in his case, his skin, hair, muscles, etc) could always get more movie work after he'd been reduced to a puddle. All he has to do is get a job as the Blob. The premise of this flick is pretty lame. An astronaut gets exposed to sunspot radiation(I think), and so begins to act like an ice cream cone on a hot day. Not only is this a puzzler, but apparently he has to kill humans and consume their flesh so that he can maintain some kind of cell integrity. Huh? Have you ever noticed that whenever any kind of radiation accident or experiment happens, the person instantly turns into a killing machine? Why is that? The astronaut lumbers off into the night from the 'secret facility'(which has no security whatsoever), shedding parts of himself as he goes. Apparently he retains just enough memory to make him head for the launch pad, maybe because he wanted to return to space. Thus begins the part of the movie that's pretty much filler, with a doctor wandering around with a Geiger counter, trying to find the melting man by the buzz he gives off. He kills a stupid Bill Gates look-alike fisherman, scares a little girl a la the Frankenstein monster movie, and finishes off a wacky older couple(punishing them karmically for stealing some lemons). Then there's a short scene where he whacks his former General, and a very long scene where he kills a young pothead and chases his girlfriend around. You'd think that after she cuts his arm off and he run away, the scene would shift. But no...we're treated to about ten minutes of the woman huddled into a corner panting and screaming in terror, even though the monster is gone. All I could think was..director's girlfriend, anyone? The end of the movie is even lamer than the rest of it. The melting man finishes turning into a pile of goo, and then...nothing. That's it. That's the end of the movie.

The reviewer highlights a number of aspects they find weak or irritating, such as the lack of depth to the main character's predicament, the slow pacing, and a seemingly unnecessary extended scene featuring a frightened woman.

Problem: Solve -80*u - 8172 = 374*u for u. And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the equation, you need to isolate variable \\"u\\". Here is the step-by-step process on how to isolate \\"u\\" and solve the equation: Firstly, let's start with the initial equation: -80*u - 8172 = 374*u We can start by bringing the terms involving the variable u together. The term -80*u should be moved to the right side of the equation and 374*u should be moved to the left side of the equation. This can be done by adding 80*u to both sides of the equation: -80*u + 80*u - 8172 = 374*u + 80*u That will simplify to: -8172 = 454*u Next, you need to isolate \\"u\\". To achieve this, divide both sides of the equation by 454: -8172 / 454 = 454*u / 454 This will result in: u = -8172 / 454 Dividing -8172 by 454 equals to -18. So the solution of -80*u - 8172 = 374*u is u = -18. Therefore, your answer is u = -18."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The positions on the persistence of objects are somewhat similar. An endurantist holds that for an object to persist through time is for it to exist completely at different times (each instance of existence we can regard as somehow separate from previous and future instances, though still numerically identical with them). A perdurantist on the other hand holds that for a thing to exist through time is for it to exist as a continuous reality, and that when we consider the thing as a whole we must consider an aggregate of all its \\"temporal parts\\" or instances of existing. Endurantism is seen as the conventional view and flows out of our pre-philosophical ideas (when I talk to somebody I think I am talking to that person as a complete object, and not just a part of a cross-temporal being), but perdurantists have attacked this position. (An example of a perdurantist is David Lewis.) One argument perdurantists use to state the superiority of their view is that perdurantism is able to take account of change in objects.

It works like this: someone posts a topic to their blog that is critical or controversial. This person can either be a community member, commentator, employee or otherwise; it doesn’t matter who the person is. Then what happens is a series of comments are posted to that blog entry from readers that are critical of the post, thus challenging the author on their views. The author then either deletes the blog entry or disables the comments based on the feedback. In other words, a viewpoint is shared, an invitation for comment is provided, but that invitation is then revoked when the author of the blog post is dissatisfied with the response from their readers. I have seen this happen countless times over the years and I don’t like this. I believe we should all be accountable for our words. Our words have the ability to inspire, to entertain, to challenge, but to also hurt. Actions have consequences, and so do words. As such, when I see someone openly share their thoughts on their blog and invite their readers to provide comments, I see that as a wonderful demonstration of accountability and engagement; debate is a beautiful thing when executed with politeness and respect. To then close that door, seemingly because people disagree with you, is in my mind the equivalent of walking out of a room in the middle of a debate. The excuse when folks are criticized of this behavior is typically “it is my blog and I can run it how I like“. This is true: it is your blog, and you can run it how you like, but the true measure of a person is not just in what they say, but also in the conversation and discourse that follows.

Options： A. sadness B. hopelessness C. loss of innocence D. confusion E. anger Answer:","completion":"C. loss of innocence A negative consequence of learning about the world is the loss of innocence. As humans, we start our lives with a sense of innocence and a relatively narrow understanding of the world. This innocence allows us to see the world in a more simplistic and optimistic manner. However, as we learn more about the world, we inevitably uncover its complexities and the harsh realities that exist within it. This can diminish our sense of wonder and may even cause us to feel disillusioned. Loss of innocence is often a consequence of acquiring knowledge about difficult subjects such as violence, injustice, poverty, and human suffering. These discoveries can be jarring, leading to a shift in our worldview and altering our approach to life. As we grow and learn more about the darker aspects of life and human nature, it can be difficult to maintain the pure and untainted perspective we once had as children. This can, in turn, have a significant impact on our emotional well-being and overall approach to life. While it is essential to be aware and educated about the world around us, it is also crucial to balance our understanding with a sense of hope and empathy. This can help to mitigate the potential negative effects of the loss of innocence, helping us to continue to engage with the world in a positive and constructive manner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On the right side, we have 102*h. -208*h + 18*h = (-208 + 18) * h = -190*h So the equation becomes: -190*h = 102*h - 2628 Step 2: Move all terms with the variable h to one side of the equation. To do this, subtract 102*h from both sides of the equation. -190*h - 102*h = 102*h - 102*h - 2628 -292*h = -2628 Step 3: Solve for h. Now we have an equation with only one term containing h.

Terry asks his boss's wife Sylvia to his apartment after an office party and the two go to bed. Later, while he is in the bathroom, she hears screams outside and goes naked to the window. Seeing a man attacking a young woman, she opens the window and the assailant runs away. When the media report the murder of a young woman near Terry's flat that night, he thinks the police should know what Sylvia saw but, to protect her, claims he was at the bedroom window. At a police lineup, neither he nor the victim Denise is able to pick out the attacker Carl. Despite the feeble evidence against him, Carl is put on trial for the assault and during the proceedings his lawyer proves that since Terry is short-sighted he could not have witnessed the incident. Carl goes free, leaving not only the police and the prosecution but also Denise and Sylvia aghast at Terry's ineptness. In the courtroom, Carl recognised Sylvia as the woman at the window. Desperate to warn her, Terry finds her at a ballet performance and tells her she must go to the police, but she refuses all further involvement.

Egypt lies to the northeast and encompasses part of West Asia, while Sudan is situated on the edge of the Sahel, to the south of Egypt. - Byrsa was the walled citadel above the harbour in ancient Carthage . It was also the name of the hill it rested on . The name is derived from the Phoenician word for citadel . In Virgil 's account of Dido 's founding of Carthage , when Dido and her party were encamped at Byrsa , the local Berber chieftain offered them as much land as could be covered with a single oxhide . Therefore , Dido cut an oxhide into tiny strips and set them on the ground end to end until she had completely encircled Byrsa . This story is considered apocryphal , and was most likely invented because Byrsa sounds similar to the Greek word , meaning oxhide . The citadel dominated the city below and formed the principal military installation of Carthage . It was besieged by Scipio Aemilianus Africanus in the Third Punic War and was defeated and destroyed in 146 BC. Saint Louis Cathedral was built on Byrsa Hill starting in 1884 . Today , it serves as a cultural center .

The empire extended over much of the coast of North Africa as well as encompassing substantial parts of coastal Iberia and the islands of the western Mediterranean Sea. - A city-state is a sovereign state that consists of a city and its dependent territories. Historically, this included cities such as Rome, Athens, Carthage, and the Italian city-states during the Renaissancebut today only a handful of sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which are city-states.

A local undertaker and free-lance photographer, have been summoned to the scene to assist the police; to take photographs, and do their best to support the beginning of the investigation. The undertaker tells Gillespie (crucially incorrectly), that it is his immediate guesstimate, that the death has occurred no more than a couple of hours earlier, than the time of the body's discovery by Wood, between say, 12:30 and 01:30 a.m. Gillespie is also told by Wood that his patrol; overall has been quiet, without incident, and with no one seen (\\"I mean not even a cat\\", is his quote). But Gillespie, speculating that the crime may have been committed by a transient (and having been wrongly advised of the probable time of death; as being no more than a couple of hours earlier), orders Wood to go back on his patrol and verify that the pool hall is closed (its hours had it open until 12:30 a.m.); the streets and alleyways are clear; and that the train and bus depots, are cleared as well. Officer Wood in rechecking the train depot (where the ticket, freight, and baggage offices are all closed, and the station is unmanned); finds (in the still open waiting room), an African-American northerner Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier), sitting quietly with his luggage, and in a business suit...

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person that worked at the Salzburg Festival?, using the article: Sir Georg Solti, (born György Stern; 21 October 1912 – 5 September 1997) was a Hungarian-born orchestral and operatic conductor, best known for his appearances with opera companies in Munich, Frankfurt and London, and as a long-serving music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Born in Budapest, he studied there with Béla Bartók, Leó Weiner and Ernő Dohnányi. In the 1930s, he was a répétiteur at the Hungarian State Opera and worked at the Salzburg Festival for Arturo Toscanini. His career was interrupted by the rise of the Nazis' influence on Hungarian politics, and being of Jewish background he fled the increasingly harsh Hungarian anti-Jewish laws in 1938. After conducting a season of Russian ballet in London at the Royal Opera House he found refuge in Switzerland, where he remained during the Second World War. Prohibited from conducting there, he earned a living as a pianist. After the war, Solti was appointed musical director of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich in 1946. In 1952 he moved to the Oper Frankfurt, where he remained in charge for nine years. He took West German citizenship in 1953. In 1961 he became musical director of the Covent Garden Opera Company, London. During his ten-year tenure, he introduced changes that raised standards to the highest international levels. Under his musical directorship the status of the company was recognised with the grant of the title \\"the Royal Opera\\". He became a British citizen in 1972. In 1969 Solti became music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, a post he held for 22 years. He relinquished the position in 1991 and became the orchestra's music director laureate, a position he held until his death. During his time as the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's eighth music director, he also served as music director of the Orchestre de Paris from 1972 until 1975 and principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra from 1979 until 1983. Known in his early years for the intensity of his music making, Solti was widely considered to have mellowed as a..., what would be the answer ?

The four travel to Los Angeles to find Kelly's estranged aunt, Susan Lake (Phyllis Davis), heiress to a family fortune. Susan welcomes Kelly and her friends, even promising a third of her inheritance to her niece, but Susan's sleazy financial advisor Porter Hall (Duncan McLeod) discredits them as \\"hippies\\" in an attempt to embezzle her fortune himself. Undeterred, Susan introduces The Kelly Affair to a flamboyant, well-connected rock producer, Ronnie \\"Z-Man\\" Barzell (John LaZar), who coaxes them into an impromptu performance at one of his outrageous parties (after a set by real-life band Strawberry Alarm Clock). The band is so well-received that Z-Man becomes their Svengali-style manager, changing their name to The Carrie Nations and starting a long-simmering feud with Harris. Kelly drifts away from Harris and takes up with Lance Rocke (Michael Blodgett), a high-priced gigolo who has designs on her inheritance. Harris at first fends off the sexually aggressive porn star Ashley St. Ives (Edy Williams), but after losing Kelly he allows Ashley to seduce him. Ashley soon tires of his conventional nature and inability to perform sexually due to increasing drug and alcohol intake.

It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole. - The araB gene promoter is a bacterial promoter, activated by e L-arabinose binding. - WZ Sagittae (\\"WZ Sge\\") is a cataclysmic dwarf nova star system in the constellation Sagitta. It consists of a white dwarf primary being orbited by a low mass companion. The white dwarf is about 0.85 solar masses while the companion is only 0.08 solar masses. This implies that the companion is a spectral class L2 star, although this has yet to be confirmed. The distance to this system has been determined by parallax measurements using the fine guidance sense on the Hubble Space Telescope, yielding a distance of 43.5 parsecs. - The Henry Draper Catalogue ( HD ) is an astronomical star catalogue published between 1918 and 1924 , giving spectroscopic classifications for 225,300 stars ; it was later expanded by the Henry Draper Extension ( HDE ) , published between 1925 and 1936 , which gave classifications for 46,850 more stars , and by the Henry Draper Extension Charts ( HDEC ) , published from 1937 to 1949 in the form of charts , which gave classifications for 86,933 more stars . In all , 359,083 stars were classified . The original HD catalogue covers the entire sky almost completely down to an apparent photographic magnitude of about 9 ; the extensions added fainter stars in certain areas of the sky . The construction of the Henry Draper Catalogue was part of a pioneering effort to classify stellar spectra , and its catalogue numbers are commonly used as a way of identifying stars . - S Doradus (also known as S Dor) is one of the brightest stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a satellite of the Milky Way. It is a Luminous Blue Variable and one of the most luminous stars known, but so far away that it is invisible to the naked eye. - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - KW Sagittarii is a red supergiant, located approximately 2,400 parsecs away from our Sun in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius. It has a size of (up to by some estimates), making it one of the largest known stars. If placed at the center of the Solar System, the star's surface would engulf Mars. - The apparent magnitude of a celestial object is a number that is a measure of its brightness as seen by an observer on Earth. The brighter an object appears, the lower its magnitude value (i.e. inverse relation). The Sun, at apparent magnitude of 27, is the brightest object in the sky. It is adjusted to the value it would have in the absence of the atmosphere. Furthermore, the magnitude scale is logarithmic; a difference of one in magnitude corresponds to a change in brightness by a factor of , or about 2.512. - Astrophotography is a specialized type of photography for recording images of astronomical objects and large areas of the night sky. The first photograph of an astronomical object (the Moon) was taken in 1840, but it was not until the late 19th century that advances in technology allowed for detailed stellar photography. Besides being able to record the details of extended objects such as the Moon, Sun, and planets, astrophotography has the ability to image objects invisible to the human eye such as dim stars, nebulae, and galaxies. This is done by long time exposure since both film and digital cameras can accumulate and sum light photons over these long periods of time. - A star catalogue (Commonwealth English) or star catalog (American English), is an astronomical catalogue that lists stars. In astronomy, many stars are referred to simply by catalogue numbers. There are a great many different star catalogues which have been produced for different purposes over the years, and this article covers only some of the more frequently quoted ones. Star catalogues were compiled by many different ancient peoples, including the Babylonians, Greeks, Chinese, Persians, and Arabs. Most modern catalogues are available in electronic format and can be freely downloaded from space agencies data center. - An astronomical catalog or catalogue is a list or tabulation of astronomical objects, typically grouped together because they share a common type, morphology, origin, means of detection, or method of discovery. Astronomical catalogs are usually the result of an astronomical survey of some kind. - Babylonia was an ancient Akkadian-speaking state and cultural area based in central-southern Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq). A small Amorite-ruled state emerged in 1894 BC, which contained at this time the minor city of Babylon. Babylon greatly expanded during the reign of Hammurabi in the first half of the 18th century BC, becoming a major capital city. During the reign of Hammurabi and afterwards, Babylonia was called \\"Mt Akkad\\" \\"the country of Akkad\\" in the Akkadian language. It was often involved in rivalry with its older fellow Akkadian-speaking state of Assyria in northern Mesopotamia. Babylonia briefly became the major power in the region after Hammurabi (fl. c. 1792 1752 BC middle chronology, or c. 1696 1654 BC, short chronology) created a short-lived empire, succeeding the earlier Akkadian Empire, Third Dynasty of Ur, and Old Assyrian Empire; however, the Babylonian empire rapidly fell apart after the death of Hammurabi. - Before the advent of photometers which accurately measure the brightness of astronomical objects, the apparent magnitude of an object was obtained by taking a picture of it with a camera. These images, made on orthochromatic photoemulsive film or plates, were more sensitive to the blue end of the visual spectrum than the human eye or modern photometers. As a result, bluer stars have a lower (i.e. brighter) photographic magnitude than their modern visual magnitude, because they appear brighter on the photograph than they do to modern photometers. Conversely, redder stars have a higher (i.e. fainter) photographic magnitude than visual magnitude, because they appear dimmer. For example, the red supergiant star KW Sagittarii has a photographic magnitude of 11.0 to 13.2 but a visual magnitude of about 8.5 to 11. It is also common for star charts to list a blue magnitude (B) such as with S Doradus and WZ Sagittae. - Henry Draper (March 7, 1837 November 20, 1882) was an American doctor and amateur astronomer. He is best known today as a pioneer of astrophotography. - The human eye is an organ which reacts to light and pressure. As a sense organ, the mammalian eye allows vision. Human eyes help provide a three dimensional, moving image, normally coloured in daylight. Rod and cone cells in the retina allow conscious light perception and vision including color differentiation and the perception of depth. The human eye can differentiate between about 10 million colors and is possibly capable of detecting a single photon. - A photometer, generally, is an instrument that measures light intensity or optical properties of solutions or surfaces. Photometers measure: - American English (variously abbreviated AmE, AE, AmEng, USEng, en-US), also called United States English or U.S. English, is the set of varieties of the English language native to the United States. English is the most widely spoken language in the United States and is the common language used by the federal government, considered the \\"de facto\\" language of the country because of its widespread use.

Context: Paul knew that the plan was insane and probably illegal. Certainly the stuff he'd been helping Chloe and her gang of followers do for the last few hours was technically illegal. He'd asked them why they were helping him, what did they hope to gain? They'd told him that this is what they did for fun. Chloe assured him that they \\"lived for this kinda shit.\\" Ok, fine. He could sort of see that. Once he was there, helping them come up with the plan and then actually carrying it out, it sure as hell was exciting - probably the most exciting thing he'd ever done. Now that he was home and alone with his misgivings and paranoia, it all seemed like a really stupid idea. If it weren't for Chloe and her mesmerizing enthusiasm, there's no doubt that he wouldn't be doing this at all. But it was too late now. Or was it? It was five in the morning when Paul got back to his apartment. He'd told Chloe that he wanted to get a few hours sleep before the big meeting, but he now realized that there was no way he was going to be able to relax. When he'd stepped out the door twenty-two hours earlier he'd still had his job and was looking forward to a showing the rest of the art team his new designs for some of the higher-level monsters he wanted to add to the game.

The main conditions of the treaty were that the Dutch were to hand over the coastal areas they had captured to the Kandyan king in return for a Dutch trade monopoly over the island. The agreement was breached by both parties. The Dutch captured Colombo in 1656 and the last Portuguese strongholds near Jaffnapatnam in 1658.

How is \\"You wearing the apron and making pancakes just feels like... normal.\\" said in Czech?","completion":"The sentence \\"You wearing the apron and making pancakes just feels like... normal.\\" can be translated to Czech as \\"To, jak si oblékáš zástěru a děláš palačinky, prostě působí... normálně.\\" Let's break this down a bit to give you some context on how Czech syntax works. 1. \\"You wearing the apron\\" - \\"To, jak si oblékáš zástěru\\" In Czech, \\"You\\" is \\"Ty\\". However, in this sentence, it's used in the reflexive form \\"si\\". The term \\"wearing\\" translates to \\"oblékáš\\" which is the second person singular present tense of the verb \\"oblékat\\" (to wear). \\"The apron\\" translates directly to \\"zástěra\\". The whole phrase structures differently in Czech and includes \\"To, jak\\", which means \\"The way how\\" making it more like \\"The way how you're wearing an apron\\". 2. \\"and making pancakes\\" - \\"a děláš palačinky\\" \\"And\\" translates to \\"a\\". \\"Making\\" translates to \\"děláš\\" which is the second person singular present tense of the verb \\"dělat\\" (to make). \\"Pancakes\\" translates to \\"palačinky\\". 3. \\"just feels like... normal\\" - \\"prostě působí... normálně\\" The term \\"just feels like\\" translates to \\"prostě působí\\", \\"Just\\" translates to \\"prostě\\", \\"feels\\" translates to \\"působí\\", which is the third person singular present tense of the verb \\"působit\\" (to seem or to feel). \\"Like\\" is implied and isn't directly stated in this phrase in Czech. \\"Normal\\" translates directly to \\"normálně\\", which indicates an adverb form in Czech. So, altogether, it's \\"To, jak si oblékáš zástěru a děláš palačinky, prostě působí... normálně.\\", literal translation of which would be \\"The way how you are wearing an apron and making pancakes, it just feels... normal.\\" but the meaning stays the same.

Milwaukee, Wisconsin (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, in a bid to create jobs and boost economic growth, called on Congress on Monday to pass a 50 billion plan to renew the country's transportation infrastructure. His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \\"Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\\" said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \\"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\\" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \\"This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\\" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of 50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress. Question: \\"The plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term would have what immediate effect?\\" Response: \\"It would give us the \\"greatest infrastructure in the world\\" again\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct? Available choices: A). no. B). yes.","completion":"A). no.

Please answer the following question: Question: when can you use a defibulator I found the following answer on Google: Defibrillators can be external, transvenous, or implanted , depending on the type of device used or needed. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","completion":"While the information you provided about different types of defibrillators (external, transvenous, or implanted) is accurate, it doesn't directly answer the question of when to use a defibrillator. Let me provide a detailed answer for you. A defibrillator is a medical device used to administer an electric shock to the heart, with the aim of restoring its normal rhythm in a situation known as sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). Here's when you can use the different types of defibrillators: 1. External defibrillators: - These are portable devices commonly found in public places and medical facilities, typically in the form of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs). - You can use an AED when a person is unresponsive, not breathing normally, and showing no signs of life. AEDs are designed for layperson use and provide step-by-step instructions to ensure proper usage. - Manual external defibrillators are used by trained medical professionals (such as paramedics and doctors) who can assess the patient's condition and deliver the appropriate level of shock. 2. Transvenous defibrillators: - These devices are not for public use. They are typically used by medical professionals in hospitals to treat certain types of abnormal heart rhythms. - A transvenous defibrillator requires inserting a catheter with an electrode tip through a vein and navigating it to the heart's chambers. These devices are often used in combination with an external defibrillator to administer a synchronized shock to the heart. 3. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs): - ICDs are small, battery-powered devices implanted in the chest of people at high risk for cardiac arrest due to prior cardiac events or specific heart conditions. - With ICDs, the need for use is determined by the device itself. It continuously monitors the heart rhythm and delivers electric shocks automatically when it detects a life-threatening arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm). So, to sum up, you can use an external defibrillator (AED) when you encounter someone experiencing sudden cardiac arrest with no signs of life and abnormal breathing. Transvenous defibrillators and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators are used under different circumstances and typically managed by medical professionals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Back when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.) Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren’t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don’t like needles. Or maybe they aren’t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer “stronger” versions, designed for older adults? I’m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it’s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC’s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I’m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I’m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza. This month, you’ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I’ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns. Here’s what I’ll cover: * The basics of influenza and vaccination against the flu * What to know about flu shots for older adults * What’s new and resources for the 2017-2018 flu...

He also studied village B, which existed about 6,000 years ago. The village was much bigger and better developed. Which village had higher birth rates? Hint: Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, we can infer that Village B, which existed about 6,000 years ago, had higher birth rates than Village A. Since agriculture was invented around 10,000 years ago, Village A (12,000 years ago) was likely to be a hunter-gatherer society with a less dependable food supply and lower population density. In contrast, Village B, which existed after the invention of agriculture, benefited from a larger, more dependable food supply and settled lifestyle. This would have enabled higher birth rates due to more resources and the advantages of settled life. However, it is important to note that higher birth rates were also accompanied by higher death rates in Village B, possibly due to crowded living conditions and diseases. Despite the higher birth and death rates, the human population continued to grow slowly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The chill of the January afternoon pierced her through, but it was fear, more than the cold, that made her limbs shake. Having just crossed over to the Left Bank, she glanced back over her shoulder and saw the towers and spires of the royal palace across the Seine. She felt as if hidden eyes there were watching her. Could anyone on the palace wall have seen her walk over the Petit-Pont? Not Amalric. He was still in the south, the King having just appointed him seneschal for Beziers and the surrounding country. But he had so many agents in Paris and allies at court. Except for Agnes, all the servants in the Gobignon town house were loyal to him. His aunt, Queen Blanche, was forever praising him to all who would listen. If Nicolette were involved in scandal, the White Queen would be furious, and would see to it that word reached Amalric. And if indeed he found out about her meeting the troubadour? Just a message, a song, let alone a meeting like this one, could mean death for her and Orlando. I should turn around right now, cross this bridge, and run back to the palace. The streets of the Latin Quarter were crawling with ruffians and criminals - it was insane for her to be walking here alone after sunset. The sight of the small knife she carried under her cloak might deter an attacker, but then she would be discovered. If I screamed for help, the whole palace would find out. Blanche would demand to know why I was here. No, she thought, her blood turning to ice, she would know why. But those eyes of his? to look into them again, was that not worth any risk? She stood, vacillating, in the shadows by a wooden house that overhung the Rue Saint-Jacques. I must see Orlando, she thought. Over a year now, and I have not been able to forget him.

Given the question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: At some time in your life you may have a strong desire to do something strange or terrible. However, chances are that you don't act on your impulse , but let it pass instead. You know that to take the action is wrong in some way and that other people will not accept your behavior. Perhaps the most interesting thing about the phenomenon of taboo behavior is how it can change over the years within the same society, how certain behavior and attitudes once considered taboo can become perfectly acceptable and natural at another point in time. Topics such as death, for example, were once considered so upsetting and unpleasant that it was a taboo to even talk about them. Now with the publication of important books such as On Death and Dying and Learning to Say Goodbye, people have become more aware of the importance of expressing feelings about death and, as a result, are more willing to talk about this taboo subject. One of the newest taboos in American society is the topic of fat. Unlike many other taboos, fat is a topic that Americans talk about constantly. It's not taboo to talk about fat; it's taboo to be fat. The \\"in\\" look is thin, not fat. In the work world, most companies prefer youthful-looking, trim executives to sell their image as well as their products to the public. The thin look is associated with youth, vigor, and success. The fat person, on the other hand, is thought of as lazy and lacking in energy, self-discipline, and self-respect. In an image-conscious society like the U.S., thin is \\"in\\", fat is \\"out\\". It's not surprising, then, that millions of Americans have become obsessed with staying slim and \\"in shape\\". The pursuit of a youthful physical appearance is not, however, the only reason for America's fascination with diet and exercise. Recent research has shown the critical importance of diet and exercise for personal health. As in most technologically developed nations, the life-style of North Americans has changed dramatically during the course of the last century. Modern machines do all the... Question: Based on the ideas presented in the passage we can conclude \\"being fat\\" _ in American society.

The passage discusses the changes in taboo behavior over time within a society and provides examples of such behaviors, like talking about death or being fat. Step 2: Identify the relevant information related to the question. The question asks about \\"being fat\\" in American society. The passage states that \\"it's not taboo to talk about fat; it's taboo to be fat\\" and that the \\"thin\\" look is more acceptable in American society. Step 3: Compare the provided options with the information in the text. A: The passage does not make any definitive claim about what will always remain a taboo. B: The passage actually says that being fat is considered a taboo by many people. C: There is no information in the passage mentioning the history of this particular taboo.

Caesar submitted the laws that he had promised Pompey to the assemblies. Bibulus attempted to obstruct the enactment of these laws, and so Caesar used violent means to ensure their passage. Caesar was then made governor of three provinces. He facilitated the election of the former patrician Publius Clodius Pulcher to the tribunate for 58 BC. Clodius set about depriving Caesar's senatorial enemies of two of their more obstinate leaders in Cato and Cicero. Clodius was a bitter opponent of Cicero because Cicero had testified against him in a sacrilege case. Clodius attempted to try Cicero for executing citizens without a trial during the Catiline conspiracy, resulting in Cicero going into self-imposed exile and his house in Rome being burnt down. Clodius also passed a bill that forced Cato to lead the invasion of Cyprus which would keep him away from Rome for some years.

Meanwhile, Sherman has created an experimental formula that reconstructs the DNA of an obese person in a way that allows them to lose weight more easily. After class, Sherman meets and instantly falls in love with Carla Purty, a chemistry graduate student who is a big fan of his work. After dinner with his obese, impolite family, Sherman asks Carla out on a date, which she accepts, much to Sherman's surprise. The date begins well with Carla showing admiration for Sherman's work, but the club's obnoxious comic Reggie Warrington publicly humiliates him about his weight. Sherman becomes depressed and has a nightmare in which he becomes a rampaging giant and wrecks the city with a single fart that is ignited to cause an explosion. He tests his serum on himself and loses 300 pounds in seconds. Overwhelmed by his thinness, he goes out and buys copious amounts of normal-sized clothing to celebrate, and a 47,000 Viper sports car on his faculty expense account. To conceal his true identity, Sherman adopts a fake name, \\"Buddy Love\\", and invites Carla out on a date at the same club again (while the serum begins to wear off). Reggie is present again and Buddy takes revenge and heckles him mercilessly. Sherman's \\"Buddy\\" persona starts to develop an independent personality due to the heightened testosterone levels of the transformation, causing him to be overly assertive and confident. Klump's assistant Jason witnesses Buddy fleeing the scene after he is identified as the person who left Klump's credit card on the bar.

In his first reaction, reaction A, he uses a large amount of reactants. In his second reaction, reaction B, he uses a much smaller amount of reactants compared to reaction A. As the reactions are proceeding, he measures that reactants in reaction A have low average kinetic energy. At the same time, reactants in reaction B have high average kinetic energy. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which reaction has a lower temperature? Hint: The particles of soup have greater average kinetic energy than the particles of water in the tub, explaining why the soup has a higher temperature. However, the mass of the water in the tub is much greater than the mass of the soup in the pot. This means that there are many more particles of water than soup. All those moving particles give the water in the tub greater total kinetic energy, even though their average kinetic energy is less. Therefore, the water in the tub has greater thermal energy than the soup. To compare the thermal energy of some other materials, go to the following URL and click on the interactive animation “Temperature and Thermal Energy.” A:","completion":"Reaction A has a lower temperature. To understand this, we must first comprehend the relationship between temperature, kinetic energy, and thermal energy. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. Kinetic energy is the energy possessed by an object due to its motion. When particles in a substance move with high velocities, the average kinetic energy is high, and so is the temperature. Conversely, when particles have low velocities, the average kinetic energy is low, leading to a lower temperature. Thermal energy, on the other hand, is the total energy of all particles in an object, including kinetic and potential energy. It depends on the temperature of the substance, the mass of the substance, and its specific heat capacity. In the given situation, reaction A uses a large amount of reactants, and the reactants have a low average kinetic energy. This means that the temperature of reaction A is low. In reaction B, there is a smaller amount of reactants than in reaction A, but they have a high average kinetic energy. This implies that the temperature of reaction B is higher than that of reaction A. Although reaction A has a larger mass of reactants (more particles), its low average kinetic energy results in a lower temperature than reaction B. It is important to differentiate between temperature and thermal energy. While the thermal energy of reaction A might be higher due to the larger mass of reactants, the temperature remains lower compared to reaction B since temperature specifically measures the average kinetic energy, not the total thermal energy, of a system's particles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does voice mean the same thing in these two sentences?","completion":"In both Sentence 1 and Sentence 2, \\"voice\\" primarily refers to the sounds produced by a person or an instrument, either as music, speech, or other utterances. However, the context and connotation of the word \\"voice\\" in each sentence vary, giving it slightly different meanings. In Sentence 1, \\"voice\\" is used metaphorically to indicate that the character is emotionally stirred by the sound of the trumpet. The phrase \\"the trumpet's voice\\" personifies the instrument, and the word \\"voice\\" serves to highlight the emotional connection between the character and the sound that the trumpet produces. The trumpet's \\"voice\\" serves as a call to action, possibly giving the character a sense of purpose, enthusiasm, or excitement. Overall, the use of \\"voice\\" in Sentence 1 is more figurative and symbolic, representing the impact of the sound on the character. In Sentence 2, \\"voice\\" is used in a more literal sense to describe a high-pitched, sharp sound likely produced by a person. The phrase \\"a shrill voice\\" suggests a possibly alarming, unexpected, or attention-catching noise. In this case, \\"voice\\" helps to describe the physical quality of the sound and provides insight into how the characters in the story may perceive or react to it. The use of \\"voice\\" in Sentence 2 is more focused on the sound's physical properties and the immediate impression it creates. To summarize, while \\"voice\\" refers to the sounds produced by a person or an instrument in both sentences, its context and connotation differ. In Sentence 1, \\"voice\\" serves a more metaphorical and symbolic purpose, describing an emotional response to the sound. In Sentence 2, it provides a sensory description of the sound's quality and the potential for reaction in a literal sense.

Article:","completion":"Title: \\"Murray's Harrowing Experience: A Glimpse into the Unsettling Reality of Prison Life\\" Introduction Jailers recently opted to transfer Murray to an 8-foot-by-10-foot cell, subsequently sparking a chain of emotional outbursts and panic episodes. Murray, who is currently serving a four-year sentence for causing Michael Jackson's death in 2009, is in dire need of mental and emotional support according to his lawyer. This article delves deeper into the unsettling environment of the new cell, the effects it has on Murray's well-being, and how this incident sheds light on the broader issue of mental health in correctional facilities. Murray's New Cell: Living in a Closet Murray's lawyer, Valerie, revealed that the transfer to the smaller cell has been a challenging adjustment for her client. Described as akin to being in a closet, the confining space of the 8-foot-by-10-foot cell has triggered feelings of claustrophobia and anxiety in Murray. The consequences of this downsizing have resulted in a notable exacerbation of Murray's mental state; Valerie shared that her client is in a state of emotional chaos, desperately pleading, \\"Valerie, I'm dying, save me.\\" Mental Health in Prisons: A Pressing Concern Murray's harrowing experience in his new cell raises important questions about the prevalence and management of mental health issues within correctional facilities. Incarcerated individuals, more often than not, suffer from a myriad of mental health disorders that may go unnoticed or inadequately addressed by prison staff. The restricted and confined spaces in jails can further exacerbate mental distress amongst prisoners, with some struggling to cope with anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The psychological toll of incarceration can have lasting repercussions on an individual's mental well-being, with long-term consequences extending well beyond their prison sentence. Studies have shown that providing appropriate mental health support and access to psychiatric services for prisoners can significantly improve their rehabilitation process, reducing the risk of re-offending and facilitating integration back into society. Addressing the Issue: Recommendations for Change To address these concerns, there are several measures that can be taken to ensure that the mental well-being of incarcerated individuals is prioritized: 1. Screenings and Assessments: Routine mental health screening and assessments should be conducted at the time of entry into the prison system, allowing for early identification of mental health issues and subsequent development of appropriate treatment plans. 2. Access to Mental Health Services: Adequate mental health care should be provided to prisoners, including the availability of trained mental health professionals who can attend to inmates' specific needs and concerns. 3. Adjustment Periods and Transitional Support: Jailers should ensure that newly transferred prisoners are given an adequate adjustment period and requisite support when transitioning to different cells or facility environments. This may include close monitoring and providing appropriate mental health care for those struggling with the change in living conditions. 4. Staff Training: Prison staff should undergo mandatory training to help them identify the signs of mental illness, and to manage inmates who may exhibit symptoms of such illness. Additionally, staff members should be equipped with skills to address their own mental health challenges that may arise from working in such high-stress environments. Closing Statement Murray's heart-wrenching plight while adjusting to his new cell sheds light on the striking and prevalent issue of mental health within prison systems. Adequate mental health care provisions are essential to combat the inescapable psychological distress that incarcerated individuals face on a daily basis. We must strive to humanize and support those who find themselves in these bleak conditions, prioritizing rehabilitation and recovery over punishment. By doing so, we will not only provide a more humane life for those behind bars but also promote a safer and more just society for all."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The popular annual Go Cammando calendar which has raised hundreds of thousands of pounds to support Marine families has been banned by the Ministry of Defence. Members of 40 Comando based in Norton Fitzwarren, Somerset had been sweating it out in the gym to tone up their muscles for the 2017 calendar, only to be stood down on the order of the MoD. Scores of people getting excited about the boys from Norton Manor Camp flexing their muscles have taken to social media to protest at the high command flexing their muscles instead. A statement by the Go Commando calendar organisers read: “Go Commando regrets that there will be no ‘Go Commando Calendar’ for 2017. “The Royal Marines have forbidden serving Royal Marines from appearing in the calender. “We would like to take this opportunity to thank all those Royal Marines who have appeared in this very popular calendar, which provided funds to support the Royal Marines families throughout the Corps. “We would also like to thank the thousands of followers of the calendar for your loyal support to date.” Former Royal Marine lieutenant colonel Kevin du Val, chairman of Go Commando, expressed his disappointment on the cover up ruling. He said: “The calendar is a great fundraiser and a bit of fun. “Every year we have had to apply to the MoD to use service personnel but this year they haven’t given permision. “They felt it was sexualising the Royal Marines. “I don’t agree with that. “It’s disappointing but that’s life.” Thousands of copies of the calendar have been sold since it first appeared in 2012, its most successful year, when it raised more than £100,00 for Go Commando, which supports Royal Marines and their families. Mr du Val added: “We’ve got to go with what the military have said. “We’ll see if we can change their minds, but it’s too late for 2017. “We’re going to review it and might get some retired Royal Marines to pose for a calendar in 2018.” Retired commandos posed for a previous calendar, although it failed to sell as well as other years. Money from the next year’s calendar would have gone towards a £400,000 nursery and family community centre in Norton Fitzwarren available for use by the military and civilian population. Over 40 people were upset by the news including Lynne Brittany who wrote: “Could serving Marines hide their faces behind something, eg. a basketball or tyre as the original ladies hid their assets behind cakes etc. “After all, be truthful, it’s not faces being looked at.” Susan Jones wrote: “So disappointed ans so will all my customers be too!. ” I haven’t thrown any of them away so with each new month they all get an airing! “Could they not be done in such a way as to use silhouettes? “The green beret could be highlighted maybe along with any weapons? “Like others have said it seems such a shame when it raised money for a good cause.” Allison Bristow wrote: “Very disappointing. “The money it raises should be the main issue here! “I fail to see the point of stopping a bit of fun that promotes an amazing group of people who are asked to put themselves in harms way to protect us all.” Simon Ferguson said: “It’s a shame you don’t have the support of the Royal Marines command. “They should hang their heads in shame.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"The Ministry of Defence has banned Royal Marines from posing for the annual Go Commando charity calendar, claiming it \\"sexualises\\" them, despite the project raising hundreds of thousands of pounds to support Marine families since its launch in 2012."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The plumbing for a fountain that would have decorated a wealthy Israeli family's garden in the 10th century has been found intact, proving workmen of the time built pipes to last. It is the first time the plumbing of a decorative fountain from this period has been found almost complete outside the wealthier districts of Old Ramla, shedding light on the ingenious methods used to create water features in elaborate villas at the time. The fountain, which is described as ‘in an excellent state of preservation,’ was unearthed in Ramla, central Israel, and was discovered during preparations for the construction of a bridge as part of a new highway scheme. It is the first time the plumbing of a decorative fountain from the 10th century has been found almost complete outside the wealthier districts of Old Ramla, shedding light on the ingenious methods used to create water features in elaborate villas. Experts said the ruins of the luxurious villa are the remains of ‘an affluent estate’ that had a fountain it its garden that dates from the Fatimid period, which covers the late 10th century to the first half of the 11th century. The fountain, made of mosaic covered with plaster and stone slabs, was uncovered west of the building and is connected to a system of pipes consisting of terracotta sections and connectors made of store jars, which led to the fountain. A large cistern and a system of pipes and channels that was used to convey water were discovered next to the villa, where two residential rooms were also exposed. Hagit Torgë, excavation director on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority, said: ‘It seems that a private building belonging to a wealthy family was located there and that the fountain was used for ornamentation. ‘This is the first time that a fountain has been discovered outside the known, more affluent quarters of Old Ramla.’ A fountain made of mosaic covered with plaster and stone slabs (pictured) was uncovered west of the building connected to a system of pipes consisting of terracotta sections and connectors made of store jars, which led to the fountain.

She said that most of the fountains that archaeologists are aware of from this period have been found around the White Mosque, which was at the centre of the old city of Ramla. Dr Torgë said: ‘This is the first time that the fountain’s plumbing was discovered completely intact. ‘The pipes of other fountains did not survive the earthquakes that struck the country in 1033 and 1068’. Archaeologists believe the entire area was abandoned in the mid-11th century in the wake of a large earthquake. Ramla was established at the beginning of the eighth century by the ruler Suleiman Ibn ‘Abd al-Malik and certain periods its importance even eclipsed that of Jerusalem, according to the Israel Antiquities Authority, which oversaw the excavations.

Independence with Partition: The British began to see India's independence as inevitable; however, only a few seemed to understand the vital role of the religious groups. Britain prepared a parliamentary democracy with majority rule, but the majority were Hindus — and Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs had been killing each other in war for many centuries. Nehru's Congress Party, largely Hindu with a socialist leadership, wanted a parliamentary democracy. As counterweight, British legislation reserved parliamentary seats for religious minorities, but the Punjab and Bengal had such a complicated mixture of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs that it was not possible to avoid fights over how separate constituencies were to be formed. The seeds of future trouble were sown. The legislation on reserving seats gave the Muslims the basis for an alternative to an India in which they were only a quarter of the population: Partition. In 1930, the poet Muhammad Iqbal proposed a separate Muslim homeland in the northwest of India. A small group of Indian Muslims at Cambridge came up with the name Pakistan, using the initials of the Punjab, Afghania (N.W. Frontier Province), Kashmir, and Sind (at the same time producing the word pak, meaning \\"pure\\"), and adding \\"stan,\\" the Persian suffix for the word \\"country. \\" The Muslim campaign for Partition was led by London-trained Bombay lawyer, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Meanwhile, Gandhi vehemently opposed any dismemberment of the country, and tried to keep people united by fasting to uphold the spirit of love, and by focussing on the common adversary: the British. Advocating civil disobedience, he led his famous Salt March to the sea, to scoop up salt and circumvent the hated British salt tax. This put more than 60,000 in jail. Against this militancy, World War II did not elicit the solidarity of the first. Indians courageously fought alongside the British troops, in Burma, the Middle East, and Europe, but Gandhi saw the British as a provocation for Japanese invasion and was jailed yet again, for launching a \\"Quit India\\" campaign in the year 1942. Some anti-British extremists saw the Japanese as an Asian liberator. Winston Churchill didn't want any Indian independence and so it was probably as well for India that he was defeated by Attlee's Labor Party in 1945. With riots growing ever more bloody in Bengal, Bihar, and the Punjab, India's last viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, kept a mandate to make the British departure as quick and as smooth as possible. Quick it was — six months after his arrival — but not smooth.

Chris Brown ordered booked on hit and run charge Los Angeles (CNN) -- Two charges against Chris Brown were dropped Tuesday, but the singer is still accused of hit and run after a minor traffic crash. Brown's lawyer entered a not guilty plea on his behalf and a judge ordered him to show up at a sheriff's station within a week to be officially booked on the charge, according to a court spokesman. The prosecutor dismissed charges of driving without a license and driving without proof of insurance during a hearing Tuesday in a Van Nuys, California, court. Brown allegedly sped away from the accident scene in May after a confrontation with the driver of another car, having refusing to provide his name, driver's license and insurance information. The hit and run charge threatens Brown's freedom since it led a judge to revoke his probation last week in connection with his conviction in the beating of his girlfriend, Rihanna. The judge allowed Brown to remain free until a trial is held. A Brown representative said last week that the singer expected all of the charges to be dropped and probation reinstated this week. Brown, 24, was already facing a probation violation trial after prosecutors accused him of not completing the community labor ordered for his 2009 felony assault conviction. Brown was ordered to return to court on August 16 for a hearing to set a trial date to determine if the probation revocation will stand. If it does, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin could order Brown to jail to serve part of the original five-year jail sentence imposed for the attack on Rihanna. A woman whose Mercedes was allegedly rear-ended by a Range Rover that Brown was driving on a Los Angeles street told investigators that he \\"went ballistic\\" after the traffic accident and screamed at her. According to the police report on the incident, the other driver, Olga Gure, quoted Brown as shouting at her: \\"You are a b---h!\\" The report added more from Gure, who quoted Brown as saying, \\"Who do you think you are, b---h? Do you think if you driving Mercedes so got money, b---h? Do you think I am just a black n----r? I got more money than you, b---h!\\" The trigger for Brown's alleged rage was that Gure took a photo of him and his girlfriend, Karrueche Tran, to document the scene -- since he allegedly refused to show her his driver's license, she said. When Brown tried to grab the camera, Tran screamed, \\"Don't touch her, don't touch her,\\" Gure said. \\"I was so shocked that I was speechless,\\" she said. \\"Just a moment ago he was a nice guy. After screaming some insulting nonsense for a while longer, he slammed a door and drove away fast and noisy.\\" Brown used his Twitter account to protest the traffic charges last month: \\"It's not a hit and run if u get out the car, exchange information (who has NO DAMAGE to either cars).This is really ridiculous\\" \\"I have a valid drivers license and I gave the woman the right info. She saw cameras and wanted to make a scene.\\" \\"She contacted the cops thinking of a payday from Chris Brown when I followed the proper procedures.\\" \\"My lawyers will be contacting you. I will not stand for this bullying and yellow journalism!\\" \\"My profile pic is the pic I took of the persons car after \\"the hit and run\\". NO damage. Just a dirty car. once again, I gotta clear my name\\" \\"I work my ass off to provide for my entire family. I've made mistakes in the past and have worked hard to be a better person. \\" \\"19-24 years of age. I don't have all the answers and you can't show me a person that age who has it figured out. We live and grow. Let me live\\" Brown punched Rihanna inside a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street, leaving her face bruised and bloody on the eve of the Grammy Awards in February 2009. He entered a guilty plea seven months later and was sentenced to serve five years' probation and to spend more than 1,400 hours in \\"labor-oriented service\\" for the assault conviction. The judge allowed him to serve the sentence in Richmond, Virginia, under the direct supervision of the police chief. In a court filing in February 2013, prosecutors accused Brown of not completing the community labor. The paperwork Brown submitted to show he had completed community labor is \\"at best sloppy documentation and at worst fraudulent reporting,\\" District Attorney Jackie Lacey said. Brown wasn't in town on some of the dates reported, the motion said. Geragos, Brown's attorney, said the prosecutor's filing was so fraudulent that he would ask the judge to punish the deputy district attorneys involved and call for a contempt of court hearing for filing false documents with the court. \\"And I don't mean just false, it is fraudulent,\\" Geragos said. The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has \\"tortured\\" Brown during his probation more than any client he's ever had, Geragos said. The prosecutor is asking the judge to order him to restart his 1,400 hours of community service under the supervision of a Los Angeles probation officer. CNN's Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.

Question: Who is the criminal profiler for the San Francisco Police Department? Movie title: The Darwin Awards Movie plot: The film opens with a car with a JATO rocket strapped to it. The movie then shifts to Michael Burrows, a criminal profiler for the San Francisco Police Department. Shot in documentary style, the film is ostensibly a dissertation by a film school grad that follows Michael throughout the story. Fired from the police force after his hematophobia allows a serial killer to get away, Michael wallows in a deep depression for several weeks before coming up with a way to combine his Darwin Awards obsession with his talent for profiling. He will help insurance companies detect people more likely to accidentally end their own lives, so they are not sold insurance policies. After impressing an insurance company manager with his profiling talent, Michael is paired up with Siri, a specialist in strange insurance cases. Siri and Michael travel the country on behalf of the company, investigating several legendary examples of stupidity, such as the JATO rocket car. A pair of men attempting to ice fish become frustrated and use a stick of dynamite to blast a hole in the ice. The problem is their dog plays fetch with the lit dynamite and runs it back to their brand-new SUV. As they investigate the cases, Michael tries to pinpoint a common factor for these people. The only explanation is a confused monologue by Siri about insurance companies always denying claims and driving people insane. Michael narrowly avoids becoming a Darwin Award winner throughout the movie. He and Siri are stranded in the middle of nowhere on a cold night. Desperate for warmth, he attempts to start a fire with gasoline, causing his car to explode. Siri later confronts Michael, accusing him of being obsessed with the Darwin Awards.

The resulting Treaty of Zuhab of that same year decisively parted the Caucasus and adjacent regions between the two neighbouring empires as it had already been defined in the 1555 Peace of Amasya. The Sultanate of women (1648–1656) was a period in which the mothers of young sultans exercised power on behalf of their sons. The most prominent women of this period were Kösem Sultan and her daughter-in-law Turhan Hatice, whose political rivalry culminated in Kösem's murder in 1651. During the Köprülü Era (1656–1703), effective control of the Empire was exercised by a sequence of Grand Viziers from the Köprülü family. The Köprülü Vizierate saw renewed military success with authority restored in Transylvania, the conquest of Crete completed in 1669, and expansion into Polish southern Ukraine, with the strongholds of Khotyn and Kamianets-Podilskyi and the territory of Podolia ceding to Ottoman control in 1676.

Samuel had contracted a rare illness that had no known cure, which had stolen his health and his strength, reducing him to a pale shell of his former self. He suffered greatly, his tormented howls echoing deep into the night as he fought the lethal invader that had taken over his body. In the end, Samuel requested this; a peaceful end in the embrace of nature. He was ready, he said. And so, with a heavy heart, Hunter obliged. The moon was high in the sky, a cold, indifferent witness to the heartbreaking scene unfolding beneath it. Hunter dug steadily, determination etching deep lines onto his tired face. Sweat dripped from his brow, staining the earth beneath him even as his hands clawed into the still soil. He picked a spot deep within the woods, next to a small serene pond. It was a place both loved, filled with memories of laughter and camaraderie; a place perfect for Samuel's final rest. The stars may have been bright above, but the darkness Hunter felt inside made them effectively invisble. Hunter's every strike of his shovel seemed to echo endlessly, filling the silence of the night. Each mound of dirt represented a piece of his heart that was going with Samuel. By the time he was done, dawn was breaking, painting the sky in hues of pink and orange. With aching arms and an much more aching heart, Hunter lowered Samuel into the earth. This hard and painful night was not only about the loss of Samuel, but also about the loss of a part of Hunter himself. Samuel had been more than a friend to Hunter, he had been his brother-in-spirit, his confidante, his rock in times of adversity. Their bond was deeper than blood and stronger than iron. Guilt, regret, and an overwhelming sense of loss coursed through Hunter as he covered Samuel with the earth he'd so recently displaced. With his bare hands, he patted down the loose soil, his tears falling freely and disappearing into the dirt. He stayed at the grave until his sobs softened into a quiet lament, the sun rising higher into the sky. Time held no meaning for Hunter as he finally rose to his feet, his body tired but his soul exhausted. He made a promise to his departed friend right there, telling Samuel that his spirit would live on through Hunter, promising to honor him in his deeds and actions. As the sun began to climb higher, he gathered his tools and turned to go, leaving the now tranquil site with one final whispered goodbye. From that day forward, Samuel lived in Hunter's memory. He served as a powerful reminder of the unstoppable march of time, a sudden, brutal lesson about the frailty of life. But above all else, he represented love in its purest form - the kind that could risk itself for another's comfort, the kind that even death couldn't separate. In truth, Hunter never really left the woods that day. A part of him remained, buried with Samuel. But the part that walked away was stronger, determined to honor Samuel's memory, determined to live a life incredible enough for two. The process of burying Samuel was tragic, painful, and lonely, but Hunter rose from it renewed, carrying the essence of Samuel within him. He could only hope it would be enough."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Jay Austin (Alex Kendrick) is a car salesman who consistently cheats his customers, even to the point of overcharging his own pastor.

I read this background article the other day: Hepatitis viruses can develop into a chronic viral infection that leads to liver cancer. Infection by human T-lymphotropic virus can lead to tropical spastic paraparesis and adult T-cell leukaemia. Human papillomaviruses are an established cause of cancers of cervix, skin, anus, and penis. Within the Herpesviridae, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus causes Kaposi's sarcoma and body-cavity lymphoma, and Epstein–Barr virus causes Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, B lymphoproliferative disorder, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Merkel cell polyomavirus closely related to SV40 and mouse polyomaviruses that have been used as animal models for cancer viruses for over 50 years. I am facing a new situation today: Two cousins both have chronic viral infections. Tim has Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, while Nate has the Epstein–Barr virus. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which cousin has a higher chance of developing body-cavity lymphoma? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article, it is clear that different viruses are associated with diverse types of cancers and conditions. In the given situation with two cousins, Tim and Nate, who both have chronic viral infections – Tim has Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), and Nate has Epstein–Barr virus (EBV). Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, as mentioned in the background article, is known to cause Kaposi's sarcoma and body-cavity lymphoma. Kaposi's sarcoma is a type of cancer that mainly impacts the skin but can also affect other organs such as the lymph nodes, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract. Body-cavity lymphoma, also known as primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), is a rare type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that is typically characterized by the presence of cancerous cells in the body cavities such as the pleural, peritoneal, or pericardial spaces. On the other hand, Epstein–Barr virus is associated with several types of cancers, including Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, B lymphoproliferative disorder, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. While some of these conditions are also types of lymphomas, body-cavity lymphoma is not explicitly mentioned as being associated with EBV. Therefore, based on the information derived from the background article, it can be concluded that Tim, who has Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, has a higher chance of developing body-cavity lymphoma compared to Nate with Epstein–Barr virus, as KSHV is directly linked to the development of body-cavity lymphoma. It is important to note, however, that individual risks for developing specific types of cancers or conditions may vary due to factors such as genetics, lifestyle choices, and overall health. It is recommended for Tim and Nate to consult with their healthcare providers for a more accurate and personalized assessment of their risks and appropriate monitoring."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But the history enthusiasts have been bombarded by confused tourists asking which century the arrangement dates back to after they put the stones on display six months ago. Unique garden display: Tom Mason and his son Richard have built their very own Stonehenge on the grounds of their family farm in Rothbury, Northumberland. Richard said: 'Quite often we’d come back from work and there would be a walker stood there, looking at his Ordenance Survey map, scratching his head. 'We’d stop and have a bit of a chat and they’d ask if this was an ancient place of worship. I’d say my ancestors built it - my father put it up six months ago.

Richard and Tom have received calls and. emails from history societies across the country, who have been. questioned by tourists over the historical nature of the stones. 'To the untrained eye the stones could be mistaken for being a lot older,' said Richard. 'But when you look closely you can tell they’ve been quarried in the last few years.' As early as 3300 BC, arrangements of standing stones began to be erected around Britain. The most famous is Stonehenge in Wiltshire. But contrary to popular belief, Stonehenge was not built by the Druids. It is believed that construction of Stonehenge started in 2600 BC and was completed in 2000 BC.

Oskar knows his father has been killed and falls to the floor. He replaces the answering machine with a new one and hides the old one so his mother will never find out. A few weeks after what Oskar calls \\"the worst day,\\" he confides in his German grandmother and they become closer. Oskar's relationship with his mother worsens since she cannot explain why the World Trade Center was attacked and why his father died. Oskar tells his mother he wishes it had been her in the building, not his father, and she responds, \\"So do I\\". After, Oskar says he did not mean it, but his mother doesn't believe him. A year later, Oskar finds a vase in his father's closet with a key in an envelope with the word \\"Black\\" on it. He vows to find what the key fits. He finds 472 Blacks in the New York phone book and plans to meet each of them to see if they knew his father. He first meets Abby Black (Viola Davis), who has recently divorced her husband.

(CNN) -- Sevilla have sacked coach Manolo Jimenez after their disappointing home draw to bottom-club Xerez on Tuesday extended the club's winless run to seven games. Despite lying fifth in the Spanish Primera Liga table, Sevilla were knocked out of the lucrative European Champions League by Russian side CSKA Moscow last week. Jimenez had also secured a Copa del Rey final against Atletico Madrid but it wasn't enough to save the 46-year-old's job. The club's sporting director Ramon Rodriguez admitted the decision had been difficult but said he had \\"done what I had to.\\" He told the club's official Web site: \\"It was an unavoidable situation and we had to find a solution, and the pain that it brings. \\"Tuesday was the end of the story but the decision comes from the image and dynamics of the team. Without doubt we are grateful to Manolo. He is an excellent professional, he has made all this possible and impossible. However it is obvious that he could not get a response out of the team. \\"Fortunately we believe that there is time. The growth and the ambition of the club is shown in the change of the manager. We are fighting for important things.\\" Xerez's injury-time equaliser on Tuesday meant Sevilla's last league success was against Real Mallorca back in February. Ironically, it is Mallorca who occupy the much-coveted fourth spot in the table that guarantees Champions League football next season. Jimenez took charge in October 2007 when former coach Juande Ramos left to take over at English Premier League team Tottenham.

In the first quarter, New York trailed early as Vikings QB Tarvaris Jackson completed a 60-yard TD pass to WR Sidney Rice. The Giants responded with RB Reuben Droughns getting a 1-yard TD run. Minnesota retook the lead with safety Darren Sharper returning an interception 20 yards for a touchdown. In the second quarter, Vikings' RB Chester Taylor got an 8-yard TD run, along with kicker Ryan Longwell making a 46-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Giants' kicker Lawrence Tynes made a 48-yard field goal, and Minnesota's Longwell made a 26-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Vikings' safety Dwight Smith returned an interception 93 yards for a touchdown, along with LB Chad Greenway returning an interception 37 yards for a touchdown. New York's QB Eli Manning completed a 6-yard TD pass to WR Plaxico Burress to complete the scoring. Eli Manning was intercepted four times (with three of his interceptions being returned for touchdowns). He became the third NFL QB since 1970 to have three interceptions get returned for touchdowns. His performance was all the more embarrassing as the Vikings had the league's worst pass defense in 2007 (albeit with the league's strongest run defense), and were playing in this game without starting corner Antoine Winfield.

A widower fulfilled his wife’s dying wish of having a traditional viking funeral - by burning and sinking her ashes on a replica warship. Devoted Francis Mulcahy, 50, took his wife Karine’s ashes two miles out to sea on a replica Viking longship which he built himself. He then set fire to the 3ft-long vessel and watched it sink - just like the traditional funeral services conducted by the Vikings hundreds of years ago. Mark of respect: The replica Viking ship containing the ashes of Karine Mulcahy burns two miles out to sea, off the coast of Plymouth. Devoted husband: Francis Mulcahy, left, makes the final adjustments to the replica viking ship which will carry the ashes of his wife.

On April 28 Francis was joined by around 70 mourners who packed onto a friend’s fishing boat and sailed out from Plymouth Sound. When they were two miles out to sea he used a blowtorch to ignite a number of firelighters on the deck. He said: 'We put it into the water after sailing out on a friend’s boat and we put fire-lighters on the top of the boat. 'We used a blow torch to set it alight and just watched it as it burnt.

To deter him SaitÅ Kageyu (RentarÅ Mikuni), the Daimyo's senior counselor, tells HanshirÅ the story of another rÅnin, Chijiiwa Motome â formerly of the same clan as HanshirÅ. Motome arrived at the palace a few months earlier and made the same request as HanshirÅ. Infuriated by the rising number of \\"suicide bluffs\\", the three most senior samurai of the clanâYazaki Hayato, Kawabe Umenosuke, and Omodaka Hikokuroâpersuaded SaitÅ to force Motome to follow through and kill himself. Upon examining Motome's swords, their blades were found to be made of bamboo. Enraged that any samurai would \\"pawn his soul\\", the House of Ii forced Motome to disembowel himself with his own bamboo blade, making his death slow, agonizingly painful, and deeply humiliating. Despite this warning, HanshirÅ insists that he has never heard of Motome and says that he has no intention of leaving the Ii palace alive. After a suicide pavilion is set up in the courtyard of the palace, HanshirÅ is asked to name the samurai who shall behead him when the ritual is complete. To the shock of SaitÅ and the Ii retainers, HanshirÅ successively names Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuroâthe three samurai who coerced the suicide of Motome. When messengers are dispatched to summon them, all three decline to come, saying they are suffering from a life-threatening illness. After provoking their laughter by calling bushido a facade, HanshirÅ recounts his story to SaitÅ and the Ii retainers. He did, he admits, know Motome after all. In 1619, his clan was abolished by the Shogun. His Lord decided to commit seppuku and, as his most senior samurai, HanshirÅ planned to die alongside him.

Indicate your choice as \`a\` for Yes or \`b\` for No. Question: What is the normal blood pressure before it is raised? Passage:The fight-or-flight response involves nervous impulses which result in hormone secretions into the bloodstream. When a horse reacts to a threat, it may initially \\"freeze\\" in preparation to take flight. The fight-or-flight reaction begins in the amygdala, which triggers a neural response in the hypothalamus. The initial reaction is followed by activation of the pituitary gland and secretion of the hormone ACTH. The adrenal gland is activated almost simultaneously and releases the neurotransmitters epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). The release of chemical messengers results in the production of the hormone cortisol, which increases blood pressure and blood sugar, and suppresses the immune system. Catecholamine hormones, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, facilitate immediate physical reactions associated with a preparation for violent muscular action. The result is a rapid rise in blood pressure, resulting in an increased supply of oxygen and glucose for energy to the brain and skeletal muscles, the most vital organs the horse needs when fleeing from a perceived threat. However, the increased supply of oxygen and glucose to these areas is at the expense of \\"non-essential\\" flight organs, such as the skin and abdominal organs.","completion":"b"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lynch told the city's devastated gay community, \\"We stand with you in the light.\\" She also announced a 1 million emergency grant to help Florida law enforcement pay for overtime costs related to the shooting, and she met with prosecutors, first responders and victims of the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Her visit comes as investigators continue to dig into the background of Omar Mateen, the gunman who killed 49 people and injured dozens more on June 12 at the Pulse nightclub. Lynch said it was a \\"cruel irony\\" that the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community — one defined almost entirely by love — is so often a target of hate. She told the LGBTQ community, \\"We stand with you to say that the good in the world far outweighs the evil; that our common humanity transcends our differences; and that our most effective response to terror and hatred is compassion, unity and love.\\" Also Tuesday, Orlando police reopened streets near the nightclub and wound down their investigation at the crime scene. A makeshift memorial that went up nearby shortly after the massacre was still standing Tuesday, with chalk messages on the sidewalk and utility poles. Among them are drawings of hearts, the message \\"God bless'' and the hashtag \\"#Orlandostrong.''

In Mexico it was certified octuple platinum by the Asociación Mexicana de Productores de Fonogramas y Videogramas (AMPROFON) for shipping two million copies, the country's all-time third-bestselling album (only Juan Gabriel and José José has sold more copies with Recuerdos, Vol. II and 20 Triunfadoras respectively). In the United States, Romance debuted at number ten on the Billboard Latin Pop Albums chart for the week of 14 December 1991, and reached number one four weeks later. The record topped the chart for 32 consecutive weeks when it was displaced by Jon Secada's eponymous album on the week of 22 August 1992, ending 1992 and 1993 as the bestselling Latin pop album of the year in the country. It was the first record by a Spanish-speaking artist to be certified gold in Brazil and Taiwan, and the first gold certification by a non-crossover Latin artist in the United States (later certified platinum in the U.S. by the RIAA for shipments of one million copies). In South America, Romance was certified platinum in Colombia and Venezuela, gold in Paraguay and double platinum in Peru.

The Bears travelled to Heinz Field to face the winless Pittsburgh Steelers in their first NBC Sunday Night Football matchup of the season. Pittsburgh had lost the previous week to Cincinnati to fall to 0-2 for the first time in 11 years. In the last game between the two in 2009, the Bears triumphed 17-14. The Bears were the 1-point favorites; eight CBSSports.com experts voted on their predictions for the game, with a 5-3 result favoring Chicago, while four ESPN analysts predicted that the Steelers would win. One of the goals of the defense was to contain Ben Roethlisberger in the passing pocket, especially as the offensive line suffered the loss of center Maurkice Pouncey. Additionally, the Steelers also had the 31st-ranked rushing offense and had yet to score a rushing touchdown, who was expected to regain first-rounder Le'Veon Bell. Alan Rubenstein of ChicagoNow writes that the Bears should attempt to improve their pass rush, which was only able to record two sacks in the last two games. Marc Trestman cited the weather as a factor for the poor performance, stating, \\"It's tough to rush the passer in wet weather... For both sides. It's tough to get a pass rush with a soggy field and a wet field. It's an advantage throwing the football. On a rainy day (versus) no rain, really the advantage goes to the offense. Because we can sit back there and protect. And it's really hard to configure a pass rush to get close.\\" On offense, the Bears should attempt to attack the Steelers' 14th-ranked rush defense. A key matchup was the WR-CB duel between Brandon Marshall and Ike Taylor; Taylor contained Bengals receiver A. J. Green, who recorded 162 yards against the Bears in week one, to just six catches for 41 yards in week two. Chicago started the game with Robbie Gould's field goal, followed by Matt Fort&#233; and Michael Bush's touchdown runs to take a 17-0 lead in the first quarter. Pittsburgh then scored on Shaun Suisham's 27-yard field goal, but the Bears then scored after Major Wright returned Roethlisberger's interception 38 yards for a touchdown for the 24-3 lead at halftime. In the second half, the Steelers began to rally with Roethlisberger throwing two touchdown passes of 33 and 21 yards to Antonio Brown, followed by Suisham kicking two more field goals to narrow the margin to 27-23. However, Jay Cutler threw a 17-yard touchdown pass to Earl Bennett; the pass was initially ruled as incomplete, but was reversed. Eventually, Lance Briggs stripped Roethlisberger, and Julius Peppers returned the fumble 42 yards for a touchdown. Although the eventual extra point by Gould was blocked by Troy Polamalu, the Bears finished the game with Chris Conte intercepting Roethlisberger with 1:39 left in the game for the fifth takeaway by Chicago on the night and the 40-23 win, dropping the Steelers to 0-3 for the first time since 1986.

Question: Question: Who might use a double edged razor to cut things precisely? Options: - first aid kit - chemist - butcher - shower - drug store Explain why a human would choose \\"chemist\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"chemist\\" to answer the question above because a double-edged razor is a precise cutting instrument that can be used for carefully slicing and preparing materials or samples in a laboratory setting. Chemists often work with various substances and require precise cuts and measurements to ensure accurate results in their experiments. Step-by-step justification: 1. Evaluating the options provided: The question asks for who might use a double-edged razor to cut things precisely. a. first aid kit: A first aid kit is not a person or profession; it's a collection of medical supplies used for treating minor injuries and wouldn't use a double-edged razor itself. b. chemist: This refers to a professional working with chemicals, often in a laboratory setting. c. butcher: A butcher mainly cuts and processes meat, but they typically use larger knives or saws for their work and may not need the precision of a double-edged razor. d. shower: A shower is not a person or profession; it's a place where people clean themselves using water and other cleaning products. e. drug store: A drug store is a place where people buy over-the-counter medications and personal care items, and it's not directly associated with the precise cutting of objects. 2. Identifying the best option among the choices: After evaluating the options, chemist stands out as the most logical choice for using a double-edged razor due to the precise nature of their work. 3. Explaining the choice: Since chemists often work with various substances and need to make precise cuts in samples or materials to conduct their experiments accurately, a double-edged razor would be a suitable tool for them to use. The precise cutting ability of the double-edged razor aligns well with the chemist's requirements for accuracy and precision in their work."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which aircraft is the largest passenger airliner currently in service?","completion":"The largest passenger airliner currently in service is the Airbus A380. Manufactured by Airbus S.A.S., it's a double-deck, wide-body, four-engine jet airliner. The A380 made its first flight on April 27, 2005 and entered commercial service in October 2007 with Singapore Airlines. Up to 853 passengers can be accommodated in a two-class seating arrangement, while a three-class seating arrangement can accommodate 525 passengers. In its all-economy class, the A380 can carry up to 868 passengers. The aircraft is powered by four Engine Alliance GP7200 or Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines, giving it the capacity for long-haul flights. It has a range of 8,000 nautical miles, or 15,000 kilometers, which allows it to fly for example from Hong Kong to New York nonstop. The Airbus A380 has several breakthrough technology and design aspects. For example, it uses an advanced multi-function display that includes a navigation display with lateral, vertical and approach plan modes, an aircraft system display, and an interactive checklist. The Cockpit also takes design cues from the latest fighter jets with pull-out keyboards for pilots and an integrated electronic flight bag. Aside from the main passenger deck and upper deck, the A380-800 also has an under-deck cargo hold and optional underfloor crew rest area. The aircraft weighs approximately 569,000 kilograms and makes use of advanced materials such as carbon-fiber reinforced plastic and other composite materials, which make up about 25% of the aircraft's structural weight. Its total wingspan is approximately 261.8 feet (79.8 meters), and it is 72.7 feet (22.1 meters) in height. In terms of environmental impact, the A380 is designed to consume less fuel per passenger kilometre than a small family car, making it a more environmentally friendly choice for long-haul travel. Airbus says the A380's engine noise is half that produced by the Boeing 747-400, and that it produces less than half as much noise on take-off and landing. However, it's noteworthy to mention that despite its technical achievements, the A380 had a mixed commercial success. In 2019, Airbus announced the production of the A380 would end in 2021. The announcement was made because there were fewer orders for the A380, as many airlines preferred twin-engine aircrafts that are more fuel-efficient, such as the Airbus A350 and the Boeing 787. These aircraft may not carry as many passengers as the A380, but their operational costs are lower. However, the existing A380s will continue to fly for many years, serving the busiest airport hubs around the world. Overall, the Airbus A380 currently remains the largest passenger airliner in service, recognised for its size, advanced technology, and efficiency."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: What is the last name of the person whose research at St. Helens formed the basis for his doctoral dissertation? Answer the above question based on the context below: Harry Glicken (March 7, 1958 – June 3, 1991) was an American volcanologist. He researched Mount St. Helens in the United States before and after its 1980 eruption, and was very distraught about the death of fellow volcanologist David A. Johnston, who had switched shifts with Glicken so that the latter could attend an interview. In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions. Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric. Conducting independent research from sponsorships granted by the National Science Foundation and other organizations, Glicken accrued expertise in the field of volcanic debris avalanches. He also wrote several major publications on the topic, including his doctoral dissertation based on his research at St. Helens titled \\"Rockslide-debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington\\" that initiated widespread interest in the phenomenon. Since being published posthumously by Glicken's colleagues in 1996, the report has been acknowledged by many other publications on debris avalanches. Following his death, Glicken was praised by associates for his love of volcanoes and commitment to his field.

The western kingdom successfully fended off the Taungoo invasions, and kept its independence. The war had a deterrence effect: Mrauk U would not see another Taungoo invasion until 1580. The war's origins can be traced back to 1542 when King Min Bin of Mrauk U provided military support on the side of the Kingdom of Ava in the Taungoo-Ava War . Although Min Bin left the alliance in the same year, King Tabinshwehti of Taungoo was determined to repay the favor. In 1545, Tabinshwehti agreed to aid Min Aung Hla, the former Viceroy of Thandwe, who had been removed from office by Min Bin. In October 1545, Tabinshwehti sent a 4000-strong army but it was promptly driven back. Much larger Taungoo naval and land forces tried again in the following dry season.

By understanding the context and sense of urgency in the writer's question, we can infer that the writer is more likely to explore options that align with their goals and interests. Thus, among the given options in the question, the most probable option that the writer might consider after asking the question is: (c). The writer might use the money to help students. This option aligns well with the writer's interest in fundraising for a classroom in need. By choosing this option, the writer is emphasizing the value of their contribution to the cause. This action not only supports the challenge but also ensures that the writer's efforts positively impact the classroom. It demonstrates the writer's dedication to the cause and their willingness to make personal sacrifices to reach the goal. Option (a), on the other hand, contradicts the writer's intentions mentioned in their question. Since the writer is trying to convince others to donate the amount they would usually spend on a McDonald's lunch, it would be inconsistent and counterproductive for the writer to consider getting lunch at McDonald's themselves. This choice would hinder the writer's objective to gather funds for the classroom in need. Option (b) suggests that the writer might ask what the money goes toward. While this is a valid concern for a potential donor, the writer already seems committed to the cause, assuming they have sufficient knowledge about the donation's recipients and its impact on the classroom in need. Thus, this option may not be as plausible as option (c), given the writer's implicit understanding of the cause. Option (d) refers to the writer asking if the goal was met.

Write an article based on this summary: Veteran Labour MP Paul Flynn has said the party must overcome public \\"contempt\\" for the political system to recover from its election defeat. Article:","completion":"Title: Rebuilding Trust: Labour's Path to Recovery after Election Defeat Introduction: The UK's recent general election led to a devastating defeat for the Labour Party, and left many of its members questioning the way forward. Veteran Labour MP Paul Flynn has pointed out one of the key factors for the party to consider on the road to recovery: overcoming public \\"contempt\\" for the political system. Here, we explore the reasons behind this sentiment and what the Labour Party can do to regain voter confidence and improve its chances for future success. Understanding the Public's Contempt: The feeling of distaste and mistrust towards the political system is not exclusive to Labour supporters. The sentiment appears to be fed by multiple factors, including political polarization, lack of transparency, and corruption. The rise of populist movements and the Brexit referendum have further enhanced the disillusionment of some voters with the political system. Mr. Flynn recognizes that the task ahead is not just about winning back support, but rebuilding fundamental trust in the political process. Steps Labour Can Take to Overcome Public Contempt: 1. Strengthening internal democracy and transparency: The Labour Party must strive to create a culture of inclusiveness and become a model of transparency in decision-making processes. Adopting measures like enabling members to have a greater say in the party's policies and leadership, as well as seeking external oversight, will inspire confidence among the electorate that Labour is open to change and improvement. 2. Prioritizing policies with a wider appeal: Crafting policies that can resonate with a broader spectrum of the electorate is crucial to rebuilding support. The party should steer clear of ideological extremes and focus on pragmatic policies that benefit a variety of social and economic groups. Examples include focusing on affordable housing, investment in public infrastructure, and social policies that nurture social cohesion and inclusivity. 3. Establishing a responsive leadership: An effective leadership structure is essential for building trust with the public. Labour must ensure it has a leader who communicates with clarity, empathy, and sincerity. Displaying authenticity, responsiveness to concerns, and a willingness to listen and adapt will go a long way in rebuilding the trustworthiness of the party. 4. Engaging constructively with the media: One of the key challenges for Labour is to address the predominantly negative portrayal of the party in the media. Cultivating a more positive relationship with the media starts with mutual respect and understanding. Being transparent, accountable, and accessible are essential foundations for establishing a more constructive rapport with the media, which in turn will help shift public perceptions of the party. 5. Fostering grassroots activism and community-building: Building a stronger connection with the electorate is vital to reestablishing trust. Fostering grassroots activism through local Labour Party branches can help engage voters who feel disconnected from the political process. Engaging with the community in meaningful ways, such as volunteering, organizing workshops, and listening to the needs and concerns of residents, will contribute to a more favorable view of the party. Conclusion: Recovering from the recent election defeat will be a long and arduous process for the Labour Party. However, by addressing the core issue of public contempt for the political system, Labour has the opportunity to rebuild trust and restore its reputation. Through improved transparency, strong leadership, pragmatic policies, positive media engagement, and genuine grassroots activism, the party can pave the way for better electoral fortunes in the future."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid. According to the above context, answer the following question. Barend is infamous for? Available options: [a]. Being friends with the narrator. [b]. Inventing the foldable map.

By 1930 raw-material production had tripled the figure of 1900, manufactured goods had increased twelve-fold, and heavy industry was galloping towards maturity. Britain led the World War I Ailies in large orders for munitions, while Japan expanded sales of manufactured goods to Asian and other markets cut off from their usual European suppliers. Merchant shipping doubled in size and increased its income ten-fold as the European fleets were destroyed. Setbacks in the 1930s caused by the European postwar slump were only a spur to redouble efforts by diversifying heavy industry into the machine-making, metallurgical, and chemical sectors. Even the terrible 1923 Tokyo earthquake, which cost over 100,000 lives and billions of dollars, provided another stimulus due to the construction boom that followed. Riding the crest of this economic upsurge were the zaibatsu conglomerates — a dozen family-run combines, each involved in mining, manufacturing, marketing, shipping, and banking. These tightly controlled commercial pyramids were the true heirs to the old feudal structures. Japan's progress toward parliamentary democracy was halted in the 1930s by the growing nationalism being imposed on government by the generals and admirals. They proclaimed Japan's mission to bring progress to its backward Asian neighbors in language not so very different from that of the Europeans in Africa or the US in Latin America. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Soviet Union was regarded as a major threat to Japan's security, and the army felt it needed Manchuria and whatever other Chinese territory it could control as a buffer against Russian advances. In 1931 the Japanese occupied Manchuria. And then in 1937, with the popular support of ultra-right-wing groups, the army overrode parliamentary resistance in Tokyo and went to war against the Chinese Nationalists. By 1938, they held Nanking, Hankow, and Canton. Japanese expansionist policies were leading to direct confrontation with the West. Japan hoped that war in Europe would divert the Soviet Union from interference in East Asia, giving Japan a free hand both in China and, through its alliance with Germany, in French IndoChina after the defeat of France. The US responded to the Japanese invasion of IndoChina with a trade and fuel embargo, cutting off 90 percent of Japan's supplies. The result was the attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor (7 December 1941) and total war. After reading the above, is \\"Banking and shipping combines\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What were a few of the tightly controlled commercial pyramids in Japan?\\"?

Thompson was born into a middle-class family in Louisville, Kentucky, the first of three sons of Virginia Ray Davison (1908, Springfield, Kentucky - March 20, 1998, Louisville), who worked as head librarian at the Louisville Free Public Library and Jack Robert Thompson (September 4, 1893, Horse Cave, Kentucky - July 3, 1952, Louisville), a public insurance adjuster and World War I veteran. His parents were introduced to each other by a friend from Jack's fraternity at the University of Kentucky in September 1934, and married on November 2, 1935. Thompson's first name came from a purported ancestor on his mother's side, the Scottish surgeon John Hunter. Following the success of Hell's Angels, Thompson was able to publish articles in a number of well-known magazines during the late 1960s, including The New York Times Magazine, Esquire, Pageant, and Harper's. In the Times Magazine article, published in 1967, shortly before the \\"Summer of Love\\", and titled \\"The Hashbury is the Capital of the Hippies\\", Thompson wrote in-depth about the Hippies of San Francisco, deriding a culture that began to lack the political convictions of the New Left and the artistic core of the Beats, instead becoming overrun with newcomers lacking any purpose other than obtaining drugs. It was an observation on the 1960s' counterculture that Thompson would further examine in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and other articles. By late 1967, Thompson and his family moved back to Colorado and rented a house in Woody Creek, a small mountain hamlet outside Aspen. In early 1969, Thompson finally received a 15,000 royalty check for the paperback sales of Hell's Angels and used two-thirds of the money for a down payment on a modest home and property where he would live for the rest of his life. He named the house Owl Farm and often described it as his \\"fortified compound.\\" In early 1968, Thompson signed the \\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War. According to Thompson's letters and his later writings, at this time he planned to write a book called The Joint Chiefs about \\"the death of the American Dream.\\" He used a 6,000 advance from Random House to travel on the 1968 Presidential campaign trail and attend the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago for research purposes. From his hotel room in Chicago, Thompson watched the clashes between police and protesters, which he wrote had a great effect on his political views. The book was never finished, and the theme of the death of the American dream would be carried over into his later work. The contract with Random House was eventually fulfilled with the 1972 book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. He also signed a deal with Ballantine Books in 1968 to write a satirical book called The Johnson File about Lyndon B. Johnson. A few weeks after the contract was signed, however, Johnson announced that he would not run for re-election, and the deal was cancelled.

Soon after his arrival, strange things start to happen:01 - Animals follow Evan without any apparent reason. 02 - He grows a beard that is restored wholly every time he shaves. 03 - Eight vacant lots in Evan's neighborhood are purchased in his name. 04 - Ancient tools and wood are sent to his house. 05 - The number \\"614\\" appears everywhere he goes.Evan soon learns that the number indicates a verse in the book of Genesis, in which God instructs Noah to build an ark. Later, God (Morgan Freeman) appears and commands Evan to build a replica of Noah's Ark in preparation for a deluge. His family initially believe that he is having an extraordinary mid-life crisis; later, his sons suspect that something greater is occurring and assist him in the construction of the ark, although his wife Joan (Lauren Graham) does not. Reappearing, God tells Evan the flood will come at noon on September 22. Animals later follow Evan to Congress. When he explains the reason for this, Chuck Long suspends him.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the premise \\"A group of people white water raft on very choppy water.\\" true if \\"a couple was there\\"?","completion":"Your question seems to involve whether the presence of a couple at the given situation validates the premise \\"A group of people white water raft on very choppy water.\\" The term \\"group\\" is generally understood to mean three or more people. However, its interpretation may vary depending on the context. In a strictly numerical sense, a couple, which usually refers to two people, would not constitute a \\"group.\\" But in a more casual or general context, a couple might be considered as part of a group if other individuals are present. Also, if the couple is white water rafting together on very choppy water, they might be perceived as a small group in the given circumstance, but this might more commonly be phrased as a pair or a duo rather than a group. Conclusively, the statement \\"A group of people white water raft on very choppy water\\" can be perceived as true if a 'couple' was there along with at least one more individual, thereby making it a group of three or more people. However, if only the couple was present and no other individuals were involved, the couple alone wouldn't traditionally be considered as a group. Hence, in such context, the premise wouldn't be true. In summary, whether or not the given premise is true depends on the interpretation of the word 'group' and the context it's being used. In strict terms, a group typically denotes three or more people. Therefore, unless other individuals were present in addition to the couple, the premise is not entirely accurate. Conversely, in a more loose interpretation, or if other people are included, the scenario with the couple could comply with the premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"The reported sentencing of paralysis for a Saudi man as punishment for paralysing another man has been described as \\"outrageous\\" by a leading human rights group.\\"","completion":"Title: Saudi Paralysis Sentencing Draws Outrage and Highlights Need for Human Rights Reform Intro: The recent news of a Saudi man sentenced to paralysis as a punishment for causing paralysis to another man has stirred significant controversy worldwide. The Saudi legal system, which is primarily based on Sharia law, instituted this severe penalty as a form of qisas, or retributive justice. A leading human rights group has described the punishment as \\"outrageous,\\" highlighting the urgent need for reevaluation and reforms when it comes to administering justice in Saudi Arabia. The Issue of Retributive Justice: The principle of qisas is deeply entrenched in certain interpretations of Islamic law. It permits punishment that is equal to the harm initially caused, as long as the injured party or their family agrees to it. In other words, it operates under the ancient premise of \\"an eye for an eye.\\" However, critics argue that some punishments prescribed under qisas principles may be incompatible with modern humanitarian and ethical standards. For instance, various human rights organizations have vehemently objected to the amputation of hands, the use of flogging and the imposition of death by stoning, among other harsh penalties, within Saudi Arabia and other countries that adhere to fundamentalist interpretations of Sharia law. Outdated and Inhumane: The recent paralysis sentencing in Saudi Arabia is a prime example of how the application of qisas principles may clash with widely accepted human rights standards. Amnesty International, a leading human rights group, issued a statement condemning the sentence as \\"utterly shocking\\" and imploring the Saudi authorities to overturn the ruling immediately. The organization correctly points out that the notion of deliberately inflicting someone with paralysis is \\"outrageous\\" and tantamount to \\"torture.\\" Furthermore, the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment has defined torture as \\"any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person.\\" The convention prohibits such actions, regardless of the context or justification. Consequently, these global human rights instruments clearly stand in opposition to the principles underpinning the reported paralysis sentencing. Need for Reforms: As the world becomes more interconnected, global human rights standards must be consistently upheld. The rigid application of some qisas principles, as illustrated by the recent paralysis sentencing, only serves to undermine these vital norms. It is crucial for Saudi Arabia to undergo a thorough assessment of its legal system to better align its practices with international human rights standards. This process will likely include engaging in genuine dialogue with international partners and civil society organizations, adopting ratified international human rights conventions, and fundamentally reassessing the function of qisas within the broader legal framework. The goal should be to find an appropriate balance between respecting cultural and religious traditions while promoting the dignity and rights of all individuals within the country's jurisdiction. Among the necessary reforms would be examining the role of judges in the application of these principles and ensuring they have adequate training in human rights and international law. In addition, the government should draft and implement new provisions and guidelines to prevent punishments that are unequivocally deemed cruel and inhuman. Conclusion: The paralysis sentencing of a Saudi man in response to paralyzing another person, although prescribed under traditional qisas principles, has righteously garnered global outrage. It is a stark reminder that, while national legal systems may have their bases in cultural and religious contexts, they must also evolve alongside contemporary notions of human rights and justice. For Saudi Arabia, as well as other countries that adhere to strict interpretations of Sharia law, this case presents an opportunity to critically analyze their legal frameworks and work towards building a more humane and just society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How is \\"Cutter looked at the corpse.\\" said in Czech?","completion":"In Czech, the sentence \\"Cutter looked at the corpse\\" can be translated as \\"Cutter se podíval na mrtvolu.\\" Let's break down the sentence and its components for a better understanding: 1. \\"Cutter\\" - The name stays the same in Czech as it is a proper noun. 2. \\"looked at\\" - In Czech, the verb \\"to look at\\" can be translated as \\"podívat se na\\" or \\"dívat se na.\\" In this case, since it's in the past tense, we will use \\"podíval se na.\\" 3. \\"the corpse\\" - The word \\"corpse\\" in Czech is \\"mrtvola.\\" The noun remains unchanged, and the article \\"the\\" is not used in Czech, as the language generally doesn't utilize definite articles like English does. So when you put it all together, the sentence \\"Cutter looked at the corpse\\" becomes \\"Cutter se podíval na mrtvolu\\" in Czech.

The city has an estimated population of 274,400 as of 2016, or 70 percent of the entire population of the Bahamas. Lynden Pindling International Airport, the major airport for the Bahamas, is located about west of Nassau city centre, and has daily flights to major cities in the United States, the Caribbean, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The city is located on the island of New Providence, which functions much like a business district. Nassau is the site of the House of Assembly and various judicial departments and was considered historically to be a stronghold of pirates. The city was named in honour of William III of England, Prince of Orange-Nassau. - The Olympic Games (\\"Olympia\\", \\"the Olympics\\" also \\"the Olympiad\\") were a series of athletic competitions among representatives of city-states and one of the Panhellenic Games of Ancient Greece. They were held in honor of Zeus, and the Greeks gave them a mythological origin. The first Olympics is traditionally dated to 776 BC. They continued to be celebrated when Greece came under Roman rule, until the emperor Theodosius I suppressed them in 393 AD as part of the campaign to impose Christianity as the State religion of Rome. The games were held every four years, or \\"olympiad\\", which became a unit of time in historical chronologies. - Dominic Demeritte ( born February 22 , 1978 in Nassau , Bahamas ) is a track and field sprinter who specializes in the 200 metres . - The Bahamas, known officially as the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, is an archipelagic state within the Lucayan Archipelago. It consists of more than 700 islands, cays, and islets in the Atlantic Ocean and is located north of Cuba and Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic); northwest of the Turks and Caicos Islands; southeast of the US state of Florida and east of the Florida Keys. The state capital is Nassau on the island of New Providence. The designation of \\"The Bahamas\\" can refer to either the country or the larger island chain that it shares with the Turks and Caicos Islands. As stated in the mandate/manifesto of the Royal Bahamas Defence Force, the Bahamas territory encompasses of ocean space. - Cross country running is a sport in which teams and individuals run a race on open-air courses over natural terrain such as dirt or grass. Sometimes the runners are referred to as \\"harriers\\" (dogs). The course, typically long, may include surfaces of grass, and earth, pass through woodlands and open country, and include hills, flat ground and sometimes gravel road. It is both an individual and a team sport; runners are judged on individual times and teams by a points-scoring method. Both men and women of all ages compete in cross country, which usually takes place during autumn and winter, and can include weather conditions of rain, sleet, snow or hail, and a wide range of temperatures. - The Caribbean (or ) is a region that consists of the Caribbean Sea, its islands (some surrounded by the Caribbean Sea and some bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean) and the surrounding coasts. The region is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico and the North American mainland, east of Central America, and north of South America. - New Providence is the most populous island in the Bahamas, containing more than 70% of the total population. It houses the national capital city of Nassau. The island was originally under Spanish control following Christopher Columbus's discovery of the New World, but the Spanish government showed little interest in developing the island (and the Bahamas as a whole). Nassau, the island's largest city, was formerly known as Charles-town, but it was burned to the ground by the Spanish in 1684. It was laid out and renamed Nassau in 1695 by Nicholas Trott, the most successful Lord Proprietor, in honor of the Prince of Orange-Nassau who became William III of England. The three branches of Bahamian Government: the executive, the legislative, and the judiciary, are all headquartered on New Providence. New Providence functions as the main commercial hub of the Bahamas. It is also home to more than 400 banks and trust companies, and its hotels and port account for more than two thirds of the four million-plus tourists who visit the Bahamas annually. Other settlements on New Providence include Grants Town, Bain Town, Fox Hill, Adelaide, Yamacraw, South Beach, Coral Harbour, Lyford Cay, Paradise Island, Sea Breeze, Centreville, The Grove (South) and The Grove (West Bay), Cable Beach, Delaporte, Gambier, and Love Beach. - Track and field is a sport which includes athletic contests established on the skills of running, jumping, and throwing. The name is derived from the sport's typical venue: a stadium with an oval running track enclosing a grass field where the throwing and jumping events take place. Track and field is categorised under the umbrella sport of athletics, which also includes road running, cross country running, and race walking. - The 200 metres (also spelled 200 meters) is a sprint running event. On an outdoor 400 m track, the race begins on the curve and ends on the home straight, so a combination of techniques are needed to successfully run the race. A slightly shorter race, called the \\"stadion\\" and run on a straight track, was the first recorded event at the ancient Olympic Games. The 200 m places more emphasis on speed endurance than shorter sprint distances as athletes rely on different energy systems during the longer sprint. - Lynden Pindling International Airport , formerly known as Nassau International Airport, is the largest airport in the Bahamas and the largest international gateway into the country.

Kedward is found guilty of witchcraft, banished from the village during a particularly harsh winter, and presumed dead. By midwinter, all of Kedward's accusers, along with half of the town's children, vanish. Fearing a curse, the townspeople flee Blair and vow never to utter Elly Kedward's name again.In 1825, 11 witnesses testify to seeing a pale woman's hand reach up and pull ten-year-old Eileen Treacle into Tappy East Creek.

We do this by dividing both sides by -270: 0 / -270 = (-270*y + 14850) / -270 Which simplifies to: 0 = y - 55 Now, to get 'y' by itself, we add 55 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 55 = y So, the value of 'y' is: y = 55"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Are Rich Donors Ruining Higher Education? Rarely in our history have the rich been so unpopular with the public. Thus, it probably was inevitable that even their good deeds–namely philanthropy–would come under sharp criticism. First came the critiques of the Gates-Buffett Giving Pledge. Now comes a book called “The Trouble with Billionaires,” from a Canadian tax-law professor and a Canadian journalist, who say that philanthropy by the elite could be bad for society, especially for education. In an excerpt in the Toronto Star, Star columnist Linda McQuaig and tax law professor Neil Brooks cite the example of the University of Toronto. In recent years, as government cut funding to education, the university turned more and more to the rich to fund its expansion. It has pulled in more than 120 million from wealthy alum and benefactors in just the past five years, according to the book. A good thing? Not so, say the pair. As a result of the alms from the elite, the university has become “a showcase for the wealthy,” where people such as pharmaceutical businessmen Leslie Dan, mining chief Peter Munk and merchant banker Joseph Rotman get buildings named after them and countless honors and plaques. Meanwhile, they say, “genuine heros” such as Tommy Douglas–considered the father of Canadas health-care system and voted in a 2004 TV poll as the greatest Canadian of all time–don’t get their names on anything at the University. The result of this dependence on the rich is that “the priorities of the university have been skewed towards areas that interest the elites,” says Paul Hamel, a biologist in the UofT Faculty of Medicine and backer of an effort to name the university’s Health Studies Program after Mr. Douglas, “rather than towards the priorities of faculty, staff and students who are engaged in critical analysis, research and teaching.” It is true that the wealthy, or anyone else for that matter, fund things that matter to them. And their money inevitably comes with influence. But the idea that the rich are crowding out true intellect and heroes from our universities seems hard to prove. It also assumes that if the rich werent paying for new buildings, new education programs and scholarships that governments would be doing more. Unfortunately, that doesnt seem to be the case–either in Canada or the U.S. Good educations cost money. Like it or not (and most dont), the wealthy are among the few that can supply that right now. Would universities be better off if the wealthy spent their money only on yachts and planes rather than global-studies programs? Do you think the wealthy have “crowded out” the ideas and people that matter most to universities? What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"This text talks about how some people believe that rich donors might be causing problems for higher education, especially universities. They give an example of the University of Toronto, where they say the university has become a \\"showcase for the wealthy.\\" Rich people donate money and get buildings named after them, while other important people like Tommy Douglas, who helped create Canada's healthcare system, don't get recognized. The text also mentions that rich people might influence what a university focuses on, instead of what the faculty or students want. But, it's also important to remember that universities need money for good education, and rich people can help provide that when the government doesn't."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information: - The Varsity Match is an annual rugby union fixture played between the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in England. The event began in 1872, with interruptions only for the two World Wars. Since 1921, the game has been played at Twickenham Stadium, London. It is normally played in early December. - The University of Oxford (informally Oxford University or simply Oxford) is a collegiate research university located in Oxford, England, United Kingdom. While having no known date of foundation, there is evidence of teaching as far back as 1096, making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation. It grew rapidly from 1167 when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris. After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled northeast to Cambridge where they established what became the University of Cambridge. The two \\"ancient universities\\" are frequently jointly referred to as \\"Oxbridge\\". - The University of Paris, metonymically known as the Sorbonne (its historical house), was a university in Paris, France. Appearing around 1150 as a corporation associated with the Notre Dame de Paris cathedral school, it was the second-oldest modern university in Europe. Chartered in 1200 by King Philip II (Philippe-Auguste) of France and recognised in 1215 by Pope Innocent III, it was often nicknamed after its theology collegiate institution, College of Sorbonne, founded about 1257 by Robert de Sorbon. - The Oxford University Rugby Football Club ( Oxford University RFC or OURFC ) is the rugby union club of the University of Oxford . The club contests The Varsity Match every year against Cambridge University at Twickenham . - Rugby is a type of football developed at Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire, one of many versions of football played at English public schools in the 19th century. The two main types of rugby are rugby league and rugby union. Although rugby league initially used rugby union rules, they are now wholly separate sports. - Approximately 330 to 360 million people speak English as their first language. More than half of these (231 million) live in the United States, followed by some 55 million in England, the first place where English was spoken. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - A team sport includes any sport which involves two or more players working together towards a shared objective. A team sport is an activity in which individuals are organized into opposing teams which compete to win. Examples are basketball, volleyball, water polo, handball, lacrosse, cricket, baseball, and the various forms of football and hockey. - Oxford is a city in the South East region of England and the county town of Oxfordshire. With a population of 159,994 it is the 52nd largest city in the United Kingdom, and one of the fastest growing and most ethnically diverse. The city is situated from London, from Bristol, from both Southampton and Birmingham and from Reading. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Cambridge is a university city and the county town of Cambridgeshire, England, on the River Cam about north of London. At the United Kingdom Census 2011, its population was 123,867, including 24,488 students. - Twickenham Stadium (usually known as Twickenham or Twickers) is a rugby union stadium in Twickenham, south west London, England. Owned by the governing body of rugby union in England, the Rugby Football Union (the RFU), the stadium hosts home test matches for the England national rugby union team. Other rugby union games played at the stadium include the Middlesex Sevens, the Aviva Premiership final, the LV Cup, the Varsity Match between the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and European Rugby Champions Cup matches. The RFU headquarters are based in the stadium. - A try is a way of scoring points in rugby union and rugby league football. A try is scored by grounding the ball (the ball must be touching the player when coming into contact with the ground) in the opposition's in-goal area (on or behind the goal line). Rugby union and league differ slightly in defining 'grounding the ball' and the 'in-goal' area. - Rugby union, or simply rugby, is a contact team sport which originated in England in the first half of the 19th century. One of the two codes of rugby football, it is based on running with the ball in hand. In its most common form, a game is between two teams of 15 players using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field with H-shaped goalposts on each try line. - Oxbridge is a portmanteau (blend word) of the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. The term is used to refer to them collectively in contrast to other British universities and more broadly to describe characteristics reminiscent of them, often with implications of superior social or intellectual status. - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking.

Sentence from a movie review: sickeningly savage Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","completion":"Based on the sentence provided from the movie review, it seems that the movie was seen negatively. To break it down, let's examine the words used in the sentence: \\"sickeningly savage.\\" The first word, \\"sickeningly,\\" is an adverb that suggests a sense of disgust or revulsion. This word typically has a strong negative connotation, indicating that the reviewer found some aspects of the movie repulsive or difficult to watch. The second word, \\"savage,\\" is an adjective that can mean violent, uncontrolled, or brutal. This word also tends to have negative connotations, suggesting that the reviewer found the movie excessively violent or harsh in nature. When combined, \\"sickeningly savage\\" paints a picture of a movie that the reviewer found to be disturbingly violent or cruel. It is important to note, however, that this perception could be influenced by personal preferences and levels of tolerance for violent content. For some individuals, this description might discourage them from watching the movie, while others could view this phrasing as a challenge to see just how intense or thrilling the film might be. Nonetheless, given the negative implications of the words used, it is reasonable to conclude that the movie was seen negatively based on the preceding review. Critics and moviegoers who come across this review might anticipate a film with unsettling content and may decide to avoid watching it based on this alone. Of course, a more comprehensive analysis of the movie would require a broader understanding of the entire review or even watching the film for oneself to form a precise opinion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it; although this claim has been widely disputed. Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird. According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: \\"They discussed publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.\\" This assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert James S. Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee's attorney and found them to be only another draft of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". The statement was also contrary to Jonathan Mahler's description of how \\"Watchman\\" was seen as just the first draft of \\"Mockingbird\\". Instances where many passages overlap between the two books, in some case word for word, also refutes this assertion.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","completion":"Certainly! The answer to the question \\"Where is Scout when Go Set a Watchman begins?\\" can be found in the provided text. In Go Set a Watchman, which is an earlier draft of To Kill a Mockingbird and not a direct continuation of the narrative, the story follows an adult Scout Finch. When the novel begins, Scout has traveled from New York to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama. During this visit, she is confronted by the intolerance present in her community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. You are given a new situation: Dee and Ann were two cousins. Ann lived in a mountain village at 8000 ft altitude, while Dee lived in a coastal town at sea level. and a hint : Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate. (See Milankovitch cycles).The uneven solar heating (the formation of zones of temperature and moisture gradients, or frontogenesis) can also be due to the weather itself in the form of cloudiness and precipitation. Higher altitudes are typically cooler than lower altitudes, which the result of higher surface temperature and radiational heating, which produces the adiabatic lapse rate. In some situations, the temperature actually increases with height. This phenomenon is known as an inversion and can cause mountaintops to be warmer than the valleys below. Inversions can lead to the formation of fog and often act as a cap that suppresses thunderstorm development. On local scales, temperature differences can occur because different surfaces (such as oceans, forests, ice sheets, or man-made objects) have differing physical characteristics such as reflectivity, roughness, or moisture content. Please answer this question : Which cousin experienced more thunderstorms?","completion":"Based on the given information, Dee, who lived in the coastal town at sea level, likely experienced more thunderstorms. There are a few reasons for this: 1. The temperature differences at lower altitudes, like coastal towns, tend to be higher than at higher altitudes, such as mountain villages. This results in warm, moist air at lower altitudes (provided by oceanic bodies) rising and forming clouds and precipitation. This convective activity is one of the primary drivers for thunderstorm development. 2. The mention of temperature inversions at higher altitudes, which can cause mountaintops to be warmer than the valleys below, leads to the suppression of thunderstorm development. Since Ann lives in a mountain village at 8000 ft altitude, temperature inversions might make it less likely for her to experience thunderstorms as they can act as a cap that prevents their formation. 3. Coastal areas generally have a greater availability of moisture due to their proximity to large bodies of water. This moisture, when combined with the effects of temperature, can lead to the development of thunderstorms. Though local and regional variations can play a role in the frequency and intensity of thunderstorms, overall, it is more likely that Dee experienced more thunderstorms in the coastal town compared to Ann in the mountain village."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Katrina bought a safety harness for the child to feel more secure..","completion":"Megan knew that Katrina would panic if they lost their child at the mall. So Megan decided to take matters into her own hands and bought a safety harness for the child to feel more secure. Their child, Lila, was a curious little one with a knack for wandering off. Megan had witnessed Katrina's anxiety skyrocket when Lila disappeared from sight in public places before, and she was determined to avoid a repeat of those stressful situations. Megan searched high and low for the perfect safety harness for Lila. She wanted something comfortable, durable, and easy to use so that they could focus more on enjoying their time together while shopping without having to constantly worry about their daughter's whereabouts. After weeks of browsing online shops and scouring through parent forums, Megan finally came across a well-reviewed, adjustable harness that she deemed suitable. The day the harness arrived, Megan excitedly presented her findings to Katrina. At first, Katrina was skeptical about the idea of tethering her child to her like a leash, but Megan explained that this was actually a measure to keep both Lila and Katrina safe. After all, public places can be unpredictable, and their sweet, adventurous daughter might feel the lure of something new, for example, a colorful toy in a store or an interesting stranger. Megan assured Katrina that giving Lila a sense of independence while also ensuring her safety was the ultimate goal of the harness. Katrina eventually warmed to the idea and decided to give the safety harness a try. She was pleasantly surprised by the ease of use, simple design, and comfortable fit. Lila didn't even seem to notice that her newfound freedom had some limits. Over time, the harness became an essential part of their outings, making the trips to the mall much more enjoyable and far less worrisome for both Megan and Katrina. What's more, they noticed a visible difference in Lila's behavior. With the harness, Lila felt more secure and seemed to understand that she couldn't go too far from her moms, despite her ongoing curiosity. The recurrent panic that had trouble Katrina every time Lila disappeared from view was gradually diminishing, allowing the family to focus on the quality time they spent together. Megan was proud of the choice she made in purchasing the safety harness for their child. She knew that, despite initial hesitation, the benefits far outweighed any negative stigma that using such a device might carry. Thanks to her proactive approach and commitment to family safety, both Megan and Katrina could relish in the peace of mind that comes with knowing their child was safely nearby at all times."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Nothing strange about that, you might think - clean-cut teen stars are the staple diet of the music industry. But, crucially, both artists were signed before they'd proved their ability to play in front of an audience. Bieber was discovered through his YouTube channel, while Mendes amassed 3.8 million followers on the video-sharing app Vine. They're not alone. The Weeknd, Jessie J, 5 Seconds of Summer, Halsey and Soulja Boy all built an audience online before eager record labels snapped them (and their fanbases) up. Canadian star Alessia Cara, who recently came second in the BBC Sound of 2016, is a typical YouTuber. She amassed millions of views for cover versions of Jessie J and Lorde - but she hadn't performed in public until she auditioned for her management company in New York. \\"It was so scary because that was probably one of the first times I really sang in front of anyone,\\" she told the BBC. \\"It was terrifying - but I did it.\\" But with so many artists emerging this way, what happens to the dingy pubs and sweat-soaked clubs that used to be the lifeblood of the music industry? The statistics don't look good. In London alone, 35% of small venues have shut in the last decade. Places like the Sheffield Boardwalk, the Princess Charlotte in Leicester and the Cockpit in Leeds have also shut their doors in recent years. The cull of club culture has prompted a new initiative, Independent Venue Week, which aims to remind people of the value of live music. \\"It's very easy to take small venues for granted,\\" the event's founder, Sybil Bell, told BBC 6 Music. \\"What's happened recently, with a lot of venues closing, is that people are jumping up and saying, 'we need to save our venues'. But what would be more productive is if they went to the venues more frequently before that even became the case.\\" She says people have become lazy, streaming shows at home, or liking bands on Facebook instead of watching them at a local venue. \\"There's no night on your sofa that's better than a night out at a gig,\\" she protests. \\"You never know who you're going to see, you don't know how great the band is going to be, you never know if they're going to mess up and recover. There's a real romance to it.\\" \\"It's really sad to see these places closing,\\" agrees Brit Award winner Mark Ronson. \\"They're incredibly important to a band on the way up. Even The Beatles played 10,000 hours in Hamburg. Bands need those spaces to practise.\\" \\"They're integral to being able to grow as a performer,\\" agrees Jack Garratt, who recently supported Mumford and Sons on tour, after crafting his show at 200-capacity venues. \\"You have to start small to understand what needs to happen when you get bigger. Without that grounding, you don't have the ability to go onto a bigger stage and entertain the person way back at the end of the room.\\" Yannis Philippakis, frontman of rock band Foals, says the Oxford venues where his band learned their trade - The Wheatsheaf and The Cellar - are still around, but he worries for the future. \\"They were the places we cut our teeth [but] without the oxygen they afford young bands, you can't expect Britain to be able to create great music like it has been doing. \\"If you cut that beginning step out, the things that will filter to the top will come through other avenues, whether that's X Factor or whatever.\\" But is that really the case? Maybe not. Everyone we spoke to in the music industry said live venues were still a crucial testing ground. \\"Personally I would never sign a band without seeing them live,\\" says Chris McCourt, who helps find and develop new talent for Atlantic Records. \\"Live music is the band's bread and butter these days, and if they can't play live, I don't think they're going to have a career. \\"On our roster, Ed Sheeran is probably the shining light for what constantly touring can bring you.\\" Indeed, the star says he couldn't have sold out three nights at Wembley Stadium last year without paying his dues on the \\"toilet circuit\\" (a network of venues so small that bands have to get changed in the lavatory. Either that, or they smell like toilets). \\"I feel like I've done every venue on the ladder in England,\\" Sheeran told the BBC last year. \\"My first ever gig was above a place called the Liberties Bar in Camden. It was in an upstairs back room. I had no PA - it was unplugged to about 13 people.\\" After five years of learning his craft, the star knew how to hold people's attention without expensive light shows, or even a full band. \\"The UK is a very unforgiving audience,\\" he says. \\"If you mess up, people here will say: '£50 to go and see him? We probably shouldn't do that again'.\\" One of the first people to spot Sheeran's potential was Jamal Edwards MBE - the entrepreneur and owner of multi-million pound YouTube channel SBTV. He featured the singer in 2010, a year before his first record deal, and has also helped break artists such as Tinchy Stryder, Jessie J and Wretch 32. But although his channel exists exclusively online, he insists on seeing new bands perform live first. \\"I first saw Ed Sheeran in the Proud Galleries. I first saw Jessie J live in a club on Brick Lane. Sometimes I go to open mic nights. I think it's important. You experience whether someone can actually sing when you go to live music events.\\" \\"Every artist I've worked with, they've built themselves up doing their stuff on their YouTube channel, then when they're ready to take it into a live music space, they've got a following who'll go with them to that show.\\" It's a pattern he's followed himself - putting on \\"SBTV Presents\\" nights at clubs and festivals around the UK. \\"I feel it connects people,\\" he says. \\"The audience might not have met each other but they have the same interests, they watch SBTV, they can bond for a few hours. So it's important.\\" The 25-year-old, who was appointed MBE last year, says he has seen dozens of his old haunts shut down in recent years. \\"It's crazy. The events that get put on at these clubs have to move - and that's very disruptive. But there are still a few left that we need to make sure can carry on.\\" Rock band Wolf Alice agree. \\"In London at the moment, the rate they're closing is shocking,\\" says bassist Theo Ellis, \\"especially the independently run ones\\". \\"I think it's important to spread awareness that it's happening. A lot of people don't realise - and then one week their favourite venue will be a flat.\\" Steve Lamacq's BBC 6 Music show is touring the UK this week to take the temperature of the live music scene. Listen to the programmes on the 6 Music website and iPlayer.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: Martin Luther King Jr. was held in the Birmingham jail and was denied a consultation with an attorney from the NAACP without guards present. When historian Jonathan Bass wrote of the incident in 2001, he noted that news of King's incarceration was spread quickly by Wyatt Tee Walker, as planned. King's supporters sent telegrams about his arrest to the White House. He could have been released on bail at any time, and jail administrators wished him to be released as soon as possible to avoid the media attention while King was in custody. However, campaign organizers offered no bail in order \\"to focus the attention of the media and national public opinion on the Birmingham situation\\".Twenty-four hours after his arrest, King was allowed to see local attorneys from the SCLC. When Coretta Scott King did not hear from her husband, she called Walker and he suggested that she call President Kennedy directly. Mrs. King was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child when she received a call from President Kennedy the Monday after the arrest. The president told her she could expect a call from her husband soon. When Martin Luther King Jr. called his wife, their conversation was brief and guarded; he correctly assumed that his phones were tapped. Several days later, Jacqueline Kennedy called Coretta Scott King to express her concern for King while he was incarcerated.Using scraps of paper given to him by a janitor, notes written on the margins of a newspaper, and later a legal pad given to him by SCLC attorneys, King wrote his essay \\"Letter from Birmingham Jail\\". It responded to eight politically moderate white clergymen who accused King of agitating local residents and not giving the incoming mayor a chance to make any changes. Bass suggested that \\"Letter from Birmingham Jail\\" was pre-planned, as was every move King and his associates made in Birmingham. The essay was a culmination of many of King's ideas, which he had touched on in earlier writings. King's arrest attracted national attention, including... Guess a valid title for it!

Appended to the last book, however, is a self-contained essay on aesthetics, which Durer worked on between 1512 and 1528, and it is here that we learn of his theories concerning 'ideal beauty'. Durer rejected Alberti's concept of an objective beauty, proposing a relativist notion of beauty based on variety. Nonetheless, Durer still believed that truth was hidden within nature, and that there were rules which ordered beauty, even though he found it difficult to define the criteria for such a code. In 1512/13 his three criteria were function ('Nutz'), naive approval ('Wohlgefallen') and the happy medium ('Mittelmass'). However, unlike Alberti and Leonardo, Durer was most troubled by understanding not just the abstract notions of beauty but also as to how an artist can create beautiful images. Between 1512 and the final draft in 1528, Durer's belief developed from an understanding of human creativity as spontaneous or inspired to a concept of 'selective inward synthesis'. In other words, that an artist builds on a wealth of visual experiences in order to imagine beautiful things. Durer's belief in the abilities of a single artist over inspiration prompted him to assert that \\"one man may sketch something with his pen on half a sheet of paper in one day, or may cut it into a tiny piece of wood with his little iron, and it turns out to be better and more artistic than another's work at which its author labours with the utmost diligence for a whole year.\\" Question: \\"What was one of Durer's theories concerning 'ideal beauty?'\\" Response: \\"He believe that believed that truth was hidden within nature, and that there were rules which ordered beauty\\" Select from the following. +no. +yes.

Clinton is in the country to participate in the India Today Conclave, where she claimed President Donald Trump only won the election because he go the support of people she famously called “deplorables.” Clinton was attempting to walk down a flight of stairs without a railing when she nearly went down, twice. Relying heavily on a member of her entourage for support, Clinton slipped and nearly fell. A second aide then came to help, taking her by her other arm. She then slipped again and was saved by both men. She eventually made it to the bottom of the stairs. Watch: This isn’t the first time Clinton has had balance issues and required the aid of others to avoid falling. During the 2016 campaign, Clinton had to leave a 9/11 memorial early and was filmed collapsing on the curb while attempting to enter a van. Secret Service agents kept her from falling to the ground and loaded her into the vehicle. Watch: The incident was blamed on pneumonia, and Clinton was filmed walking out of her daughter Chelsea’s apartment in New York City later that day, though she did leave the campaign trail for a few days to recover. Former President Bill Clinton, in an interview after her memorial collapse, said that Hillary had fainted “on more than one occasion,” blaming dehydration for the episodes. ||||| Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton told a receptive audience over the weekend in India that while she thought President Donald Trump played to some of Americans' worst fears, he does not reflect the country as a whole. \\"No, we did not deserve that,\\" Clinton said when asked if the US \\"deserves\\" Trump as its leader. Clinton called the 2016 presidential race the \\"first reality TV campaign,\\" and said Trump, as a bombastic \\"reality TV candidate,\\" was able to win over enough of the audience to win the election. And in comments seized on by the Republican National Committee, Clinton said she had won sections of the country with more economic output and attributed some of Trump's insurgent victory to a series of social and economic anxieties and discriminatory attitudes among his supporters. \\"I won the places that represent two-thirds of America's gross domestic product,\\" Clinton said. \\"So I won the places that are optimistic, diverse, dynamic, moving forward. And his whole campaign, 'Make America Great Again,' was looking backwards.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: James noticed that people who communicate well have fewer problems. Some people communicate easily with strangers, others need to talk with members of their own groups. A religion is a type of group. What do members of a religion have in common? Possible A: believe in god, talk to each other, pay bills, learn from each other, believe in ghosts Why is \\"believe in god\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Believe in God\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because religion, in its most basic definition, centers around a shared system of faith and worship that usually involves belief in a higher power or divine entity. This answer reflects a key attribute that unites individuals who belong to a particular religious group and provides a point of commonality that forms the basis for their communication and sense of community. When we look at various world religions, such as Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and others, the belief in a divine or supreme being or force is fundamental to their teachings and practices. While the specific attributes and nature of this divine being may vary significantly depending on the particular religion, this core conviction about the existence of a deity is consistent across many faiths. Besides the belief in a higher power, members of a religious group often share elements such as rituals, traditions, customs, moral and ethical values, and spiritual perspectives on life, death, and the meaning of existence. These shared elements help lay the foundation for strong and effective communication among the group members and facilitate an environment in which they can relate to one another's experiences and perspectives. Furthermore, human common sense recognizes that \\"believe in God\\" is an answer more relevant to the context of the question than the other given options. \\"Talk to each other\\" could relate to any social group, not just religious ones, while \\"pay bills\\" and \\"believe in ghosts\\" have little direct relevance to religion. \\"Learn from each other\\" might be a secondary characteristic of a religious group, as they share knowledge and values, but it is not the primary distinguishing feature that sets them apart from other groups. In conclusion, \\"believe in God\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it identifies the fundamental feature that unites members of a religious group and provides a plausible basis for their shared communication, bonding, and sense of belonging. It also stands out as the most relevant and representative characteristic when compared with the other possible answers provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Combine one part epsom salt with one part water.","completion":"Step 1: Gather materials To begin, gather the necessary materials, which include epsom salt, water, a small bowl or container, a measuring spoon, and a toothbrush. The measuring spoon will be used to measure the correct proportions of epsom salt and water. Step 2: Mix the solution Using a measuring spoon, pour an equal amount of epsom salt and water into the small bowl or container. This 1:1 ratio ensures that there is enough salt to maintain its benefits while not being overly abrasive to the teeth. Mix the two ingredients together to form a homogeneous solution. Step 3: Apply the mixture to the toothbrush Dip the bristles of the toothbrush into the solution so that they are adequately coated with epsom salt and water. Make sure to get a decent amount of the mixture on the toothbrush for effective cleaning. Step 4: Brush teeth Brush your teeth gently using a circular motion, ensuring that all tooth surfaces, including the front, back, and chewing surfaces, are covered. It's important not to press too hard, as epsom salt can be abrasive and might harm the tooth enamel if used with excessive force. Step 5: Rinse mouth After brushing your teeth with the epsom salt mixture for the usual recommended two minutes, thoroughly rinse your mouth with water to remove any remaining epsom salt residue. Step 6: Evaluate your teeth Take a moment to examine your teeth in the mirror, noting any enhanced brightness or whiteness. Regular use of the epsom salt mixture may improve the appearance of your teeth over time as well as help maintain good oral hygiene. Remember, using epsom salt for teeth cleaning should not replace regular toothpaste or dental visits. It's essential to consult with a dentist before adopting any new oral care routines, including brushing with epsom salt."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Latif comes from an upper-class family and had attended school with Uday, where the other students would remark on their likeness. Latif initially refuses the position, but is imprisoned and tortured, ultimately relenting when his family is threatened.Latif undergoes minor cosmetic surgery to perfect his resemblance to Uday and, over the next three years, practices emulating the young Hussein's mannerisms and wildly volatile persona. He is given access to all of the luxurious benefits of the Husseins' fortune, including massive palaces, expensive wardrobes and Uday's Ferrari Mondial 3.2 and various other exotic cars. Latif tries to resist Uday's exorbitant merrymaking and erratic behavior, at one point fleeing a nightclub in another of Uday's Ferraris to attempt to see his family, who believe he has died in the war. However, he is apprehended by Uday's bodyguards and beaten. After an appearance at a conference with several Kuwaiti leaders, an attempt is made on Uday's (Latif's) life, apparently by a member of a rebel opposition group, possibly a Kurd. The real Uday, though, is more concerned with the Kuwaitis, who he believes have been slant drilling from Iraq's Rumaila oil field. Iraq invads Kuwait in August 1990 which begins the First Gulf War. With the fall of Kuwait, Uday proclaims \\"The Age of the Sheikhs is over!\\"Uday's increasingly violent, sadistic tendencies are displayed when he kidnaps a 14 year-old school girl and forces her to escort him to a party. At the party, (based on an actual 1988 celebration honoring Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's wife Suzanne), the strung-out Uday becomes enraged with his father's personal bodyguard Kamel Hana Gegeo (Mehmet Ferda). Uday believes Gegeo facilitated an affair between Saddam and Samira Shahbandar,...

War work again brought local prosperity during World War II, this time centered on Boeing aircraft. The war dispersed the city's numerous Japanese-American businessmen due to the Japanese American internment. After the war, the local economy dipped. It rose again with Boeing's growing dominance in the commercial airliner market. Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair. Another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s, at a time when Boeing was heavily affected by the oil crises, loss of Government contracts, and costs and delays associated with the Boeing 747. Many people left the area to look for work elsewhere, and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading \\"Will the last person leaving Seattle – Turn out the lights.\\"Seattle remained the corporate headquarters of Boeing until 2001, when the company separated its headquarters from its major production facilities; the headquarters were moved to Chicago. The Seattle area is still home to Boeing's Renton narrow-body plant (where the 707, 720, 727, and 757 were assembled, and the 737 is assembled today) and Everett wide-body plant (assembly plant for the 747, 767, 777, and 787). The company's credit union for employees, BECU, remains based in the Seattle area, though it is now open to all residents of Washington. Another boom began as the city emerged from the Great Recession which commenced when Amazon.com moved its headquarters from North Beacon Hill to South Lake Union. This initiated a historic construction boom which resulted in the completion of almost 10,000 apartments in Seattle in 2017, which is more than any previous year and nearly twice as many as were built in 2016. Beginning in 2010, and for the next five years, Seattle gained an average of 14,511 residents per year, with the growth strongly skewed toward the center of the city, as unemployment dropped from roughly 9 percent to 3.6 percent.

Please answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - A selection of grapes are gathered - The grapes are washed - The stems are removed from the grapes - The grapes are crushed and added to a fermation container - Yeast is added to the container - The yeast eats the sugar in the yeast, releasing alcohol - Answer:","completion":"The missing first step in the winemaking process before the selection of grapes are gathered is to carefully choose and cultivate the grape variety and maintain the health of the vineyard, including the proper trellising, pruning, and management of the vines. This step is crucial, as the grape variety, vineyard management techniques, and environmental factors (e.g., climate, soil composition) will all influence the final characteristics of the wine produced. The selection of the grape variety involves researching and selecting the best grape type that is suitable for the given environmental conditions, desired wine flavor profile, and style of wine being produced. In addition to choosing the right grape variety, maintaining the health of the vineyard is essential to ensure that the grapes reach optimal ripeness and maintain their intended characteristics. This involves regular monitoring of the vines, soil, and weather conditions. Proper pruning, trellising, and canopy management are vital for the vines' growth and development, allowing them to receive sufficient sunlight, air circulation, and nutrients. During cultivation, efforts should be put in to manage pests, diseases, and weeds that could damage the grapes or vines. Various techniques, such as Integrated Pest Management (IPM), can be utilized to reduce the impact of pests and diseases on the vineyard. Moreover, growers closely monitor the vines to identify the optimal time for harvesting, depending on the desired sugar, acid, and flavor balance. The grapes are then handpicked or mechanically harvested during this time. In summary, the missing first step in the winemaking process is selecting the appropriate grape variety, cultivating the vineyard, and managing the vines to produce healthy and ripe grapes, which are essential for creating high-quality wine."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Blanche of Navarre, however, proved to be an incredibly strong and efficient regent, and had devoted herself for the past 15 years to ensuring the legal status of her son Theobald IV as rightful heir. Blanche was aided in securing her powerbase during the first few shakey years of her regency by the fact that so many lords and knights of the county, who might have posed a challenge to her, had left to fight on the Fourth Crusade from 1202 to 1204. Queen Mother Adèle of Champagne also took Blanche under her wing, giving Blanche vital counsel during the early years of her regency until Adèle's death in 1206 . By 1216, despite the fact that Erard rallied most of the local barons of the county against Blanche, she had built up such strong alliances with both King Philip II as well as Pope Innocent III that Erard never gained any official legal support for his claims. From the start of the conflict, Pope Innocent III began excommunicating rebel barons, negatively affecting their efforts. Further, while Theobald IV was still an underaged youth of 13 years, he had acquitted himself so valiantly in combat at the decisive Battle of Bouvines that King Philip II threw his full support behind him .

Given the question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Scientists Alan M.Goldberg and Thomas Hartung describe recent advances in replacing the use of animals in toxicology testing.Improvements in cell and tissue culture technologies,for example,allow a growing number of tests to be performed on human cells alone.Computer models are becoming increasingly complex and many could one day become more accurate than trials in living animals. Since the late 1990s,Huntingdon Life Sciences--a company that conducts testing of substances on animals conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration--has become a proving ground for aggressive strategies by animal-rights militants .At a hearing,a Senate.committee listened to testimony against Huntingdon employees and financial institutions providing services to the company.One experimentation witness at the hearing insisted that any means necessary were justified to spare animals' lives;he has previously accepted the idea of murder to that end. Use of animals in testing and in biomedical research continues to be necessary in many instances and is ethically preferable to experimenting on humans or giving up cures that could save human lives.But for the sake of people and animals alike,the development and acceptance of animal substitutes deserve enthusiastic support. In some instances, substitutes are already thought as good or better than animals,but supervising agencies have yet to catch up.In both the European Union and the U.S.,scientists and companies wanting to use the new alternative tests complain that regulatory standards for proving a drug or chemical to be safe for humans force the continued use of animals.Thus,animal-loving Americans might turn to persuading the EPA and the FDA to speed validation of new methods so that they can be more widely employed.And animal advocates who want to influence business could consider investing in the small biotech's and large pharmaceutical companies that are working to develop alternatives to animals in research. Question: _ plays a leading role in replacing the use of animals in testing. - Huntingdon Life Sciences - Improvement in technologies - Animal-fights militants - Scientists Alan and Thomas The answer is:","completion":"Improvement in technologies. The article phrases that advancements in cell and tissue culture technologies permit a growing number of tests to be performed on human cells instead of animals. Also, computer models are becoming increasingly sophisticated, potentially outperforming animal trials in accuracy one day. Therefore, technology improvements are playing a key role in the move away from using animals in testing. Huntingdon Life Sciences is indeed involved in animal testing, but the article does not present it as leading the change towards non-animal testing methods. Indeed, it seems to be a target for protests against animal testing. Animal rights militants are also not leading the change; they are more reactively protesting current practices. Lastly, while Scientists Alan and Thomas are describing these improvements and alternatives, there's no statement suggesting they're the ones directly developing or deploying these new technologies.

A year ago this week, Moon, a former human rights lawyer and candidate for the progressive Democratic Party, won a special presidential election held after former conservative President Park Geun-hye was impeached for her involvement in a bribery and corruption scandal. This year, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison during criminal trial related to the scandal in which she was charged with abuse of power, coercion and bribery. Moon assumed power at a time of increasing tensions, not just concerning North Korea’s accelerated nuclear and ballistic missile tests, but also China’s imposing of informal economic sanctions against South Korea for deploying the U.S. THAAD missile defense system, and the Trump administration’s talk of possible military action to end the North’s efforts to develop a nuclear armed intercontinental missile that could strike the U.S. mainland. In his inaugural address in May 2017, Moon promised to engage in shuttle diplomacy with Washington, Beijing and Pyongyang to work out a peaceful solution to the growing crisis. In a July speech in Berlin, President Moon laid out his vision for inter-Korean reconciliation that called for peaceful co-existence of the two Korean governments, but also said that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is “the absolute condition for peace.” But unlike past progressive South Korean governments that provided unconditional economic assistance, the Moon administration complied with economic sanctions in place and...

The only home Hamilton ever owned was a Federal style mansion designed by John McComb Jr., which he built on his 32-acre country estate in Hamilton Heights in upper Manhattan. He named the house, which was completed in 1802, the \\"Grange\\" after his grandfather Alexander's estate in Ayrshire, Scotland. The house remained in the family until 1833 when his widow sold it to Thomas E. Davis, a British born real estate developer, for 25,000. Part of the proceeds were used by Eliza to purchase a new townhouse from Davis (Hamilton-Holly House) in Greenwich Village with her son Alexander. The Grange, first moved from its original location in 1889, was moved again in 2008 to a spot in St. Nicholas Park on land that was once part of the Hamilton estate, in Hamilton Heights, a neighborhood in upper Manhattan. The historic structure was restored to its original 1802 appearance in 2011, and is maintained by the National Park service as Hamilton Grange National Memorial. Alexander Hamilton served as one of the first trustees of the Hamilton-Oneida Academy in New York state.

Answer the following question: Process: - Your thermostat senses that the room temperature has fallen below your thermostat setting - Your thermostat sends a signal to your heating system to provide heat for your home - When your oil burner is engaged, heating oil travels from the tank to the burner by way of a pump - Here the oil becomes a fine mist mixed with air - The fuel/air mixture is then injected into the burner where it is ignited in the combustion chamber - The warm air is disbursed through vents, hot water through baseboards, or by steam radiators - suppose \\"Its a cold winter\\" happens, how will it affect more heating oil travels from the tank to the burner. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"In the given scenario, \\"It's a cold winter\\" would indirectly impact a step of the process. Specifically, it would influence the rate at which the room temperature falls below the thermostat setting, which would then cause the thermostat to activate the heating system more frequently. As a result, more heating oil would travel from the tank to the burner to keep up with the increased demand for heat in the cold winter. Here's a breakdown of the situation: 1. In a cold winter, the room temperature is more likely to fall below the thermostat setting faster due to the lower outside temperature and increased heat loss through walls, windows, and doors. 2. When the thermostat senses the drop in room temperature, it sends a signal to the heating system to provide heat for the home. 3. This increased demand for heat means that more heating oil will need to be pumped from the tank to the burner. 4. As a result, the oil burner will be engaged more frequently, and the oil will be converted into a fine mist mixed with air in the combustion chamber at a higher rate. 5. The fuel/air mixture is then ignited, providing the necessary heat to the home through vents, hot water baseboards, or steam radiators. Although the cold winter does not directly impact any particular step of the process, it puts additional strain on the heating system by increasing the frequency at which the thermostat activates the system. This indirectly affects the amount of heating oil traveling from the tank to the burner, as more oil is needed to maintain the desired room temperature during colder weather."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: At an early meeting of the British Sociological Association’s “Activism in Sociology Forum” members met to discuss how we might play a more campaigning role in the world outside the academy. Pragmatically, academics tend to work long hours. We are faced with multiple and competing demands: teaching, administration, publishing, marketing, research, grant-bidding, and so on. The REF has ramped up the requirement to demonstrate the efficacy of our research in “the real world” (our impact upon society, economy, and culture rather than upon knowledge per se, or upon the academic discipline). Maybe here – I suggested, as my contribution to the meeting – was a chance for those of us interested in progressing social justice to lever officially sanctioned space, in our busy day-to-day lives, to do more of this sort of work? Maybe we should welcome the REF impact agenda? I learned afterwards that eminent British sociologists, whom I respect enormously, regarded such a viewpoint as “naïve” and “embarrassing”. Indeed, critics interpret REF as just one mode of the heightened, neoliberal, managerial control that is degrading academic life and infesting universities. So, how should we think about the REF impact agenda? Because of its obvious connections with social improvement and reform through policy action, social policy is regarded as one disciplinary area that is well-placed to meet and benefit from the impact agenda. Yet there has been surprisingly little concerted discussion amongst scholars about REF and impact. This is despite the fact that many millions of pounds of public funding accrue to the proposed or claimed impact of research (with monies channelled through research councils to individual projects or via regular, six-yearly centralised assessments of the quality of research in university departments). In addition, there is substantial funding directed toward the “impact industry”; the consultants, think tanks, PR firms, funding schemes, new software programmes, impact managers, specialist impact case study...

Blue is an English boyband consisting of members Antony Costa, Duncan James, Lee Ryan and Simon Webbe. The band originally formed in 2000 and has released three studio albums, All Rise (2001), One Love (2002) and Guilty (2003) that all peaked at number one in the United Kingdom alongside releasing 16 singles, over a four-year period. The group also worked alongside artists such as Stevie Wonder, Elton John and Lil' Kim. In late 2004, the group announced a hiatus and released their first compilation album, Best of Blue, on 15 November 2004. In May 1999, Lee Ryan and Antony Costa met at the ages of 15 and 17, respectively, when auditioning for a boy band on ITV's This Morning, with Simon Cowell putting the group together. Ryan made it into the band, as did 21-year-old Will Young (who would go on to win the first series of Pop Idol in 2002), although Costa was not chosen. The boy band never took off, but Ryan and Costa remained friends following their meeting. In 2000, Costa and another one of his friends, Duncan James, decided to form their own band, and they were soon joined by Ryan. Their manager Daniel Glatman said, \\"Duncan came to see me with his friend, Antony Costa, who was also in the same position [wanted to be in the music industry], and they told me that they wanted to do something together. When I asked them if they had anyone in mind to work with, they said they had a friend, Lee Ryan, whom they wanted to invite to join their band. The three of them came in a couple of days later and I was completely blown away by the incredibly talented stars that stood before me.\\" Ryan, Costa, James and Glatman all felt that something was missing and so they went on to audition for a fourth member, a position eventually filled by Ryan's flatmate, Simon Webbe. Blue started recording for their debut album following their new line-up. They released their debut single \\"All Rise\\" in May 2001 and it reached number four on the UK Singles Chart. Their follow-up single \\"Too Close\\" was released in August 2001 and peaked at number one. Following this, the band went to New York City to film the \\"Too Close\\" music video, and while there, they witnessed the attacks on the World Trade Center. The following month, Blue were being interviewed by British newspaper The Sun and Ryan commented that \\"This New York thing is being blown out of proportion\\" and asked \\"What about whales? They are ignoring animals that are more important. Animals need saving and that's more important.\\" The other members of the band tried to silence Ryan, but he went on. This caused a huge media backlash that resulted in Blue losing a record deal in the United States and campaigns to sack Ryan from the group. Despite the backlash, Blue went on to achieve a second number one in November with the ballad \\"If You Come Back\\". The album All Rise was released in time for Christmas and reached number one, eventually selling in excess of 1.8 million copies in the UK. The final single from the album, \\"Fly by II\\", reached number six in March 2002.

Based on this description, what is the modern equivalent of the Voltaic pile? Pick your answer from: (a). a wire. (b). a battery. (c). a resistor. (d). a light bulb.","completion":"The modern equivalent of the Voltaic pile invented by Alessandro Volta in 1800 is (b). a battery. To provide a detailed explanation, let's first understand what the Voltaic pile was and how it worked. Alessandro Volta's invention of the Voltaic pile marked an important step in the development of our understanding of electricity. It was the first device that could generate a constant and continuous flow of electrical current rather than just static electricity or momentary electrical discharges, like previous devices such as the Leyden jar. The Voltaic pile consisted of a series of alternating zinc and copper discs (or plates), separated by pieces of cardboard or cloth soaked in saltwater or other electrolytes (conductive solutions). The zinc and copper discs behaved as the positive and negative terminals of battery cells, while the electrolyte-soaked separators allowed the flow of ions between them to create an electrical current. The whole system worked like an electrochemical cell. When wires were connected to both ends of the Voltaic pile, an electrical current flowed through them, which could be used to power various devices. Now, let's consider the options listed: (a) A wire is not an equivalent to the Voltaic pile, as wires are used to transmit electricity but do not generate electrical energy by themselves. (b) A battery is the modern-day equivalent to the Voltaic pile. Just like the Voltaic pile, a battery is made up of one or more electrochemical cells that store energy in the form of chemical reactions and release it as electrical energy upon demand. In a battery, two electrodes (an anode and a cathode) are immersed in an electrolyte within each cell. When the battery is connected to an external load (such as a light bulb), the chemical reactions inside the battery generate an electrical current that flows through the circuit and powers the device. (c) A resistor is an electronic component designed to restrict the flow of electric current within a circuit, regulating voltage and current. While it is an essential component in many electronic devices, it does not generate electrical energy and therefore is not equivalent to the Voltaic pile. (d) A light bulb is a device that converts electrical energy into light and heat through the process of incandescence or other means (such as fluorescence for compact fluorescent bulbs and electroluminescence for LED bulbs). While light bulbs use electrical energy, they do not generate it, making them an incorrect comparative to the Voltaic pile. In conclusion, the modern equivalent of Alessandro Volta's Voltaic pile is (b). a battery, which shares the same function of generating and providing electrical energy through electrochemical reactions, albeit with more advanced engineering solutions for greater capacity, efficiency, and portability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.

Article: Background music may seem harmless, but it can have a powerful effect on those who hear it. Recorded background music first found its way into factories, shops and restaurants in the USA. Very soon it spread to other parts of the world. Now it is becoming difficult to go shopping or eat a meal without listening to background music. To begin with, background music was intended simply to create a soothing atmosphere. Recently, however, it's becoming a big business. An American marketing expert has shown that music can boost sales or increase factory production by as much as a third. But it has to be the light music. Lively music has no effect at all on sales. Slow music can increase receipts by 34%. This is probably because shoppers slow down and have more opportunity to spot items they would like to buy. Yet, slow music isn't always the answer. The expert found that in restaurants slow music meant customers took longer to eat their meals, which reduced overall sales. So restaurant owners might be well advised to play faster music to keep the customers moving-unless, of course, the resulting indigestion leads to complaints.

It's called the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, and weeks before authorities say he got on a plane with a bomb, Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab was in it. The vast government databank, known as TIDE, is administered by the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center. It contains information about hundreds of thousands of people, the majority of them foreign nationals, who are suspected of having terrorist leanings. An FBI official said AbdulMutallab was included in TIDE after his father warned the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria of his son's hard-line beliefs and possible ties to militant Islamists. To understand how he could have been under the government's scrutiny and still make it onto a U.S.-bound plane with an explosive, you have to understand the way the government's watch list system works. TIDE is just the start. The FBI uses the raw information contained in the TIDE databank to determine whether to put the subject onto the government's terror watch list, known as the Terrorism Screening Data Base. That list contains the names and aliases of about 400,000 people, but AbdulMutallab didn't make the cut. According to Chad Kolton, a spokesman for the FBI's Terror Screening Center, there wasn't enough hard evidence to back up AbdulMutallab's father's fears, and so he wasn't placed on the terror list. The bureau's own Web site spells out the criteria for inclusion in the screening database, saying that \\"only individuals who are known or reasonably suspected to be or have been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism are included.\\" The determination not to put AbdulMutallab on the screening list had far-reaching consequences. In May, the U.S. Justice Department's inspector general issued a report on the watch-list process, including a flow chart describing how anyone suspected of terrorist ties passes through a series of lists, the most serious of which includes the Transportation Security Administration's no-fly list. Making it from the TIDE database to the FBI's screening list is the key. Because AbdulMutallab didn't make the screening database, his name could not then be sent onto the watch lists maintained by the TSA: the \\"selectee list,\\" which law enforcement sources say includes about 14,000 names, and the \\"no-fly\\" list, which those sources say bans some 4,000 people from boarding any commercial flight destined for the United States.

Question: Process: - Air travels into the body - Air reaches the lungs - The lungs absorb the oxygen from the air - The oxygen is transported by hemoglobin - Red blood cells are made of hemoglobin - Blood has a lot of red blood cells - The heart moves the blood throughout the body - Blood can bring the oxygen to different cells in the body. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more oxygen wlil reach the cells happens, how will it affect \\"MORE oxygen being brought to the bodys cells\\". Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of more oxygen reaching the cells could have an effect on the process, both directly and indirectly. Directly, if more oxygen is brought to the body's cells, it may result in improved cellular respiration and increased energy production. This could also lead to enhanced physical performance and reduced fatigue, as the cells receive more oxygen to function efficiently. Indirectly, an increase in oxygen reaching the cells may affect the cardiovascular system, particularly the heart and blood vessels. This could be related to increased blood flow or improved oxygen-carrying capacity of the red blood cells. As a consequence, the heart may pump blood more effectively, further contributing to the efficient delivery of oxygen to all parts of the body. It is important to note, however, that these effects would depend on various factors, such as the individual's health, physical condition, and the extent of the perturbation. Excessive amounts of oxygen reaching the cells could potentially have harmful effects, such as oxygen toxicity or oxidative stress, so it is crucial to maintain a proper balance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa finds himself without adequate funding to finance his war against the military-run government. He also finds himself at odds with the Americans because of the Hearst media empire's press campaign against him. To counter both of these threats, he sends emissaries to movie producers to convince them to pay to film his progress and the actual battles. Producer D.W. Griffith is immediately interested and convinces Mutual Film Studios boss Harry E. Aitkin to send a film crew. Aitkin's nephew Frank Thayer is initially a mere errand boy for the studio, but he makes a good impression with Villa, who demands that Thayer be placed in charge of the project. Thayer and a camera crew team film Villa leading his men to victory in battle. Despite the failure of this initial footage (which draws derisive laughter from potential backers) Thayer convinces Aitkin to invest even more money in a second attempt, and also convinces Villa to participate in making a more narrative film. Thayer returns to Mexico with a director, actors, producers, cameramen and screen writers, and begin to film Villa's previous exploits using a younger actor, future film director Raoul Walsh. The filming goes well, although Villa becomes angry that the screenwriters and the director have changed history to make a more dramatic film. However, he agrees to do a cameo appearance as an older version of himself. Meanwhile, Thayer begins a romance with actress Teddy Sampson whom he's had a crush on since they first met. One night Villa announces that they will attack a Federal held fort at Torreon and win the revolution.

Edward had recently moved to the town after a family tragedy, and is haunted by a traumatic past. Shy, introverted, but undoubtedly intelligent, Edward is an outsider and finds it difficult to make friends. The only person who seems to notice him is a kindred spirit, Sarah, a quiet outcast who shares Edward's love of knowledge and is fascinated by his enigmatic nature. On a seemingly ordinary school day, as the students are heading to their classes, Edward notices a massive out-of-control van barrelling towards one of his classmates, Brian, who is cluelessly walking in the van's path. In a moment of sheer desperation, Edward takes a split-second decision to save Brian's life. He spots another student, Mark, a popular but mischievous jock, who seems oblivious to the impending tragedy. Edward shoves Mark in the van's direction, hoping his sudden throw will not only gain Mark's attention, but also slow down the careening van, making it easier to stop. Act 2: Mark's unexpected intervention indeed slows down the van, while Edward leaps forward to grab Brian and pull him out of the van's trajectory. The sudden change of weight and shift in momentum bring the van to a screeching halt, just inches away from the students. In the aftermath of the incident, the school community is rife with rumors and speculations surrounding the miraculous save. Mark, feeling embarrassed and frustrated by Edward's intervention, attempts to turn the tables on Edward by making him appear as the villain. He starts a rumor that Edward deliberately pushed him, intending to hurt him. People begin to doubt Edward's intentions and question whether he truly intended to save Brian. Sarah, the only witness to the event who understands what Edward really did, is caught in a dilemma. Although she is grateful for Edward's brave act and wishes to exonerate him, she knows that doing so will reveal her own secret - Sarah is blessed with heightened sensory abilities that allowed her to witness the incident unfold. Sharing her truth puts her at risk of becoming an outcast as well. Act 3: As Edward is ostracized and blames himself for making matters worse, Sarah finally decides to stand up for the truth. In an emotional outburst at a school gathering, Sarah reveals her ability and unveils the truth of Edward's heroic act to the entire school. Despite the potential consequences of her admission, Sarah convinces the school community that Edward's selfless intent was aimed at saving Brian's life and it was a crucial decision made in the heat of the moment for a greater good. Although both Edward and Sarah face scrutiny following the revelation, they find strength in each other's company. The duo, along with Brian, form an unbreakable bond amidst their struggles, supporting each other as they deal with the aftermath of the incident. As the school community slowly comes to terms with the truth, they begin to accept and appreciate Edward and Sarah for their extraordinary courage and strength. Mark, on the other hand, is caught in his own web of deceit and loses his credibility amongst his peers. Epilogue: The film concludes with Edward and Sarah's newfound friendship forging a pathway to their self-acceptance and growth. They continue to use their exceptional abilities for the greater good, and in the process, help the community learn the values of understanding, empathy, and the importance of standing up for the truth. Their inspiring story not only changes their lives, but also leaves an indelible mark on the town's people, reshaping perspectives and making the world a better place."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Information: - Psychological horror is a subgenre of horror literature, film, television, and video games (as a narrative) which relies on the character's fears and/or psychological instability to frighten readers, viewers or players. On a few occasions, Psychological horror overlaps with the psychological thriller subgenre, making whatever story of the genre more unpleasant as well as terrifyingly suspenseful. - The term \\"Cinema of Korea\\" (or \\"Korean cinema\\") encompasses the motion picture industries of North and South Korea. As with all aspects of Korean life during the past century, the film industry has often been at the mercy of political events, from the late Joseon dynasty to the Korean War to domestic governmental interference. While both countries have relatively robust film industries today, only South Korean films have achieved wide international acclaim. North Korean films tend to portray their communist or revolutionary themes. - Horror film is a film genre that seeks to elicit a negative emotional reaction from viewers by playing on their fears. Inspired by literature from authors like Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley, horror films have existed for more than a century. The macabre and the supernatural are frequent themes. Horror may also overlap with the fantasy, supernatural fiction and thriller genres. - Exorcism (from Greek , \\"exorkismos\\" binding by oath) is the religious or spiritual practice of purportedly evicting demons or other spiritual entities from a person or an area they are believed to have possessed. Depending on the spiritual beliefs of the exorcist, this may be done by causing the entity to swear an oath, performing an elaborate ritual, or simply by commanding it to depart in the name of a higher power.

Korean horror features many of the same motifs , themes , and imagery as Japanese horror . Korean horror has been around since the early years of Korean cinema ; however , it was not until the late 1990s that the genre began to experience a renewal . Many of the Korean horror films tend to focus on the suffering and the anguish of characters rather than focus on the explicit \`\` blood and guts '' aspect of horror . - Japanese folklorists and historians use \\"ykai\\" as \\"supernatural or unaccountable phenomena to their informants\\". In the Edo period, many artists, such as Toriyama Sekien, created \\"ykai\\" inspired by folklore or their own ideas, and in the present, several \\"ykai\\" created by them (e.g. Kameosa and Amikiri, see below) are wrongly considered as being of legendary origin. - Horror is a genre of fiction which is intended to, or has the capacity to frighten, scare, disgust, or startle their readers or viewers by inducing feelings of horror and terror. Literary historian J. A. Cuddon has defined the horror story as \\"a piece of fiction in prose of variable length... which shocks or even frightens the reader, or perhaps induces a feeling of repulsion or loathing\\". It creates an eerie and frightening atmosphere. Horror is frequently supernatural, though it can be non-supernatural. Often the central menace of a work of horror fiction can be interpreted as a metaphor for the larger fears of a society. - Shamanism (or ) is a practice that involves a practitioner reaching altered states of consciousness in order to perceive and interact with a spirit world and channel these transcendental energies into this world. - Japanese horror is Japanese horror fiction in popular culture, noted for its unique thematic and conventional treatment of the horror genre in light of western treatments.

The term most often refers to an audience's perceptions in a dramatic work. Suspense is not exclusive to fiction. It may operate whenever there is a perceived suspended drama or a chain of cause is left in doubt, with tension being a primary emotion felt as part of the situation. - Folk religion, alongside popular religion and vernacular religion, are terms used within religious studies and folkloristics to describe various forms and expressions of religion that are deemed distinct from the official doctrines and practices of organized religion. The precise definition of folk religion varies among scholars. Sometimes also termed popular belief, it consists of ethnic or regional religious customs under the umbrella of a religion, but outside of official doctrine and practices.

This executive order supplemented his previous 1961 order that declared it was the \\"policy of the United States to encourage by affirmative action the elimination of discrimination in employment\\". The 1963 order made a significant addition by stipulating that all federal funds, including \\"grants, loans, unions and employers who accepted taxpayer funds, and other forms of financial assistance to state and local governments,\\" were obligated to comply with the government's affirmative action policies in their employment practices. This addition meant a considerable expansion of the reach of affirmative action policies, ensuring that any entity receiving federal funds was required to adopt these policies, thereby broadening the impact of affirmative action across a wider range of sectors and industries. It represented an intensification of the Kennedy administration's commitment to affirmative action as a means to combat discriminatory practices in employment.

They were poised to take on more royal duties. They are now preparing to welcome another addition to their family. An addition that will attract considerable global interest. The child's grandmother is the late Diana, Princess of Wales. This princess or prince is unlikely to be crowned monarch. As things stand, that future awaits their brother, Prince George.

A former nurse told her daughter her life had become a 'nightmare' after undergoing gastric bypass surgery to lose weight, an inquest heard today. Virginia Humphrey, 67, died at the Royal Sussex County Hospital (RSCH) in Brighton, East Sussex, on May 9 after losing 10 stone in six months, the inquest at Brighton County Court was told. An email sent by divorcee Mrs Humphrey to her daughter, Deborah Mitchell, who lived in the U.S., was read out to the inquest. Tragic: Virginia Humphrey, pictured with her grandchild before the operation, was worried about having the gastric bypass. In the email, sent on January 18, she described how she was unable to keep any food down and had chronic indigestion, leaving her feeling like a 'prune'. She wrote: 'Life since coming out of hospital has been a nightmare. 'Friday was an awful day ending with me being so sick I thought I turned my body inside out.' Her son, Kevin Humphrey, said that in her last few months she became wheelchair-bound as she did not enough energy to walk, and he would have to carry her up the stairs to the house they shared in the city. He told the inquest: 'I had rails fitted but she wasn’t strong enough to use the rails. 'She could walk no further than 10 steps, then she’d feel faint.' The inquest heard yesterday how Mrs Humphrey, who also had another son, suffered from malnutrition as she was unable to absorb nutrients. It was also heard that the surgeons who carried out the operation at University College London Hospital (UCLH) may have got their measurements wrong when carrying out the procedure as it was possible a channel leading to the colon was cut too short. Fatal. operation: Virginia Humphrey died in hospital in Brighton after she. lost more than ten stones following a gastric band operation. Mrs Humphrey, who suffered from type two diabetes, asthma and high blood pressure, had undergone the procedure to help her lose weight on August 31 last year and seemed to be doing well and making the progress expected in the following months. However by December she was beginning to have problems keeping food down and was admitted to the A&E department at the RSCH twice that month. The inquest heard that although she went to the hospital because of her constant vomiting, medics also found she had chest problems and so did not inform staff at UCLH of her bariatric trouble. Mrs Humphrey, who worked as an Army nurse before becoming an auxiliary nurse, went to A&E again on February 9 suffering from severe vomiting, diarrhoea, lower abdomen pain and indigestion. Medics found she was dehydrated and also had difficulty swallowing. The inquest heard staff at the RSCH decided Mrs Humphrey should be transferred to UCLH so she could have specialist bariatric care. They did not have space for her immediately but she was admitted on February 22 with symptoms of vomiting and difficulty swallowing. University College Hospital London: The hospital where Mrs Humphrey underwent her gastric bypass surgery in August last year. James Hewes, a trainee surgeon who had carried out the gastric bypass alongside consultant bariatric surgeon Marco Adamo, told the inquest these were relatively common complaints from patients following gastric surgery, and would normally last for around a year afterwards. He said on seeing her again at the hospital, her kidney function appeared to be completely normal and she appeared dehydrated, but not severely. Her albumin levels, which indicate the amount of protein in the blood and could have pointed to malnutrition at the time, fluctuated but were also said to be normal. The inquest heard that 'morbidly obese' Mrs Humphrey, who had weighed 18st 10lb (119kg) ahead of her operation on July 23, weighed 75.4kg on February 22, which was described as more than would have been expected, but not of great concern. It was heard that Mrs Humphrey, who was previously described as a 'very cheerful' person by her GP, Dr Caroline Roberts, was also a 'stoic' character who may not have let on to hospital staff just how ill she felt before she was discharged on February 28. Mr Adamo said: 'Patients are very happy because of the weight loss so sometimes they tend to minimise their symptoms. 'Patients are more inclined to say 'it's fine'.' The inquest heard Mrs Humphrey, known as Ginny, later contracted a blood stream infection, which may have contributed to her death of multiple organ failure. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1. Virginia Humphrey, a 67-year-old former nurse, underwent gastric bypass surgery to lose weight and ended up losing 10 stone (around 140 pounds) in six months. 2. After the surgery, Humphrey experienced various post-operative complications, including constant vomiting, chronic indigestion, malnutrition, dehydration, and difficulty swallowing. 3. Despite her condition, Humphrey was initially denied admission to specialist bariatric care at University College London Hospital (UCLH) due to lack of space, but she was eventually admitted for treatment with symptoms of vomiting and difficulty swallowing. 4. It was suggested that the surgeons at UCLH may have made measurement errors during the procedure, possibly cutting a channel leading to the colon too short. 5. Humphrey continued experiencing health issues leading to multiple organ failure, and she passed away at the Royal Sussex County Hospital. 6.

He first picks up some frozen pizzas, his favorite meal when he is feeling lazy after work, and then stops off to pick up a loaf of bread. He then walks over to the dairy section to pick up some cheese for his lunches. Jimmy never buys milk, but today he has a sudden urge to get some. He walks over to the milk refrigerators and looks at all the options. He is currently debating between two brands, Luchene and Jean's. While trying to decide, he notices a sticker on the Luchene gallon that says \\"organic,\\" but is unable to find any such indication on the gallon of Jean's milk. After asking an employee, it is confirmed that Jean's is not organic milk. Unable to make up his mind, Jimmy simply leaves without buying any milk. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which brand requires more cows to produce the same amount of milk? Hint: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).

Should I validate this answer? The answer is:","completion":"The Fugitive Slave Law, also known as the Fugitive Slave Act, was enacted as part of the Compromise of 1850. The law was passed by the United States Congress and was intended to pacify tensions between the Northern and Southern states over the issue of slavery. The suggested answer you provided is partially correct but lacks some important details. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was a federal law enacted in the United States as a result of the Compromise of 1850. The law strengthened the existing obligations of Northern states to capture and return escaped slaves to the South, thus supporting the Southern slave owners. The Act imposed heavy penalties on individuals who assisted escaped slaves or hindered their capture. As a result, the law stirred strong opposition and resentment in the Northern states, where abolitionist movements were growing. In summary, the Fugitive Slave Law was enacted by the United States Congress as part of the Compromise of 1850. While the suggested answer mentions that it was a controversial act that heightened Northern fears of a \\"slave power conspiracy,\\" it is important to additionally note that the law itself was a federal law, enacted to strengthen existing obligations of the Northern states to help capture and return escaped slaves, which further intensified the tensions between the North and South over the issue of slavery."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered. - The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a British public service broadcaster.

The species is classified in the genus \\"Panthera\\" with the lion, leopard, jaguar and snow leopard. Tigers are apex predators, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and bovids. They are territorial and generally solitary but social animals, often requiring large contiguous areas of habitat that support their prey requirements. This, coupled with the fact that they are indigenous to some of the more densely populated places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts with humans. - The Democratic Republic of the Congo , also known as DR Congo, DRC, DROC, East Congo, Congo-Kinshasa, or simply the Congo is a country located in Central Africa. From 1971 to 1997 it was named, and is sometimes still called Zaire, and from 1908 to 1960 it was called the Belgian Congo.

Kenya covers , and had a population of approximately 45 million people in July 2014. - The wildebeests, also called gnus, or wildebai, are a genus of antelopes, Connochaetes. They belong to the family Bovidae, which includes antelopes, cattle, goats, sheep and other even-toed horned ungulates. \\"Connochaetes\\" includes two species, both native to Africa: the black wildebeest, or white-tailed gnu (\\"C. gnou\\"); and the blue wildebeest, or brindled gnu (\\"C. taurinus\\"). Fossil records suggest these two species diverged about one million years ago, resulting in a northern and a southern species. The blue wildebeest remained in its original range and changed very little from the ancestral species, while the black wildebeest changed more in order to adapt to its open grassland habitat in the south. The most obvious way of telling the two species apart are the differences in their colouring and in the way their horns are oriented. - Tanzania , officially the United Republic of Tanzania, is a country in Eastern Africa within the African Great Lakes region. Parts of the country are in Southern Africa. It is bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north; Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west; Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique to the south; and by the Indian Ocean to the east. Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain, is in northeastern Tanzania. - James Maury \\"Jim\\" Henson (September 24, 1936 May 16, 1990) was an American puppeteer, artist, cartoonist, inventor, screenwriter, film director and producer who achieved international fame as the creator of the Muppets. Born in Greenville, Mississippi, and raised in Leland, Mississippi, and Hyattsville, Maryland, Henson began developing puppets while attending high school. While he was a freshman at the University of Maryland, College Park, he created \\"Sam and Friends\\", a five-minute sketch-comedy puppet show that appeared on television. After graduating from the University of Maryland with a degree in home economics, he produced coffee advertisements and developed some experimental films.

It is notable as the home of the U.S. film industry, including several of its historic studios, and its name has come to be a shorthand reference for the industry and the people in it. - Southern Africa is the southernmost region of the African continent, variably defined by geography or geopolitics, and including several countries. The term \\"southern Africa\\" or \\"Southern Africa\\", generally includes Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. From a political perspective the region is said to be unipolar with South Africa as a first regional power. - The informal term \\"big cat\\" is typically used to refer to any of the four largest (living) members of the entire \\"Panthera\\" genus. Among the five total species within the \\"Panthera\\" genus, these four are the only cats that are able to roar. In descending order of their maximum potential size, these four species are: tigers, lions, jaguars, and leopards. A more liberal and expansive definition is sometimes used which may include the snow leopard, puma, clouded leopard, Sunda clouded leopard and/or cheetah, although these added species do not roar. The two clouded leopard species are considered an evolutionary link between big and small cats. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Mount Kilimanjaro, with its three volcanic cones, \\"Kibo\\", \\"Mawenzi\\", and \\"Shira\\", is a dormant volcano in Tanzania. It is the highest mountain in Africa, and rises approximately 4,900 m (16,000 ft) from its base to above sea level. The first recorded ascent to the summit of the mountain was by Hans Meyer and Ludwig Purtscheller in 1889. The mountain is part of the Kilimanjaro National Park and is a major climbing destination. The mountain has been the subject of many scientific studies because of its shrinking glaciers. - The Republic of Zambia is a landlocked country in Southern Africa, neighbouring the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north, Tanzania to the north-east, Malawi to the east, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia to the south, and Angola to the west. The capital city is Lusaka, in the south-central part of Zambia. The population is concentrated mainly around Lusaka in the south and the Copperbelt Province to the northwest, the core economic hubs of the country. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants.

The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - Rwanda (or ), officially the Republic of Rwanda, is a sovereign state in central and east Africa and one of the smallest countries on the African mainland. Located a few degrees south of the Equator, Rwanda is bordered by Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Rwanda is in the African Great Lakes region and is highly elevated; its geography is dominated by mountains in the west and savanna to the east, with numerous lakes throughout the country.

On 23 June 1596, an Ottoman Army marched from the city of Istanbul. Commanded by Sultan Mehmed III, the army marched through Edirne, Filibe , Sofia and Niš to arrive at Belgrade on 9 August. On 20 August, the army crossed the River Sava by bridge and entered the Austrian territory of Siren. A war council was called at Slankamen Castle, and it was decided that they would begin a siege on the Hungarian fort of Eger . The fort controlled the communication routes between Habsburg Austria and Transylvania, all of whom were in revolt against the Ottoman suzerainty. However, news soon arrived that the Austrians had besieged and succeeded in taking over the Castle of Hatvan and had killed all the Ottomans housed there, including the women and children. The Ottoman Army started a siege on the fort of Eger on 21 September 1596, and by 12 October the castle had capitulated. As a retaliation to the Hatvan castle massacre, the defenders of this castle were all executed. Not long after, Ottoman command received the report that a mixed army of Austrians and Transylvanians were advancing towards the Ottoman expeditionary force. A war council was conducted under Grand Vizier Damat Ibrahim Pasha. It was decided that the Ottoman Army should march out of the Erlau castle so as to meet the Austrians at a suitable battle terrain. The Sultan thought that the Ottoman army should disengage and return to Istanbul; it was with great difficulty that he was persuaded to engage the enemy forces. The most realistic troop strength figures seem to be 40,000-50,000 for the Christian and 80,000-100,000 for the Muslim army. The Christian army had 10,000 Austrians, 4,000 Germans, 3,000 reiters, 13,000 Hungarian light cavalry and 10,000 Transylvanians, for a total of 40,000 men.

It is neither overwhelmingly positive nor entirely negative, as the reviewer points out specific aspects that they found noteworthy, both favorable and unfavorable. First, let's discuss the negative aspects mentioned in the review. The reviewer describes the movie as \\"derivative,\\" suggesting that it may have borrowed ideas or concepts from other similar films and did not bring much originality to the table. Additionally, the film is described as \\"overlong,\\" which implies that its running time felt too long for the story it was trying to tell. This may lead viewers to feel disengaged or bored at times throughout the movie. Lastly, the term \\"bombastic\\" suggests that the film may have had excessive style or overly dramatic sequences which could have detracted from its overall impact. Despite these criticisms, the reviewer still found the movie \\"surprisingly entertaining.\\" This demonstrates that despite the identified flaws, the film managed to successfully capture the viewer's attention and provide them with an enjoyable experience. It is possible that the engaging performances, visually appealing cinematography, or well-executed action sequences might have made up for the shortcomings mentioned earlier in the review. In conclusion, the movie K-19: The Widowmaker received a mixed review from this particular critic. The reviewer highlighted some negative aspects of the film, such as being derivative, overlong, and bombastic, yet also expressed their surprise at how entertaining it was.

Mike is trying to figure out how HIV-infected patient is different from the patient who is not infected with HIV. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would patient A have more or less T cells than patient B? Answer:","completion":"Patient A, who is infected with HIV, would generally have fewer T cells than patient B, who is not infected with HIV. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) primarily targets the immune system of a human body, specifically a type of white blood cell known as T-helper cells, also called CD4 cells. These cells play a crucial role in maintaining the body's immune response by signaling other cells (like B cells or cytotoxic T cells) to perform their immunity functions. When HIV enters the body, it attaches itself to CD4 cells and utilizes the cellular machinery to replicate itself. As the virus replicates, it destroys the T-helper cells, reducing their number significantly. This hampers the body's ability to fight off infections and diseases, leading to weakened immunity. On the other hand, a person without HIV, like Patient B, would not experience this massive loss of T cells. Hence, they would typically have a higher number of T cells compared to an HIV-positive individual, unless some other health condition is affecting their T cell count."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether the Head can be hindered by what is mentioned in the Tail or not. In this task, hindering introduces hindrances that obstruct the natural path to the achievement of a goal. For example, the event PersonX adopts a cat can be obstructed if PersonX is allergic to cats. Classify your answers into \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\".

It’s quite uncommon, but essentially I can get an excruciating migraine in my arm, leg, etc., on top of getting them in my head/temples. For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as “beeping.” Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better. I used to be terrified of learning to drive, for many reasons, but a large one being that if I got an ice pick headache on the road, I couldn’t guarantee the safety of those around me if I was at the wheel. Now I’m considering finally getting my license (considering - I still don’t like being behind the wheel), I don’t double over in white hot pain randomly anymore, and when I do get a cluster headache, I can still function.

Fact: if a tree is located near a sidewalk then the roots of that tree might crack the sidewalk Question: The cracks in a sidewalk could be caused by What's the answer? Available choices: -black holes. -Pine. -time travel. -emotions.","completion":"The cracks in a sidewalk could be caused by the roots of the pine tree. When a tree is located near a sidewalk, the growth and expansion of its roots could exert considerable pressure on the surrounding materials, such as concrete or other pavement types. As the tree continues to grow and the roots expand, they gradually displace the soil beneath the sidewalk, thereby causing the sidewalk to crack and break apart over time. Pine trees, being a common type of tree in many environments, can often be found in close proximity to sidewalks. Their roots are no exception to the root expansion phenomenon, as they too require space and nutrients in order to sustain the growth of the tree. As they spread underground, these roots can seek out and create paths through soft soil or small crevices in hard surfaces such as sidewalks. If they encounter resistance in the form of a solid, unyielding surface like concrete, the roots can continue to grow around or under the sidewalk and exert substantial upward force, leading to cracking and displacement. It's important to note that tree roots in general, not limited to pine roots, can cause sidewalk damage. Any tree with a considerable root system, especially those with more aggressive root growth, can potentially break through the pavement when planted too close to a sidewalk. To mitigate this issue, homeowners and city planners should take into consideration the potential growth of the tree and the root system when planting and landscaping near sidewalks. Using proper planting techniques and selecting appropriate tree species that are non-invasive and compatible with the surrounding environment can significantly reduce the risk of root-related sidewalk damage. In this context, the other options - black holes, time travel, and emotions - are not logically connected to the cracks in a sidewalk. Black holes are astronomical phenomena occurring in outer space, which would not cause direct damage to the sidewalk on Earth. Time travel is a hypothetical concept in science fiction, and even if it were possible, it would not be a plausible cause for cracks in sidewalks. Lastly, emotions, being related to the feelings and mental states of humans, cannot be a direct factor in the creation of cracks in a sidewalk."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Lila Lee [Cheryl \\"Rainbeaux\\" Smith], the Singin' Angel of the Community Baptist Church of Tylerville (North Carolina?), is a sweet and innocent 13-year old whose gangster father Alvin [William Whitton] just shot his wife and her lover, ran down an old lady in the street, and is now running from the law. Reverend Mueller [Richard Blackburn], who has a hard time keeping his hands off his ward Lila, has made it clear to the parish that the sins of her father should not be blamed on Lila, but when Lila gets a letter from a woman named Lemora, instructing her to come to her sick father and forgive him his sins against her, Lila makes her way that very night to the Northpark bus station just in time to catch the bus (driven by a very creepy bus driver) to Asteroth.Along the road to Asteroth, an isolated little town in the salt marshes, the bus is pursued by several monstrous-looking ghouls, visible from outside Lila's window. When the bus breaks down and the bus driver tries to fix it, the ghouls close in. Lila releases the brake and coasts down the hill until she crashes into a tree. The ghouls begin to approach when suddenly they are attacked by vampires (aristocratic-looking with white faces, long black coats, and top hats). Lila passes out.

Translate to Romanian Romanian:","completion":"Cu alte cuvinte, ar trebui acordată o mai mare atenție locurilor de muncă accesibile pentru un număr tot mai mare de persoane în vârstă care rămân active. În ultimii ani, numărul persoanelor în vârstă care doresc să rămână active pe piața forței de muncă a crescut semnificativ. Acest lucru generează o nevoie imperativă de a ne asigura că locurile de muncă sunt adaptate și accesibile pentru această categorie de angajați. În continuare, vom explora câteva aspecte esențiale legate de crearea unui mediu de lucru prietenos pentru vârstnici și beneficiile aduse de acest demers. În primul rând, angajatorii ar trebui să ia în considerare nevoile specifice ale persoanelor în etatea a treia și să adapteze condițiile de muncă în consecință. Acest lucru poate include ajustarea programului de lucru pentru a fi mai puțin obositor, oferirea de instruire sau reconvertire profesională pentru a ține pasul cu noile tehnologii și o colaborare strânsă cu departamentele de resurse umane pentru a identifica soluții potrivite fiecărui angajat în parte. Un alt aspect important este ergonomia și siguranța la locul de muncă. Pe măsură ce îmbătrânim, nevoile noastre fizice și cognitive se schimbă, iar un mediu de lucru optim trebuie să țină cont de aceste modificări. Acest lucru poate include scaune ergonomice, iluminat corespunzător, panouri acustice pentru reducerea zgomotului, dispunerea ergonomică a birourilor și reducerea riscului de accidentare prin marcarea zonelor periculoase și adoptarea unor practici de lucru sigure. De asemenea, angajatorii ar trebui să promoveze un mediu de lucru incluziv și să încurajeze comunicarea și colaborarea între colegii de diferite vârste. Acest lucru poate ajuta la eliminarea stereotipurilor legate de vârstă și la îmbunătățirea relațiilor dintre angajați, ceea ce va crește, în cele din urmă, satisfacția și randamentul la locul de muncă. Există numeroase beneficii în a crea locuri de muncă accesibile pentru persoanele în vârstă care rămân active. În primul rând, această abordare poate contribui la menținerea unui nivel înalt de experiență în organizații, deoarece persoanele în vârstă aduc, de obicei, cunoștințe și abilități valoroase. În al doilea rând, o forță de muncă diversă în termeni de vârstă poate spori creativitatea și inovația într-o companie, deoarece angajații de diferite vârste aduc perspective diferite și idei unice. În concluzie, este esențial să acordăm o mai mare atenție creării unor locuri de muncă adaptate și accesibile pentru persoanele în vârstă care doresc să rămână active. Având în vedere provocările demografice cu care se confruntă societatea în prezent, așa cum este îmbătrânirea populației și scăderea natalității, asigurarea unor oportunități adecvate și a unui mediu de lucru prietenos pentru vârstnici este nu doar o chestiune de echitate, ci și o investiție esențială în viitorul și sustenabilitatea pieței forței de muncă."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Over the course of his career, he served as Director of both the National Museum of Wales and London Museum, Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India, and the founder and Honorary Director of the Institute of Archaeology in London, in addition to writing twenty-four books on archaeological subjects. Born in Glasgow to a middle-class family, Wheeler was raised largely in Yorkshire before relocating to London in his teenage years. After studying classics at University College London (UCL), he began working professionally in archaeology, specialising in the Romano-British period. During World War I he volunteered for service in the Royal Artillery, being stationed on the Western Front, where he rose to the rank of major and was awarded the Military Cross. Returning to Britain, he obtained his doctorate from UCL before taking on a position at the National Museum of Wales, first as Keeper of Archaeology and then as Director, during which time he oversaw excavation at the Roman forts of Segontium, Y Gaer, and Isca Augusta with the aid of his first wife, Tessa Wheeler. Influenced by the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers, Wheeler argued that excavation and the recording of stratigraphic context required an increasingly scientific and methodical approach, developing the \\"Wheeler method\\". In 1926, he was appointed Keeper of the London Museum; there, he oversaw a reorganisation of the collection, successfully lobbied for increased funding, and began lecturing at UCL.

Your task is to provide an explanation based on the given question or fill-in-the-blank statement, and answer. Input: Question: If we double our use of nonrenewable resources, we will end up having _____ of them. Answer: less Output:","completion":"I used the definition of nonrenewable resources to come up with the answer. Nonrenewable resources are those that have a limited supply and cannot be replenished in a short period of time. Examples include fossil fuels, minerals, and metals. When we double our use of these nonrenewable resources, we are consuming them at a faster rate, depleting the available supply. As a result, we will end up having less of them over time because they are not being replenished."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Few athletes would disagree that more muscle is an advantage in their sport. And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule. Question: When should sportspeople consider taking protein supplements? Answer: OPT: [I] When they are fasting. [II] When they are traveling. [III] not enough information. [IV] When they are eating a high protein meal. Answer:","completion":"[II] When they are traveling."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the question \\"How would you describe Lee?\\", is \\"focused\\" a valid answer? Choices: a). Yes. b). No. Answer:","completion":"a). Yes. Although we have limited information about Lee, the brief description provided suggests that Lee is indeed a focused individual. Let's break down the situation and analyze why this might be a valid characterization. Firstly, Lee has work tomorrow and is aware of the need for a clean uniform. This demonstrates a sense of responsibility and professionalism where they want to be presentable and adhere to the workplace's dress code. To ensure they have what they need for the job, they take initiative and arrange for their clothes to be washed. Taking the time and effort to prepare for the next workday is a clear indication that Lee prioritizes their tasks and stays ahead of their responsibilities. By doing so, Lee shows a form of focus that revolves around their success at work. The organization, preparedness, and foresight demonstrated in this situation all correlate with a focused mindset. Though this is just a snapshot of one specific aspect of Lee's life, their ability to manage priorities and act deliberately can have benefits that extend to other areas outside of work. A focused person is more likely to have a clear vision and direction in life, which steers them towards accomplishing both short-term and long-term goals. In summary, from the information provided, it can be reasonably concluded that Lee exhibits focused behavior. They recognize the importance of their work responsibilities and take calculated steps to maintain efficiency and preparedness. Choosing \\"focused\\" as a descriptor acknowledges these specific qualities that Lee demonstrates through their actions. While it's crucial to recognize that people are complex and multifaceted, in this particular situation, considering the context and information provided, \\"focused\\" is a valid answer to describe Lee."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But scientists say that method is less helpful. If you need to remember something, write it. Writing notes by hand is much better for long-term memory of idea. So, turn off your computer if you want to remember something. Students who type notes on a keyboard often write down what the teacher says word-for-word. They may write without really thinking about what they are writing. These electronic notes contained more words. But scientists say it leads to \\" _ .\\" Transcription means to write down something exactly as you hear it. However, students taking notes by writing them, need to first process the information they hear. Then they record just the main parts. They use fewer words. This is because people usually write slower than they type. This kind of process leads to a deeper understanding. The scientists did a research. In the research, students listened to a teacher and then took a test. Some took notes by typing on a computer. The others took notes by writing them down. Both groups performed about the same in remembering facts. But students who typed their notes did much worse on conceptual questions. These questions required them to understand an idea. Also, scientists found that those who wrote their notes remembered conceptual information better a week later. Scientists believe that the students who took notes by writing them had a deeper understanding of ideas. Scientists know that students probably will still use their computers in class. But they suggest to take notes by hand on screens. They say this might be a good way between different schools.

He had watched her grow from a shy teenager to a confident young woman but had always treated her with the same kindness and warmth. As Claire approached the front of the cafeteria, she couldn't help but smile at George's familiar and caring demeanor. Despite being in his sixties, George had the energy and enthusiasm of a far younger man. His graying hair was neatly combed, and his brown eyes sparkled with sincerity as he greeted her with his trademark smile. \\"Doing great today, George. Thanks for asking!\\" Claire replied, her spirits lifted by the simple interaction. She had been coming to Danver's since her high school days, and George had always taken a genuine interest in her wellbeing. \\"I'm glad to hear that, Claire,\\" said George, his smile never faltering. He had an uncanny ability to remember people's names and faces, which went a long way in endearing him to the regulars at the cafeteria. \\"So, any big plans for the weekend?\\" \\"Oh, not much,\\" Claire replied, already anticipating the relaxation that awaited her. \\"Just hanging out with friends and catching up on some much-needed rest.\\" \\"That sounds perfect, my dear,\\" George offered, a twinkle in his eye. He placed a gentle, grandfatherly pat on her shoulder. \\"You work hard and deserve some downtime. Make sure you enjoy it.\\" Claire smiled warmly at George, grateful for the familiar camaraderie and the comforting atmosphere he'd helped maintain at Danver's all these years. It was true that she owed much of her success and happiness to the friendly community they had managed to foster in this simple cafeteria. The fact that the establishment had persisted for three decades under the watchful guidance of both George and the Danvers family was not only a testament to their business acumen but also their ability to make people feel valued and cared for. Though many things had changed since she first began coming to the cafeteria, George's unwavering kindness had remained a constant. And it was that very constancy that had solidified Claire's bond not only with Danver's Cafeteria but also with the people who worked there. Feeling a sense of contentment, Claire dropped off her tray and waved goodbye to George, who wished her a wonderful weekend ahead. As she stepped out of Danver's and into the busy streets beyond, she couldn't help but think about how lucky she was to have found such a special place in her life, one that not only offered sustenance but also a human connection - something rare in today's fast-paced world. And for that, she would forever be grateful to the cheerful man who, alongside the Danvers family, had managed to create a haven that touched the hearts of all who frequented its welcoming halls."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: \\"You're always here for me.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"You're never here when I need you.\\" true?","completion":"The assertion \\"You're always here for me\\" contradicts the hypothesis \\"You're never here when I need you.\\" To clarify, let's break this down further. The premise, \\"You're always here for me,\\" suggests that the individual's presence is constant and consistent. It sums up a reality perceived by the person issuing the statement, in which they feel the continued and unwavering support or availability of the individual referred to as 'you.' The use of 'always' implies consistency without exceptions. On the other hand, the hypothesis \\"You're never here when I need you\\" claims an entirely opposite scenario. It proposes a situation in which the specific 'you' person is consistently absent or unavailable whenever the speaker needs them. 'Never' is a term that signifies a complete lack of occurrence or exceptionless non-occurrence. The two statements here are logically contradicting. If the premise \\"you're always here for me\\" is true, then it is impossible for the hypothesis \\"you're never here when I need you\\" to be true, according to standard logical rules. By logical standards, if a hypothesis contradicts a true premise, then the hypothesis must be false. According to this, if \\"You're always here for me\\" is indeed a true premise, then the hypothesis \\"You're never here when I need you\\" cannot be true. However, it is important to note that these statements also strongly depend on personal perception and subjective appraisal of situations. While logic can analyze wording and absolute values implied by 'always' and 'never,' emotions and personal feelings bend these absolutes in everyday use. Sometimes a person might feel like someone isn't there for them when they need them, despite that person being generally available. But purely in terms of the provided premise and hypothesis, and according to logical reasoning, if the premise \\"You're always here for me\\" is true, the hypothesis \\"You're never here when I need you\\" cannot be true concurrently."},{"prompt":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: What do you think of black cats? Are they unluckier than cats of other colors? Many people in Western countries think so. Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), did a study on cat colours and people's understandings of cat personalities. The study found that people do judge cat personalities by color. Scientists did a survey on the Internet. There were 49 statements matching five cat colorings with 10 personalities. People think orange and bi-coloured cats are friendly, tri-coloured cats are not generous, and white cats are calm, lazy and shy. As for black cats, people think they don't have special personalities. But why do so many people dislike keeping black cats as pets? People think black cats have less special personalities, which might be because of their bad reputation . They think black cats may bring bad luck, especially at Halloween. Movies and television shows also make people believe that. Although people have these ideas, UC Berkeley scientists give another reason: people don't think black cats are pretty enough. After all, nothing can show black cats are unluckier than other cats. \\"You can't judge a cat by its colour, because it's the personality of the cat, not the colour, that will let you know if the cat is right for you,\\" Cathy Marden, a scientist said.

After logging into the creation tools or downloading the creation software, you will need to start a new project. The process varies from program to program, but generally involves naming your app a name and description. Most app development programs will ask you to set a basic theme and color palette before you begin building the app. You will be able to change these choices later once the app is under construction. You may be able to add your own images for screen backgrounds. These images should typically be 1024 X 768 px.

There are a variety of different functions you can add to your app, including calendars, photo galleries, podcasts, Facebook integration, audio players, and more. Typically, each one of these functions will be its own screen on your app. As you add functions, you will be able to customize each screen with your own text and content. For example, if you add an RSS feed function, you can link to your blog's feed and automatically populate the app with your latest posts. After you've added a few functions to your app, spend some time organizing the layout of each screen so that you have a cohesive look for your app. Your title bars should all be in the same location, and content should appear in consistent parts of the screen.

Jacob Gedleyihlekisa Zuma (Zulu: [gelZhejile'kisa 'zhuma]; born 12 April 1942) is a South African politician who served as the fourth President of South Africa from the 2009 general election until his resignation on 14 February 2018. Zuma is also referred to by his initials JZ and his clan name Msholozi. Zuma served as Deputy President of South Africa from 1999 to 2005, but was dismissed by President Thabo Mbeki in 2005 after Zuma's financial adviser, Schabir Shaik, was convicted of soliciting a bribe for Zuma. Zuma was nonetheless elected President of the African National Congress (ANC) on 18 December 2007 after defeating Mbeki at the ANC conference in Polokwane. Thabo Mbeki filed an affidavit and applied to the Constitutional Court to appeal Pietermaritzburg High Court Judge Chris Nicholson's ruling: It was improper for the court to make such far-reaching \\"vexatious, scandalous and prejudicial\\" findings concerning me, to be judged and condemned on the basis of the findings in the Zuma matter. The interests of justice, in my respectful submission would demand that the matter be rectified. These adverse findings have led to my being recalled by my political party, the ANC - a request I have acceded to as a committed and loyal member of the ANC for the past 52 years. I fear that if not rectified, I might suffer further prejudice. Tlali Tlali, National Prosecuting Authority spokesman, stated by phone from Pretoria, on 23 September, \\"We have received the papers.

Deputy Judge President Louis Harms had to rule on two aspects of the appeal. The first aspect was whether or not Zuma had the right to be invited to make representations to the NPA before they decided to reinstate charges of bribery and corruption against him. The second aspect was whether Judge Nicholson was correct in implying political meddling by the then President Thabo Mbeki with regards to the NPA's decision to charge Zuma. On the question of the NPA's obligation to invite representations when reviewing decisions, Harms DP found that Nicholson's interpretation of section 179 of the Constitution was incorrect in that the NPA did not have such an obligation and thus was free to have charged Zuma as it did. On the question of Nicholson's inferences of political meddling by Mbeki, Harms DP found that the lower court \\"overstepped the limits of its authority\\".

But that was before the unstoppable march of multi-coloured wheelie bins reached their village. The elderly residents of the historic terrace were shocked by the arrival of not one but three bins for each cottage – a total of 21 for the row – as well as two smaller indoor bins each, including an orange ‘caddy’ for waste food. New delivery: The wheelie bins were lined up outside these attractive cottages on Elizabeth Owen Terrace in Llanfair Dyffryn Clwyd, Denbighshire by the local council.

If you want to make a simple swap that will give your sandwich a dramatically different taste, swap a different nut butter for the peanut butter. You could use cashew, almond, sunflower, or hazelnut butter.","completion":"Each of these alternatives offers its own unique flavor profile and nutritional benefits, allowing you to customize your sandwich to suit your preferences. Here's a closer look at each option and how it can elevate your next peanut butter and jelly sandwich: 1. Cashew Butter: Cashew butter is made from ground cashews and has a smooth, creamy consistency that closely resembles peanut butter. It has a slightly milder flavor compared to peanut butter, with a touch of sweetness that pairs well with fruity jams or preserves. Cashew butter is a good source of healthy fats, protein, and essential minerals like magnesium and iron. 2. Almond Butter: Another popular alternative, almond butter, is made from ground almonds and possesses a creamy, slightly grainy texture. It tends to have a natural sweetness and a hint of nuttiness that pairs well with tart or fruity spreads. Almond butter is rich in vitamin E, magnesium, and fiber, making it a nutritious option for a sandwich upgrade. 3. Sunflower Seed Butter: Sunflower seed butter is derived from sunflower seeds and is an excellent choice for people with nut allergies. Its taste is somewhat reminiscent of peanut butter, with a more earthy and robust flavor that works well with both sweet and savory fillings. Sunflower seed butter is high in heart-healthy unsaturated fats, protein, fiber, and essential nutrients such as vitamin E, magnesium, and selenium. 4. Hazelnut Butter: Hazelnut butter, while less common, offers a unique and indulgent twist to the traditional peanut butter and jelly sandwich. It boasts a distinct nutty taste with slightly sweet undertones, much like the popular hazelnut-chocolate spread, Nutella. Hazelnut butter is a nutritious choice, as it is rich in heart-healthy fats, dietary fiber, and essential vitamins and minerals like vitamin E, magnesium, and manganese. In addition to using a different nut or seed butter, consider experimenting with various spreads to add an extra layer of flavor to your upgraded sandwich. You might choose a unique fruit jam, such as apricot, raspberry, or blackberry, or opt for a preserve made from less-common fruits like figs or rhubarb. You can also try adding fresh fruit slices, such as bananas, apples, or strawberries, for a refreshing contrast to the nut butter and added natural sweetness. Another way to upgrade your peanut butter and jelly sandwich is by switching up the bread. Instead of using traditional white or wheat bread, consider options like whole grain, sourdough, multi-seed, rye, or even a bagel, croissant, or a tortilla wrap. Lastly, don't be afraid to get creative and incorporate unique and unconventional toppings to your sandwich, such as a sprinkle of cinnamon or cocoa powder, a drizzle of honey or maple syrup, a spoonful of Greek yogurt or cream cheese, or even a pinch of sea salt or red pepper flakes for a sweet and savory spin. By experimenting with different nut or seed butters, spreads, bread options, and fun toppings, you can easily upgrade the classic peanut butter and jelly sandwich and discover a modern masterpiece all your own."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Voters will decide between the Democratic candidate , Hillary Clinton, and Donald Trump of the Republicans. But the voting is not a must for each person in the US. So quite a lot of people choose not to vote, especially the young generation. According to Fox News, one-in-five young voters between the ages of 18 and 35 said clearly that they wouldn't vote for either of the two candidates. Just 12 percent of voters aged 35-54, and only nine percent of voters aged 55 and older said the same thing. This is not only because young people don't like Clinton or Trump, according to theFortunemagazine. The truth is that they are traditionally less likely to vote than their parents. \\"Young people are not at an age in their life when they think politics or government has anything to do with them,\\" said Rodd Freitag, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, US. \\"But for the older age groups, they have a home, they pay taxes , they care about schools and the community.\\" Many believe that the civic education of an American youth is another reason why they don't vote. Students usually just do community services like cleaning the neighborhoods. This means they haven't learned how to link real life problems to politics through voting, according to Christopher Beem, a politics professor at the Pennsylvania State University. He said the country needs to help young people learn how to take part in politics and get them to see that they can make a difference.

Title: Dracula Movie plot: In May 1885, Jonathan Harker arrives at the castle of Count Dracula near Klausenburg (Cluj), to take up his post as librarian. Inside, he is startled by a young woman who claims she is a prisoner and begs for his help. Dracula then appears to greet Harker and guide him to his room, where he locks him in. Jonathan starts to write in his diary, and his true intentions are revealed: he is a vampire hunter and has come to kill Dracula. John Van Eyssen as Jonathan Harker. Freed sometime later, Harker again is confronted by the desperate woman. She begs him for help but then bites his neck. Just as she does, Dracula â fangs bared and lips bloody â arrives and pulls her away. When he awakens in daylight, Harker finds the bite mark. He hides his journal in a shrine to the Virgin Mary outside the castle and descends into the crypt, where he finds Dracula and the vampire woman resting in their coffins. Armed with a stake, he impales the woman, who, as he looks on, immediately ages from young to old. Whilst he does this, the sun sets, and when he turns to Dracula's coffin with the intention of killing the vampire, he finds it empty. Looking up, Harker is in time to see the Count shut the door and they are both plunged into darkness... A few days have passed Dr. Van Helsing then arrives in Klausenburg, looking for Harker. An inn keeper's daughter gives him Harker's journal. When he arrives at the castle, it is deserted; a hearse carriage speeds by with a coffin in it. In the crypt, Van Helsing is horrified to discover Harker lying in a coffin as a vampire. Staking Harker, he leaves to deliver the veiled news of Harker's death in person to a wary Arthur Holmwood and his wife Mina, brother and sister-in-law of Harker's fiancÃ©e Lucy Holmwood.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"To combine facts and answer the question, I will first analyze the two cases separately: 1. Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health (1990): This case was concerned with the right to die and whether the parents of Nancy Cruzan, who was in a persistent vegetative state, could remove her feeding tube under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The US Supreme Court ruled that while individuals have a constitutional right to refuse unwanted medical treatment, the state of Missouri's clear and convincing evidence standard for removing life support was constitutional. 2. Bolling v. Sharpe (1954): This case dealt with the desegregation of public schools in Washington D.C. following the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision. The Supreme Court ruled that racial segregation in public schools in Washington D.C. violated the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law. Now, let me find the commonalities between these two cases: Both Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health and Bolling v. Sharpe involved the interpretation of the due process clause, which was applied in both circumstances. In Cruzan, it was the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause, while in Bolling, it was the Fifth Amendment's due process clause. Therefore, the answer to the question is: Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health and Bolling v.

By Joel Christie The watchful eye of a young woman who was doing dishes has been credited with preventing a well-planned family and high school massacre in Minnesota, authorities say. Chelsie Schellhas was standing at the sink of her home in Waseca on Tuesday night when out of the window she noticed a tall young man slip into the storage facility next door. 'He shut the door and normally we see people come here and it doesn’t take them 10 minutes to open a storage shed, so I called it in,' Schellhas told CNN. And she was right - once police arrived, they discovered the unit was being used to make an arsenal of explosive devices, which would eventually lead them to a cache of seven guns and six bombs, along with the materials to make more. ‘A great catastrophe and tragedy was averted,’ OPTIONS: - CNN Mayor Roy Srp said. - Chelsea Schellhas Mayor Roy Srp said. - Chelsie Schellhas Mayor Roy Srp said. - Columbine Mayor Roy Srp said. - Joel Christie Mayor Roy Srp said. - John LaDue Mayor Roy Srp said. - LaDue Mayor Roy Srp said. - Minneapolis Mayor Roy Srp said. - Minnesota Mayor Roy Srp said. - Schellhas Mayor Roy Srp said. - Waseca Mayor Roy Srp said.","completion":"The most logical way to complete the passage would be: ‘A great catastrophe and tragedy was averted,’ CNN Mayor Roy Srp said. Justification: To reach this conclusion, we need to consider previous sentences, the sentence flow and the most relevant figure in the current context. It's apparent from the text that this is a statement from a person of authority, supporting the action of Chelsie Schellhas and also emphasizing the severity of the situation. Looking at the options, the best fit should be the individual mentioned only in the context of some authority without having been explicitly named in the storyline so far. The user also specifies the person to be Roy Srp, who is identified in the options as a Mayor. Considering that the event took place in Waseca, Minnesota, it would be somewhat logical to select Minnesota Mayor or Waseca Mayor Roy Srp; however, a mayor isn't typically referred to by the name of their state, but by their city. Among the other options, Chelsie Schellhas and Joel Christie are already involved in the narrative. Other names, like John LaDue, LaDue, Columbine, etc., are not introduced or relevant to the provided context. The option \\"CNN Mayor Roy Srp said\\" is preferred because CNN is a well-known news network and the earlier mention of CNN in the quotes of Ms. Schellhas implies a connection. It's a practice for news networks to identify prominent figures in their reports for credibility, making the presence of CNN before Mayor Roy Srp logical. Hence, in the context of the news report, Mayor Roy Srp is probably crediting Ms. Schellhas's action on CNN, which is quoted here."},{"prompt":"Definition: In this task, you are given two sentences.

Youngsters are only allowed to drink orange juice, milk and water. A petition has been started calling for children to be allowed squash. Carlton Central Infants says it is following county council guidelines.","completion":"Title: Parents Raise Concerns over Dehydration at Carlton Central Infant School; Start a Petition for Squash Recently, parents at Carlton Central Infant School have expressed significant concerns over the welfare and health of their children. A major issue they have raised is the reported dehydration of their kids, claiming that the current school provision for drinks is not meeting their children's demands for hydration. Parents are particularly critical of the current school policy, which dictates that only orange juice, milk, and water are available for the young pupils to drink. It is essential for children to remain adequately hydrated during the day, especially when they are engaged in physical activities, mental concentration and learning. Dehydration can pose various detrimental effects on children's health, such as dizziness, fatigue, and reduced cognitive abilities. Furthermore, chronic dehydration can lead to more serious health issues over time, which parents understandably want to avoid. Taking matters into their own hands, parents of young pupils at Carlton Central Infant School have initiated an online petition. The central goal of the petition is to persuade the school administration to consider adding squash to the list of approved beverages for children. This, they hope, would greatly help in combating dehydration by offering a more appealing and varied selection of drinks. The belief is that a wider range of choice can encourage kids to stay better hydrated throughout the day. In response to the parents' concerns, Carlton Central Infants have explained that they are merely following the guidelines set by the county council. These guidelines likely impose certain restrictions on available beverage options at schools in order to ensure a standard of health and nutrition. Additionally, the school's focus on serving fruit juices, milk, and water could be to establish healthy habits in children regarding their choices of beverages. However, parents argue that squash, particularly its low-sugar variety, can be a healthy alternative for kids who may not enjoy milk or water. They further emphasize that fruit juices, despite being widely accepted as a healthy option, may not be the best choice for children in large quantities, due to their sugar content. In light of this, the call for squash appears to be a reasonable request. As the petition garners attention and more signatures, it would be necessary for Carlton County Council and the school to address the concerns voiced by the parents. This might involve revisiting their guidelines or exploring modified beverage options tailored to the children's needs and preferences, while still maintaining a focus on health and nutrition. The situation at Carlton Central Infant School highlights the importance of open communication between educational institutions and parents. Addressing the needs of the students should always be of paramount concern, as the ultimate goal is to create an environment that fosters healthy children who are in a suitable condition for learning and growth. With the added support of the petition, it is hoped that a resolution can be reached that satisfies both the school administration and the concerned parents."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer should be","completion":"iv. continues carving the face of the pumpkin to turn it into a jack-o-lantern. The woman, with a steady hand and a focused gaze, meticulously carves a zigzag mouth, triangular-shaped eyes, and a pointy nose, giving the pumpkin a comically sinister look. She uses a combination of various carving tools to work dexterously and craft the facial features with precision. Each detail is painstakingly carved, with the flicker of joy and satisfaction in her eyes as she marvels at the transformation taking place before her. Upon removing the cut-out sections, she sets them aside on a clean kitchen towel, to be repurposed later for her halloween-themed decoration collection. Having nearly completed the facial features, she steps back for a moment to admire her handiwork. Pleased with the results, she envisions the warm glow of the light within the pumpkin when illuminated in the dark. She begins to put the finishing touches on her creation, smoothing out the edges and making minor adjustments for a consistent appearance. Finished with the carving, she gets a small tealight candle from her cabinet and places it at the bottom center of the pumpkin before lighting it with a long matchstick gently blowing out the match when the tealight ignites. A sense of accomplishment fills her, as she covers the top of the pumpkin with the pumpkin lid she had reserved earlier. As the sky outside her window turns to shades of deep indigo, eagerly waiting trick-or-treaters can be seen in the distance, their laughter and excitement palpable. The woman steps outside and proudly presents her creation to the world, placing the transformed jack-o-lantern on the front porch. The warm and flickering light casts eerie, yet enchanting shadows as the darkness engulfs the neighborhood, signaling the beginning of a memorable Halloween night."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the release that marked a change in Metallica's musical direction? ? After almost three years of touring to promote Metallica, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played a short tour, Escape from the Studio '95, comprising three outdoor shows, including a headline show at Donington Park supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996. Load debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number-one album. The cover art, Blood and Semen III, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass. The release marked a change in the band's musical direction and a new image; the bandmembers' hair was cut. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza festival in mid-1996. During early production of the album, the band had recorded enough material to fill a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released; the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in follow-up album titled Reload. The cover art was again created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine. Reload debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart. Hetfield said in the 2004 documentary film Some Kind of Monster that the band initially thought some of the songs on these albums were of average quality; these were \\"polished and reworked\\" until judged releasable. To promote Reload, Metallica performed \\"Fuel\\" and \\"The Memory Remains\\" with Marianne Faithfull on NBC's Saturday Night Live in December 1997.In 1998, Metallica compiled a double album of cover songs, Garage Inc. The first disc contained newly recorded covers of songs by Diamond Head, Killing Joke, the Misfits, Thin Lizzy,...

This place has gone a bit downhill as far as service goes and now methinks the food is to. It was only 4 pm and there were more service staff to customers. Maybe it was the heat but the staff looked like they had a Meh! attitude and just going through the motions. Hostess just pointed me to a table and it took about 10 min. for the wairtress to acknowledge me. Took about another 10 min to get my ice tea. The cup of chili was the highlight of the meal and not so much the entree. A different gal brought my chili but never offered to refill my tea which was empty. Didn't get a refill until I was part way through my meal. Good thing they had A/C or I might have become dehydrated lol. The waitress was very indifferent and I felt like I was more of a bother than a customer. Now for the meal. Had the chicken fried steak, mashed taters and corn on the cob. All items felt like they had been sitting under the heating light way too long. The corn tasted like it had been soaking all day in water, Should have went next door to Red Lobster to borrow a lobster bib, it was so wet, soggy and not crisp. The mashed taters were ok, but like I said not very hot. The chicken fried steak was tough and stringy and didn't look like it was very fresh compared to other places and the creamy black pepper gravy had no pepper in it, looked like Mr Magoo missed the gravy and put all the pepper on the corn on the cob!","completion":"To analyze the sentiment of the given review, I will break it down into different aspects: 1. Service: The reviewer mentions that the service has gone downhill, mentioning the staff's indifferent attitude, long wait times for service, and the staff not being attentive to their needs like refilling their tea. Sentiment: Negative 2. Food: The reviewer indicates that the food quality has also declined, describing the chicken fried steak as tough and stringy, the corn on the cob as soggy, and the mashed potatoes as lukewarm. The chili was the only highlight of their meal, but the overall impression of the food is not positive. Sentiment: Negative 3. Atmosphere: The reviewer briefly mentions that the restaurant had air conditioning, which they appreciate in a humorous way; however, this point is overshadowed by the overall tone of the review. Sentiment: Neutral Overall sentiment: Negative The review mainly talks about the negatives related to the service and food at the restaurant. There is only a neutral point made about the air conditioning and no significant positive points. Hence, the overall sentiment of this review is negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Entomology (from Greek , \\"entomon\\" \\"insect\\"; and , \\"\\") is the scientific study of insects, a branch of zoology. In the past the term \\"insect\\" was more vague, and historically the definition of entomology included the study of terrestrial animals in other arthropod groups or other phyla, such as arachnids, myriapods, earthworms, land snails, and slugs. This wider meaning may still be encountered in informal use. Like several of the other fields that are categorized within zoology, entomology is a taxon-based category; any form of scientific study in which there is a focus on insect-related inquiries is, by definition, entomology. Entomology therefore overlaps with a cross-section of topics as diverse as molecular genetics, behavior, biomechanics, biochemistry, systematics, physiology, developmental biology, ecology, morphology, and paleontology. At some 1.3 million described species, insects account for more than two-thirds of all known organisms, date back some 400 million years, and have many kinds of interactions with humans and other forms of life on earth. Entomology is rooted in nearly all human cultures from prehistoric times, primarily in the context of agriculture (especially biological control and beekeeping), but scientific study began only as recently as the 16th century. William Kirby is widely considered as the father of Entomology. In collaboration with William Spence, he published a definitive entomological encyclopedia, \\"Introduction to Entomology\\", regarded as the subject's foundational text. He also helped to found the Royal Entomological Society in London in 1833, one of the earliest such societies in the world; earlier antecedents, such as the Aurelian society date back to the 1740s.

Answer a question about this article: Green is common in nature, as many plants are green because of a complex chemical known as chlorophyll, which is involved in photosynthesis. Chlorophyll absorbs the long wavelengths of light (red) and short wavelengths of light (blue) much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear green to the human eye, so light reflected by plants is enriched in green. Chlorophyll absorbs green light poorly because it first arose in organisms living in oceans where purple halobacteria were already exploiting photosynthesis. Their purple color arose because they extracted energy in the green portion of the spectrum using bacteriorhodopsin. The new organisms that then later came to dominate the extraction of light were selected to exploit those portions of the spectrum not used by the halobacteria. Why are many plants green?","completion":"Many plants are green because of a complex chemical called chlorophyll, which is involved in the process of photosynthesis. Chlorophyll is good at absorbing long wavelengths of light (red) and short wavelengths of light (blue) but absorbs green light poorly. When light is reflected by plants, it is mainly the green light that is reflected, not absorbed, which makes the plants appear green to the human eye. The evolution of chlorophyll absorption in the aspect of green light is linked back to a time when organisms lived in oceans where purple halobacteria were exploiting photosynthesis, extracting energy from the green portion of the spectrum using a pigment called bacteriorhodopsin. As a result, the newer organisms, which became the dominant ones, evolved to use those portions of the spectrum not utilized by the halobacteria, which is why chlorophyll does not absorb green light efficiently."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It serves directly to assist a rapid distribution of goods at reasonable prices, thereby establishing a firm home market and so making it possible to provide for export at competitive prices. By drawing attention to new ideas it helps enormously to raise standards of living. By helping to increase demand it ensures an increased need for labor, and is therefore an effective way to fight unemployment. It lowers the costs of many services: without advertisements your daily newspaper would cost four times as much, the price of your television license would need to be doubled, and travel by bus or tube would cost 20 per cent more. And perhaps most important of all, advertising provides a guarantee of reasonable value in the products and services you buy. Apart from the fact that twenty-seven Acts of Parliament govern the terms of advertising, no regular advertiser dare promote a product that fails to live up to the promise of his advertisements. He might fool some people for a little while through misleading advertising. He will not do so for long, for mercifully the public has the good sense not to buy the inferior article more than once.

Question: where was ms-13 originally from? Would \\"Members of MS distinguish themselves by tattoos covering the body and also often the face, as well as the use of their own sign language .\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"MS-13, also known as Mara Salvatrucha, is a transnational criminal organization and street gang that originally formed in Los Angeles, California, in the United States during the late 1980s. The gang, which is primarily composed of Central American immigrants and descendants from El Salvador, was created as a way to protect Salvadoran immigrants from other, more established gangs in Los Angeles. Many of the original members were refugees who had fled El Salvador during the country's civil war in the 1980s. As a result, these individuals brought with them a legacy of violence and trauma that played a significant role in the development of MS-13. Over time, the gang expanded its presence across the United States and to other countries, particularly in Central America. This expansion was facilitated, in part, by deportations of criminal individuals back to their home countries, which allowed MS-13 to establish a foothold in countries such as El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. As a result, the gang evolved from a localized, street-level organization to a transnational criminal organization engaged in a wide range of criminal activities including drug trafficking, human trafficking, extortion, and murder. Regarding the statement \\"Members of MS distinguish themselves by tattoos covering the body and also often the face, as well as the use of their own sign language,\\" this would be a reasonable, albeit incomplete, characterization of the gang's identity and distinguishing features. MS-13 members are indeed well-known for their distinctive tattoos, which often cover a significant portion of the individual's body and can even include facial tattoos. These tattoos often incorporate symbols and imagery associated with the gang, such as the numbers \\"13\\" or \\"MS,\\" as well as images of weapons, skulls, devils, and other elements intended to signify the group's violent and criminal nature. In addition to tattoos, MS-13 members have also been known to employ specialized hand signs and gestures as a form of communication and identification. This \\"sign language\\" can include unique signs representing specific gang affiliations, as well as other, more general gang-related signs and gestures that may be common among various street gangs. The use of complex, secretive forms of communication is a common feature of criminal organizations, as it can make it more difficult for law enforcement and outsiders to intercept and interpret the group's activities. However, it is also important to note that in recent years, MS-13 has started to depart from some of these traditional markers of gang identity, as law enforcement agencies have become more adept at identifying and targeting individuals based on these visible signs of gang affiliation. As a result, some MS-13 members may now forego tattoos or use more discreet tattoo placements, while also adopting a more varied and subtle range of signs and gestures to communicate their affiliation and intentions. This evolution underscores the adaptive and resilient nature of the gang, as it seeks to evade detection and continue its criminal operations both in the United States and abroad. In summary, while the statement about tattoos and sign language is a reasonable representation of some key aspects of MS-13's identity and distinguishing features, it does not fully capture the complexity and evolving nature of the gang. MS-13 is a transnational criminal organization with roots in El Salvador that began in Los Angeles, and over time, has spread across the United States and Central America. Understanding the gang's origins, history, and present-day activities is crucial to formulate effective strategies to address and mitigate the threat it poses to society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Through the dark, I could see three bolts left in the wall from where they'd taken down the crucifix. A confessional too beaten-up to have been sold was shaking in a way that suggested activity inside, and where the pews had been taken out, a couple hundred people were testifying to the DJ's moving sermon. Rachel stepped forward into the crowd while I took a moment to drink in the ceiling's blue-lit, shadowed vault and the light-catching haze from who-knows-what rising between the DJ and the crowd. There was a terrific echo, each beat reverberating inside of the next, and the old stained-glass windows rattled in their frames. On the dance floor, people moved with their eyes closed and their hands in the air. I danced with Rachel for a while, but then something by the bar seemed to be pulling her eyes. She told me that she was heading for a drink and slipped out of the crowd. When she hadn't come back halfway through the next song, I glanced over at the bar. It was just a little set-up where someone had stacked a few crates and brought something alcoholic to share, mostly beer. Rachel was standing with a plastic cup, looking like she was having a conversation, but I couldn't see anyone else there. The next time the crowd split, I saw him. He stood in front of a blue light, so I couldn't see him clearly, but what I saw was memorable. He wore a jacket of what might have been blue velvet, and his hair gleamed black against his white skin. The blue haze seemed to stop just shy of his pallor, setting off his striking face without illuminating its details, and his wrists flashed white in the darkness. He didn't move, just stared and held his drink. The next time I saw them, his mouth was moving. She nodded and he took her arm. I watched them through the crush of dancers as they squeezed along the wall, and the feeling came to me that something was very wrong. Saturday morning, I woke up and saw that she still hadn't come home.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: Run to the nearest house B: Run to the grocery store C: Call the ambulance Answer:","completion":"After considering the context provided, Lee screamed for help when an assailant tried to grab her purse. In this situation, Lee may be experiencing fear and panic, and her primary concern will likely be to ensure her safety and get assistance. Out of the given options, answer A: Run to the nearest house seems to best address the question according to the context. This is because, by running to the nearest house, Lee can distance herself from her assailant and potentially find help from someone inside the house. Additionally, she may be able to contact the authorities from the safety of the house, ensuring that they are informed of the incident and can take necessary action. Answer B: Run to the grocery store may not be the best option, as it is unclear how close the grocery store is in relation to Lee's current location. Also, depending on the time of day, the grocery store may not be occupied, meaning Lee might not find help there. Furthermore, the grocery store could be farther away than the nearest house, and safety would be her main priority in this situation. Answer C: Call the ambulance is not the most appropriate option in this context. While Lee might be frightened and experiencing stress, she may not have any physical injuries that would require medical assistance from an ambulance. Additionally, if Lee were to call the ambulance, she would still be exposed to potential danger from her assailant if she stays at her current location. Therefore, ensuring her safety first by distancing herself from the assailant and seeking help from a nearby house would be the most logical next step for Lee."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Justin was so short in stature.. B). Ian was so short in stature..","completion":"Justin was a little dwarf compared to Ian because Justin was so short in stature. This difference in height between the two friends was not a hindrance to their close bond, but rather a unique aspect that set them apart. Justin's short stature was a result of genetics, as both of his parents were also short in height. Growing up, he did not experience the same growth spurts that other children might have, which ultimately led to his smaller-than-average height. While some people might have felt self-conscious about their size, Justin embraced his height and made the best of it. On the other hand, Ian was taller than average, with a height that towered over others around him. His height was also a genetic gift from his parents, who were both quite tall themselves. Ian was confident and at times, even protective of his shorter friend, Justin. Despite their differences in height, Justin and Ian had a lot in common, developing a deep, meaningful friendship. They shared similar interests, hobbies, and values and enjoyed spending time together. Being height diverse proved to be beneficial in various aspects of their lives; for example, when playing basketball, Ian would be able to reach for higher baskets, while Justin could move quickly and nimbly around the court. In addition to their physical differences, their personalities complemented each other as well. Justin was an optimistic, humorous person, making light of his situation whenever he could. His sense of humor did not go unnoticed by Ian, as he admired Justin's ability to find joy despite the potential challenges he faced due to his height. Ian, on the other hand, was more serious and introspective, often considering the long-term consequences of their actions. Their unique friendship allowed them both to learn and grow from one another's experiences. Justin taught Ian how to embrace life and find humor in the little things, while Ian offered stability and guidance to Justin. They would often engage in deep conversations about life, love, and everything in between, growing closer as they navigated their way through the world. As they moved through life, Justin and Ian encountered various challenges and triumphs that tested their friendship. Through thick and thin, they supported one another, offering a shoulder to lean on and providing encouragement. Height was but a small aspect of what made these two friends unique, and their undeniable bond persevered through it all. In conclusion, Justin was a little dwarf compared to Ian because of his short stature. However, this difference in height became a strength in their friendship, as they embraced their uniqueness, relied on each other's strengths, and ultimately made an incredible team. Their bond was a testament to the power of friendship, proving that differences, while noticeable, do not have to define one's relationships or the value they hold."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Questions: What preposition do you use if you want to combine two words? Options: - article - adjective - interjection - conjunction - pronoun Answer:","completion":"The correct option to pick in line with common sense to combine two words is a conjunction. Conjunctions are words that connect two or more words, phrases, clauses, or sentences and help them flow together. They are essential for creating more complex sentences and ideas, as they provide smooth and logical transitions. A conjunction allows you to create compound or complex sentences by linking words or groups of words, maintaining the coherence and cohesion in the text. Some common examples of conjunctions include \\"and,\\" \\"but,\\" \\"or,\\" \\"so,\\" \\"yet,\\" \\"for,\\" \\"nor,\\" and \\"either...or.\\" These words facilitate and enrich communication by joining words or phrases that have similar meanings or complement each other. Let's take a closer look at the other options: 1. Article: An article is a type of determiner that precedes and provides context to a noun. There are two types of articles: definite (the) and indefinite (a, an). Articles do not connect words but rather provide information about the specificity of a noun. 2. Adjective: Adjectives are words that describe or modify nouns. They give additional information about the noun's quantity, quality, size, color, or other attributes. While adjectives add detail and richness to language, they are not designed to connect two words. 3. Interjection: Interjections are words or short phrases that express emotion, surprise, or reaction in a sentence. They are often followed by an exclamation mark and can stand alone or be incorporated into a longer sentence. Examples of interjections include \\"oh,\\" \\"wow,\\" \\"ouch,\\" and \\"yikes.\\" Interjections do not combine two words, as their primary function is to convey a feeling or sentiment. 4. Pronoun: Pronouns are words that replace or stand in for nouns, helping to avoid repetition in a text. They can refer to people, animals, objects, or abstract concepts. Some common examples of pronouns include \\"he,\\" \\"she,\\" \\"it,\\" \\"they,\\" \\"them,\\" \\"this,\\" \\"that,\\" \\"these,\\" and \\"those.\\" Pronouns do not connect words but rather serve to replace or refer to other nouns. In summary, the best option to combine two words is a conjunction, as it serves to join words, phrases, or clauses in a meaningful and coherent manner, enhancing communication and providing logical transitions within a text."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil.

The sensors showed her heart rate was 103 beats/min before launch and increased to 240 beats/min during the early acceleration. After reaching orbit, Sputnik 2's nose cone was jettisoned successfully; however the \\"Block A\\" core did not separate as planned, preventing the thermal control system from operating correctly. Some of the thermal insulation tore loose, raising the cabin temperature to 40 °C (104 °F). After three hours of weightlessness, Laika's pulse rate had settled back to 102 beats/min, three times longer than it had taken during earlier ground tests, an indication of the stress she was under. The early telemetry indicated that Laika was agitated but eating her food. After approximately five to seven hours into the flight, no further signs of life were received from the spacecraft.The Soviet scientists had planned to euthanise Laika with a poisoned serving of food. For many years, the Soviet Union gave conflicting statements that she had died either from asphyxia, when the batteries failed, or that she had been euthanised. Many rumours circulated about the exact manner of her death. In 1999, several Russian sources reported that Laika had died when the cabin overheated on the fourth orbit. In October 2002, Dimitri Malashenkov, one of the scientists behind the Sputnik 2 mission, revealed that Laika had died by the fourth circuit of flight from overheating.

In this context, the question seeks to identify the title of a novel written by John Steinbeck, which tells the story of the Joad family and their struggles after being forced to leave their home in the Oklahoma dustbowl. John Steinbeck is a well-known American author who wrote numerous novels, short stories, and other literary works throughout his career. Among his works, one novel, in particular, has become a classic in American literature and deals with the events described in the question: The Grapes of Wrath. Published in 1939, The Grapes of Wrath follows the journey of the Joad family as they migrate from Oklahoma to California, seeking a better life after losing their farm during the Great Depression and the dustbowl era. The novel delves into the hardships and struggles faced by the family and other migrants during this tumultuous time in American history. The story touches upon various themes, such as poverty, social injustice, and the resilience of the human spirit. It also offers a critical examination of the economic and social systems that contributed to the widespread suffering experienced during the Great Depression. Steinbeck's vivid portrayal of the Joad family and the difficulties they face in their quest for a brighter future struck a chord with readers and brought attention to the plight of the thousands of families like theirs who were impacted by the dustbowl disaster and the Great Depression. The Grapes of Wrath won the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and was later adapted into a successful film directed by John Ford in 1940. In conclusion, the question is asking about an entity - the title of a John Steinbeck novel that tells the story of the Joad family, who are forced to leave their home in the Oklahoma dustbowl.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Prospects - NYTimes.com No sooner did economists agree that the recession was severe than they began pointing at early signs of a recovery. Part of the forecasting proble m, explained Norman Roberts on, chief economist at the Mellon National Bank, is that ''all the p redictions of an economic free-fall were based on cutbacks in manufacturing.'' Car sales, housing construction and overall indus trial production are all depressed. But, as Mr. Robertson said, th e service industry, which has grown over the years to account for 72 percent of nonfarm employment, ''is less sensitive to high inter est rates and remains strong.'' Service, he said, ''is not adequately expressed in the monthly parade of data.'' That is why some analysts were suprised when retail sales rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in November, despite rising unemployment and sharp declines in manufacturing. Among the major sources of personal income, manufacturing payrolls account for only 16 percent, he pointed out, compared with 40 percent from service and government employment, and 27 percent from transfer and interest payments. The 1982 housing market will be weak indeed, with only about 1.25 million starts expected this year, up slightly from 1.1 million in 1981. Peter Treadway, an economist at Cralin Capital Markets, and formerly chief economist at the Federal National Mortgage Association, said ''The problem until now was high interest rates, but rising unemployment is a new factor that will depress housing and offset the stimulus of lower interest rates.'' Many economists say that the public would rush for fixed-rate mortgages at 15 percent, but they doubt that rate will be widely available. Mr. Treadway said he expected the public to turn to various kinds of adjustible rate mortgages, which might account for 60 percent of all new conventional mortgages this year, up from 30 percent in 1981. To sell them may require some brisk marketing to ''re-educate people who have been conditioned not to shop for mortgage money,'' commented Howard Crane, a vice-president at the Federal National Mortgage Association. A Money Bulge The nation's basic money supply rose 9.6 billion in the last nine weeks of 1981. Some economists are worried that the rapid growth will continue into January and cause the Federal Reserve to make credit scarcer in the banking system, thereby pushing up interest rates. Rapid growth was welcome late last year when M-1 was far below its annual target. Now the Fed is aiming at a 2 1/2 percent to 5 1/2 percent annual growth target and even if it wants slightly faster growth this year than last, it can not tolerate for long the nearly 18 percent annual growth rate of the past month. Concern about money supply growth may peak on Jan. 15 when the Fed is expected to announce a large - perhaps 5 billion or more - increase for the week ended Jan. 6. An earlier-than-normal Dec. 31 delivery of January's Social Security checks could cause a surge in checking account deposits, which are the major component of the M-1 measure of money supply. A large increase in M-1 automatically raises the reserve needs of the banking system and could push up short-term rates if the Fed did nothing. Many analysts expect the Fed to supply enough reserves to keep rates from rising until it learns if the large, expected increase was reversed in suceeding weeks. Whither the Weather? Experts expect fuel prices to be stable this winter, but what about the other determinant of heating costs - the weather? The National Weather Service expects the next three months to bring below-normal temperatures for most areas east of a line drawn from western Minnesota to Missouri as well as in the Mountain, West South Central and West North Central regions. Normal or above-normal temperatures are forecast for the West North Central, South Atlantic, and Pacific regions. Colder weather means more heating degree days, a measure of how far and how often temperatures drop below 65 degrees farenheit. For example, one day of 50 degrees equals 15 heating degree days. Henry Warren, an analyst at the weather service, says the three-month national forecast implies total degree days equaling 97 percent of last year, but 2 percent above normal. The accumulated heating degree days for New England, Mid-Atlantic, and East North Central regions are forecast at 93 percent, 95 percent and 9 8 percent, respectively, of the 1981 totals. Still, heating degre e days in those regions will be 5 percent to 7 percent above normal.
