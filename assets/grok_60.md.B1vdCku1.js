Find out which cords plug into mics and which ones go between soundboards and amps. You need to know how to set up all kinds of sound equipment. You can learn these things online through tutorial videos and also in person when you can work with sound people. Some sound equipment is the same as it was years ago, but many other technologies are continuing to evolve. Staying current on your knowledge is vital. You need to know how mix and edit in music software like Pro Tools and Cubase. If you can, purchase one of these programs and begin exploring what they can do and practice editing songs. Pick a song you like and import it into the software. Practice splitting the song into parts and changing pitches and volumes. Not all sound engineers mix new music tracks, but being able to do it will make you more versatile. It will take time to learn all of the things you can do, but it’s important to start building a foundation. Because sound engineers work with so many types of electrical equipment, you will need to learn some basic electrical safety. Learn about basic electricity, such as the difference between voltage and current. You will need to know how many pieces of equipment can be plugged into a specific power strip so you don’t blow a fuse or ruin the equipment. Taking classes in physics, for example, is a good place to start. If classes are not an option, consider an electrical safety training seminar. If you are still in school, you have access to some opportunities that others don’t. Try to get involved with the theater program, which most likely uses a sound system during plays. Productions are often mostly run by students anyway, so this is an easy way to get hands on experience in a low key setting. In college, you also have some opportunities to get involved in running sound, even if you aren’t studying it. Check in with your campus theater and see what they require for their sound people. Find out if you could start working with someone who already does it and learn from them. While you can learn on the job and get lots of experience, earning a degree shows your commitment to learning. It shows that you can work hard on something until it is complete. A degree also shows that you have been properly trained in the field. While it may not be mandatory for some jobs, it’s going to make you look better to those looking to hire quality engineers.

Become familiar with your dog's body so you have a good idea of what a healthy body shape is for it. A dog in good body condition should have a waist line when viewed from above or the side, and you should be able to feel its ribs easily, but without the ribs standing out through the skin. If you inspect your dog's body regularly, for example when you brush it, then you will be able to spot changes more easily.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: Can the film be seen as an allegory of post-World War II Eastern European political systems? Movie plot title: Werckmeister Harmonies Movie plot: The film can be seen as an allegory of post-World War II Eastern European political systems - told as a black-and-white cinematic poem with 39 long, single-camera takes. It examines the brutalization of a society, its political systems and ethics through the metaphor of a decaying circus whale and its star performer. It is set in a desolate, isolated small town in Hungary during Soviet times. The film starts with JÃ¡nos Valuska, a simple person, conducting a poem and dance with drunken bar patrons. The dance is of the total eclipse of the sun, which disturbs, then silences the animals. It finishes with the grand return of the warm sunlight. One of the significant reoccurring characters in this plot is the subtle transitions between light and darkness. The first appearance of this motif is a lamp in the bar, moving to a door into the darkness. The circus arrives like a Trojan Horse in the darkness of night. A window is opened as a glimmer of hope and dressed to shut out the world. The antagonist is only ever seen as a shadow. JÃ¡nos' uncle GyÃ¶rgy is a composer, and therefore one of the intelligentsia. GyÃ¶rgy observes the imperfection and compromise of the musical scale (as defined by Andreas Werckmeister a historical theorist). GyÃ¶rgy proposes changes to the scale to make it more harmonious. This utopian approach to music represents a flawed, naive idealism that never can be achieved; it is not developed any further in the film or the book. It is just a statement indicating that human governance will always be flawed. GyÃ¶rgy's estranged wife tries to leverage her political and social status by giving GyÃ¶rgy a list of names to recruit for the \\"clean up the town movement\\" (with the blessing of the police chief). However, a stuffed smelly circus whale and its star performer, Prince, come to town in the silence and darkness of night. This is a metaphor for a bloated political system and the unseen Prince who represents the power of politically inspired, emotive dogma. JÃ¡nos philosophizes about God and the... The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the film Werckmeister Harmonies can be seen as an allegory of post-World War II Eastern European political systems. The film uses metaphors and symbols like the decaying circus whale and its star performer, representing the bloated political system and the power of politically inspired dogma. It is set in a small town in Hungary during Soviet times, reflecting the harsh realities of life under Communist rule. The film also explores themes of idealism and flawed human governance through the character György, who proposes to change the musical scale to make it more harmonious. This mirrors the utopian aspirations of Eastern European political systems that ultimately proved to be unattainable. Overall, the film serves as an allegorical representation of the struggles, complexities, and disillusionment faced by Eastern European societies in the aftermath of World War II."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: A small twin-engine plane crashed into the Superstition Mountains east of Phoenix on Wednesday night and there was no apparent sign of survivors, authorities said. Rescue crews flown in by helicopter to reach the crash site in rugged terrain reported finding two debris field on fire, suggesting that the plane broke apart on impact, the Pinal County sheriff's office said. Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Allen Kenitzer says the Rockwell AC69 had just departed from Mesa's Falcon Field when it crashed about 40 miles east of downtown Phoenix. Authorities started getting calls reporting an explosion near the peak of a mountain at about 6:30 p.m. It was unclear how many passengers were aboard the plane, which was registered to Ponderosa Aviation Inc. in Safford, Ariz. A man who answered the phone Wednesday night at Ponderosa Aviation declined to comment on the crash and refused to identify himself. Calls to Falcon Field, which mostly serves small, private planes, weren't immediately returned. Kenitzer said the FAA and National Transportation Safety Board would be investigating the cause of the crash. Rescue crews who arrived by helicopter reported finding 24-inch tires at the crash site, which would indicate a small twin-engine plane. Pinal County sheriff's spokeswoman Angelique Graham said people who heard an explosion near the Flat Iron area close to Lost Dutchman State Park. \\"People said it sounded like fireworks going off,\\" Graham said. Some witnesses told Phoenix-area television stations they heard a plane trying to rev its engines to climb higher before apparently hitting the mountains. The elevation is about 5,000 feet at the Superstition Mountains' highest point. Video showed several fires burning on the mountainside, where heavy brush is common. The region near Lost Dutchman State Park and the Superstition Wilderness is filled with steep canyons, soaring rocky outcroppings and cactus. Treasure hunters who frequent the area have been looking for the legendary Lost Dutchman mine for more than a century. ||||| (CNN) -- Six people, including three children, were killed when their plane crashed into rugged mountains east of Phoenix on a Thanksgiving eve trip, authorities said Thursday. Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu identified the dead as a father and his three children, plus two other men. All were Arizona residents and knew each other well, he said. The twin-engine Rockwell 690A airplane slammed into a steep cliff near the top of the Superstition Mountains at 6:31 p.m. on Wednesday, strewing debris for hundreds of yards down the 80-degree incline, Babeu told reporters. Recovery efforts by more than 50 deputies and volunteers involved collect and preserving the remains, the sheriff said. \\"No one could survive that crash,\\" he said. The plane had flown from Safford to Mesa, where it picked up the siblings -- ages 9, 8 and 6 -- for the Thanksgiving holiday, Babeu said. \\"All of these families are just obviously heartbroken, traumatized over the loss of their loved ones so suddenly here on Thanksgiving,\\" he said. Federal officials were expected to begin their investigation as soon as Thursday, according to Babeu. A man who said he witnessed the impact told CNN that a mushroom cloud of flames lit up the evening sky. Kevin Cunningham, 44, of Apache Junction, said he was talking on the phone from his back porch and saw the crash a few miles away. \\"The flames lit up the mountain,\\" said Cunningham, adding the plane appeared to be flying level before the crash. \\"I didn't see where it was in distress.\\" CNN's Phil Gast and Tom Cohen contributed to this report. ||||| Summary:","completion":"A small twin-engine Rockwell AC69 plane crashed into the Superstition Mountains east of Phoenix on Wednesday night, with no apparent sign of survivors.

Having several bottles of high-priced perfume to choose from made Jason happy but not Donald because","completion":"Donald had always been more frugal, and he couldn't understand Jason's fascination with spending so much money on fragrances. The two friends had grown up together, with their families living in the same neighborhood. As they grew older and went to the same college, their friendship remained strong. However, there was one significant difference between them: their views on luxury items and spending habits. Jason came from a well-off family and was no stranger to the finer things in life. He worked hard in school aiming to achieve his dreams of becoming a successful entrepreneur. He believed in investing in quality products that could boost his confidence, and he saw his perfume collection as one of those investments. Donald, on the other hand, grew up in a middle-class household where frugality was the norm. His parents had always emphasized the importance of saving money and living within one's means. Donald admired Jason's ambitions and work ethic, but he could not wrap his head around spending exorbitant amounts of money for something as fleeting as a scent. One day, Jason invited Donald over to show off his latest perfume acquisitions. He had just returned from a business conference and was excited to share his experiences and new fragrances. As Jason showcased his assortment of expensive perfumes, Donald's discomfort grew. He found it difficult to indulge in Jason's excitement while their different perspectives screamed loudly in his mind. To Donald, the perfumes represented excess and materialism, whereas, to Jason, they signified prestige and personal growth. Donald remained silent, reluctantly obliging as Jason eagerly sprayed samples of the scents onto their wrists. With each spritz, Jason described the notes and ingredients that made each scent unique, trying to spark a conversation about the perfumes' history, the artistry behind their creation, and their renowned makers. Donald tried his best to be a supportive friend, but he couldn't help feeling bothered. Finally, he spoke up. \\"Jason, I understand that you appreciate the craftsmanship behind these perfumes, but can't you see that spending this much money on them is excessive?\\" Donald challenged. For a moment, Jason appeared taken aback by Donald's candid comment, but then his expression softened. \\"I can see why you might feel that way, but to me, these perfumes are more than just scents. They symbolize the aspirations I hold, the challenges I've overcome, and my desire to strive for excellence. I don't view them as mere luxury items, but as reminders of my goals and accomplishments.\\" Donald listened intently, trying to understand Jason's perspective. \\"I guess I didn't see it that way before. I understand that everyone has their own way of acknowledging their achievements, and your perfume collection is a way for you to celebrate yours. I'm sorry if I seemed judgmental; it's born out of my own upbringing and values.\\" Jason smiled. \\"I appreciate your honesty, and I understand where you're coming from. Our different backgrounds have shaped our perspectives, but that's why our friendship works so well. We learn from each other, and we challenge each other's viewpoints.\\" Both friends spent the rest of the evening engaged in deep conversations about their dreams, aspirations, and life choices. This debate over luxury items had opened up a door for them to understand each other even better. While they may not have seen eye to eye on everything, their friendship was made stronger by their ability to respect and appreciate their differences. They knew that regardless of how many high-priced perfumes Jason collected or how many budget-friendly colognes Donald preferred, their bond would continue to thrive, thanks to their willingness to accept and cherish each other's unique perspectives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. You may recall the \\"Saudi Arabia of renewables\\" rhetoric. Land was earmarked for Dundee and Leith and Renfrew and Methil. Thousands of jobs were attached to the announcements. It's not turning out that way. And the announcement that two of the biggest players are joining forces - Siemens and Gamesa - makes it even less likely. So what's going on, and what's gone wrong for Scotland's plans? Part of the story was that Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) would be pioneered in the North Sea, treating the emissions from power stations at either Longannet or Peterhead. They were in a competition for £1bn of UK government funding to make Britain a centre for that new technology. But the funding has been withdrawn. Both projects have been ended. The chances of Britain pioneering CCS now look very slim. The wind business has picked up though, at least onshore, helping Scotland to reach its ambitious emission targets for the first time. And how many of the turbines sprouting around Scotland are made in this country, generating jobs as well as power? Of the larger turbines, only a few, from the small manufacturing plant at Campbeltown. That has seen some rocky times financially. Bailed out by SSE and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, they sold it in April to a Korean firm, at which point it was employing 134 people. Other turbines are imported from the countries which got ahead in the early days of turbine manufacturing - Denmark, Spain and Germany. And with Britain having the most ambitious offshore wind plans of any country, the German bosses at Siemens agreed to put a manufacturing plant on this side of the North Sea. Including improvements to the port of Hull, the investment is of £350m, with 200 jobs in construction and 1,000 in the factory. It is due to open on 1 September this year. The plans in Scotland have withered. In 2010, Mitsubishi took over Artemis hydraulic power pioneers near Edinburgh, with talk of £100m investment on the way. The then first Minister, Alex Salmond, said back then: \\"The decision will create 30 high-quality jobs, safeguard 25 jobs and is likely to create 200 jobs by 2015. And as well as delivering new jobs and investment, over the long-term this announcement could result in the creation of a major offshore wind turbine manufacturing site in Scotland.\\" Artemis now has a team of about 50, and Mitsubishi has a test centre at Hunterston in North Ayrshire. Doosan, based in Korea, announced £170m of investment, and design of a new, very large turbine - perhaps in Renfrew, perhaps Dundee. Over ten years, more than 800 new jobs were foreseen. That was in March 2011. (The proximity to that year's election was surely coincidental, wasn't it?) The following, December, they pulled out of the plan. Not only had they under-estimated the difficulty of getting into the market, but they hadn't reckoned on Britain's unpredictable regulatory regime. In February 2012, GE Energy pulled out of plans for a British manufacturing facility. The next month, Gamesa announced it had chosen Leith over Hartlepool and Dundee as the location for its British turbine-making factory. The announcement came with the prospect of 800 jobs, and lots more indirectly, along with £125m of investment. This was \\"conditional upon development of offshore wind projects in the area, securing government support and the availability of sites for prototypes\\". These have turned out to be significant conditions. The following December, it was French firm Areva announcing plans to locate a manufacturing plant in Scotland, for nacelle gear casing and for turbine blades. That would have brought 750 jobs. But then, Gamesa and Areva joined forces on developing wind turbine technology, creating a company called Adwen. They were no longer likely to build two plants in Scotland. And so far, they haven't built one. This is what they said when they joined forces: \\"The company will fulfil industrial commitments engaged by Areva and Gamesa, in France and in the UK, comprising the creation of factories in Le Havre and the implementation of a network of suppliers and partners throughout the country.\\" And now that Gamesa and Siemens are getting together, they are looking for €230m of savings from overlapping operations. So far, the hopes for manufacturing turbines have come to very little. There are a modest number of higher-skill jobs in designing and in managing the portfolio of wind turbines. Scottish Power, part of Iberdrola, manages its worldwide offshore wind arrays from Glasgow. Gamesa opened a centre for wind turbine design at Bellshill in Lanarkshire, and a management centre in Cumbernauld. The new joint venture may wish to take a look at their overlap with Siemens. Siemens has a small service centre in Livingston, to look after its turbines throughout Scotland. And as it claims that its technology generates around half the wind power in Scotland, that means a lot of turbines. So far, the hopes of manufacturing have come to not much at all. Some jobs have been sustained in Fife and Stornoway, building the platforms on which offshore turbines stand. A significant order has just been confirmed for BiFab, owner of the yards, to supply the huge Beatrice wind farm development in the Moray Firth. Then there's Liberty Capital, new owners of Lanarkshire's mothballed steel plants. Once fired up again, it is targeting its output at fabrication work for all those offshore wind turbines. That would clearly be welcome, if it happens. But with recent experience triumphing over hype and hope, it might be wise to remain at least a little sceptical.

The article also mentions how the UK government took away funding for a project that would have made Britain a pioneer in a new technology called Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). While some jobs have been created in renewable energy in Scotland, it's not as many as people hoped for, and the growth of the renewable energy sector has been slower than expected."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings is a 1969 autobiography describing the early years of American writer and poet Maya Angelou. The first in a seven-volume series, it is a coming-of-age story that illustrates how strength of character and a love of literature can help overcome racism and trauma. The book begins when three-year-old Maya and her older brother are sent to Stamps, Arkansas, to live with their grandmother and ends when Maya becomes a mother at the age of 16.

Aaron took his dirty laundry out of the hamper and moved it to a basket to transport it, because the","completion":"hamper was beginning to overflow. It was a bit of a chore that Aaron usually tried to avoid, but he knew that he couldn't put off his laundry any longer – his clothes were piling up, and he was starting to run out of clean clothes to wear. As Aaron lifted the laundry basket, he noticed that it felt unusually heavy today. He peered inside, wondering if he had crammed more clothes than usual into the basket or if it was just his imagination. To his surprise, he found an old tattered book hidden beneath his dirty clothes. It was a thick, ancient-looking tome with crumpled, yellowing pages, and a leather-bound cover that bore no title or words. Curiosity piqued, Aaron set the laundry basket aside to take a closer look at the mysterious book. He carefully opened the worn cover, revealing rows of neatly handwritten text that filled the brittle pages. It appeared to be written in an old script that he didn't recognize, but the symbols looked somewhat familiar. As he continued to flip through the pages, Aaron found exquisite illustrations of mythical creatures, alongside diagrams of celestial bodies and complex alchemical formulas. Intrigued by the book's contents, Aaron knew he couldn't let this discovery go to waste. He decided to take the book to his friend Maya, who was a history and linguistics major. Her knowledge of ancient languages and cultures could potentially lead them to figure out where the book originated and what information it contained. Upon showing the book to Maya, her eyes lit up in fascination. She could barely contain her excitement as she carefully studied the text. She told Aaron that the symbols seemed to be a mix of ancient Sumerian and a long-forgotten language. Over the next few weeks, they tried to decipher the book's cryptic contents. With each passing day, they slowly uncovered more about this lost piece of history. They finally managed to piece together that the book was a compendium of knowledge from an ancient civilization, passed down from its scholars and alchemists. It was a repository of stories and wisdom about mythical creatures, celestial bodies, and the secrets of transmutation. Yet, it also harbored a dark secret. As Maya and Aaron delved deeper into the core of the text, they started to notice references to a powerful artifact that could control time and space. The book had clues embedded within its pages, which would lead them on a journey to recover an ancient relic that held unimaginable power. Realizing the potential implications of their discovery, Aaron and Maya knew that such power could be dangerous in the wrong hands. With that, they decided to form a secret society, dedicating their lives to protect the knowledge contained within the book and prevent the artifact from falling into the possession of those who sought to misuse it. Over time, their society grew – recruiting talented individuals from all walks of life who shared the same values and aspirations. Together, they continued to study the book, decipher its secrets, and embark on quests in search of more clues. They've encountered countless unexplained phenomena along their journey, battled powerful enemies, and forged alliances with once-mythical creatures. While Aaron's original intention had been to conquer a mundane chore, destiny had other plans. From the moment he set his eyes on the mysterious book, his life took an unexpected turn – one filled with extraordinary adventure, camaraderie, danger, and the pursuit of knowledge. The once ordinary Aaron was now a part of something more significant than he had ever imagined, all thanks to a curious finding among his dirty laundry. And so, the legend of the secret society, the guardians of the ancient book and its knowledge, continued to grow – etching its place within the annals of history, slowly unfolding itself with the turn of every page."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Her father was a German immigrant who came to the United States in 1952 and taught his native language. Her mother, of German and Italian descent, is the daughter of artists. Krauss grew up in the college town of Champaign, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Krauss made her recording debut in 1985 on the independent album, Different Strokes, featuring her brother Viktor Krauss, Swamp Weiss and Jim Hoiles. From the age of 12 she performed with bassist and songwriter John Pennell in a band called \\"Silver Rail\\", replacing their previous fiddler Andrea Zonn. Pennell later changed the band's name to Union Station after another band was discovered with the name Silver Rail. Pennell remains one of her favorite songwriters and wrote some of her early work including the popular \\"Every Time You Say Goodbye\\". Later that year, she signed to Rounder Records, and in 1987, at 16, she released her debut album Too Late to Cry with Union Station as her backup band. Krauss' debut solo album was quickly followed by her first group album with Union Station in 1989, Two Highways. The album includes the traditional tunes \\"Wild Bill Jones\\" and \\"Beaumont Rag\\", along with a bluegrass interpretation of The Allman Brothers' \\"Midnight Rider\\". Krauss' contract with Rounder required her to alternate between releasing a solo album and an album with Union Station, and she released the solo album I've Got That Old Feeling in 1990.

News article: Since publishing a letter to the editor in the Daily Princetonian Friday, some people have asked me to clarify whether I intended it to be read as satire. My letter was serious. I sincerely feel that too much focus has been placed on encouraging young women only to achieve professionally. I understand that this can be seen as retrogressive, but for those women who aspire to what used to be thought of as a traditional life with home and family, there is almost no ink addressing personal fulfillment outside of the workplace. Specifically, finding lifelong friends and the right partner with whom to share a life and raise a family. Again, I understand that all women don't want marriage (to men or other women) and or children, but for those that do, identifying the right partner is critical. One of the criteria by which I am defining the right partner is someone with shared educational and intellectual appreciation. Yes, that can be found after college and outside of Princeton, but the concentration of outstanding men (and women) will never be greater than it is as a student. I wanted to encourage the wonderful young women on Princeton's campus to take advantage of this while they can. From a sheer numbers perspective, the odds will never be as good again. The popularity of Nikki Mueller's video (I Went to Princeton, Bitch) comically attests to the difficulty Princeton women face from men who are threatened by their academic credentials. It doesn't address how unsatisfying it is for exceptionally well educated women to be with men who are not their intellectual equal. I am divorced. I did not marry a Princeton man. I wish I had. The extreme reaction to my letter is astonishing. Honestly, it was intended as little more than honest advice from a Jewish mother. And, yes, this is exactly the advice I would give my daughters. RELATED ON HUFFPOST WOMEN: 7 Questions For The Alumna Telling Princeton Women To 'Find A Husband' ||||| Is this the world's most embarrassing mother? Woman who wrote to Princeton student newspaper urging female students to snag man...just like her son Meddling mother: Susan Patton penned a letter to the editor of the Daily Princetonian, dolling out relationship advice to female students attending her alma mater Susan A. Patton, a proud Princeton University alumna and the living affirmation of the meddling Jewish mother stereotype, raised some eyebrows this week after urging young women attending her vaunted alma mater to be quick about snagging a Princeton man - a man like her own son. Patton, who was among the 200 'pioneer' women enrolled in the Ivy League school in 1973, penned a letter to the editor of the Daily Princetonian Friday addressed to the 'daughters I never had.' In the open letter dolling out free relationship advice, the proud Princeton alumna whose younger son, Daniel, is currently attending the New Jersey institution, bluntly stated that one of the main goals for female students attending her school should be finding a husband that will be up to their high standards. 'For most of you, the cornerstone of your future and happiness will be inextricably linked to the man you marry, and you will never again have this concentration of men who are worthy of you,' Patton writes. 'Here’s what nobody is telling you: Find a husband on campus before you graduate. Yes, I went there.' The mother of two who runs a human resources consultation business on the Upper East Side in New York City, went on to say that her older son, who also went to Princeton, 'had the good judgement and great fortune to marry a classmate of his, but he could have married anyone.' Of her younger son, who is currently a junior at Princeton, Patton wrote that the 'universe of women he can marry is limitless.' According to Patton, unlike men, who often opt to cast their lot with dumb women so long as they are attractive, intelligent women cannot afford to settle for a husband who is not their intellectual equal. 'As Princeton women, we have almost priced ourselves out of the market. Simply put, there is a very limited population of men who are as smart or smarter than we are,' the Tiger Mother asserts. Scroll down to read the full letter Elite institution: Patton, who was the president of Princeton's 1977 class, urged freshman girls to take advantage of the high concentration of intelligent men around them and snag a husband early on And according to Mrs Patton, not only do Princeton girls have to pair off with Princeton men to have a successful, fulfilling marriage, but they also must waste no time and snag them before their 19th birthday. 'As freshman women, you have four classes of men to choose from. Every year, you lose the men in the senior class, and you become older than the class of incoming freshman men. 'So, by the time you are a senior, you basically have only the men in your own class to choose from, and frankly, they now have four classes of women to choose from. Maybe you should have been a little nicer to these guys when you were freshmen?' The unprompted advice to the 'daughters' Patton never had sparked a firestorm online, with feminist bloggers attacking her seemingly backwards, archaic stance on marriage as a focal point in a woman's life. Some critics also took issue with the fact that in Patton's world view, there is apparently no room for same-sex relationships as she keeps hammering home the point that women must be paired off with men, specifically, Princeton men. In a reaction piece that appeared on the influential feminist blog Jezebel , writer Katie J.M. Baker put it in more blatant terms. 'Patton could've saved herself a lot of time and energy by simply writing 'F*** my youngest son while you have the chance!\\"' The letter sparked a flurry of articles brimming with sarcasm and indignation. 'It's worth noting that this embarrassing window into how Ivy Leaguers talk to each other should be as cringe-inducing to modern audiences as Patton's take on gender relations is,' wrote Maureen O'Conner for New York magazine’s The Cut. Marriage material: Patton revealed that unlike her, who had married a man from a college with no name recognition, her older son, a Princetonean, had the good judgement to marry a classmate 'Some of the dumbest and most intellectually incurious people I've known were in my class at Princeton. And some of the smartest I've known went to state schools, or community colleges, or didn't go to college.' As it turns out, the president of Princeton's 1977 class had failed to follow her own advice – and paid the price for it. In an interview with New York magazine , Patton said that she had recently finalized her divorce after 27 years of marriage to a man who did not attend her beloved alma mater. 'He went to a school of almost no name recognition,' she said, 'a school that nobody has respect for, including him, really.' Looking back, Patton said she regrets not practicing what she now preaches. 'Yes! Yes. Yes, I wish I married someone who went to Princeton,' she said. 'That way I could have embraced Princeton for the thirty years that I stayed away from it because my ex-husband had no respect for the hoopla, the traditions, the allegiance, the orange and black...' Patton also marveled at the extreme backlash set off by her letter. 'Honestly, I just thought this was some good advice from a Jewish mother,' she said. The proud alumna also rushed to set the record straight, saying that although the tone of her missive may suggest otherwise, she is not anti-feminist, and she understand that not all women want to get married or are interested in men. 'I'm just saying, if as a young [Princeton] woman, you are thinking that you would like to have not just professional success but personal success as part of your life happiness, keep an open mind to the men that you're surrounded with now,' Patton said. ||||| Story highlights Donna Brazile: If only Susan Patton had offered her man-catching advice earlier Then, says Brazile, she might have chosen to live through a man instead of her own goals She says Patton successfully satirized the Princeton stereotype with her retro advice Brazile: Maybe Patton thinks Princeton women should be taught how to be pretty? Susan Patton kicked up a firestorm with her letter last week to the editor of The Daily Princetonian urging female students to find a man to marry before they graduate because \\"the cornerstone of your future and happiness will be inextricably linked to the man you marry, and you will never again have this concentration of men who are worthy of you.\\" If only the Princeton alum's advice had come out 30 years earlier when I was in college, perhaps I could have avoided the costly mistake of focusing on what makes me come alive and then pursuing it for a living. Perhaps if I'd focused instead on nailing down a man by the time I was 22, I could be going to cocktail parties and co-opting my husband and children's successes, bragging about them as if they were my own, rather than being forced to talk about the current state of politics or what we can do as a society to engage the next generation in the struggles of today. Perhaps, if I'd had Ms. Patton's wisdom and foresight about what really matters in college, I wouldn't have taken so many pesky classes, and instead concentrated on designing my hair, makeup, attire and personality to create the perfect man-catching machine. Perhaps it would have all worked out exactly as Ms. Patton implies -- the perfect house, kids, husband and future. And yet I'm skeptical. I made a lot of stupid decisions in college; I'm really glad the choice of life partner wasn't one of them. How many people, do you think, could choose a tattoo at 22 years old and still be happy with it by the time they are 50? Let's be generous here: maybe a quarter of all people? And tattoos don't even talk. Donna Brazile Choosing a life partner requires a maturity and self-awareness that I can't imagine more than a small fraction of college students have. I know I didn't. Not only that, but people change. Who you are at 22 is not who you will be at 35, and in my experience, the decade following college is the interval where the rate of change is the greatest. So while it may be tempting to imagine the white picket fence and 2.5 children I could have had with my hastily chosen college boyfriend, I can't help but think a divorce at 28 or 32 would have been more likely, had I chosen that route. What then, Ms. Patton? I find it refreshing that as the same-sex marriage debate swirls through society, Ms. Patton remains untouched in her heteronormativity. Does it even occur to her to question the premise that \\"the cornerstone\\" of a woman's future is finding a husband? No! Of course not! It simply must be. I haven't heard regressive rhetoric like this since I mistakenly tuned in Dr. Laura on the radio. I have to ask, what are lesbians supposed to do? Must they also find mates while in college, or are lesbians the only privileged group of women allowed to search for self-fulfillment before partnership? That said, Ms. Patton really must be commended for what has to be her grasp of satire. She knows the stereotype of Princeton is that it's filled with self-satisfied, conceited, bloviating jerks, and she captures that tone perfectly to make her point. Without such bold elitism -- an op-ed that took the perfectly defensible position that college is a target-rich environment free from the awkwardness of bars, set-ups or online dating -- there would have been no stir. Certainly it wouldn't have crashed the servers, and the women of Princeton might have spent another day thinking the future is filled with untold adventure and opportunity, rather than simply another day closer to their expiration date as a desirable partner.

There aren't a lot of well-educated women who would be courageous enough to completely sell out the feminist movement responsible for securing women's equal social, political and economic rights (to the degree that we have them) in favor of the 1950s' mentality that a woman's worth is determined by her marital status. Also, to come out with it while her youngest son remains unmarried? Brave. Though the \\"universe of women he can marry is limitless,\\" the universe of women who would be willing to be her daughter-in-law is finite.

The whereabouts of McDaniel's Oscar are currently unknown. In 1992, Jet magazine reported that Howard University could not find it and alleged that it had disappeared during protests in the 1960s. In 1998, Howard University stated that it could find no written record of the Oscar having arrived at Howard. In 2007, an article in the Huffington Post repeated rumors that the Oscar had been cast into the Potomac River by angry civil rights protesters in the 1960s. The assertion reappeared in the Huffington Post under the same byline in 2009. In 2010, Mo'Nique, the winner of the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, wearing a blue dress and gardenias in her hair, as McDaniel had at the ceremony in 1940, in her acceptance speech thanked McDaniel \\"for enduring all that she had to so that I would not have to\\". Her speech revived interest in the whereabouts of McDaniel's plaque. In 2011, J. Freedom duLac reported in the Washington Post that the plaque had disappeared in the 1960s. In November 2011, W. B. Carter, of the George Washington University Law School, published the results of her year-and-a-half-long investigation into the Oscar's fate. Carter rejected claims that students had stolen the Oscar (and thrown it in the Potomac River) as wild speculation or fabrication that traded on long-perpetuated stereotypes of blacks. She questioned the sourcing of the Huffington Post stories. Instead, she argued that the Oscar was likely returned to Howard University's Channing Pollack Theater Collection between the spring of 1971 and the summer of 1973 or had possibly been boxed and stored in the drama department at that time. The reason for its removal, she argued, was not civil rights unrest but rather efforts to make room for a new generation of black performers. If neither the Oscar nor any paper trail of its ultimate destiny can be found at Howard today, she suggested, inadequate storage or record-keeping in a time of financial constraints and national turbulence may be blamed. She also suggested that a new generation of caretakers may have failed to realize the historic significance of the 5 1/2\\" x 6\\" plaque.

To do this, we will first subtract 22 from both sides. 11 * r = -22 Step 4: Solve for r Now, we have an equation that looks like this: 11 * r = -22. To solve for r, we will divide both sides by 11. r = -22 / 11 Step 5: Get the final value of r Finally, we will compute the division to get the value of r. r = -2 The solution of the equation -35*r + 46*r + 22 = 0 is r = -2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Which ancient Roman festival, which ran until the 4th century AD involved sacrifices, partying and owners serving their slaves and was partly subsumed into Christmas? Answer:","completion":"The ancient Roman festival that you are referring to is called Saturnalia, which ran until the 4th century AD and involved sacrifices, partying, owners serving their slaves, and was partly subsumed into Christmas. This festival was celebrated in honor of the Roman deity Saturn, who was the god of agriculture, wealth, renewal, and liberation. The main purpose of the event was to commemorate the end of the agricultural year and to symbolize the renewal of life. Saturnalia was a time of merriment and joy, with Roman citizens indulging in feasting, gift-giving, and various forms of entertainment. The festival typically commenced on December 17th, and the celebration would last for a week, until December 23rd. Originally, Saturnalia was observed for only a day or two, but as its popularity grew throughout the Roman Empire, the duration was increased accordingly. The celebrations featured a number of unique customs and rituals specific to the event. One of the key aspects of the festivities involved the social reversal of roles, where slaves were given a temporary reprieve from their usual duties and were allowed to participate in the revelries. During the festival, slaves were treated as equals – they were permitted to wear the same clothes as their masters, and in some cases, the roles were reversed, with the masters serving meals to their slaves. This exchange of roles symbolized the god Saturn's overturning of the social order, promoting equality and a sense of camaraderie among all members of society. Another important feature of Saturnalia was the ritual of gift-giving, which took the form of small tokens called sigillaria, often made from terracotta, wax, or clay. These miniature, often humorous, figurines represented a variety of characters, professions, or themes, and were exchanged among family members and friends. Other popular gifts during this time included candles, which symbolized the solstice's return of light, and edible treats like honey, fruits, and nuts. The celebrations also involved an abundance of food and drink. Feasting was an essential part of Saturnalia since it was a time of indulgence and merriment. Public banquets were held, and large quantities of wine were consumed to add to the festive atmosphere. In addition to the feasting, various forms of entertainment were organized, such as music, poetry recitals, and theatrical performances. As the Roman Empire converted to Christianity around the 4th century AD, many of the traditions and customs of Saturnalia were subsumed into the Christian celebration of Christmas. The idea of exchanging gifts, indulging in grand feasts, and celebrating with merriment during the festive season can all be traced back to the original Saturnalia festival. Additionally, the choosing of December 25th as the date to celebrate the birth of Jesus has been suggested to be influenced by the proximity of Saturnalia, thereby assimilating the revered aspects and traditions of the pagan celebration into the Christian observance of Christmas. In conclusion, Saturnalia was an ancient Roman festival that provided an opportunity for social role reversals, indulgence in food and wine, public entertainment, and the exchange of gifts. The celebration of Christmas adopted many of these customs, with the two events becoming partially entwined in history. As such, the jollity and communal aspects of modern Christmas festivities are, in part, a legacy of the ancient Roman festival of Saturnalia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Underworld: Rise of the Lycans Movie plot: The film begins with a voice-over monologue by vampire Selene, telling the story of the lycans and vampires. It has been 20 years since the war between them has begun (set several years before the first Underworld movie). Viktor (Bill Nighy) has built up an army of vampires to fight off the threat and have begun the process of exterminating the lycans. It appears that when someone is infected by a lycan, they transform into werewolves, but do not change back and appear to behave like vicious animals rather than people. However, one day, in a prison cell, Viktor hears the cries of a human child, and investigates. What he discovers is a human child born of a lycan later named Lucian. Viktor contemplates killing the child, but could not bring himself to do it.Lucian grows up, and appears to be stronger and more focused than others of his kind; this is evident when Viktor tests him by making him fight vampires. Viktor decides to make more of Lucians kind (the new lycans that have human form). Viktor uses Lucian to make more like him by starving him and letting him feed on human slaves. The ones that survived became the new lycans, a new slave race to serve the vampires. The vampires think they have control of the lycans, but this may not be the case for long.Note: there are two types of were-wolves in this film, ones that are permanently in wolf form and wild, and ones that can transform when its a full moon and are in service to the vampires. I will refer to the former as wolves, and the latter as lycans.Cut to the present, a horseman is riding through the woods at night, pursued by something.

Article:","completion":"Title: Bristol Academy Suffers Crushing Defeat to Frankfurt in Women's Champions League Semi-Final Clash Bristol Academy's dreams of reaching the Women's Champions League semi-finals were shattered as they suffered a resounding 12-0 defeat on aggregate to German powerhouse, Frankfurt. The loss marks a disappointing end to a promising campaign for Bristol Academy, as the relentless Frankfurt side demonstrated their superior skill throughout the two-legged encounter. In the first leg of the competition held at Ashton Gate, Bristol was overwhelmed by the German side's prowess as they conceded an agonizing five goals. Bristol Academy was unable to respond to the goals scored by Frankfurt's exceptional offense, led by their talented striker Célia Šašić, who netted three goals in the first leg. The home fans left the stadium devastated, as they knew their team's chances of progressing to the semi-finals had become remote. The second leg of the tie took place at Frankfurt's Commerzbank-Arena, where thousands of passionate Frankfurt fans showed their support for the Frauen-Bundesliga champions. Bristol Academy, determined to give their best and restore some pride, knew that a remarkable fightback would be required to overturn the five-goal deficit of the first leg. As the match began, Bristol attempted to take the game to their opponents, showing good organization and determination in the initial stages. However, Frankfurt's superior experience and quality soon emerged as they overpowered the English side. Mandy Islacker opened the scoring for Frankfurt, swiftly followed by Marith Prießen, Saskia Bartusiak, and the in-form Šašić adding to their tally. Bristol was unable to match the intensity, skill and tactical discipline of the reigning European champions who continued their ruthless strategy and extended their lead with goals from Simone Laudehr, Lise Munk, and Australian international Emily van Egmond. The game ended with a staggering 7-0 victory for Frankfurt in the second leg, taking the aggregate score to 12-0. Despite this overwhelming loss, Bristol Academy has much to be proud of in their Women's Champions League campaign. As the only English club to reach the quarter-final stage in the current season, they fought bravely against some of the top teams in Europe, including Barcelona and Austrian outfit St. Pölten. Manager Tanya Oxtoby and her players have undoubtedly gained valuable international experience, and they will strive to use this as a springboard to greater success in the future. For Frankfurt, this resounding victory sees them advance to the semi-finals of the Women's Champions League, where they will face French giants Lyon or Danish side Brøndby IF. The German side will be confident of their chances, as they aim to add another European trophy to their ever-growing collection. With an array of talent within their ranks and momentum on their side, Frankfurt remains a formidable force in the competition and a genuine contender to lift the prestigious trophy in May. In conclusion, Bristol Academy's journey in the Women's Champions League was brought to an abrupt end by a dominant Frankfurt side. Nevertheless, there are positives to be taken from their campaign, and the experience will surely prove invaluable as they look to build and improve in the coming seasons. Meanwhile, Frankfurt marches on to the semi-finals, fully focused on their quest to secure the European crown once more."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Translate to English English:","completion":"I believe Mr. Papandreou has a good idea with his intention to publish the income statements of high-income individuals in Greece. Mr. George Papandreou, a prominent Greek political figure and former Prime Minister, appears to have proposed the idea of making income statements of wealthy individuals in Greece more transparent and accessible to the public. This initiative, if implemented, would serve several purposes and could bring about positive changes in the Greek society, economy, and political landscape. Firstly, publishing the income statements of high-income individuals in Greece would encourage more transparency in the country's economic and financial affairs. The public would have better access to information on the wealth distribution within the country, helping to create an environment of greater trust between citizens and the government. Ultimately, this increased transparency could lead to a more fair and just society. Secondly, this initiative could address the issue of tax evasion and corruption in Greece, which has been a significant problem in recent years. By publicly revealing the income statements of wealthy individuals, the government would be signaling that they are taking the issue of tax evasion seriously and are committed to holding citizens accountable for paying their fair share of taxes. Thirdly, publicly disclosing high-income earners' financial information could foster a more informed public debate about fiscal and economic policies. A better understanding of the country's wealth distribution could help to shape policies that better address income inequality, social welfare, and economic growth. This knowledge could also lead to discussions on implementing progressive tax systems, providing social security nets, and ensuring a more equitable distribution of resources. Additionally, this measure could serve as an example for other countries experiencing similar issues with income inequality and tax evasion. By adopting such an initiative, Greece could inspire change in other nations and demonstrate the importance of transparency and accountability in addressing complex economic challenges. Finally, it is important to consider potential drawbacks and concerns with this proposal. One possible concern is the risk to personal privacy and potential misuse of the disclosed financial information. Proper privacy protections would need to be put in place to ensure that sensitive information is handled and used responsibly. Moreover, any initiative should be carefully implemented to avoid creating animosity or resentment among wealthy individuals, which could ultimately deter investment and hinder economic growth. In conclusion, Mr. Papandreou's idea of publishing the income statements of high-income individuals in Greece has several potentially beneficial consequences, such as fostering greater transparency, enabling informed public debates, and encouraging tax compliance. However, it is crucial to address any potential drawbacks or concerns and ensure that proper safeguards are in place to protect privacy and prevent the misuse of information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is Life, all right, but we do treat it like a rehearsal and, unhappily, we do miss so many of its best moments. We take jobs to stay alive and provide homes for our families, always making ourselves believe that this style of life is only a temporary state of affairs along the road to what we really want to do. Then, at 60 or 65, we are suddenly given a clock and several grandchildren and we look back and realize that all those years waiting for Real Life to come along were in fact real life. In America they have a saying much laughedat by the English: \\"Have a nice day.\\" They speak slowly and seriously in their shops, hotels and sandwich bars. I think it is a wonderful phrase, making us remember, in effect, to enjoy the moment: to value this very day. How often do we say to ourselves \\"I'll take up horse-riding(or golf, or sailing)as soon as I get a greater job.\\" But only to do none of those things when we do get the higher position. When I first became a reporter I knew a man who gave up a very well-paid respectable job at Daily Telegraph to go and work for a small weekly newspaper.

I wanted to know. Now when I am a little older and possibly wiser, I see the sense in it. In Fleet Street the man was under continuous pressure. He lived in all unattractive London suburb and he spent much of his life sitting on Southern Region trains to and back from his work.

Select from: I. yes. II. no.","completion":"I. Yes. You are correct. The Anchorage Opera is currently the state's only professional opera company in Alaska. Established in 1962, this organization has been bringing opera to the state for nearly 60 years. Anchorage Opera presents a variety of performances, including fully staged productions, concerts, cabarets, and educational programs. Their programming aims to showcase both the classic repertoire as well as contemporary works. In addition to the Anchorage Opera, Alaska is also home to several volunteer and semi-professional opera organizations that contribute to the overall promotion and appreciation of this art form in the state. These groups offer opportunities for local singers, musicians, and production personnel to perform and learn about opera. One example of such an organization is the Fairbanks Light Opera Theatre (FLOT), which has been presenting a wide range of productions, including operas, musicals, and operettas, for over 30 years. Although FLOT is not a professional opera company like the Anchorage Opera, it plays a significant role in enriching the cultural life in Alaska.

ROME Police on Friday recovered the piece of cloth stained with the blood of the late Pope John Paul, a day after they found the stolen gold and glass case which once contained the relic. They told a news conference in L'Aquila, east of Rome, that they found the fragment in the garage of two men who were detained for having stolen the reliquary last week. Bishop Giovanni D'Ercole told the same news conference he had pieced together the reliquary and the cloth after police found them in bits on successive days. The recovered piece of fabric was missing just a few filaments of cloth and gold thread, he said. \\"I think John Paul has forgiven them. I think we have to do the same,\\" D'Ercole said of the men, believed by police to be drug addicts. The reliquary and a crucifix were stolen from the isolated mountain church of San Pietro della Ienca last weekend. The cloth was a fragment of the cassock that John Paul was wearing on May 13, 1981 when he was shot in an assassination attempt. Relics of saints and other holy figures are often displayed in reliquaries to be venerated by the Catholic faithful. The late pope, who is due to be declared a saint on April 27, loved the mountains in the Abruzzo region because they reminded him of those in his native Poland. He would slip away secretly from the pressures of the Vatican to hike and ski there in the early years of his papacy. His secretary, now Cardinal Stanislaw Dziwisz of Krakow in Poland, gave the local community the relic. (Reporting By Philip Pullella; Editing by Tom Heneghan) ||||| Edward K.

The cloth was found in the garage of one of three teens who took it from the church in the Abruzzo region, ANSA reported. Police are still looking for a few missing gold threads. \\"These three boys have our forgiveness and that of Pope [Francis],\\" said Bishop Giovanni D'Ercole of L'Aquila, who put the cloth back together. The three teens, who are known drug addicts, were released after telling police where to find the cloth. They could still face charges, police said. The cloth, which was taken from the Church Saturday night, is one of three blood relics that John Paul II donated.

When we look at unemployment, the minister is boasting of fantastic surpluses in the unemployment insurance fund, which he is putting toward reduction of the deficit, when we look at the restrictions which have helped accumulate the unemployment insurance fund surplus, the restrictions to the new employment insurance program, we see that this is no joke. Can we draw the following conclusion? The restrictions to the new employment insurance program are no joke.","completion":"Indeed, the restrictions to the new employment insurance program are no joke and have consequences that can make a substantial impact on various aspects of society and the economy. When evaluating the effects of the restrictions, several factors can be taken into consideration: 1. Accumulation of surplus in the unemployment insurance fund: The minister boasts of a substantial surplus in the unemployment insurance fund. This suggests that the government has been effective in managing the fund, resulting in a surplus that can be utilized for other purposes such as reducing the deficit. A surplus accumulation can be seen as a positive outcome, but it can also result from restrictions imposed on accessing the program. 2. Restrictions and eligibility: The restrictions introduced in the new employment insurance program may limit the number of people eligible for benefits. Stricter criteria for eligibility can result in a decrease in spending on unemployment insurance, contributing to the surplus. However, these restrictions can have negative consequences, leaving many unemployed individuals without the necessary financial support during their job search or periods of unemployment. 3. Impact on the uninsured unemployed individuals: Those who are not eligible for the new employment insurance program due to the restrictions can face financial struggles – a situation that is far from a joke. Many uninsured individuals might experience financial hardships due to their inability to secure unemployment benefits, which might result in a dependency on other social assistance programs or, in severe cases, poverty, homelessness, and an increased reliance on non-governmental organizations. 4. Economic consequences: A surplus in the unemployment insurance fund can help in reducing the deficit, but if the surplus is generated at the cost of insufficiently supporting the unemployed, then this can have broader economic consequences. For instance, reduced consumer spending due to inadequate financial support can lead to lower demand and slower economic growth. Additionally, without proper unemployment insurance support, those who are unemployed may be more likely to accept any job regardless of the match between their skills and job requirements, leading to underemployment, inefficiencies and even impacting future productivity. 5. Social consequences: Unemployment can lead to social issues such as increased crime rates, substance abuse, and mental health problems. Adequate unemployment insurance programs can provide a safety net for those who are out of work, allowing them to maintain some semblance of stability during an otherwise tumultuous period. Inadequate support due to restrictions in the program, therefore, might exacerbate these social issues. In conclusion, while the surplus in the unemployment insurance fund may appear to be a positive outcome, it is essential to analyze the consequences of the restrictions to the new employment insurance program. The fact that such restrictions can result in significant economic, social, and personal challenges for those affected is a clear indication that they are by no means a joke. Policymakers and government officials must balance the benefits of a surplus against the potential negative impacts on individuals and the broader economy when considering implementing and adjusting restrictions on any unemployment insurance program."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: After the lengthy Iraq disarmament crisis culminated with an American demand that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein leave Iraq, which was refused, a coalition led by the United States and the United Kingdom fought the Iraqi army in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Approximately 250,000 United States troops, with support from 45,000 British, 2,000 Australian and 200 Polish combat forces, entered Iraq primarily through their staging area in Kuwait. (Turkey had refused to permit its territory to be used for an invasion from the north.) Coalition forces also supported Iraqi Kurdish militia, estimated to number upwards of 50,000.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Alkenes can react with halogens to form dihalides. Q: Alkenes react with what to form dihalides? Choices: - antioxidants - amines - oxides - halogens A: A:","completion":"Alkenes react with halogens to form dihalides. In the given paragraph, it is mentioned that alkenes can react with halogens to form dihalides. The context provides an explicit answer to the question. Among the given choices, the correct one is halogens, as this substance is responsible for the formation of dihalides when reacting with alkenes. To delve deeper into this reaction, alkenes (also known as olefins) are hydrocarbons that contain a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). These organic compounds are unsaturated, indicating that they possess one or more double or triple bonds between carbon atoms. They are abundant in natural sources, such as plants and fossil fuels, and play a crucial role in the synthesis of various chemicals and materials. Halogens, on the other hand, are non-metal elements belonging to Group 17 (VIIA) of the periodic table. They include fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and astatine (At). Halogens are highly reactive due to their capability to achieve a stable electron configuration by gaining one electron, filling their outermost electron shell. This reactivity allows them to readily form compounds with other elements, such as alkenes. When halogens react with alkenes, they undergo a chemical reaction known as halogenation. In this reaction, a molecule of the halogen (typically Cl2 or Br2) is added across the double bond in the alkene. The halogenation process follows an electrophilic addition mechanism in which the electrophile, in this case, the halogen, reacts with the nucleophile, the alkene. As a result, the double bond is broken, and each carbon atom involved in the double bond gets bonded to one halogen atom. Consequently, a dihalide product is formed with two halogen atoms covalently bonded to the former alkene molecule. To summarize, the correct answer is that alkenes react with halogens to form dihalides. This reaction, called halogenation, is an electrophilic addition mechanism that involves the addition of halogen molecules across the carbon-carbon double bond in the alkene, resulting in the formation of a dihalide compound."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What are the three names of the Daoist fouder? , can you please find it? The Li family belonged to the northwest military aristocracy prevalent during the Sui dynasty and claimed to be paternally descended from the Daoist founder, Laozi (whose personal name was Li Dan or Li Er) the Han dynasty General Li Guang and Western Liang ruler Li Gao. This family was known as the Longxi Li lineage (Li lineage; 隴西李氏), which includes the Tang poet Li Bai. The Tang Emperors also had Xianbei maternal ancestry, from Emperor Gaozu of Tang's Xianbei mother, Duchess Dugu. Li Yuan was Duke of Tang and governor of Taiyuan, modern Shanxi, during the Sui dynasty's collapse, which was caused in part by the Sui failure to conquer the northern part of the Korean peninsula during the Goguryeo–Sui War. He had prestige and military experience, and was a first cousin of Emperor Yang of Sui (their mothers were sisters). Li Yuan rose in rebellion in 617, along with his son and his equally militant daughter Princess Pingyang (d. 623), who raised and commanded her own troops. In winter 617, Li Yuan occupied Chang'an, relegated Emperor Yang to the position of Taishang Huang or retired emperor, and acted as regent to the puppet child-emperor, Yang You. On the news of Emperor Yang's murder by General Yuwen Huaji on June 18, 618, Li Yuan declared himself the emperor of a new dynasty, the Tang.Li Yuan, known as Emperor Gaozu of Tang, ruled until 626, when he was forcefully deposed by his son Li Shimin, the Prince of Qin. Li Shimin had commanded troops since the age of 18, had prowess with bow and arrow, sword and lance and was known for his effective cavalry charges. Fighting a numerically superior army, he defeated Dou Jiande (573–621) at Luoyang in the Battle of Hulao on May 28, 621. In a violent elimination of royal family due to fear of assassination, Li Shimin ambushed and killed two of his brothers, Li Yuanji (b. 603) and Crown prince Li Jiancheng (b. 589), in the Xuanwu Gate Incident on July 2, 626.

One of the simplest ways to make a man feel loved is to directly tell him, “I love you.” A direct expression of love and affection may seem hollow when there are no actions to back it, but it is still an important sentiment to convey in words. It is the statement that focuses all your loving actions into one clear, obvious meaning. Mix things up. Saying \\"I love you\\" is important, but there are other sentiments you can use to express your love just as meaningfully. Try something like, \\"I'm grateful you're in my life,\\" \\"I am so in love with you,\\" or \\"You're incredibly important to me.\\" For better or worse, women receive compliments about their looks and the way their bodies move from men on a somewhat frequent basis. Men hear these sorts of things less often, but as visual creatures, they usually like to know that you have your eyes appreciatively on them as much as they have their eyes on you. For instance, if he plays a lot of sports and you usually go to cheer him on, tell him something like, “I love watching you as you play basketball” or “I love the way your body looks when you're playing.” If he is more of the artistic sort and is not physically active, you could compliment his body by telling him something like, “I love watching your hands as you play the piano.” Even simple compliments like “I love staring into your eyes” or “I could stare at your smile all day” can work wonders. Tell him that he turns you on. In strong romantic relationships, emotional love and physical love walk hand-in-hand. You need to express your love on an emotional level, but you also need to express it on a physical level. Telling him how much you love his body and love having it pressed against you is important. Of course, you can usually convey this sentiment with body language and behavior. As with emotional love, though, saying how you feel in straightforward words can be just as important. When the two of you are around other people, sing his praises. Talk about how great he is at his job, how passionate he is about his hobbies, or how great he is at making you feel loved. These are all great things to say to his face, but telling them to another person in front of him lets him know how proud you are to be at his side. Express your gratitude often and earnestly. “Thank you” should be part of your daily exchanges. Tell him how much you appreciate a kind gesture when he does something thoughtful. If there is something he has done for you habitually that you do not usually thank him for, go out of your way to tell him that you appreciate that gesture, even if you do not always say as much. Every couple fights. When you have an argument, be the first to apologize, even if you were not at fault. You do not need to be the first to apologize every time, but you should be the first to do so sometimes. An apology lets him know that he is more important to you than your own ego, and it also tells him that your relationship is something you want to fight together for. This does not mean that you should allow him to walk all over you. If you sense that he will never apologize to you without you apologizing first, or worse, see that he does not apologize to you even when you do offer the first “I'm sorry,” there might be an underlying problem in your relationship that you need to analyze and remedy. When life gets stressful, simply tell him, “I'm here for you.” He may still hesitate to show you his weak side, but telling him that you love him even when he feels weak can be incredibly reassuring. What you don't say can be just as important as what you do say. Serious problems in your relationship need to be addressed, but avoid nagging him, embarrassing, or making him feel ashamed for trivial reasons. A statement meant to shame is critical without being constructive. For instance, “You're so cold; do you even have any feelings at all?” would be a statement meant to shame. On the other hand, “I feel hurt when you walk away without telling me what's wrong,” is a statement that addresses the actual hurtful behavior and opens the problem up for discussion. Summary:","completion":"To make a man feel loved, express your feelings through both words and actions. Start by directly telling him that you love him, and mix in other meaningful sentiments. Compliment his appearance and let him know that he turns you on. Praise his qualities and achievements in front of others, demonstrating your pride in being with him. Show your gratitude regularly, and be willing to apologize during arguments, even if you are not at fault. Offer support during stressful times by reassuring him that you are there for him. Avoid nagging, shaming, or criticizing him for trivial reasons, and maintain open communication to address any serious problems in the relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

SEOUL — The recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria could increase pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, or reinforce in Pyongyang the need for nuclear deterrence. The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the... Question: Who or what will keep the nuclear program if it thinks that its regime is not guaranteed? Options: - North Korea - not enough information - President Trump - Syria === The correct answer is A:","completion":"North Korea The recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria could have varying effects on North Korea and its decisions concerning its nuclear weapons program. On the one hand, the strikes could increase pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, as they demonstrate the U.S.'s willingness to use force against those who violate international norms. On the other hand, these strikes may reinforce North Korea's belief in the necessity of its nuclear deterrence for regime security. The U.S., France, and Britain's joint military strike on Syria was in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in Douma. This military action took place while preparations are ongoing for an expected summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The summit's primary focus is the potential dismantling of North Korea's nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. As President Trump has demonstrated his willingness to use force in Syria, this may strengthen his \\"maximum pressure\\" campaign message to North Korea and encourage Kim Jong Un to make significant nuclear concessions during the Trump-Kim summit. However, it's essential to consider that the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the regime more vulnerable to outside aggression. This fear could make North Korea less willing to surrender its nuclear weapons, as it may believe that retaining its nuclear program is crucial for maintaining the regime's security and stability. In conclusion, while the U.S. military strikes on Syria could pressure North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, they might also strengthen the country's belief in the necessity of its nuclear deterrent for regime security. Therefore, North Korea is likely to keep its nuclear program if it thinks that the regime's security is not guaranteed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The inaugural games were held, on the orders of the Roman Emperor Titus, to celebrate the completion in AD 80 (81 according to some sources) of the Colosseum, then known as the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium). Vespasian began construction of the amphitheatre around AD 70 and it was completed by his son Titus who became emperor following Vespasian's death in AD 79. Titus' reign began with months of disasters – including the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, a fire in Rome, and an outbreak of plague – he inaugurated the completion of the structure with lavish games that lasted for more than one hundred days, perhaps in an attempt to appease the Roman public and the gods. Little literary evidence survives of the activities of the gladiatorial training and fighting (ludi). They appear to have followed the standard format of the Roman games: animal entertainments in the morning session, followed by the executions of criminals around midday, with the afternoon session reserved for gladiatorial combats and recreations of famous battles. The animal entertainments, which featured creatures from throughout the Roman Empire, included extravagant hunts and fights between different species. Animals also played a role in some executions which were staged as recreations of myths and historical events. Naval battles formed part of the spectacles but whether these took place in the amphitheatre or on a lake that had been specially constructed by Augustus is a topic of debate among historians. Only three contemporary or near-contemporary accounts of the games survive. The works of Suetonius and Cassius Dio focus on major events, while Martial provides some fragments of information on individual entertainments and the only detailed record of a gladiatorial combat in the arena known to survive: the fight between Verus and Priscus.

Question 1: How do you get cough syrup with codeine prescribed from a doctor? Question 2: Is it okay to take cough syrup to get high? Pick your answer from: --no --yes Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"In response to Question 1, it is important to understand that firstly, obtaining a prescription for codeine-containing cough syrup should be done for legitimate medical reasons. Codeine is an opioid used to treat mild to moderate pain and cough. It works by affecting the brain's perception of pain and also helps alleviate cough by reducing the activity in the brain that causes it. Cough syrup with codeine is typically prescribed when over-the-counter cough medications are ineffective, and the cough is severe enough to inhibit sleep or daily functioning. To get cough syrup with codeine prescribed by a doctor, you should: 1. Schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider: You should visit or consult a doctor, either in-person or through telemedicine, and explain your symptoms and concerns. 2. Describe your symptoms accurately: Be honest while providing detailed information about your symptoms, such as the duration of your cough, the intensity and frequency, and whether it is affecting your daily life or sleep. Mention any over-the-counter medications you have tried and their results. 3. Be open about your medical history: Disclose your medical history, including any allergies, chronic conditions, or previous use of prescription medications. This information will help your doctor decide if prescribing a codeine-containing cough syrup is safe for you. 4. Follow your doctor's advice: If your doctor prescribes cough syrup with codeine, follow the suggested dosage and instructions carefully. If your doctor does not prescribe it, respect their decision, and ask for alternative treatment options for your symptoms. As for Question 2, the answer is \\"no\\". It is not okay to take cough syrup to get high. Recreational use of cough syrup, especially those containing codeine or similar substances, is both dangerous and illegal. Taking cough syrup to get high can lead to addiction, serious health complications, and potentially fatal overdose. Additionally, abusing prescription medication is against the law and can result in severe legal consequences. Although both questions relate to cough syrup with codeine, they are not asking the same thing. Question 1 focuses on legitimately obtaining a prescription for the medication due to a severe cough, while Question 2 deals with the potential misuse of the substance for recreational purposes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As a result, they are expressing their strong negative feelings toward the situation and their former partner, with a sense of loss and emotional upheaval. The use of capital letters in the statement \\"SHE LEFT ME\\" suggests an emphasis on the intensity of the experience as well as the overwhelming nature of the situation.

In the phrase \\"I HATE HER,\\" the author uses strong and assertive language to communicate their resentment and anger. By using the word \\"hate,\\" they express the severity of their negative feelings towards their ex-partner, possibly caused by a multitude of reasons such as betrayal, lack of understanding, or the suddenness of the breakup. Though the tweet does not provide much context, it can be inferred that the individual may be struggling to process their feelings and channel their emotions in a healthy and constructive manner.

Here is a news article: SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — Groupon Inc. filed Thursday for a widely anticipated initial public offering in which the daily-deals service said it expects to raise as much as 750 million. Click to Play Andrew Mason’s IPO silence On eve of IPO filing, Groupon CEO turns Kara Swisher’s question on the offering’s timing into a lighthearted staring contest. Chicago-based Groupon said in a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it plans to list its shares under the symbol “GRPN.“ Groupon, which now has about 8,000 employees, up more than fivefold in the past year, has grown rapidly over a relatively short period of time, as its steep, daily discounts on everything from spa treatments to concert tickets have gained popularity. The company said in its filing that it saw 644.7 million in revenue in the quarter that ended in March, compared with 44.2 million in the comparable period of 2010. Meanwhile, the company swung to a net loss of 113.9 million compared with net income of 8.6 million in the year-earlier period, as it spent heavily to expand. “We intend to continue to pursue a strategy of significant investment,” according to the company’s SEC filing. On an annual basis, Groupon reported that revenue surged from 94,000 in 2008 to 713.4 million last year. The service’s total number of subscribers rose from 3.4 million in the first quarter of last year to more than 83 million in the same period this year. Groupon’s total cumulative customer base expanded to 15.8 million in the first quarter of this year from 874,017 in the comparable period last year, while the total number of coupons, or “Groupons,” sold rose to 28.1 million from about 1.8 million. Groupon is a prominent member of a batch of fast-growing Internet businesses now coming to the public markets with relatively mature financial track records. Read Therese Poletti’s Tech Tales for more on Groupon’s growth . Professional-networking service LinkedIn Corp. /quotes/zigman/5131883/quotes/nls/lnkd LNKD -5.69% went public last month with a popular IPO that saw the company’s stock rise from 45 to nearly 95 in its first day of trading. LinkedIn shares were trading at 78.63 on Thursday. Another highly anticipated IPO is that of Facebook Inc. The social-networking service, which has amassed more than 600 million users, is expected to go public next year. Groupon.com was the 64th most popular U.S. website for the week ended May 28, according to data from Experian Hitwise, while online searches for the term “Groupon” have increased roughly 462% over the past year. Underwriters for Groupon’s IPO include Morgan Stanley /quotes/zigman/182639/quotes/nls/ms MS +3.62% , Credit Suisse Group AG /quotes/zigman/172227/quotes/nls/cs CS +1.50% and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. /quotes/zigman/188479/quotes/nls/gs GS +3.23% In terms of size, the Groupon IPO ranks ahead of LinkedIn’s May offering, which raised about 217 million, and behind Google Inc.’s /quotes/zigman/93888/quotes/nls/goog GOOG +0.86% 2004 offering, which raised 1.2 billion. Google reportedly sought to buy Groupon last year for as much as 6 billion. During an appearance Wednesday at the D: All Things Digital conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., Groupon Chief Executive Andrew Mason deflected questions about acquisition talks with Google, as well as about his company’s imminent IPO. John Letzing is a MarketWatch reporter based in San Francisco. ||||| Groupon Inc., the top online-coupon provider, filed to raise 750 million in an initial public offering, riding a wave of Web-company share sales and giving investors a chance to bet on the surging daily-deal market. The IPO will be handled by Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), according to the filing. Chicago-based Groupon, founded in 2008, will trade under the ticker GRPN. Groupon has drawn increasing interest from Wall Street since December, when it opted to weigh an IPO instead of accepting a 6 billion takeover bid from Google Inc. As early as March, Groupon was in talks with bankers about an IPO that would value the company at as much as 25 billion, people familiar with the matter said at the time. Groupon is benefiting from demand for daily coupons, which provide discounts at local businesses like restaurants and nail salons. “You need to have a war chest,” said Sandeep Aggarwal, an analyst with Caris & Co. in San Francisco. “You need to have that access to capital to maintain that level of growth.” Groupon had an implied valuation of 5.6 billion at the end of March, according to research firm Nyppex LLC. Groupon Chief Executive Officer Andrew Mason said in a memo to employees that going public would make it “easier to make big acquisitions” and that all full-time employees will get equity in the share sale. He also said employees should avoid any “forward-looking statements” about Groupon in the months before the filing, dubbing the IPO “Groubrangelina,” a riff on the nickname given to celebrity couple Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Copycats Abound The company enjoys the benefit of pioneering the market for daily deals, which according to researcher BIA/Kelsey in Chantilly, Virginia, is set to generate 3.9 billion in sales in 2015, up from 873 million in 2010. Groupon follows LinkedIn Corp., the No. 1 professional- networking site, which became the first major U.S. social-media company to sell shares to the public last month. Shares of the Mountain View, California-based company has surged 75 percent since its May 18 debut and is now valued at 7.5 billion. Mason faces challenges in the market for daily coupons from hundreds of rivals, including LivingSocial.com, as well as recent entrants Google Inc. (GOOG), Facebook Inc. and Yelp Inc. Groupon’s sales surged to 644.7 million in the first quarter, a 14-fold increase from 44.2 million a year earlier. ‘Scary’ Marketing Costs The company recorded a 113.9 million net loss in the period, because of a 208 million marketing expense and 178.9 million in selling, general and administrative costs. “What was scary to me was the extent of that marketing expense,” said A.B. Mendez, a research analyst at GreenCrest Capital Management LLC in New York. “It’s not yet clear what their longer-term margins will be or when they will be able to get to consistent profitability.” Subscribers increased to 83.1 million in the first quarter from 3.4 million a year earlier, and the number of deals sold jumped to 28.1 million from 1.8 million. Groupon has deals in more than 500 markets worldwide, compared with 260 for Washington-based LivingSocial. The companies offer daily discounts of as much as 90 percent and keep about half the revenue, giving the rest to merchants. Groupon announced a partnership yesterday with Expedia Inc. (EXPE), offering U.S. and Canadian customers discounts of about 50 percent on stays at more than 135,000 hotels. “One of the biggest criticisms of Groupon is their desktop component is easy to copy, and that’s true,” Mendez said. “They’re going to have to continue spending a lot of marketing, and they’re going to need to invest in technology.” ‘Bunch of Money’ Still, the company has managed to distinguish itself from rivals and it is likely to keep increasing revenue in the coming years, said Greg Sterling, an analyst at Opus Research Inc. in San Francisco. Groupon said in the filing that it featured offers from more than 56,000 businesses in the first quarter. The potential market is “several million,” Sterling said. “It’s a very dramatic story,” he said. “Unless they screw it up, they should be able to keep it going for some time until the business starts to mature. The early investors are going to make a bunch of money.” The biggest shareholder is Green Media LLC, which is owned by co-founder Eric Lefkofsky and his wife, Elizabeth Kramer Lefkofsky. Green Media owns 21.6 percent of Class A shares and 41.7 percent of Class B stock. Investors Poised to Gain Rugger Ventures LLC, owned by the family of Groupon co- founder Bradley Keywell, hold 6.9 percent of Class A stock and 16.7 percent of Class B. New Enterprise Associates and Accel Partners own 14.7 percent and 5.6 percent of Class A shares, respectively. Investors with less than 5 percent ownership include T. Rowe Price Group Inc., Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock Partners, Russia’s Digital Sky Technologies and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, is an investor in Andreessen Horowitz. Groupon was valued at about 1.3 billion in April 2010, when it raised 135 million from Digital Sky and other investors. An investment of 950 million, completed in January, pegged Groupon’s worth at 4.75 billion.

The 2½-year-old company has grown at a torrid pace by pioneering a new approach to selling on the Web, offering daily deals to consumers in partnerships with local merchants. But it has been racking up huge losses, and such Internet powerhouses as Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. are moving to enter its business. Groupon's filing, which offered the first inside look at its finances, revealed that while revenue surged to 644.7 million in this year's first quarter, the company has been spending a fortune to fuel that growth. It recorded a loss of 413.4 million last year, and lost another 113.9 million in the first quarter. Its costly strategy is reminiscent of the early days of Internet companies like Amazon Inc. Groupon's filing comes on the heels of LinkedIn Corp.'s successful IPO, the latest sign of surging valuations for companies connected with hot Internet trends. The size of Groupon's losses may add fuel to the arguments that investors' appetite for high-profile tech offerings is becoming overheated, as it did before the first Internet stock-market bubble burst in 2000. \\"It's totally like 1999,\\" said Sucharita Mulpuru, an online-commerce analyst for Forrester Research. \\"To lose this money? What's crazy about these numbers is that this should be a highly profitable model.\\" Groupon's Chief Executive Andrew Mason, speaking Wednesday at The Wall Street Journal's D9: All Things Digital conference, didn't address the company's losses or the prospect of going public. But he expressed confidence that the company can stand up to the competition. He argued that Groupon's success is \\"largely due to the relationships that we have with local merchants, and it is a difficult thing to replicate.\\" Groupon didn't indicate exactly how much it intends to raise in its offering, which includes a placeholder figure of 750 million to compute a registration fee. People familiar with the matter have previously said the company could seek to raise close to 1 billion, which would value it at about 20 billion. The exact valuation will depend on market sentiment at the time of the offering. Bloomberg News As of March 31, Groupon's shares traded among institutional investors in private secondary trading at an implied valuation of 5.6 billion, according to Nyppex LLC, an intermediary in the secondary market. If the public offering values the company at 20 billion or more, its three founders would wind up with a combined net worth, on paper, of more than 7 billion. Eric Lefkosky, the tech entrepreneur who helped found the company, owns 21% of the company's stock, which could be worth more than 4 billion. Mr. Mason, a co-founder, has a stake that could be worth more than 1.5 billion, and the stake of Bradley Keywell, a third co-founder, could be worth more than 1.3 billion.

View Interactive More photos and interactive graphics Groupon was launched in 2008 as a side project for a website called The Point, which lets users run campaigns asking people to give money or do something as a group. The company's revenue surged as millions of people signed on to get discounts on everything from pedicures to horseback-riding lessons. The filing indicates that Groupon had revenue of 713.3 million last year. Its 644.7 million of first-quarter revenue dwarfs the 3.3 million it notched in the second quarter of 2009. The company says it has deals with nearly 57,000 local merchants in 43 countries, taking a cut from each sale. It had sold more than 70 million \\"Groupons,\\" or deals, by the end of March. Mr. Mason has said his goal is to become the Amazon.com of local commerce, bringing online a huge portion of the retail economy that other Web companies have tried to tap, largely without success. Groupon's filing is unapologetic about its spending, which has focused on marketing, sales staff and acquisitions. \\"In the past, we've made investments in growth that turned a healthy forecasted quarterly profit into a sizable loss,\\" the filing warns. \\"When we see opportunities to invest in long-term growth, expect that we will pursue them regardless of certain short-term consequences.\\" Ms. Mulpuru of Forrester Research said Groupon's financials show that the daily-deal business is \\"incredibly labor-intensive\\" and that the company has been buying growth by hiring more salespeople. That means Groupon has few fixed costs and can easily cut expenses by firing employees, she said. Some other observers are skeptical that Groupon can fend off competition. \\"It's not clear to me what their defensible competitive advantage is,\\" said Cathy Halligan, a sales and marketing executive at PowerReviews Inc., which sells customer-review technology for e-commerce sites. Besides Facebook and Google, Groupon's primary competitor is LivingSocial, a Washington company that analysts say has been steadily increasing its market share. Dozens of local imitators have launched around the country. Some newspapers also offer daily deals. The Groupon filing was widely welcomed in Silicon Valley, where the IPO window was largely closed for years. After LinkedIn's successful offering, \\"the Valley overall is excited and there's a big rush to get companies out there while the window's open,\\" said Jim Pitkow, chief executive of Attributor, a San Mateo, Calif., company that helps publishers track their content online. Lou Kerner, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, said Groupon is spending rapidly to acquire more customers, betting that they will become repeat ones. \\"The big question is will Groupon retain its leadership?\\" Mr. Kerner said. \\"Will Groupon be a Yahoo that was an early leader that basically became irrelevant? Or will they be an Amazon that built an early leadership and retains massive consumer value?\\" —Stu Woo, Gina Chon and Robert Frank contributed to this article.

Jordan studied Australia, while Jeb studied Antarctica. Which person observed an increased glacier outflow? Hint: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

The ongoing climate change and strong warming, particularly on the Antarctic Peninsula, have contributed to the increase in glacier outflow. The warming in West Antarctica, as well as the inflow of warm water from the deep ocean just off the continental shelf, are believed to be responsible for the recent increases in glacier outflow in the region. Additionally, various ice shelf collapses, such as the Larsen-B ice shelf in 2002 and the Wilkins Ice Shelf in 2008, demonstrate the direct result of the atmospheric warming in Antarctica, which contributes to increased glacier outflow."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The rest of the family humor him as best they can, rationalizing that Ludovic is only trying to find his identity and will soon be over it . Trouble begins when Ludovic befriends JÃ©rÃ´me, the son of her father's boss, and expresses a desire to marry him when Ludovic is finally a girl. When visiting JÃ©rÃ´me's house, Ludovic enters his sister's room and puts on one of her dresses, not realizing that the sister is deceased and the room was merely kept in memory of her. JÃ©rÃ´me's mother sees this and she and the rest of the neighbors are horrified. The community turns against Ludovic and, by extension, the rest of the Fabre family. After Ludovic stands in as Snow White in a school play, the parents of the other students send in a petition to have him expelled. Ludovic's father, under strain as an employee of JÃ©rÃ´me's father, is unable to cope and causes conflict within the family.

Answer:","completion":"In 2012, Cristiano Ronaldo played for the prestigious Spanish club Real Madrid, a team he joined in 2009 from English club Manchester United for a then world-record transfer fee of £80 million (€94 million). At Real Madrid, Ronaldo quickly established himself as one of the best players in the world and continued to break numerous records and win multiple individual and team awards. During the 2012 season, Ronaldo was a crucial player for Real Madrid, both domestically and on the international stage. Under the management of Portuguese coach José Mourinho, Ronaldo played primarily as a winger and sometimes as a forward, displaying his remarkable speed, dribbling skills, and goal-scoring abilities. In April 2012, Ronaldo scored the decisive goal in the 73rd minute of the match against Barcelona, ensuring Real Madrid's victory at the Camp Nou – a turning point in the title race for the 2011-2012 La Liga season. Real Madrid ultimately won the La Liga title that season, accumulating 100 points – a record at the time. In the UEFA Champions League, Ronaldo also performed exceptionally for Real Madrid during the 2011-2012 season, scoring a total of 10 goals before the team was eliminated in the semi-finals by Bayern Munich in a penalty shootout. In total, Ronaldo scored an astounding 60 goals in 55 appearances across all competitions during this season, contributing significantly to Real Madrid's domestic success and justifying his status as a world-class player. While playing for Real Madrid in 2012, Ronaldo also represented the Portuguese national team, adding to his lengthy list of credentials as a top international footballer. He played a key role in Portugal's qualification and campaign during the 2012 UEFA European Championship, where Portugal reached the semi-finals before being defeated by eventual champions Spain in a penalty shootout. In summary, Cristiano Ronaldo played for Real Madrid during 2012 and had a stellar year, becoming an essential player for both the club and the Portuguese national team. He contributed significantly to Real Madrid's successes, including winning La Liga that season, and his individual performances continued to place him at the top of the football world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Body-worn camera footage Below are links to the body-worn camera footage taken from the officer involved shooting on June 23, 2018 in the area of 4700 block of Bryant Avenue North. Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) Officers Justin Schmidt and Ryan Kelly were the responding officers. Officer Kelly is driving the squad car. Officer Schmidt is the passenger. Please be advised that the footage is very graphic. This video is not suitable for young people or sensitive viewers. There are three video links available: Officer Schmidt’s raw video (provided by the City of Minneapolis), Officer Kelly’s raw video (provided by the City of Minneapolis), and stabilized and analyzed video (not provided by the City of Minneapolis, explained below). The raw video footage is the body worn camera video that comes straight from the body worn camera. It contains movement and provides a lower level of clarity. This video is from the MPD and has not been altered in any way. The stabilized and analyzed video was produced by the National Center for Audio & Video Forensics in Beverly Hills, California, as contracted by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA), and provided to the City of Minneapolis by the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office. The National Center for Audio & Video Forensics ran this video through a stabilizing and analysis process. The stabilized and analyzed video includes footage from both MPD officers Justin Schmidt and Ryan Kelly. The stabilizing software identifies pixels from each frame and aligns them to help limit the “shake” that can occur without altering the content. Both the raw footage and stabilized and analyzed footage have been presented in the interest of full transparency. On Saturday, June 23, 2018 at 5:26 p.m., Minneapolis Police Officers responded to a 911 call reporting a male firing a handgun in a residential neighborhood near the 4700 block of Bryant Avenue North. Shortly after receiving the call, a squad arrived in the area. A full transcript of the 911 call and other public information is available above. Upon the officers exiting the squad car, you may hear clicking sounds. This sound is a product of audio disturbance from the microphone and does not reflect gun shots. ||||| Body camera footage of the Thurman Blevins shooting released Sunday night on the Minneapolis Police Department’s website appears to show that Blevins had a gun in his hand when he was fatally shot by officers in a North Minneapolis neighborhood earlier this summer. In the video, two officers repeatedly order Blevins to drop the gun and warn him that they are going to shoot before they fire. When he falls to the ground in an alley, what appears to be a handgun drops to the pavement beside him before police reach him. Another officer then is shown asking for cover so he can kick the gun away; the officer then approaches Blevins and kicks the object out of reach. Warning: Video includes explicit language and violent images. Police spokesman John Elder said the release was directed by Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and that the department was unable to comment. “Because there is a criminal investigation that is still ongoing we are unable to talk,” Elder said. “We can say that Chief (Medaria) Arradondo is still engaged and will continue to engage with the community, but we regret that because of this investigation we are unable to speak further.” In a press conference, Frey said the release of the body camera footage “was just one part of an effort to bring greater transparency to these processes. In the weeks and months ahead we will undoubtedly learn more.” “Why Jacob Frey chose to release this footage on a Sunday night, escapes me,” activist Nekima Levy Armstrong posted on her Facebook page. She warned people that the footage was graphic. The department posted unedited videos from the body cameras of Officer Ryan Kelly and Officer Justin Schmidt and a stabilized and analyzed video that was produced by the National Center for Audio & Video Forensics in Beverly Hills, Calif. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension contracted the stabilized video, and it was provided to the City of Minneapolis by the Hennepin County attorney’s office. The June 23 shooting in the 4700 block of Bryant Avenue North sparked calls for police reform and protests. There have been conflicting accounts about whether Blevins actually had a gun. A man who was hiding around the corner of his garage when Blevins was shot in his alley driveway provided a description that closely resembled what the video showed, including hearing the officer shout “Drop the gun!” and seeing the gun beside the body. Minneapolis NAACP president Leslie Badue said in a Facebook post on the night of the shooting that “Eye witnesses stated he was killed while running away from the officers. The witnesses say that he was sitting on the curb with his girlfriend and baby. The cup that he was drinking can still be seen at the scene.” The videos released Sunday from dash cameras and body cameras on officers Kelly and Justin depict the following: After the call comes in and the officers make their way to that area, they discuss how good the description of the suspect is after the 911 dispatcher describes a man shooting a gun. “That’s kind of a really good description for that to be an actual legitimate call,” Schmidt says. “But then again …” When the officers get closer they repeat the description. “What’s our description?” asks Kelly, who was driving. “Black male in his 30s, white or gray tank top, black backpack, six foot, 180, tapered hair, he’s also got a bottle of gin,” Schmidt says. “That’s very, very specific,” Kelly says. “Yeah,” says Schmidt. They see a man on the street. “That’s definitely not our guy,” Kelly says. “Definitely not,” says Schmidt. “It says tank top. White or gray tank top.” About two and a half minutes later the officers come across another man. “What about this guy? He’s got a bottle of gin,” Schmidt says. “Is he black tank top, tapered hair? Yeah. He’s got a gun!” As Schmidt gets out of his vehicle, the video shows Blevins getting up from sitting on the curb. A woman with a child in a stroller stands on the street in front of him. Blevins is holding a leash connected to a dog standing on the sidewalk behind him; he drops the leash and begins to run. The following conversation is what could be distinguished in the video based on audio from Schmidt and Kelly’s body cameras: As soon as Blevins begins to run: Schmidt: “Put your (expletive) hands up now. Stop. Put your (expletive) hands up. Put your hands up. I will (expletive) shoot you.” Kelly: “Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop or I’ll shoot. Stop or I’ll shoot. Stop or I’ll shoot.” Blevins: “What. What.” Schmidt: “Stop.” Blevins: “Come on, man. Come on, man.” Schmidt: “Put your hands up.” Blevins: “I didn’t do nothing, bro.” Schmidt: “You’ve got a gun, (expletive).” Blevins: “No.” Schmidt: “Yes you do.” (Unintelligible.) Schmidt: “Put it down. Put it down. I will (expletive) shoot you. Put your hands up.” Blevins: “Please don’t shoot me.” Schmidt: “Put your hands up.” Blevins: “Leave me alone.” Schmidt: “Put your …” Then Schmidt begins firing at Blevins, who falls on his back. Schmidt, with his gun still drawn, walks up closer. Blevins is on his back; his arms are moving and what appears to be a black and silver handgun is near his right hand. Another officer: “Schmidt backup.” And shortly after: “Cover him. I’m going to kick the gun.” Schmidt: “Yes, I got you.” Other officers: “He’s still moving. Cover him.” Schmidt: “I got you.” Another officer walks up and kicks the gun away before police call for medical assistance. Blevins’ shooting was the latest high-profile police shooting in the Twin Cities area in recent years. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

The context provided only discusses the film's technical details, such as the director, writer, producers, production banners, and lead actors. It does not provide any information about the reception, quality, or overall success of the film compared to the previous one. 2. Another point to consider is that the context seemingly contradicts the hypothesis itself. The text indicates that Baaghi 2 is, in fact, the sequel to the 2016 film \\"Baaghi\\". Since Baaghi 2 is the sequel, it would not be accurate to compare it as being better or worse than the sequel (itself). 3.

Without these details, it is impossible to determine if one film is better than the other.

Title: Night of the Twisters Movie plot: The film's prologue takes places in an area of rural farmland in Dannebrog, Nebraska. While there, Bob Irisen â a storm chaser with the National Weather Service â is driving down a country road to track a freak supercell thunderstorm. As a tornado touches down yards away, right as their daughter arrives home from school, Bob warns a family about the oncoming twister, which sends them running into their cellar just before it destroys their farm. Meanwhile, in (the fictional town of) Blainsworth, Nebraska (the book is set in the real-world city of Grand Island),[1][2] teenager Dan Hatch, an aspiring and practicing artist who is constantly being pushed by his stepfather Jack to be an athlete, participates in a bike race and damages his bicycle; Jack pushes Danny into finishing the race on his bum bike, where he falls behind the other racers. Much to his luck, he wins a new bike in a raffle held by a local bank. While trying out his new bicycle, Danny and his best friend Arthur Darlington run into Arthur's two sisters, Stacey (whom Danny is infatuated with) and Ronnie Vae, while at the park. Danny and Arthur arrive home as the former's mother Laura is preparing dinner, when she also asks Danny to tend to his baby half-brother, Ryan. Later, Laura's sister, Jenny, calls to inform her that they have been assigned to a fill-in shift as waitresses at the Salty Dawg, the local diner where they both work. On the road, while continuing to track the massive storm creeping toward the town, Bob decides to head southeast into Blainsworth, as the meteorologist he is radioing to is astonished at the uncharacteristic spring-like nature of the storm system for the fall; while there, he meets Laura and Jenny while getting some coffee at the diner. The action begins after Jack comes home at mid-evening; as he sits down to watch television, the show he is watching is interrupted by a severe weather bulletin reporting about a tornado sighting near Dannebrog, 14 miles (23Â km) northwest of Blainsworth.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Blue Butterfly Context: Pete Carlton is a young Montreal boy with terminal cancer. He has a love for butterflies, and often watches entomologist Alan Osborne's television show. His mother, Teresa, meets with Osborne, to try to get him to take her son to Costa Rica to find the rare Blue Morpho butterfly. However, he dismisses her, but later comes to their home upon receiving a phone call from Pete saying he would go to Central America himself. The two arrive at a small village when they learn the blue morphos have already migrated. Heartbroken, they prepare to leave, until they find one is still in the jungle. They chase after it several times, but are unable to catch it. Pete is determined to find the \\"magical\\" butterfly so his cancer can be cured, which leads to them falling into an underground cavern, injuring Osborne badly. Pete escapes to get help, but it only leads to him being lost, suffering from hallucinations. Osborne is rescued, and as they are leaving to a hospital for Osborne, a friendly villager reveals she has caught the butterfly, giving it to Pete. As he is about to kill it for his collection, he lets it go so it can make more of the magical butterflies. An epilogue shows that at the next visit to the doctor, Pete's cancer had miraculously disappeared. Answer:","completion":"Pete Carlton's mother, Teresa, wants to take him to Costa Rica in search of the rare Blue Morpho butterfly for several reasons. Firstly, Pete is a young boy from Montreal who has been diagnosed with terminal cancer. As a loving and dedicated mother, Teresa is desperate to do whatever it takes to help her son and try to find a cure for his illness. Secondly, Pete has a deep love and fascination for butterflies. He often watches entomologist Alan Osborne's television show and becomes particularly enchanted by the Blue Morpho butterfly. Pete believes that by finding this \\"magical\\" butterfly, his cancer can be cured. This belief acts as a driving force in Teresa's determination to help her son fulfill this dream. In an effort to help her son, Teresa meets with Alan Osborne to convince him to take Pete on an adventure to Costa Rica. Although Osborne initially dismisses this idea, he is later compelled to join Pete and Teresa due to Pete's unwavering determination and willingness to go to Central America by himself, if necessary. During their journey in Costa Rica, Pete's perseverance and optimism serve as a source of hope and inspiration for the trio as they search for the elusive Blue Morpho butterfly. Even when faced with the challenges of the jungle, Pete remains steadfast in his belief that finding the butterfly will result in his cancer being miraculously cured. In the end, when a villager presents Pete with the butterfly, he decides not to kill it for his collection but to let it go, allowing it to create more \\"magical\\" butterflies. This beautiful moment becomes a turning point for Pete, as his next visit to the doctor reveals that his cancer has indeed disappeared miraculously. In conclusion, Pete Carlton's mother, Teresa, wants to take him to Costa Rica to search for the rare Blue Morpho butterfly due to her unwavering love and commitment as a mother, her desire to find a cure for her son's terminal illness, and as a means to fulfill Pete's dream of finding the \\"magical\\" Blue Morpho butterfly that he believes can cure his cancer.

This article: With the outbreak of World War I on 28 July 1914, The Oceanides languished. Wartime politics being what they were, Sibelius's music was seldom played outside the Nordic countries and the United States: in Germany, there was little demand for the music of an \\"enemy national\\", while in Russia, Finns were viewed as being \\"less than loyal subjects of the Tsar\\". In any case, many of Sibelius's works had been printed by German publishing houses, a detail that harmed Sibelius's reputation not only in Russia, but also Britain and the United States. According to Tawaststjerna, the war plunged Sibelius into a state of melancholy and creative struggle (the Fifth and Sixth symphonies were in the process of simultaneous gestation at this time). His response was to retreat into near solitude: he abstained from attending and giving concerts and neglected his circle of friends, and he imagined himself \\"forgotten and ignored, a lonely beacon of light in a deepening winter darkness\\".Sibelius was not easily stirred from his exile; friend and fellow composer Wilhelm Stenhammar, then Artistic Director and chief conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, wrote to Sibelius repeatedly to persuade him to conduct a concert of his works in Gothenburg. Believing himself duty-bound to premiere a \\"major work\\" in Sweden, such as a symphony, Sibelius—to Stenhammar's chagrin—delayed each scheduled trip. He withdrew from planned concerts for March 1914, writing to Stenhammar, \\"My conscience forces me to this. But when I have some new works ready next year, as I hope, it would give me great joy to perform them in Gothenburg\\". New arrangements were made for February 1915, but these, too, Sibelius canceled in December 1914. In the end, the indefatigable Stenhammar prevailed and new concerts were set for March 1915 (\\"I see yet again your great sympathy for my music. I shall come\\".).Stenhammar's efforts were rewarded with the European premiere of The Oceanides.

The 1933 double eagle, a 20 gold piece with a mysterious history that involves a president, a king and a Secret Service sting operation, was auctioned Tuesday last night for a record price for a coin, 7.59 million, nearly double the previous record. The anonymous buyer, believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States, made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine-minute auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan. Eight bidders were joined by 500 coin collectors and dealers in an auction house audience seemingly devoid of celebrity bidders, while an additional 534 observers followed the bidding on eBay. As auction houses prepare for their fall seasons in an uncertain economy, the sale price \\"suggests that the marketplace for important items is enormously strong,\\" said David Redden, a vice chairman at Sotheby's, who was the auctioneer. \\"This is an astonishing new record for a coin,\\" he said. In an unprecedented move, the auction proceeds were split by the U.S. Mint and a London coin dealer, Stephen Fenton, who had won that right in court after having been arrested by Secret Service agents for trying to sell the coin in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in 1996. Henrietta Holsman Fore, the director of the U.S. Mint, who witnessed the sale, said, \\"The monies we receive will go toward helping to pay down the debt and to fight the war on terrorism.\\" Fenton commented that the double eagle had been on \\"a long historic journey, with a very satisfying ending.\\" He added, \\"I am thrilled with the price.\\" The previous numismatic record holder was an 1804 U.S. silver dollar, which sold for 4.14 million in 1999. Sotheby's partner in the one-lot auction was Stack's Rare Coins, with which it shared the customary 15 percent commission. \\"I have never seen as much interest in the sale of any coin in my 30 years in the business,\\" said Lawrence R. Stack, the company's managing director. \\"This is the Mona Lisa of coins,\\" said Beth Deisher, editor of Coin World, the largest weekly coin publication in the United States, with a circulation of 85,000. \\"It is unique.

A distinctive characteristic of Queen's music are the vocal harmonies which are usually composed of the voices of May, Mercury, and Taylor best heard on the studio albums A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races. Some of the ground work for the development of this sound can be attributed to their former producer Roy Thomas Baker, and their engineer Mike Stone. Besides vocal harmonies, Queen were also known for multi-tracking voices to imitate the sound of a large choir through overdubs.

As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen.

In a situation where someone loves another person but their feelings are not reciprocated, the experience often causes a deep emotional pain and longing called heartache. Let's examine the other options and their meanings to understand why \\"heartache\\" is the most appropriate choice: 1. Satisfaction: This typically refers to a state of contentment or fulfillment. In the context of unrequited love, the person experiencing it is unlikely to feel satisfied, as their emotional desires are unfulfilled. 2. Peace: Although peace can be a desirable state, it does not accurately represent the emotional turmoil that can result from unrequited love. The person may be struggling with their feelings of love and rejection, causing internal unrest rather than peace. 3. Love: Since the question specifically states that the other person does not reciprocate the love, this option does not accurately capture the emotional outcome for the person who loves but is not loved in return. 4. Happiness: Happiness occurs when someone feels pleasure, joy, or contentment. But in the case of unrequited love, the person experiencing it is likely to be unhappy because they are not receiving the love they desire. In conclusion, \\"heartache\\" is the most fitting choice among the options because it conveys the emotional pain and longing associated with loving someone who does not love you back. Unrequited love can lead to feelings of sadness, rejection, and heartache, setting it apart from the other options like satisfaction, peace, love, and happiness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the individual whose holdings included a church and priest, as well as 8 mills, 1 acre of woodland, 320 acres of meadow and 330 acres of marsh? from the following article ? The Sleaford area has been inhabited since the late Iron Age; people settled around the ford where a prehistoric track running northwards from Bourne crossed the River Slea. A large hoard of coin moulds belonging to the Corieltauvi tribe have been uncovered in this area and dated to the late Iron Age. It was occupied by the Romans, and then by the Anglo-Saxons. The place-name Slioford first appears in 852, meaning \\"crossing over a muddy stream\\", in reference to the Slea. The settlement around the crossing came to be known as \\"Old\\" Sleaford in 13th-century sources to distinguish it from developments further west, around the present-day market place, which came to be known as \\"New\\" Sleaford. The origins of New Sleaford are not clear, leading to a theory that it was planted by the Bishop of Lincoln in the 12th century as a means of increasing his income, hence the epithet \\"New\\". The town's compass-point layout, the 12th-century date of St Denys' stonework and other topographical features offer evidence for this theory.A speculative reassessment of Domesday Book (1086) material suggests that St Denys' origins may be earlier. Two manors called Eslaforde (Sleaford) were recorded in the Domesday Book, one held by Remigius, Bishop of Lincoln, the other by Ramsey Abbey. The Bishop succeeded a Saxon thegn, Bardi, and held 11 carucates with 29 villeins, 11 bordars, 6 sokemen, a church and priest, as well as 8 mills, 1 acre of woodland, 320 acres (130 ha) of meadow and 330 acres (130 ha) of marsh. Ramsey Abbey had been granted land in Sleaford and surrounding villages before the Norman Conquest of England; in Domesday its fee consisted of 1 carucate, 1 sokeman, 2 villeins and 27 acres of meadow. It was sokeland of the abbot of Ramsey's manor of Quarrington, where he held two churches. There is no evidence for a second church at Quarrington, which suggests that the record is alluding to one in another of the abbot's manors for which Quarrington was an estate centre. The local historians David Roffe and Christine Mahany... The answer is:","completion":"Remigius, Bishop of Lincoln.

It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001. As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775. - The United States Air Force (USAF) is the aerial warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven American uniformed services. Initially part of the United States Army, the USAF was formed as a separate branch of the military on 18 September 1947 under the National Security Act of 1947. It is the most recent branch of the U.S. military to be formed, and is the largest and one of the world's most technologically advanced air forces. The USAF articulates its core functions as Nuclear Deterrence Operations, Special Operations, Air Superiority, Global Integrated ISR, Space Superiority, Command and Control, Cyberspace Superiority, Personnel Recovery, Global Precision Attack, Building Partnerships, Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support. - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - The National Security Act of 1947 was a major restructuring of the United States government's military and intelligence agencies following World War II. The majority of the provisions of the Act took effect on September 18, 1947, the day after the Senate confirmed James Forrestal as the first Secretary of Defense.

Eberhard Louis commissioned a replacement lodge that was built from 1697 to 1701. Construction was interrupted by the beginning of the War of the Spanish Succession, fought against France and Bavaria. Württemberg resisted entry into the war until late 1702. Two years later, Eberhard Louis participated in the Battle of Blenheim in August 1704 that was followed by the exile of the Bavarian Elector. The duke used the battle to press claims to Bavarian lands, but he illegally occupied those lands and was further weakened by a French invasion of Württemberg in 1707. As a result of this attack, the ducal residence in the capital, Stuttgart, was burned and the royal family fled to Switzerland. With the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, the occupied Bavarian territory and status of the exiled Elector were restored.Construction of Ludwigsburg Palace began in May 1704 with the laying of the Alter Hauptbau's cornerstone by Eberhard Louis.

Before he retires, he is partnered with Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt), a cocky, young and short-tempered cop from Springfield, a comparatively small town. The two investigate the murder of a highly obese man (Bob Mack) who was fed spaghetti until a kick to his stomach burst him open.

Movie title: Rise of the Planet of the Apes Movie plot: The film opens at Gen Sys, a genetic therapy pharmaceutical company. A female ape (Terry Notary), designated No. 9 and known as \\"Bright Eyes\\" by the staff, has been given the drug ALZ 112, and has shown considerable progress. She is more sociable and calmer than normal apes, and has succeeded in completing the Towers of Hanoi puzzle in 20 moves, which is close to a perfect score of 15. Will Rodman (James Franco) talks to his boss, Steve Jacobs (David Oyelowo), and convinces him that he has data to enable them to proceed with human trials for the drug.The next day, Rodman and Jacobs appear before the board of directors in the Gen Sys conference room. Will explains that the new drug causes neurogenesis, the growth of new brain cells (something that doesn't typically happen after birth) and may heal any number of degenerative brain disorders, such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. The only side effect is that the subjects exposed to the drug have a green sparkle to their eyes.Back in the lab, the senior ape caretaker, Robert Franklin (Tyler Labine), is having trouble coaxing Bright Eyes out of her cage. She acts aggressively towards Robert and the other helpers. They attempt to lure her out of the cage with orange soda, but when they try to wrangle her with a lasso pole, she goes \\"ape\\" and runs rampant through the building. The chase ends when she crashes through the glass window of the conference room and the building's security guards kill her.Fearing that what they witnessed with Bright Eyes is a violent side effect of the drug, Jacobs pronounces the drug project 'dead.' Will attempts to change his mind, but Jacobs refuses, claiming he wants the remainder of the test apes 'put down.'After returning to the lab, Robert shows Will a baby ape hidden in Bright Eyes's cell. This explains that their assumption was in error: Bright Eyes was not acting violently because of the drug, but to protect her child.

Analyze the context: Sydney was at a bonfire and she told scary stories to the kids. This situation indicates a gathering around the fire with the purpose of having fun and sharing stories, likely creating an atmosphere of bonding and light-heartedness. 2. Evaluate possible actions: a) Tuck the kids into their tents: This is a possibility if the scary stories have concluded, and it's time for the kids to go to bed. However, it might not necessarily be the immediate next action that the group would want to take. b) Run away: This action doesn't fit well with the context, as it seems out of place and unrelated to the situation of Sydney telling scary stories in a fun setting. Running away is not likely what others would want to do next. c) Toast marshmallows: Toasting marshmallows is a classic bonfire activity that can follow story-telling, especially since it can help lighten the mood after scary stories and bring people together.

Later Holmes and Watson are visited at 221B Baker Street by Ann Brandon (Ida Lupino). She tells him that her brother Lloyd has received a strange note - a drawing of a man with an albatross hanging around his neck - identical to one received by her father just before his brutal murder ten years before. Holmes deduces that the note is a warning and rushes to find Lloyd Brandon. However he is too late, as Lloyd has been murdered by being strangled and having his skull crushed. Holmes investigates and attends a garden party, disguised as a music-hall entertainer, where he correctly believes an attempt will be made on Ann's life. Hearing her cries from a nearby park he captures her assailant, who turns out to be Gabriel Mateo, out for revenge on the Brandons for the murder of his father by Ann's father in a dispute over ownership of their South American mine.

His father was a pilot with the Royal Air Force, who moved into civil aviation, and his mother was a former airline stewardess. When he was 4 years old, Clayton's father worked in Kenya as a pilot with East African Airways, the family being resident in Nairobi (Clayton regards this as the happiest period of his childhood). In 1965, the family moved to Malahide, County Dublin in the Republic of Ireland, where Clayton's brother Sebastian was born. In September 1976, Mullen put an advert onto the school's bulletin board seeking other musicians to form a band; Clayton showed up for the first meeting and practice, so did the Edge with his older brother Richard Evans (\\"Dik\\"), Bono, and Ivan McCormick and Peter Martin who were two of Mullen's friends. McCormick and Martin left the band soon after its inception. While the band was a five-piece (consisting of Bono, the Edge, Mullen, Dik Evans, and Clayton) it was known as \\"Feedback\\". The name was subsequently changed to \\"The Hype\\", but changed to \\"U2\\" soon after Dik Evans left. Clayton stood in as the nearest thing that the band had to a manager in its early life, handing over the duties to Paul McGuinness in May 1978. In 1981, around the time of U2's second, spiritually charged album, October, a rift was created in the band between Clayton and McGuinness, and the three other band members. Bono, The Edge, and Mullen had joined a Christian group, and were questioning the compatibility of rock music with their spirituality. However, Clayton, with his more ambiguous religious views, was less concerned, and so was more of an outsider. In 1995, after the Zoo TV Tour and Zooropa album, Clayton headed to New York with bandmate Mullen to receive formal training in the bass; until then Clayton had been entirely self-taught. During that period, he worked on U2's experimental album, released under the pseudonym \\"Passengers\\", entitled Original Soundtracks 1. That album features one of the few instances where Clayton has appeared as a vocalist; he spoke the last verse of \\"Your Blue Room\\", the album's second single. Prior to this Clayton had only provided live backing vocals to tracks such as \\"Out of Control\\", \\"I Will Follow\\", \\"Twilight\\" and \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\". Since 1997's Popmart tour Clayton has not sung live in any capacity for the band. In 1996, while still in New York, Clayton collaborated with Mullen to re-record the Mission: Impossible theme.

Step 3: Know the properties of nitrogen Nitrogen is an element that exists in various states depending on temperature and pressure. Its boiling point at normal atmospheric pressure is -195.8 degrees Celsius (-320.4 degrees Fahrenheit). Step 4: Evaluate the answer Boiling is a specific phase change that occurs at the boiling point of a substance. When a substance expands, it doesn't necessarily mean that it boils.

The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - Bethesda Game Studios is an American video game developer, acting as in-house development team for parent company Bethesda Softworks, established in 2001. Previously synonymous with parent publisher Bethesda Softworks, the studio's name and logo were established with the release of \\"\\" in 2002.

A second studio, Bethesda Game Studios Montreal, was opened in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. - Bethesda Softworks LLC is an American video game publisher based in Rockville, Maryland. The company was founded by Christopher Weaver in 1986 in Bethesda, Maryland as a division of Media Technology Limited, and nowadays is a wholly owned subsidiary of ZeniMax Media. Originally a video game developer itself, Bethesda Softworks now acts as the publisher for their in-house development team, Bethesda Game Studios, and ZeniMax Media's subsidiaries, ZeniMax Online Studios, id Software, Arkane Studios, MachineGames, Tango Gameworks and BattleCry Studios. - An expansion pack, expansion set, supplement, or simply expansion is an addition to an existing role-playing game, tabletop game or video game. These add-ons usually add new game areas, weapons, objects, characters and/or an extended storyline to complete an already released game. While board game expansions are typically designed by the original creator, video game developers sometimes contract out development of the expansion pack to a third-party company, (see \\"\\" for \\"Diablo\\"), it may choose to develop the expansion itself or it may do both (Ensemble Studios developed the real-time strategy game Age of Empires III and the first expansion called itself, but contracted Big Huge Games for the second expansion pack, the Asian Dynasties). Board games and tabletop RPGs may have been marketing expansions since the 1970s, and video games have been releasing expansion packs since the 1980s, early examples being the \\"Dragon Slayer\\" games \\"\\" and \\"Sorcerian\\". - Downloadable content (DLC) is additional content created for a released video game. It is distributed through the Internet by the game's official publisher. Downloadable content can be of several types, ranging from aesthetic outfit changes to a new, extensive storyline, similar to an expansion pack.

The Game of The Year edition of Fallout 3 includes the full game and all five pieces of downloadable content . The downloadable content was originally exclusive to Xbox Live and Games for Windows . Although Bethesda had not offered an official explanation as to why the content was not released for PlayStation 3 , Lazard Capital Markets analyst Colin Sebastian speculated that it may have been the result of a money deal with Bethesda by Sony 's competitor , Microsoft .

Summarize: Use a headband, hair band, or bobby pins to pull back your hair and bangs so your face is fully exposed. You don't want it to get in the way during your facial. Use your favourite facial cleanser to remove make-up and wash your face. Use warm water, instead of cold or hot, since warm water is the best temperature for delicate facial skin.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What is the spatial device Bacon continued to incorporate and used many times throughout his career? is inside the article: As an artist, Francis Bacon was a late starter. He painted sporadically and without commitment during the late 1920s and early 1930s, when he worked as an interior decorator and designer of furniture and rugs. He later admitted that his career was delayed because he had spent so long looking for a subject that would sustain his interest. He began to paint images based on the Crucifixion in 1933, when his then-patron Eric Hall commissioned a series of three paintings based on the subject. These abstract figurations contain formal elements typical of their time, including diaphanous forms, flat backgrounds, and surrealist props such as flowers and umbrellas. The art critic Wieland Schmied noted that while the early works are \\"aesthetically pleasing\\", they lack \\"a sense of urgency or inner necessity; they are beautiful, but lifeless\\". The sentiment is echoed by Hugh Davies, who wrote that Bacon's 1933 paintings \\"suggest an artist concentrating more on formal than on expressive concerns\\". Bacon admitted that his early works were not successful; they were merely decorative and lacking in substance. He was often harshly self-critical during this period, and would abandon or destroy canvasses before they were completed. He abandoned the Crucifixion theme, then largely withdrew from painting in frustration, instead immersing himself in love affairs, drinking and gambling.When he returned to the topic of the Crucifixion eleven years later, he retained some of the stylistic elements he had developed earlier, such as the elongated and dislocated organic forms that he now based on Oresteia. He continued to incorporate the spatial device he was to use many times throughout his career—three lines radiating from this central figure, which was first seen in Crucifixion, 1933. Three Studies was painted over the course of two weeks in 1944, when, Bacon recalled, \\"I was in a bad mood of drinking, and I did it under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Together with your partner (and any family members who may be helping pay for your wedding), you’ll want to decide exactly how much you can afford to spend. It’s important to do plenty of research so you have an idea of how much each individual aspect of your wedding is likely to cost. Although weddings can be expensive, it is possible to plan the day of your dreams on a budget. Destination weddings aren’t necessarily more expensive than traditional ones and can even save you money in some cases. However, it’s still important to have a reasonable, well-thought out budget and consider any extra expenses you’re likely to incur. Since you’re unlikely to be able to travel back and forth multiple times to attend various appointments and meet with local vendors, it’s a good idea to hire someone you can trust to take care of these details on your behalf. Some venues and wedding packages provide a wedding specialist. In other cases, you’ll need to hire someone on your own. Either way, make sure you clearly communicate your vision and ideas to whoever will be helping you plan your special day. Especially if there’s a language barrier, choosing an all-inclusive package where your venue does most of the work for you can take away a lot of pressure and stress. , keeping the weather and your budget in mind. Consider your destination’s peak season when you decide on a date for your wedding. There may be certain seasons that are more crowded and touristy than others, and venue and vendor fees may be much higher during these times. Having your wedding during your destination’s “off-season” may save you money, but keep in mind that some vendors may only operate during peak season and inclement weather may be more likely. It’s also a good idea to talk to your wedding party, as well as your close family and friends, before setting a date to make sure they’re available. Your wedding planner may have a list of vendors they regularly work with and trust in the area, so talking to them is a good place to start. You’ll also want to look at any potential vendors’ online portfolios and ask them for references. If possible, plan a trip to meet with your vendors in person. If that’s not feasible, consider scheduling meetings via video chat. You can also opt to bring certain vendors with you. For example, if you have a photographer you really like, or a friend who does hair and makeup, it might be worth flying them out for your wedding. Airline ticket prices vary from season to season and can be unpredictable. The earlier you start looking for a good deal, the better. For a trip as important as your wedding, you definitely don’t want to wait until the last minute to book your flight. If you’re getting married in a warm, tropical climate, you probably don’t want to be wearing a heavy ball gown or wool suit. Also, keep in mind that high heels aren’t well suited to ceremonies on sandy beaches. Make sure to suggest appropriate attire to your guests as well. You can do this on your invitations or wedding website. If possible, fly to your destination ahead of time to meet with your planner, tour your venue, rehearse for your ceremony, and make final arrangements. Arriving early can also help calm your nerves and prevent you from being jet-lagged on your special day.

What is the correct answer to the question from the following choices? Possible answers: + burning crops. + driving a hybrid car. + burning household garbage. + using coal to produce energy.","completion":"The correct answer to the question from the following choices is: + driving a hybrid car. Driving a hybrid car helps decrease air pollution as it relies on both a traditional internal combustion engine and an electric motor for propulsion. The combination of these two technologies leads to lower emissions and improved fuel efficiency, subsequently reducing the overall impact on the environment. Here's a detailed explanation of how the other options do not help in decreasing air pollution: 1. Burning crops: This human activity is a significant contributor to air pollution. When farmers burn crop residues in fields, it releases large amounts of particulate matter, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, and greenhouse gases into the air. These pollutants can negatively impact air quality, cause respiratory issues, and contribute to global warming. Moreover, burning crops can reduce soil fertility, create visibility hazards, and increase pressure on natural resources. 2. Burning household garbage: When household garbage, which includes various materials like plastic, paper, and food waste, is burned, it releases harmful pollutants and toxic gases into the atmosphere. These pollutants, such as dioxins, furans, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, can have severe health implications for humans and the environment. They can cause respiratory problems, cancer, and birth defects, besides contributing to climate change. Proper waste disposal and recycling methods are much more eco-friendly alternatives to burning garbage. 3. Using coal to produce energy: Coal is a fossil fuel that, when burned for energy production, releases significant amounts of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter into the air. These emissions are responsible for causing smog, acid rain, and respiratory illnesses, as well as contributing to climate change. Coal-fired power plants are one of the leading sources of air pollution globally. Transitioning to renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, or hydroelectric power, is a more environmentally conscious option to reduce air pollution. In conclusion, the correct answer to the question - \\"Which human activity will help decrease air pollution?\\" - is driving a hybrid car as it greatly reduces greenhouse gas emissions and cuts down on pollution related to traditional fuel consumption. The other options (burning crops, burning household garbage, and using coal to produce energy) all contribute negatively to air pollution, making them unwise choices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This outcome would be justified by the need to maintain a fair testing environment for all students. 2. Rescheduling the test: Another possibility is that the testing site may allow Lee's friends to reschedule the test for a later date. This outcome would depend on the site's policies and the reason for their late arrival. It'd be justified if there were extenuating circumstances such as an emergency or a major traffic issue. 3. Missed test opportunity: If Lee's friends are not allowed to take the test on that day or reschedule, they may miss the opportunity altogether. This could affect their academic progress, course grade, or eligibility for certain programs. This outcome would be justified by the expectation that students should be punctual and responsible in organizing their time to meet deadlines. 4. Probation or disciplinary measures: Depending on their school or institution, Lee's friends may face additional consequences for missing the test. These could include academic probation, impacting their enrollment status, or required attendance at a disciplinary hearing. These outcomes would be justified by the need for institutions to hold students accountable for their actions. Overall, the consequences for Lee's friends will depend on the policies of their school or testing site and the specific circumstances surrounding their late arrival. Regardless of the outcome, it's important for students to learn from these experiences and strive to improve their time management and planning skills in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I was sent to court and found guilty based on no evidence by a magistrate court judge who was later struck off for corruption after defrauding an old lady of over a million pounds! I was not put in prison for this minor offense but did receive a minor criminal record. This criminal records the same DJ’s and bent ex-police have used to ruin my reputation and career. One of the bent policemen, who incidentally had already been thrown out of the police force for car insurance fraud, even turned up at the uni I went to and spread vicious slander to ruin me there, and in the area that I lived at the time. I was then victimised by the people at the famous college that I went to and all my intellectual and copyright works stolen. Which I note, generated millions for others. Once they made their money and gained credibility on the back of my hard work, innovation and some may say genius, the thieves then did all they could to ruin my reputation in the entertainment industry and in the area that I live.

Their mission is to capture Nazi war criminal Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen)âinfamously known as \\"The Surgeon of Birkenau\\" for his medical experiments on Jews during World War IIâand bring him to Israel to face justice.

This tryst leads to Rachel becoming pregnant. Stefan also reveals to Rachel that David lost his entire family in The Holocaust. At a doctors appointment, Rachel injects Vogel with a sedative during an examination and induces the nurse (Vogel's wife) to believe that he has suffered a heart attack. Stefan and David arrive dressed as paramedics and make off with the unconscious Vogel in a faux ambulance, barely ahead of the real ambulance team. Under cover of night, the trio attempt their exfiltration at Wollankstrasse Station, on a railway line along the sector boundary between East and West Berlin, and next to a mail depot. As they prepare to load Vogel onto the stopped train he suddenly awakens and sounds the horn of the stolen mail van where he is being held, alerting East German guards to their presence.

Push the toothpick end gently underneath one of the seeds on the skin of the strawberry.","completion":"Carefully lift and remove the seed from the strawberry without damaging it, and place it on a paper towel to dry for around 24 hours. While the seed dries, gather your planting supplies: a small container or pot with drainage holes, potting mix, a spray bottle filled with water, and a clear plastic bag. Fill the container with moistened potting mix, leaving about half an inch of space from the top. Create several small indentations in the soil, about ¼ inch deep, and evenly spaced to provide ample room for each seed to grow. Once your strawberry seeds are dry, gently place each one into an indentation in the soil, taking care not to overcrowd the container. Lightly cover the seeds with a thin layer of potting mix, maintaining the ¼-inch depth. Using the spray bottle, mist the soil surface with water to ensure the seeds have adequate moisture for germination. Place the container in a sunny windowsill or under grow lights, ensuring that the spot receives at least six to eight hours of sunlight per day. To create a mini-greenhouse effect and retain moisture, place the clear plastic bag over the container, securing it with a rubber band if necessary. Make sure there is enough space between the top of the container and the plastic bag to allow for air circulation. Monitor the soil's moisture level daily and mist with water when needed to maintain consistent soil moisture. Typically, strawberry seeds will germinate within two to three weeks; however, this may vary depending on factors such as seed quality, temperature, and light conditions. Once your seeds have germinated, and you see small seedlings emerging from the soil, remove the plastic bag to prevent mold and mildew growth. Continue providing adequate sunlight and water, allowing the top layer of soil to dry slightly between waterings to avoid overwatering. When your seedlings have developed at least three leaves, transplant them into separate, larger pots filled with a high-quality potting mix. As your strawberry plants grow, maintain proper care by ensuring they receive the required sunlight, water, and nutrients. Additionally, remember to rotate the pots regularly to ensure even exposure to light. As your strawberry plants begin to flower, you can encourage fruit production by hand-pollinating the blooms using a small paintbrush or cotton swab. Gently transfer pollen from the stamen to the pistil of each flower, mimicking the process typically performed by bees and other pollinators outdoors. With proper care and attention, your indoor strawberry plants will soon reward you with a delicious, homegrown harvest."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Title: Crazy Heart Movie plot: Otis \\"Bad\\" Blake (Jeff Bridges) is a 57-year-old alcoholic singer-songwriter who was once a country music star. He now earns a modest living by singing and playing his guitar in small town bars across the South-Western United States. Having a history of failed marriages (four that he admits to, although a reference is made to a fifth he does not discuss) Blake is without a family. He has a son, aged 28, with whom he has not had contact in 24 years. He is mostly on the road performing, staying in cheap motels and travelling in his old '78 Suburban alone. The film opens with his arrival at a bowling alley for a show. Enter Jean Craddock (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a young journalist after a story, divorced and with a four-year-old son, Buddy (Jack Nation). She interviews Blake, and the two enter into a relationship. Jean and her son become a catalyst for Blake beginning to get his life back on track. In doing so, he lets himself be pushed into renewing a professional relationship with Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell), a popular and successful country music star he once mentored, and plays as the opening act at one of Tommy's concerts, despite his initial balking and wounded pride at being the opening act to his former student. He asks Tommy to record an album with him, but Tommy says his record company insists on a couple more solo albums before a duet project can be recorded. He instead suggests that Blake concentrate on writing new songs that Tommy can record solo, telling him he writes better songs than anyone else. Blake's drinking soon gets out of control, and he ends up running off the road while driving drunk. In the hospital, the doctor informs him that although he only sustained a broken ankle from the crash, he is slowly killing himself, and must stop drinking and smoking and lose 25 pounds if he wants to live more than a few more years. Blake's relationship with Jean makes him start to rethink his life. He calls up his son to make amends, only to have his son tell him that his mother, Bad's ex-wife, has died,...

Answer the following question: Information: - Philip II, known as Philip Augustus (21 August 1165 14 July 1223), was King of France from 1180 to 1223, a member of the House of Capet. Philip's predecessors had been known as kings of the Franks, but from 1190 onward, Philip became the first French monarch to style himself king of France. The son of King Louis VII and his third wife, Adèle of Champagne, he was originally nicknamed \\"Dieudonné\\" \\"God-given\\" because he was the first son of Louis VII, born late in his father's life. Philip was given the nickname \\"Augustus\\" by the chronicler Rigord for having extended the Crown lands of France so remarkably. - The House of Capet or the Direct Capetians, also called the House of France (\\"la maison de France\\"), or simply the Capets, ruled the Kingdom of France from 987 to 1328. It was the most senior line of the Capetian dynasty itself a derivative dynasty from the Robertians. Historians in the 19th century came to apply the name \\"Capetian\\" to both the ruling house of France and to the wider-spread male-line descendants of Hugh Capet. It was not a contemporary practice (see House of France). They were sometimes called \\"the third race of kings\\", the Merovingians being the first, and the Carolingians being the second. The name is derived from the nickname of Hugh, the first Capetian King, who was known as \\"Hugh Capet\\". The direct succession of French kings, father to son, from 987 to 1316, of thirteen generations in almost 330 years, was unparallelled in recorded history. - Louis VIII the Lion ( 5 September 1187 -- 8 November 1226 ) was a King of France from the House of Capet who reigned from 1223 to 1226 . He also claimed the title King of England from 1216 to 1217 . Louis VIII was born in Paris , the son of King Philip II of France and Isabelle of Hainaut , from whom he inherited the County of Artois . While Louis VIII only briefly reigned as king of France , he was an active leader in his years as crown prince . During the First Barons ' War of 1215 - 17 against King John of England , his military prowess earned him the epithet the Lion . After his victory at the Battle of Roche - au - Moine in 1214 , he invaded southern England and was proclaimed \`\` King of England '' by rebellious barons in London on the 2 June 1216 . He was never crowned , however , and renounced his claim after being excommunicated and repelled . In 1217 , Louis started the conquest of Guyenne , leaving only a small region around Bordeaux to Henry III of England . Louis 's short reign was marked by an intervention using royal forces into the Albigensian Crusade in southern France that decisively moved the conflict towards a conclusion . He died in 1226 and was succeeded by his son Louis IX. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'noble family' with 'capetian dynasty'.

Next question: what does hp stand for in the sauce?","completion":"HP Sauce is a popular British condiment, and the \\"HP\\" stands for \\"Houses of Parliament.\\" The history and attributes of this sauce are quite interesting, as it has become an iconic product in the United Kingdom, with a loyal following around the world. The Houses of Parliament in the United Kingdom is where the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the two main branches of the British government, meet to discuss and legislate matters important to the country. The association of the sauce with the Houses of Parliament originated in the early 20th century when the sauce made an appearance on the tables in the parliamentary dining rooms. HP Sauce was first created in 1899 by a Nottingham grocer named Frederick Gibson Garton. He formulated the sauce using a combination of malt vinegar, tomatoes, dates, tamarind, and various spices, creating a tangy, savory, and slightly sweet flavor. Garton registered the name \\"HP Sauce\\" in 1903 after allegedly claiming that a restaurant within the Houses of Parliament served his sauce. The sauce continued to grow in popularity throughout the UK and eventually became a staple in British households and eateries. In 1903, Garton sold the HP Sauce recipe and brand to Edwin Samson Moore, a vinegar brewer, and founder of the Midlands Vinegar Company. Moore's company started mass production and distribution of HP Sauce, eventually increasing its popularity even more. The iconic illustration of the Houses of Parliament found on the HP Sauce label is a nod to its name origin. The current packaging features the Elizabeth Tower, widely known as Big Ben, despite the fact that Big Ben actually refers to the largest bell inside the tower. Over the years, the label has been updated, but the Houses of Parliament image remains an essential part of its visual identity. In the years since its creation, HP Sauce has become a British culinary icon, being featured in a variety of dishes such as the classic Full English Breakfast, bacon sandwiches, pies, and sausages. The sauce has also found its way into an assortment of recipes, with chefs and home cooks alike incorporating it as a marinade, glaze, or base for stews and sauces. Its distinctive taste has garnered a loyal following, not only in the United Kingdom but also internationally, as it is exported globally to suit the palates of those seeking a traditional British flavor. In conclusion, HP Sauce is a beloved British condiment featuring the initials \\"HP\\" that stand for \\"Houses of Parliament\\". This tangy and slightly sweet sauce has come to symbolize British cuisine and heritage, backed by its historical connection to the famed government establishment in London. Regardless of how it arrived on the tables in the Houses of Parliament many years ago, HP Sauce continues to be a staple in British households, playing a significant role in defining the taste of the nation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

At least four women have gone missing there since 2009. Graham, 18, was last seen in Charlottesville's Downtown Mall area on September 13. Investigators believe suspect Jesse Matthew, 32, was the last person with her. He is charged with abduction with the intent to defile.","completion":"A drone with a special camera is looking for a lost student named Hannah Graham in a big area. People who are trying to solve this mystery are also looking at other cases where people went missing or were killed. They caught a man who might be connected to these bad things. This man has been in trouble before for hurting other people. Evidence shows that he might be connected to the disappearance and death of another young woman in the same area where Hannah went missing. Four women have gone missing in that area since 2009. Hannah, who is 18 years old, was last seen in a place called Charlottesville's Downtown Mall on September 13. People think that the suspect, a 32-year-old man named Jesse Matthew, was the last person with her. He is now in trouble for taking her away and wanting to do bad things to her."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Where is the proof of alien life? Is there any proof or evidence of alien / extraterrestrial life existence?","completion":"To determine if these questions have the same meaning, I will analyze each question and compare their intent. 1. Analyzing the first question: \\"Where is the proof of alien life?\\" This question is asking for the location or source of proof that confirms the existence of alien life. The person asking this question assumes that such proof exists and wants to know where they can find it. 2. Analyzing the second question: \\"Is there any proof or evidence of alien / extraterrestrial life existence?\\" This question is inquiring about the existence of any proof or evidence supporting the existence of alien or extraterrestrial life. This question is more open to the possibility that such proof or evidence may not exist. Comparing the two questions, I can conclude that they do not have the same meaning: The first question presupposes that there is proof of alien life and wants to know its location or source. In contrast, the second question is more neutral and asks whether any proof or evidence exists to support the concept of alien life. So, while both questions touch upon the topic of proof or evidence for alien life, their intents are different, and they cannot be considered as having the same meaning."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The remnants of humanity are either enslaved by the Psychlos and used for manual labor or survive in primitive tribes living in remote areas outside Psychlo control. Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper), a member of one such tribe, leaves his home in the Rocky Mountains on a journey of exploration. He joins forces with Carlo (Kim Coates), a hunter, but both men are captured by a Psychlo raiding party and transported to a slave camp at the Psychlos' main base on Earth, a giant dome built over the ruins of Denver, Colorado.Terl (John Travolta), the Psychlo security chief on Earth, has been condemned by his superiors to remain indefinitely at his post on Earth as punishment for an unclear incident involving \\"the Senator's daughter.\\" Aided by his deputy, Ker (Forest Whitaker), Terl devises a plan to buy his way off the planet by making a fortune using human slaves to mine gold in radioactive areas. Psychlos are unable to visit such areas due to the explosive interaction of the gas that they breathe with radionuclide particles. Terl selects Jonnie as his \\"foreman\\" for the project and gives him a Psychlo education using a rapid-learning machine. Terl gives Jonnie a party of slaves and a Psychlo flying shuttle and orders him to go out and find gold.After learning the Psychlos' language, history, and myriad other educational forms from the rapid learning machine, Jonnie plots a human uprising against the Psychlos. He obtains gold from Fort Knox to satisfy Terl's demands, instead of mining gold as ordered. Jonnie and his followers find an abandoned underground US military base with working aircraft, weapons, fuel, and nuclear weapons. They use the base's flight simulators to train themselves in aerial combat.After a week of training, the rebels launch a mass uprising against the Psychlos using Harrier jump-jets and other weapons. Carlo sacrifices himself to destroy the dome over Denver, and the Psychlos inside suffocate in Earth's atmosphere, which they are unable to breathe. Jonnie captures a Psychlo teleportation device and uses it to teleport an atomic bomb to the Psychlo home world. The ensuing detonation causes the entire Psychlo atmosphere to explode, wiping out the planet. Ker and Terl survive on Earth but face different fates: Ker sides with the victorious humans, while Terl is imprisoned as a hostage within a vault in Fort Knox.

Step 2: Historically, the Netherlands has experienced varying degrees of economic growth and recession. One significant event was the 2008 global financial crisis, which affected many countries, including the Netherlands. Step 3: Regarding the statement about the 2009 economic decline, it is accurate as the Dutch economy contracted by 3.5% during that year due to the global financial crisis. However, rather than focusing solely on this specific event, it is important to consider the broader context and overall economic performance in the years that followed. Step 4: Based on the information gathered, a more comprehensive answer to the question about the economics of the Netherlands is: The Netherlands has a highly developed, high-income economy, with key industries such as agriculture, services, manufacturing, and trade. The country experienced a significant economic downturn in 2009, with a 3.5% decline in GDP due to the global financial crisis.

Such attentiveness demonstrates that Kai is likely to be someone who values and appreciates the intricacies and minute aspects of their surroundings or a specific subject. When compared to the other possible answers, \\"careless\\" would not be a fitting description for Kai, as it contradicts the notion of concentrating on details and fully observing a matter at hand. A \\"careless\\" person would not pay close attention and could overlook essential elements or make mistakes due to their lack of mindfulness.

You are given a new situation: Two farmer's associations used different agricultural methods when growing crops. Bold farm used lots of fertilizers over the years, while Shallow farm used organic methods combined with methods from permaculture. and a hint : Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Please answer this question : Which farm contributes less to the consumption of oxygen in the water? Answer:","completion":"The Shallow farm contributes less to the consumption of oxygen in the water. This is because Shallow farm uses organic methods and permaculture techniques for growing crops, instead of utilizing chemical fertilizers as Bold farm does. These sustainable practices help to maintain a balanced ecosystem in the surrounding environment. When Bold farm uses chemical fertilizers, the rain dissolves them, and the runoff carries the excess nutrients such as nitrogen into nearby bodies of water. The high levels of nitrogen promote excessive algae growth, which in turn consume large amounts of carbon dioxide in the water. When the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue and use up all the oxygen in the process, creating dead zones where nothing can grow due to low oxygen levels. On the other hand, Shallow farm's organic and permaculture practices minimize the use of harmful chemicals and focus on maintaining a balanced ecosystem. This means that there is a lower risk of nitrogen runoff and subsequent oxygen depletion in nearby water sources. As a result, Shallow farm contributes less to the consumption of oxygen in the water and is a more environmentally sustainable option compared to Bold farm."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Busy streets and few bike lanes and parking areas can make it a battle. But not even these difficulties can stop Europeans' love for cycling. According to Reuters, more bicycles have been sold than cars in 26 of the European Union's 28 states this year. In some European countries, people really love bicycles. \\"People ride to work and take their bikes to the grocery store\\", Bill Strickland, editor of Bicycling magazine, told the reporter from Reuters. So what has led to cycling's growing popularity in Europe? Cycling is \\"a safe, clean, healthy, inexpensive way to get around town,\\" the Daily Star concluded. \\"It not only reduces traffic problems and pollution, but also contributes to public health.\\" Bike-friendly rules have also been made. Dozens of cities have joined a European Union initiative to make bicycles a form of city transport, like cars. Quite a few cities such as Stockholm, London, Florence and Munich now offer special bike lanes. Copenhagen takes it a step further by keeping bicycles and cars separated as much as possible. On these _ , traffic lights are designed to the rhythms of bicycles, not cars. For people living far from city centers, getting to work by bicycle alone may take too much time. That's why many European countries now allow cyclists to bring their bicycles onto subway trains. Europeans are also creative in solving parking problems.

Question 1: My ex does not want to get back with me, but he still stares at me in class constantly. What's wrong with him? Question 2: My girlfriend still loves her ex. She wants to get over him. But she hasn't. She wants to fall in love with me. But this gets in the way. What should I do? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Answer to Question 1: It appears that your ex may be experiencing a complex mix of emotions. Although they have decided not to get back together with you, there could be several reasons for their continued interest in you. Some potential explanations for this behavior are: 1. Residual feelings: Even though they don't want to rekindle the relationship, your ex might still have lingering emotions from your time together. Staring at you in class could be indicative of these unresolved feelings. 2. Curiosity: Your ex may be finding it difficult to adjust to the idea of not being an active part of your life. They might be observing you to seek information about your current emotional state or your interactions with others. 3. Habit: It is possible that your ex has become accustomed to watching you during your time together. In this case, they might not even be aware of their habit, and it may take some time to break. 4. Regret or uncertainty: Your ex may be questioning their decision to end the relationship, and staring at you could be a way to try and figure out whether they made the right choice. To manage the situation, try having an open and honest conversation about their behavior and your feelings. Establish boundaries and request that they respect your personal space during class. Answer to Question 2: In this situation, it's vital to approach the issue with empathy and patience. Your girlfriend's struggle to fully move on from her ex can be challenging for both of you. Here are some steps you can take to help her and navigate this situation: 1. Communicate openly: Encourage your girlfriend to express her feelings and emotions honestly. Establish a safe space where she feels comfortable talking about her struggles without the fear of judgment or misunderstandings. 2. Be patient: Give your girlfriend the time she needs to heal from her past relationship. It might take longer than you expect, but it will allow her to genuinely process her emotions and eventually let go of her ex. 3. Strengthen your connection: Focus on nurturing your relationship by spending quality time together, creating new memories, and exploring shared interests. A strong emotional connection will help her to see the value in your relationship and facilitate her falling in love with you. 4. Encourage self-care and personal growth: Support your girlfriend in her self-care efforts and the pursuit of activities that will help her grow independently. This might include therapy, meditation, or pursuing her passions and hobbies. 5. Know your limits: If the situation starts to take a toll on your mental and emotional well-being or causes strain in your relationship, remember that you can only do so much. Acknowledge your boundaries and seek professional help if necessary. The answer to these two questions is not the same, as the situations and the individuals involved have different dynamics and emotions at play. Therefore, the approach to handling each situation should be tailored to the specific circumstances and the needs of the people involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Greg and Frank were two friends that studied natural sciences. One day, Greg decided to start reading about natural selection. His friend Frank decided to read more about populations that displayed natural selection more sparingly. They both learned lots of new interesting facts. and a hint : New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks. Please answer this question : Which friend didn't learn about unfavorable heritable traits becoming less common? Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, let's break down the information provided step-by-step and examine what each friend learned. Step 1: Identify the topic each friend studied. - Greg focused on natural selection. - Frank focused on populations that displayed natural selection more sparingly. Step 2: Review the provided hint and understand the concept. - New species develop through natural selection. - Organisms with better adaptive traits tend to survive and reproduce more. - Natural selection causes beneficial traits to become more common and unfavorable traits to become less common. Step 3: Compare the friends' topics with the concept of unfavorable heritable traits becoming less common. - Greg learned about natural selection, so he would have learned about unfavorable heritable traits becoming less common. - Frank, on the other hand, studied populations that displayed natural selection more sparingly. This means he focused on populations where natural selection was less prominent or less influential on the traits of the organisms. Based on this analysis, the answer is: Frank didn't learn about unfavorable heritable traits becoming less common, as his focus was on populations that displayed natural selection more sparingly rather than the process of natural selection itself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Other notable credits include \\"Two Years Before the Mast\\" (1946), \\"Whispering Smith\\" (1949) and \\"The Great Gatsby\\" (1949). His popularity diminished in the late 1950s, though he continued to appear in popular films until his accidental death due to a lethal combination of alcohol, a barbiturate, and two tranquilizers. - The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) is a body of senior uniformed leaders in the United States Department of Defense who advise the President of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, the Homeland Security Council and the National Security Council on military matters. The composition of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is defined by statute and consists of the \\"Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\\" (\\"CJCS\\"), \\"Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\\" (\\"VCJCS\\"), and the Military Service Chiefs from the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, all appointed by the President following Senate confirmation. Each of the individual Military Service Chiefs, outside of their Joint Chiefs of Staff obligations, works directly for the Secretary of the Military Department concerned, i.e., Secretary of the Army, Secretary of the Navy, and the Secretary of the Air Force. - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - A film genre (or ) is a motion picture category based on similarities in either the narrative elements or the emotional response to the film (namely, serious, comic, etc.). Most theories of film genre are borrowed from literary genre criticism. The basic genres include fiction and documentary, from which subgenres have emerged, such as docufiction and docudrama. Other subgenres include the courtroom and trial-focused drama known as the legal drama. Types of fiction which may seem unrelated can also be combined to form hybrid subgenres, such as the melding of horror and comedy in the \\"Evil Dead\\" films. Other popular combinations are the romantic comedy and the action comedy film. - The James Bond series focuses on a fictional British Secret Service agent created in 1953 by writer Ian Fleming, who featured him in twelve novels and two short-story collections. Since Fleming's death in 1964, eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelizations: Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd and Anthony Horowitz. The latest novel is \\"Trigger Mortis\\" by Anthony Horowitz, published in September 2015. Additionally Charlie Higson wrote a series on a young James Bond, and Kate Westbrook wrote three novels based on the diaries of a recurring series character, Moneypenny. - Whispering Smith (1948) is a Western film starring Alan Ladd as a railroad detective assigned to stop a gang of train robbers. The supporting cast includes Robert Preston and Brenda Marshall. - War film is a film genre concerned with warfare, typically about naval, air, or land battles, with combat scenes central to the drama. It has been strongly associated with the 20th century. The fateful nature of battle scenes means that war films often end with them. Themes explored include combat, survival and escape, sacrifice, the futility and inhumanity of battle, the effects of war on society, and the moral and human issues raised by war. War films are often categorized by their milieu, such as the Korean War; the most popular subject is the Second World War. The stories told may be fiction, historical drama, or biographical. Critics have noted similarities between the Western and the war film. - Two Years Before the Mast is a memoir by the American author Richard Henry Dana Jr., published in 1840, having been written after a two-year sea voyage from Boston to California on a merchant ship starting in 1834. A film adaptation under the same name was released in 1946. - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - O.S.S. is a 1946 war film starring Alan Ladd and Geraldine Fitzgerald about the Office of Strategic Services , directed by Irving Pichel , who would soon be blacklisted and written by Richard Maibaum , a World War Two vet who would later write 12 of the first 15 James Bond films . Richard Maibaum , a former Broadway actor , also narrates the film . - The Blue Dahlia is a 1946 film noir, directed by George Marshall based on an original screenplay by Raymond Chandler. The film marks the third pairing of stars Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake. It was Chandler's first original screenplay. Plot. Three discharged United States Navy officers, Johnny Morrison, Buzz Wanchek and George Copeland, arrive in Hollywood, California. All three flew together in the same flight crew in the South Pacific. Buzz has a shell shock and a metal plate in his head above his ear. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was a wartime intelligence agency of the United States during World War II, and a predecessor of the modern Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The OSS was formed as an agency of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) to coordinate espionage activities behind enemy lines for all branches of the United States Armed Forces. Other OSS functions included the use of propaganda, subversion, and post-war planning. - Film noir is a cinematic term used primarily to describe stylish Hollywood crime dramas, particularly such that emphasize cynical attitudes and sexual motivations. Hollywood's classical film noir period is generally regarded as extending from the early 1940s to the late 1950s. Film noir of this era is associated with a low-key black-and-white visual style that has roots in German Expressionist cinematography. Many of the prototypical stories and much of the attitude of classic noir derive from the hardboiled school of crime fiction that emerged in the United States during the Great Depression. - Veronica Lake (born Constance Frances Marie Ockelman; November 14, 1922 July 7, 1973) was an American film, stage, and television actress. Lake won both popular and critical acclaim, most notably for her role in \\"Sullivan's Travels\\" and for her femme fatale roles in film noirs with Alan Ladd, during the 1940s. She was also well known for her peek-a-boo hairstyle. Lake's career had begun to decline by the late 1940s, in part due to her alcoholism. She made only one film in the 1950s but appeared in several guest-starring roles on television. She returned to the screen in 1966 with a role in the film \\"Footsteps In the Snow\\", but the role failed to revitalize her career.

The cuts are able to heal themselves in a couple of days. How does this happen? Read on, and you will find out the secret. Every living thing on the earth is made up of cells . Cells grow and make new cells. Most cells are very small and we can't see them with our eyes. Different cells have different uses. Our skin cells are special ones. The cells on the outside of our skin are old dead cells. New skin cells are right under the outside. These are the living skin cells. They work for our bodies. They help protect our bodies and heal cuts. Our bodies make skin cells all the time. As the old cells fall off, new cells grow in the same place. Each person makes about 18 kg of skin cells during his or her life. Outside skin cells fit together closely with no _ between them. When you cut yourself, you can harm your skin cells. A small cut will not be harmful. Your skin will quickly heal itself by making new skin cells. How do skin cells work? First, the cells near the cut get bigger and move into the gap. Next, these bigger cells meet in the middle. They form a new layer of skin cells. Finally, new cells will grow until the gap disappears. In this way, your skin can grow and get well itself. How amazing the small cells are! Next time you have a cut, don't worry about it. Maybe in a few days, you will be surprised to find it healed.

Ignoring refers to the act of not paying attention to or disregarding something. In the context of not replying to a question, it implies that the person might be consciously or unconsciously choosing not to respond or engage with the question posed to them.

The county produced one of the major figures of the revival in Ewan MacColl, but also a local champion in Harry Boardman, who from 1965 onwards probably did more than anyone to popularise and record the folk song of the county.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"Getting mud off your shoes may not be the most exciting task, but it's certainly necessary to maintain cleanliness in your home and the longevity of your footwear. Here are detailed steps on two methods you can use: Method 1: Dry Cleaning 1. Allow the Mud to Dry: It might sound counter-intuitive, but allowing the mud to fully dry can make it easier to remove. Attempting to clean away wet mud may only serve to spread it and deepen the stain. In order to speed up the drying process, place your shoes in a warm, dry spot. However, avoid placing them on a heater or in strong sunlight, as these can damage the material of your shoes. 2. Scrape off the Mud: Once the mud is dry, you can begin the process of removing it. Using an old toothbrush, a nail file or a specialised shoe brush, gently scrape off the mud. Be careful to avoid damaging the shoe material. Always brush in the same direction to prevent unnecessary wear. 3. Clean the Outsoles: Pay extra attention to the outsoles, or the bottom part of your shoes. This area typically gathers the most dirt and debris. Use your tool to scrape the mud from grooves or patterns in the shoes. 4. Wipe with a Dry Cloth: After you've scraped off as much mud as possible, wipe over your shoes with a clean, dry cloth to get rid of any lingering dust. Method 2: Wet Cleaning 1. Preparing the Shoes: If the mud is too wet or if the dry cleaning method is not enough, you may need to follow a wet cleaning method. Before you start this, make sure to remove the laces and insoles if possible to prevent them from getting wet and to clean more thoroughly. 2. Rinse Your Shoes: Using warm water, thoroughly rinse the mud off your shoes. Avoid using high pressure streams as it might damage the material of your shoes. 3. Create a Cleaning Solution: In a bowl, mix warm water with a few drops of mild detergent or dish soap. 4. Clean your Shoes: Dip a soft brush or an old toothbrush into the cleaning solution and start scrubbing the mud spots gently. Ensure not to forget the sides and tops of your shoes. 5. Rinse and Dry: Rinse your shoes again with warm water to remove soap suds and residual mud. Pat them dry using a towel to remove as much moisture as possible, then leave them to air dry in a warm spot avoiding direct sunlight. 6. Conditioning: After thorough drying, apply some conditioner if the shoes material permits, to restore its natural shine and prevent cracking. Remember, if your shoes are made of a special material like suede or leather, they may need a specific shoe cleaning product instead of mild detergent, and more care will be needed when scrubbing. Both methods can effectively remove mud from your shoes. However, consider the type of shoes, the materials made from, and your comfort level with the cleaning process when deciding which method to use. In some cases, scraping off dried mud might be sufficient and convenient. For harder stains or more durable shoes, a wet clean might be more effective. It's key to remember to clean mud off your shoes as soon as possible — the longer it remains, the harder it is to get off."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A:","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the fourth person. Let's set the heights of the four people as follows: 1st person = x 2nd person = x + 2 3rd person = x + 4 4th person = x + 4 + 6 = x + 10 Now, the average height is given as 78 inches. To calculate the sum of the heights, we can use the average formula: Average = (Sum of heights) / (Number of people) Sum of heights = Average * Number of people So, the sum of heights is: Sum of heights = 78 * 4 = 312 inches Now, we want to find the height of the fourth person. Let's first calculate x, which represents the height of the first person: x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 10) = 312 4x + 16 = 312 4x = 296 x = 74 inches Now that we have the height of the first person, we can find the height of the fourth person: 4th person = x + 10 4th person = 74 + 10 4th person = 84 inches So, the fourth person is 84 inches tall."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A:","completion":"The answer to your question \\"Where was the art of carpet weaving first significant?\\" can be found in the given text. The art of carpet weaving was particularly significant in the Ottoman Empire, which was a state that lasted from 1299 to 1922 and spanned across three continents: Europe, Asia, and Africa. The Ottoman Empire was known for its significant contributions to art and culture, including the art of carpet weaving. Carpet weaving originated in the nomadic cultures of central Asia, where the carpets were easily transportable forms of furnishing. The art of carpet weaving then spread to the settled societies of Anatolia, a region in modern day Turkey. Turks began using carpets, rugs, and kilims in various ways, not only as floor coverings but also as wall hangings and doorway insulations. This versatile use of carpets contributed to their immense importance both as decorative furnishings with rich religious and other symbolism, and as practical items for providing insulation and maintaining cleanliness in living spaces. In addition, carpets were commonly donated to mosques, which often accumulated large collections of them. These carpets served not only as beautiful decorations but also as symbols of piety and religious devotion. In summary, carpet weaving first became significant in the Ottoman Empire, with its origins in the nomadic cultures of central Asia. Carpets held immense importance as both decorative furnishings and practical items, and they also played a key role in religious and cultural practices of the society."},{"prompt":"Information: - Gavin MacLeod (born Allan George See; February 28, 1931) is an American film, television and character actor, ship's ambassador, Christian activist and author, whose career spans six decades of television.

Coriolano: eroe senza patria (English Translation: Coriolanus: \\"Hero without a Country\\") is a 1963 Italian historical drama film set in Rome in 493 BC. The plot is an adaptation of the Roman legend about the general who won great victories for the Romans over their enemies the Volscians, but was then forced into exile by his political enemies at home. Can we draw the following conclusion? Hero without a Country was an adaptation of a historic leged","completion":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that the film \\"Coriolano: eroe senza patria\\" (Coriolanus: \\"Hero without a Country\\") is an adaptation of a historic legend. This 1963 Italian historical drama film is based on the Roman legend of Gaius Marcius Coriolanus, a military general who won numerous victories for Rome, particularly against the Volscians. The story of Coriolanus explores themes of patriotism, loyalty, political intrigue, and personal tragedy, making it a compelling and enduring tale that has been adapted in various forms throughout history. The legend of Coriolanus is significant in both history and literature. The story dates back to the early years of the Roman Republic in the 5th century BC and is believed to have been first chronicled by Roman historian Livy in his work \\"Ab Urbe Condita Libri\\" (Books from the Foundation of the City) around 27-25 BC. Furthermore, a more famous adaptation of the legend can be found in William Shakespeare's tragedy \\"Coriolanus,\\" which was written around 1605-1608. \\"Coriolano: eroe senza patria\\" retells the story of Gaius Marcius Coriolanus, focusing on his brilliant military career and eventual fall from grace. The film captures the tensions within the Roman Republic at that time, with a society divided by class struggles between the patricians and the plebeians. Coriolanus, a patrician, is depicted as a capable and successful military leader who exhibits immense bravery during his campaign against the Volscians. However, his eventual exile from Rome arises due to his political adversaries, who exploit his pride and uncompromising nature, driving him to defy the Senate and the people. In his exile, Coriolanus finds refuge with his former enemies, the Volscians, and forms an alliance with their leader Aufidius. Together, they plan to wage war against Rome. However, Coriolanus is ultimately moved by the pleas of his mother, wife, and son, choosing to spare the city from destruction, which results in his assassination by Aufidius. This tragic turn of events reinforces the complexity of the character and the themes of loyalty, betrayal, and sacrifice. In conclusion, \\"Coriolano: eroe senza patria\\" is indeed an adaptation of a historic legend, the Roman story of Gaius Marcius Coriolanus. Although there may be variations in the retelling, this film offers a captivating portrayal of the Republic's early years and the life of a legendary Roman hero whose personal struggles, triumphs, and downfall present a timeless tale that continues to resonate with audiences today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Of Irish descent, Donovan was born in Buffalo, New York, to Anna Letitia \\"Tish\\" Donovan (nee Lennon) and Timothy P. Donovan, both American-born children of Irish immigrants. The Lennons were from Ulster, the Donovans from County Cork. Donovan's grandfather Timothy O'Donovan (Sr.) was from the town of Skibbereen; raised by an uncle who was a parish priest, he married Donovan's grandmother Mary Mahoney, who belonged to a propertied family of substantial means that disapproved of him. While British authorities and the US military and State Department were relatively indifferent to the question of trying war criminals after the war, Donovan was lobbying Roosevelt as early as October 1943 to arrange for such prosecutions. Roosevelt tasked Donovan with looking into the legalities and technicalities, and in the months that followed Donovan collected testimonies about war criminals and related information from a wide range of sources. In addition to seeking justice, Donovan wanted to exact retribution for the torture and killing of OSS agents. When Truman named Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson to serve as chief U.S. counsel in the prosecution of Nazi war criminals, Jackson, discovering that the OSS was the only agency that had seriously explored the issue, invited Donovan to join his trial staff. On May 17, 1945, Donovan flew to Europe to prepare for the prosecutions, and eventually brought 172 OSS officers onto Jackson's team, interviewing Auschwitz survivors, tracking down SS and Gestapo documents, and uncovering other evidence. Donovan, whose idea it was to hold the trials in Nuremberg, also introduced Jackson to useful foreign officials and even released OSS funds to bankroll the prosecution effort. Eventually, Jackson, who had been a political rival of Donovan's in New York State, considered him a \\"godsend\\"; in return for Donovan's help, but also because the OSS had proven \\"vital for the prosecution team,\\" Jackson lobbied Truman in person to approve of Donovan's plans for a permanent postwar intelligence agency. The effort, however, was unsuccessful. On September 20, 1945, Truman signed an executive order abolishing the OSS. In Nuremberg, Donovan interrogated many prisoners, including Hermann Goring, whom he spoke with ten times. But eventually Donovan fell out with Jackson. The latter wanted to indict the entire German High Command, not just men who had personally ordered or committed war crimes; Donovan considered this a violation of American principles of fairness. Donovan, a former prosecutor, also criticized Jackson's lack of skill and experience at putting together a strong case and at courtroom examination and cross-examination. Jackson removed him from the team, and Donovan returned to the U.S., where in January 1946 Truman presented him with the Distinguished Service Medal.

Article: We've used the wind as an energy source for a long time. The Babylonians and Chinese were using wind power to pump water for irrigating crops 4,000 years ago, and sailing boats were around long before that. Wind power was used in the Middle Ages, in Europe, to grind corn, which is where the term \\"windmill\\" comes from. We can use the energy in the wind by building a tall tower, with a large propeller on the top. The wind blows the propellor round, which turns a generator to produce electricity. We tend to build many of these towers together, to make a \\"wind farm\\" and produce more electricity. The more towers, the more wind, and the larger the propellors, the more electricity we can make. It's only worth building wind farms in places that have strong, steady winds, although boats and caravans increasingly have small wind generators to help keep their batteries charged. The best places for wind farms are in coastal areas, at the tops of rounded hills, open plains and gaps in mountains - places where the wind is strong and reliable. Some are offshore. To be worthwhile, you need an average wind speed of around 25 km/h. Most wind farms in the UK are in Cornwall or Wales. Isolated places such as farms may have their own wind generators. In California, several \\"wind farms\\" supply electricity to homes around Los Angeles. The propellors are large, to obtain energy from the largest possible volume of air. The blades can be angled to cope with varying wind speeds. Some designs use vertical turbines , which don't need to be turned to face the wind. The towers are tall, to get the propellors as high as possible, up to where the wind is stronger. This means that the land beneath can still be used for farming. Question: What can be a suitable title for the passage? - Where to build a wind farm. - ABC of the using of wind energy. - How to make best use of wind. - Wind energy is the best energy.

Article: When US student Olivia Priedeman, 17, woke up one morning, she thought she had had a dream about making plans with a friend. But it wasn't a dream. Her phone showed that during the night, Priedeman had read a text message from her friend. She did it while she was fast asleep. Reading and sending text messages while asleep--called \\"sleep texting\\"--is an unusual sleep behaviour, similar to sleepwalking. It's also a growing concern among doctors: young people can't live without their cell phones. One in three teenagers sends more than 100 text messages a day, according to the Pew Internet & American Life Project. And at least four out of five teenagers said they sleep with their phone on or near their bed. Elizabeth Dowdell, a professor at Villanova University in Pennsylvania, has studied sleeping texting. She said that having a phone nearby all night is a big part of the problem. Andrew Stiehm, a sleep medicine expert with Allina Health in Minnesota, agrees. It's possible for the part of the brain that controls motor skills to wake up, while the part of the brain that controls memory and judgment may be still asleep. That's why some people can perform basic movements ---such as walking, talking, texting or even driving--while they're sleeping. Some of Dowdell's students said that they're disturbed by their nighttime texting behavior. But because sleep texting is _ , it's a difficult habit to break. Dowdell said she knows of some students who wear socks on their hands to keep themselves from texting. Marjorie Hogan, a doctor at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, suggests keeping all electronic devices outside the bedroom at certain times.

Background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out.

Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose only remaining son died in 840? , can you please find it? Charlemagne planned to continue the Frankish tradition of dividing his kingdom between all his heirs, but was unable to do so as only one son, Louis the Pious (r. 814–840), was still alive by 813. Just before Charlemagne died in 814, he crowned Louis as his successor. Louis's reign of 26 years was marked by numerous divisions of the empire among his sons and, after 829, civil wars between various alliances of father and sons over the control of various parts of the empire. Eventually, Louis recognised his eldest son Lothair I (d. 855) as emperor and gave him Italy. Louis divided the rest of the empire between Lothair and Charles the Bald (d. 877), his youngest son. Lothair took East Francia, comprising both banks of the Rhine and eastwards, leaving Charles West Francia with the empire to the west of the Rhineland and the Alps. Louis the German (d. 876), the middle child, who had been rebellious to the last, was allowed to keep Bavaria under the suzerainty of his elder brother. The division was disputed. Pepin II of Aquitaine (d. after 864), the emperor's grandson, rebelled in a contest for Aquitaine, while Louis the German tried to annex all of East Francia. Louis the Pious died in 840, with the empire still in chaos.A three-year civil war followed his death. By the Treaty of Verdun (843), a kingdom between the Rhine and Rhone rivers was created for Lothair to go with his lands in Italy, and his imperial title was recognised. Louis the German was in control of Bavaria and the eastern lands in modern-day Germany. Charles the Bald received the western Frankish lands, comprising most of modern-day France. Charlemagne's grandsons and great-grandsons divided their kingdoms between their descendants, eventually causing all internal cohesion to be lost. In 987 the Carolingian dynasty was replaced in the western lands, with the crowning of Hugh Capet (r. 987–996) as king. In the eastern lands the dynasty had died out earlier, in 911, with the death of Louis the Child, and the selection of the unrelated Conrad I (r....

Read this and answer the question Many of the crucial events of the American Revolution—the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party, Paul Revere's midnight ride, the battles of Lexington and Concord and Bunker Hill, the Siege of Boston, and many others—occurred in or near Boston. After the Revolution, Boston's long seafaring tradition helped make it one of the world's wealthiest international ports, with rum, fish, salt, and tobacco being particularly important. What long held tradition helped make Boston a wealthy port?","completion":"Boston's long seafaring tradition played a significant role in making it a wealthy international port. This maritime culture was deeply ingrained in the city's history and daily life, shaped by its advantageous geographical location along the Atlantic coast and numerous natural harbors. As a thriving seaport and economic hub, Boston was well-positioned to trade various goods, providing it with substantial economic benefits. The seafaring tradition in Boston involved a myriad of activities, including fishing, shipbuilding, sailing, and international trade. These activities, in turn, laid the groundwork for a flourishing maritime network with myriad connections to various international markets, including Europe, the West Indies, and Asia. Boston's skilled boat makers, navigators, and ships facilitated the establishment of numerous trade routes that spanned the globe, thus allowing the city to engage in extensive commerce. Among the various goods traded in the port of Boston, rum, fish, salt, and tobacco were particularly important. The city's abundant fisheries sustained a robust fish trade, while its traders frequently imported molasses from the Caribbean and converted it into rum. Boston's rum distilleries, in turn, became an essential part of the regional economy, producing large quantities of the high-quality spirit for both domestic consumption and export. At the same time, salt, an essential commodity for food preservation, was vital for the fish trade and was also imported to supply the growing demand. Furthermore, the tobacco trade proved lucrative for Boston's merchants and traders. New England merchants imported tobacco from the Southern Colonies and the Caribbean and then re-exported it to Europe and Asia. In doing so, they capitalized on the high international demand for tobacco products and bolstered the city's maritime commercial efforts substantially. In conclusion, Boston's long seafaring tradition, coupled with its advantageous geographical setting and skilled maritime workforce, significantly contributed to making the city a wealthy international port. The trade in valuable goods such as rum, fish, salt, and tobacco boosted the local economy and established Boston as a vital hub of commerce and maritime activity during the American Revolution era and beyond."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Winslow has bought a ranch sight unseen and looks forward to making his fortune. McQueen arrives at the ghost town of Todos Santos, where Reno Blake and Duke Harris are waiting for him, along with Reno's part-Indian girlfriend, Colorado Carson. After looking them over (and not liking what he sees), he heads off to a nearby town to meet an ailing Rickard, who asks McQueen to pull off one last big train robbery so they can both retire.

Zakariya Essabar, a Moroccan citizen, moved to Germany in February 1997 and to Hamburg in 1998, where he studied medical technology. Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM. Going to Afghanistan The available evidence indicates that in 1999, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah decided to fight in Chechnya against the Russians.

Sure there’s the money, the adulation, and the eventual nude photo leaks, but what you really want are the sandwiches. You may see someone on television, but that doesn’t make them famous. The real sign of a person “making it” and being a bonafide Hollywood celeb, is when a restaurant reaches down from on high and knights him or her with their very own concoction of meat and bread (or for our vegan friends, bread and sprouts). It doesn’t get better than having an eponymous sandwich. Grab the mayonnaise and check out this menu of sandwiches named after famous people. Woody Allen, Carmelo Anthony, Freddie Mercury: what do these three people have in common? You can order all three of them at a restaurant, cut them half, and shove them in your mouth. Sort of. They all have sandwiches named after them, which may or may not envelop their particular sensibilities as artists, or sports heroes. On this list of sandwiches named after famous people, we’ve torn apart menus from across the world and put them here for you to fantasize about (people fantasize about eating sandwiches, right?). Which celebrity sandwiches sound the best? Which seem like gratuitous movie tie-ins? And which sandwiches just sound gross and/or flat-out boring? Vote on which sando you want to chomp down on the most, whether it’s an overgrown roast beef or a PB&J on a bagel. And if your favorite local hot spot has sandwich named after Joseph Gordon Levitt we want to hear about it in the comments! 2 + - 17 5 Donnie's Choice Photo: uploaded by Jacob Shelton Ugh, Ugh, Wahlburgers . What an awful television show based around burgers that may or may not be all that good.

If The Byzantine Empire had powerful and well-fortified cities, but the countryside and the outlying islands were ravaged by waves of invaders., can we conclude that \\"The Byzantine Empire was not concerned about the areas outside of the cities.\\"?","completion":"No, we cannot simply conclude that \\"The Byzantine Empire was not concerned about the areas outside of the cities.\\" The situation in the Byzantine Empire was far more complex, and numerous factors influenced the empire's ability to protect and maintain control over its territories. To better understand the situation, let's delve into the factors that contributed to the Byzantine Empire's vulnerability and the steps it took to protect its domains. 1. Geographical and political context: The Byzantine Empire, which was the eastern continuation of the Roman Empire, spanned a vast area over many centuries and was surrounded by powerful and potentially hostile neighbors. Due to its vast territory, it was not always possible for the empire to maintain an equal level of protection and control everywhere, especially in areas far from the major urban centers. 2. Defensive strategies and resources: The Byzantine Empire was more likely to prioritize the defense and fortification of its major urban centers, which were the political, economic, and religious hubs. These cities, such as Constantinople, were usually better equipped to resist invasions due to their strong fortifications and access to more significant military forces. Additionally, the empire's resources were often finite, so the emperor and his advisors had to make strategic choices about where to allocate those resources based on various factors such as threat levels, economic value, and internal politics. 3. Military and naval capabilities: The Byzantine Empire had an impressive military machine, with a strong focus on infantry and the development of the famous \\"Byzantine diplomacy\\" in foreign affairs. Nonetheless, its naval capabilities might not have been as formidable, which could have left its islands and coastal areas more vulnerable to enemy attacks by sea. 4. External threats and dynamics: Throughout its history, the Byzantine Empire faced numerous external threats and waves of invasion. Barbarian invasions, such as those by the Goths, Huns, and Avars, as well as the Arab and later Turkish invasions, all exerted pressure on the empire. It is worth noting that some regions were under more significant threat than others. In those scenarios, the empire might have decided to prioritize its efforts towards the defense of vital areas or cities of particular strategic importance, leaving parts of the countryside or outlying islands potentially more vulnerable. 5. Internal politics and administration: The Byzantine Empire had a complex political and administrative system, characterized by regional differences, power struggles, and bureaucratic challenges. These factors could have influenced the empire's ability to effectively manage and protect all of its territories, possibly leading to some areas being more exposed to external threats. 6. Local communities and initiatives: The Byzantine Empire was composed of numerous local communities and ethnic groups. In some cases, while the central imperial government might have been unable to provide comprehensive protection and support to outlying areas, local communities could have taken responsibility for organizing their defense or seeking protection from nearby powers. However, this was not always possible or effective. In conclusion, while it is true that the Byzantine Empire's cities were generally better fortified and protected than its countryside and outlying islands, this does not necessarily indicate a lack of concern for these areas. Instead, their vulnerability resulted from a combination of geographical, political, economic, military, and social factors that influenced the empire's capacity and strategy for defending all of its territories. The Byzantine Empire faced ongoing challenges throughout its existence, and at times, it might have been forced to make pragmatic and strategic choices prioritizing the security of some regions over others."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Qantas Airways has raised its fuel surcharge on domestic and international tickets by 4 and 7, respectively, because of the high price of oil. What best summarizes the content of the above article?","completion":"The provided article discusses an increase in the fuel surcharge implemented by Qantas Airways due to the rising cost of oil. Qantas Airways is compelled to make an adjustment to its pricing structure to accommodate this change in operational costs. Specifically, it is imposing a 4 increase on fuel surcharge for domestic tickets and a 7 increase for international tickets. The nature of the fuel surcharge increase differentiates based on the type of flight - domestic or international, demonstrating how the broader economic factors, like oil prices, can have tangible impacts on various aspects of airline operations and strategies, such as pricing. To manage the additional expenditure related to high oil prices, the airline is passing a part of it to the customers through the increased fuel surcharge. The decision is likely to affect the airline's customer base, as it alters the final price that the passengers have to pay. It indicates the volatility of the aviation industry, where costs can fluctuate depending on external economic circumstances.

Question: Information: - In Greek mythology, Eurotas was a king of Laconia, the son of King Myles and grandson of Lelex, eponymous ancestor of the Leleges. He had no male heir, but he did have a daughter Sparta and wife Clete. Eurotas bequeathed the kingdom to Lacedaemon, the son of Taygete, after whom Mount Taygetus is named, and Zeus, according to Pausanias. Lacedaemon married Sparta and renamed the state after his wife. - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. - Sparta (Doric Greek: ; Attic Greek: ) was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece. In antiquity the city-state was known as Lacedaemon, while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia, in south-eastern Peloponnese. Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece. - A city-state is a sovereign state that consists of a city and its dependent territories. Historically, this included cities such as Rome, Athens, Carthage, and the Italian city-states during the Renaissancebut today only a handful of sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which are city-states. A great deal of consensus exists that the term properly applies to Singapore, Monaco, and Vatican City. - Eurycrates ( Greek : Eurykrates ) was a king of the Greek city - state of Sparta , one of the Agiad ( also spelled Agiade ) kings , who was preceded by his father Polydorus and followed by his son Anaxander . He ruled from 665 to 640 BC. - Vatican City , officially Vatican City State or the State of Vatican City, is a walled enclave within the city of Rome. With an area of approximately 44 hectares (110 acres), and a population of 842, it is the smallest State in the world by both area and population, but formally it is not sovereign, sovereignty being held by the Holy See, the only entity of public international law that has diplomatic relations with almost every country in the world. - Anaxander or Anaxandros was the 12th Agiad dynasty King of Sparta (ruled c. 640-615 BC). - Singapore, officially the Republic of Singapore, and often referred to as the \\"Lion City\\" or the \\"Little Red Dot\\", is a sovereign city-state in Southeast Asia, and the world's only island city-state. It lies one degree (137 km) north of the equator, south of the southernmost tip of continental Asia and peninsular Malaysia, with Indonesia's Riau Islands to the south. Singapore's territory consists of a diamond-shaped main island along with 62 other islets. Since independence, extensive land reclamation has increased its total size by 23% (130 km), and its greening policy has covered the densely populated island with tropical flora, parks and gardens. - Monaco, officially the Principality of Monaco, is a sovereign city-state and microstate, located on the French Riviera in Western Europe. France borders the country on three sides while the other side borders the Mediterranean Sea. Monaco has an area of and a population of about 37,800; it is the second smallest and the most densely populated country in the world. Monaco has a land border of , a coastline of , and a width that varies between . The highest point in the country is a narrow pathway named Chemin des Révoires on the slopes of Mont Agel, in the Les Révoires \\"Ward\\", which is above sea level. Monaco's most populous \\"Quartier\\" is Monte Carlo and the most populous \\"Ward\\" is Larvotto/Bas Moulins. Through land reclamation, Monaco's land mass has expanded by twenty percent. Monaco is known as a playground for the rich and famous, due to its tax laws. In 2014, it was noted about 30% of the population was made up of millionaires, more than in Zürich or Geneva. - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. What is the relationship between 'eurycrates' and 'king of sparta'? Answer:","completion":"Eurycrates was a king of Sparta, specifically belonging to the Agiad dynasty. The kings of Sparta were hereditary rulers who held significant power and authority in ancient Greek city-state. Sparta was known for its dominant military land-power in ancient Greece and was a prominent city-state during its prime time. Eurycrates was the son of Polydorus and ruled Sparta from 665 to 640 BC. He was one of the Agiad kings, named after the Agiad dynasty, which was one of the two ruling dynasties in Sparta. The other dynasty was the Eurypontid dynasty. These two ruling families maintained a dual kingship system in Sparta, where power and responsibilities were shared between the kings from both dynasties. The relationship between Eurycrates and 'king of Sparta' is that Eurycrates served as one of the kings of Sparta during his reign, exercising power over the city-state and making critical decisions related to governance and the military. As a ruler affiliated with the Agiad dynasty, he contributed to the legacy and influence of ancient Sparta throughout the region."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Although many civilians had used them as such during the First World War, the government in 1939 refused to allow the stations to be used as shelters so as not to interfere with commuter and troop travel, and the fears that occupants might refuse to leave. Underground officials were ordered to lock station entrances during raids; but by the second week of heavy bombing the government relented and ordered the stations to be opened.

The school nurse informed him that during a routine check, they found lice in his daughter's hair. Despite taking all the necessary precautions at home, Nick couldn't believe that it had still happened. Feeling helpless, he immediately called his close friend, Adam, whose child also attended the same school. Fortunately, Adam's child did not have any lice, and he felt relieved. Nevertheless, as a concerned parent and friend, he offered to help Nick and shared some tips on how to manage and treat the infestation. Grateful for the support, Nick decided that it was best to act swiftly. Therefore, he picked up an over-the-counter lice treatment solution on his way back home. To make sure the treatment was effective, he followed the instructions carefully, covered his daughter's hair with the solution, and allowed it to sit for the recommended time. After the waiting period, Nick washed out the solution and used a fine-toothed lice comb to remove the dead lice and nits. He made sure to cover each section of the hair thoroughly, not wanting to miss a single lice or nit. With his daughter's comfort in mind, he gently combed her hair, taking breaks when needed. To prevent future infestations, Nick decided to educate his daughter about the importance of good hygiene practices, including not sharing personal items like combs, hats, or headphones. He also regularly checked her hair for any signs of lice and kept in touch with the school to monitor the situation. Adam's support and helpful advice were a great source of comfort to Nick during this trying time.

Solve 7*w + 54 = 12 for w.. What is the answer??","completion":"To solve the equation 7*w + 54 = 12 for w, let's follow several steps. Step 1: Isolate the term with w on one side of the equation. 7*w + 54 = 12 To do this, we should first subtract 54 from both sides of the equation. Subtracting 54 will help isolate the term with w (7*w). 7*w + 54 - 54 = 12 - 54 This simplifies to: 7*w = -42 Step 2: Solve for w. Now that the term with w (7*w) is isolated on one side of the equation, we need to divide both sides by 7 to solve for w. (7*w) / 7 = -42 / 7 7 and w are now separated: w = -6 The solution for the equation 7*w + 54 = 12 is w = -6."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The United Nations is an international organization founded in 1945 after World War II to promote peace, security, and cooperation among member countries and to address various global challenges, including economic, social, humanitarian, and environmental issues. Boutros Boutros-Ghali served as the sixth Secretary-General of the United Nations from January 1, 1992, to December 31, 1996. He was an Egyptian diplomat and politician with a background in international law and relations. Before assuming his role at the UN, Boutros-Ghali had held several positions in the Egyptian government, including Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Deputy Prime Minister for International Cooperation Affairs. As Secretary-General, he focused on improving the UN's peacekeeping operations and its role in conflict prevention and resolution. Boutros-Ghali is also known for initiating the \\"Agenda for Peace,\\" a report which outlined the UN's vision and role in maintaining international peace and security. Kofi Annan, from Ghana, succeeded Boutros Boutros-Ghali as the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations. He served two terms from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2006. Kofi Annan was the first person from sub-Saharan Africa to hold the position and the first to emerge from within the ranks of the UN staff. Prior to his appointment as Secretary-General, Annan had held various roles at the UN, including Assistant Secretary-General for Program Planning and Coordination, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management, and Deputy to the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). During Annan's tenure, he focused on increasing the UN's efforts to address global challenges such as poverty, inequality, and infectious diseases, particularly the HIV/AIDS epidemic. He also made efforts to strengthen the UN's peacekeeping, conflict resolution, and humanitarian missions. Kofi Annan played a central role in the development and adoption of the Millennium Development Goals, which aimed to significantly improve the socioeconomic conditions of the world's poorest regions by 2015. In 2001, Kofi Annan, along with the United Nations itself, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their work promoting peace, human rights, and the fight against global poverty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jason drove in a car to their workplace while Kyle biked, so","completion":"they often took different routes to reach the same destination. Jason, being constantly on the move, preferred the convenience of a car. His jet black SUV, a shining token of his power and status, blended seamlessly into the river of vehicles that streamed down the city’s main roads every day. On the other hand, Kyle had earned the title of the office’s “Eco-warrior\\" due to his steadfast commitment to his environment-friendly practices such as biking to work. While Jason opted for high-speed highways and busy city streets, Kyle would pedal his way across the city's network of cycle paths and parkways. Jason enjoyed the comfortable routine of sitting behind the wheel of his car, listening to the morning news on the radio, while the world outside whizzed passed him. His air-conditioned car felt like a calm island amidst the storm of honks and brakes that promised the arrival of yet another hectic day. Kyle, on the contrary, chose to experience each day in its raw form. With the wind in his hair and the dew-kissed morning air on his face, Kyle grooved to the rhythm of the city. He passed by the small bakery, letting the smell of freshly baked bread and croissants fill his senses. He nodded at the familiar faces, usually fellow regular cyclists or early morning joggers. Each traffic signal was a chance to stop, not a delay, and admire the surrounding nature and burgeoning morning life around. Despite their differences in transportation methods, the inherent reason behind each one’s choice was starkly clear: Jason preferred his fast-paced yet comfortable life while Kyle chose a slower-paced, eco-friendly lifestyle. The end point was the same for both – their workplace – but the journey, seen from their different perspectives, took on its character and significance. This embodied the basic truth of life that each one of us marches to the beat of our own drum, even when marching towards the same goal. So, while Jason drove in his car and Kyle biked to work, their personal preferences shaped their perceptions of the journey, adding a unique flavor to each of their daily commuting experiences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In order to get ready for it, this summer, many Beijing middle school students had a different kind of vacation. Instead of hanging out with friends or traveling, they trained hard for the 60th birthday of China this year. Students trained from 7:30 am to around 10:00 am or from 4 pm to 6:30 pm, because it was very hot this summer. They wore white hats, T-shirts and blue trousers. The hats and T-shirts were printed with a red logo, the number \\"60\\". The first week of training was PE. Students practiced standing and squatting. Then they moved on to practice the group show. When we watched the parade on TV we saw them making colorful pictures. What did the students think of their unusual summer? \\"Sometimes we find it a bit tiring.\\" said Lu Wenqi, 13. \\"But most of us think it's a great _ to take part in such an important show.\\" Li Hui, 15, thought the same as Lu. She said her classmates were hardly late for training. \\"It's a wonderful chance for us,\\" said Li. \\"When my parents were in college, they also took part in a national day parade.

What is the title of this article: The National Conference of State Legislatures held in Washington D.C. stated in a 2014 overview that many supporters for affirmative action argue that policies stemming from affirmative action help to open doors for historically excluded groups in workplace settings and higher education. Workplace diversity has become a business management concept in which employers actively seek to promote an inclusive workplace. By valuing diversity, employers have the capacity to create an environment in which there is a culture of respect for individual differences as well as the ability to draw in talent and ideas from all segments of the population. By creating this diverse workforce, these employers and companies gain a competitive advantage in an increasingly global economy. According to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, many private sector employers have concluded that a diverse workforce makes a \\"company stronger, more profitable, and a better place to work.\\" Therefore, these diversity promoting policies are implemented for competitive reasons rather than as a response to discrimination, but have shown the value in having diversity.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Casey had robbed a bank and he remained at large and was not even seen. Given the question \\"How would you describe Casey?\\", is \\"stealthy\\" a valid answer? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, in the context of Casey's behavior during and after the bank robbery, describing him as \\"stealthy\\" would be a valid answer. The term \\"stealthy\\" refers to someone who can move or operate in a secretive or furtive manner, avoiding notice and detection. To further elaborate on the scenario, Casey successfully managed to rob the bank without being caught in the act and has effectively evaded the authorities ever since. His ability to remain unseen and at large is a testament to his stealth. He must have displayed a great deal of skill, planning, and precision in order to pull off such a heist without leaving any traces. This level of stealth could involve various tactics and methods that Casey has employed. For instance, he may have utilized disguises or alternate identities to help him blend into the crowd or stay undetected in various locations. Furthermore, he might also have hacked into security systems, created diversions or planned escape routes to avoid being apprehended by the police or the bank's security guards. Additionally, Casey might have a network of people aiding him in his evasion of law enforcement, or he could be a lone operator who is resourceful, cunning, and adaptive. Such skillful maneuvers and tactics would further support the claim that Casey is a stealthy individual. Furthermore, his ability to continue staying off the radar suggests that Casey's stealthy nature is not a one-time occurrence. He must consistently be employing tactics to remain undetected, which in turn makes him successful at remaining at large. In conclusion, given the context of Casey's actions during and after the bank robbery and his ability to avoid capture, describing him as \\"stealthy\\" is indeed a valid characterization of his behavior and abilities. This label aptly captures the essence of his secretive, covert actions while also highlighting how he has managed to outsmart and evade the authorities so far."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

My Casio is easy to read for updates on the time, day, date, etc. It is attractive, and appears to be a lot more expensive than it is. However, 2 problems have raised their ugly heads; buckle and tides. The buckle on the watchband insists on rubbing, and cutting it's way into my wrist. I wear a small bandaid as a buffer zone, but how many years must I invest in bandaids? The tides are a neat feature for fishermen, and I qualify. However, even with my college education, I've been unable to adjust the tides feature. It's flashing.....but....for where....and what time?????In any case, I refuse to return it...Its other features outweigh the bloody discomfort and the way-out tides gizmo.Did I mention there's no need for batteries?? Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","completion":"After analyzing the given product review, I would say that the review depicts the product in a mostly unflattering light due to the following points: 1. The reviewer states that they have faced two problems with the watch - the buckle and the tides feature. 2. The buckle appears to be causing physical discomfort to the reviewer, as it rubs and cuts into their wrist. 3. The tides feature, despite being a neat and appealing addition for fishermen, seems challenging to adjust, even for someone with a college education. 4. The reviewer acknowledges the watch's other features (ease of reading the time, day, date, and attractive appearance) but these features do not seem to fully outweigh the negative aspects they mentioned. Despite mentioning the watch's positive attributes, such as an attractive appearance and no need for batteries, the fact that the reviewer references \\"bloody discomfort\\" and an ineffective feature (tides) gives the review a predominantly unflattering tone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. Step 1: For each row in Customer_Orders table, find corresponding rows in Customers table and in Order_Items table. Step 2: find the summation of order_quantity in the results of step 1 whose date_became_customer less than 2018-03-17 07:13:53 A:","completion":"SELECT SUM(Order_Items.order_quantity) FROM Customer_Orders JOIN Customers ON Customer_Orders.customer_id = Customers.id JOIN Order_Items ON Customer_Orders.id = Order_Items.customer_order_id WHERE Customers.date_became_customer < '2018-03-17 07:13:53';"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Evaluate each choice - Oxygen intake: While an increased oxygen intake can positively impact your cognitive abilities, solely breathing fresh air doesn't guarantee an improved decision-making capacity. - New lungs: This option is irrelevant, as breathing fresh air doesn't provide us with new lungs or significant lung function improvements to affect our decision-making capacities. - Think more clearly: Breathing fresh air can help our brains function better and improve focus, thus allowing us to think more clearly during decision-making. - Feeling refreshed: Although feeling refreshed can positively impact our mood, this option doesn't specifically address the mechanics of how fresh air affects the decision-making process. - Silence: Breathing fresh air might help us find a quieter environment, but there's no guarantee that this would always be the case, and silence isn't the direct result of fresh air.

Input: He accepted the throne in a televised broadcast following an invitation from parliament, formalising his accession. King Bhumibol, the world's longest-reigning monarch, died on 13 October. The late king was widely seen as a pillar of stability during seven decades of political turmoil in Thailand. The crown prince had been expected to become the next king the day after his father's death, but Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha at the time said that he had asked to delay the official proclamation so he could mourn. Instead, the crown prince was anointed in a special ceremony 50 days after the death of the late Thai king. He becomes King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, the 10th monarch of the Chakri dynasty, but will also be known as Rama X. \\"I would like to accept in order to fulfil his majesty's wishes and for the benefit of all Thais,'' he said in a televised statement. The broadcast showed one official shuffling on his knees to hand a microphone to the new king in the ceremony at the palace in Bangkok. Mr Prayuth, who was among top government figures attending, said the new king would become the \\"heart and soul\\" of the nation. Maha Vajiralongkorn was given the title of crown prince, making him the official heir, in 1972. He is yet to enjoy the same level of popularity as his father, and spends much of his time abroad. His accession to the throne ends a period of uncertainty during which Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda, a 96-year-old former prime minister, has been serving as regent. Thailand's monarchy is protected from criticism by tough lese-majeste laws, which restrict media discussion about the royal family's role, including in the international press. Most ordinary Thais know only a few details about who the crown prince is and how he lives his life. In recent years he has tried to improve his profile - important because the king is traditionally seen as a guiding force in Thai politics, which is highly polarised. His coronation will not happen until after King Bhumibol's cremation, expected next year. Bhumibol's own coronation took place four years after his brother King Ananda Mahidol died of gunshot wounds in mysterious circumstances. Output:","completion":"Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn has become King Rama X of Thailand, succeeding his father King Bhumibol, in a formal accession ceremony 50 days after the late king's death, further solidifying the monarchy's role as a stabilizing force in Thai politics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Petty Officer First Class Kristian Saucier, 29, is set to be sentenced Friday on a single felony charge of retaining national defense information without permission. In May, Saucier pleaded guilty in federal court in Bridgeport, Conn., admitting that while working on the U.S.S. Alexandria in 2009 he took and kept six photos showing parts of the sub's propulsion system he knew to be classified. The defense and prosecutors agree that sentencing guidelines in the case call for a prison term of 63 to 78 months, but defense attorney Derrick Hogan cited the treatment of Clinton as he argued in a filing last week that Saucier should get probation instead. \\"Democratic Presidential Candidate and former Secretary of State Hilary [sic] Clinton...has come under scrutiny for engaging in acts similar to Mr. Saucier,\\" Hogan wrote. He noted that FBI Director James Comey said 110 emails in 52 email chains in Clinton's account contained information deemed classified at the time, including eight chains with \\"top secret\\" information and 36 with \\"secret\\" information. \\"In our case, Mr. Saucier possessed six (6) photographs classified as 'confidential/restricted,' far less than Clinton's 110 emails,\\" Hogan wrote. \\"It will be unjust and unfair for Mr. Saucier to receive any sentence other than probation for a crime those more powerful than him will likely avoid.\\" There are distinctions between the cases. Saucier admitted as part of a plea bargain that he \\"knew from his training and his specialized work upon the submarine\\" that the photos contained classified information and he wasn't authorized to take them. He also admitted that after being confronted by law enforcement in 2012 he destroyed a laptop, camera and memory card. Clinton has said she didn't know any information on her server was classified, although Comey has said anyone in Clinton's position \\"should have known that an unclassified system was no place\\" for some of the subjects being discussed. While Clinton had tens of thousands of emails erased from her system in 2014, she did so with the advice of lawyers and before the FBI investigation was underway. Saucier's drive for leniency may ultimately benefit more from the treatment of some of his fellow submates than from the handling of cases involving Clinton or other prominent officials. Hogan cites incidents involving two other Navy sailors on the Alexandria who were caught taking photos in classified spaces on the vessel. One received a one rank reduction and was docked 560 in pay. The other was just docked 560 in pay. Both cases were handled through a Captain's Mast hearing used for relatively minor cases. Letters submitted on Saucier's behalf attempt to shift some of the blame to the Navy, both over the command climate for junior sailors on the Alexandria and lax policies in that era towards electronics on subs. \\"We worked them too hard, we didn't give them as much time off as we should have, we didn't treat them with the dignity and respect that they deserved, and we never let off. Ever,\\" wrote retired Chief Machinists Mate Scott Nelson, who worked with Saucier on the Alexandria. \\"The men were showing signs of cracking left and right...The human pieces of the machine were being pushed past their limits.\\" \\"I believe that we, the leadership own a significant portion of the blame for creating the environment where these men thought this was a good idea,\\" Nelson added. Another former colleague of Saucier's, Ryan Meldrum, called Saucier a \\"war hero\\" and wrote that the case should have been handled in the Navy by bumping the sailor down a rank. \\"I am sorry to see that this is taking up time in Federal District Court, but I pray that this can be disposed of so as to not dissuade other patriots such as Kris from serving our great country,\\" said Meldrum, who recent graduated from Pace University law school. \\"Kris does not deserve what he is going through....If you look at the Navy records you will see countless mishandling classified material cases where many people are still in the Navy and many more where people were asked to get out,\\" added Mark Robb, another former submate who said he was pushed out of the Navy over a similar incident in 2014. Some submitting letters on Saucier's behalf attribute the relatively tough treatment he seems to be receiving to \\"serious\\" allegations his ex-wife leveled at him early in the investigation. Saucier's defense disputes a probation officer's conclusion that the sailor intended to share some of the photos with \\"foreign agencies,\\" an allegation that prosecutors have not made publicly. Still, court records show the probation officer is recommending Saucier receive less than the five-year, three-month sentence called for by federal guidelines. The precise recommendations from the probation official and prosecutors have not been made public. Saucier remains in the Navy, but expects to be dismissed from the service with an \\"other than honorable\\" discharge, the defense filing said.

Lawyers for 29-year-old Kristian Saucier told a federal court in Connecticut on Friday that the Justice Department’s decision not to press charges against Clinton, despite the existence of classified material on more than 100 messages on her server, was one of several cases that should compel a reduced sentence. ADVERTISEMENT “Most recently, Democratic Presidential Candidate and former Secretary of State Hilary [sic] Clinton ... has come under scrutiny for engaging in acts similar to Mr. Saucier,” his legal team claimed The FBI has criticized Clinton’s private setup, attorney Derrick Hogan noted, “however, the FBI recently recommended Mrs. Clinton not be brought up on any charges as she lacked ‘intent.’” Saucier pleaded guilty to possessing just six sensitive photographs, Hogan added, “far less than Clinton’s 110 emails.” “Further, Mr. Saucier pled guilty to [a legal prohibition] which does not require intent. “Wherefore, it will be unjust and unfair for Mr. Saucier to receive any sentence other than probation for a crime those more powerful than him will likely avoid.” Clinton’s case is listed as just one of several in which officials were either not charged or given relatively light sentences for their crimes. Circumstances surrounding the former secretary of State were also different than those for Saucier, who acknowledged that he was aware that the pictures he took were classified. Clinton has maintained that she did not believe any of the information she receive via email ought to have been protected. But the citation is likely to inflame critics of the Democratic presidential nominee, who they warn exposed a two-tiered process of justice after federal prosecutors announced they would not indict her or her senior aides. “We believe that you have set a precedent, and it is a dangerous one,” House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz Jason ChaffetzDem demands documents from TSA after scathing security report Chaffetz replacement sworn in as House member Democrats expand House map after election victories MORE (R-Utah) scolded FBI Director James Comey during a hearing in July. Before a federal court in May, Saucier admitted he took cellphone photos of sensitive portions of a submarine in 2009. The photos were not discovered until his cellphone was found in a dumpster three years later. He is set to be sentenced on Friday. Federal sentencing guidelines suggest he be put in prison for up to 6.5 years, but Saucier’s attorneys are claiming he should instead be given probation. “Mr. Saucier has new responsibilities as a father, husband and grandfather, and has grown out of the mistakes he made in his early twenties,” his legal team claimed on Friday. “Therefore, at 29 years old, any sentence of confinement will be greater than necessary. Details of the filing were previously reported by Politico. |||||Summary:","completion":"A Navy sailor in the US, Kristian Saucier, who could face years in prison for taking photographs of classified areas of a nuclear submarine, is citing Hilary Clinton's email scandal in an attempt to avoid his punishment.

Information: - A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story. - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - Prose is a form of language that exhibits a grammatical structure and a natural flow of speech, rather than a rhythmic structure as in traditional poetry. Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph. - \`\` Stellar Ships '' or \`\` Star Ships '' ( Russian name \`\` Zvezdnye Korabli '' , Russian : ) is a short story by the Soviet writer and paleontologist Ivan Yefremov written in 1944 and first published in 1948 in the USSR . This story is about the discovery of an ancient dinosaur bone with a mysterious bullet hole ( or \`\` blaster hole '' ) and an alien skull and his portrait nearby . This acts as a starting point and a cover story to the philosophical idea of plurality of the mind cradles in the Universe , similarity of planet evolution paths , and similarity of physiology and psychology . Efremov states the final perspective for all civilisations is The Great Circle , which will unite them all . - An anecdote is a brief, revealing account of an individual person or an incident. Often humorous, anecdotes differ from jokes because their primary purpose is not simply to provoke laughter, but to reveal a truth more general than the brief tale itself, such as to characterize a person by delineating a specific quirk or trait, to communicate an abstract idea about a person, place, or thing through the concrete details of a short narrative. An anecdote is \\"a story with a point.\\" - A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques. - Ivan Antonovich (real patronymic Antipovich) Yefremov (April 22, 1908 October 5, 1972), last name sometimes spelled Efremov, was a Soviet paleontologist, science fiction author and social thinker. He originated taphonomy, the study of fossilization patterns. - Storytelling is the social and cultural activity of sharing stories, often with improvisation, theatrics, or embellishment. Stories or narratives have been shared in every culture as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation and instilling moral values. Crucial elements of stories and storytelling include plot, characters and narrative point of view. The term 'storytelling' is used in a narrow sense to refer specifically to oral storytelling and also in a looser sense to refer to techniques used in other media to unfold or disclose the narrative of a story.

Question: \\"A loop in a chain is called a?\\" Context: \\"In the 1970s, computer engineers at research institutions throughout the United States began to link their computers together using telecommunications technology. The effort was funded by ARPA (now DARPA), and the computer network that resulted was called the ARPANET. The technologies that made the Arpanet possible spread and evolved.\\" Answer:","completion":"The term you might be looking for is a \\"link.\\" However, it doesn't directly relate to the context you've provided, which centers around the historic formation of ARPANET. A \\"link\\" could refer to an individual component of a chain, often circular, that together with other similar components forms a chain. This interpretation is from a more physical or functional standpoint, often referencing actual chains or symbolic chains. In the context of computer networking, the term \\"link\\" can also be used in a more abstract way. In this sense, a link refers to a connection between two points, such as two computers or a computer and a server. In the case of ARPANET, the \\"links\\" were the telecommunications connections between the various research institutions. This project involved using novel protocols and systems to enable long-distance and complex data communication. This allowed computers within participating institutions to communicate and share resources, effectively creating one of the first forms of the internet as we know it today. The network consisted of individual computers connected by these links, much like how a chain consists of individual loops connected together. The links, or connections, ensured unbroken communication and data transfer, making vast leaps forward in the field of computer science and, over time, influencing the development of modern-day internet infrastructure.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What are the full names of Allan Alvarez's two loves? The story is a flashback of the five years (2005 to 2010) of love affair involving the characters of Allan Alvarez and Mia Samonte. The opening scene was in a Pasig River ferry boat. One of the passenger, Allan, was sad and confused if he really loved his then live-in partner, Daphne Recto. While another passenger, Mia, was downtrodden by family problems. To express her heartaches, Mia would write messages on stones and would leave them anywhere, Allan picked up one of those, they got acquainted and their romantic story began. Later, in one of their trysts, they met an old man in Paco Park who predicted that they were meant for each other and would end up together although it would take a difficult five-year ride. Allan was torn between two loves. Although he knew that he loved Mia more, he procrastinated in his choice. Mia left for Malaysia. Two years after, when Allan finally broke free from his indecision, he went to Malaysia to look for Mia only to find out that she was already engaged to another guy. It was now Mia's turn to make a choice. She chose the new guy who loved her so much and the one she knew could help her support her family. Even though she honestly knew in her heart that she still loved Allan. Allan did not lose hope. He patiently waited for Mia for another three years. He firmly believed that she would come back to him as predicted by the old man earlier in the story. True enough, the Malaysian guy let Mia go as he was aware of who Mia truly wanted and her intention of choosing him over Allan. On the very same date foreseen by the old man, Mia returned to the Philippines, saw Allan waiting for her, and embraced each other.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? insults","completion":"To provide a detailed analysis of the sentiment of the given movie review sentence, \\"insults,\\" we need to consider multiple aspects involved in sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the emotion, opinion, or tone behind a piece of text. In this specific case, the given review phrase is just a single word, providing limited context to work with. However, since the word \\"insults\\" has a negative connotation, we can infer that the sentiment of this phrase is negative as well. To break it down, let's consider linguistic aspects and their possible impact on sentiment: 1. Lexical and semantic analysis: The term \\"insults\\" is generally associated with hurtful or offensive remarks, which has a negative meaning. The review phrase contains only this single word, making it easier to classify the overall sentiment of the phrase as negative as well. 2. Context: Due to the brevity of the review phrase, we don't have much context regarding which specific aspects of the movie might be insulted. This lack of context makes it impossible to provide more detailed insights or to analyze whether the sentiment refers to the movie's content, acting, directing, or other elements. 3. Target of the sentiment: Often, movie reviews address different aspects like the story, acting performances, camera work, special effects, and more. However, since the given review sentence is very short, we cannot determine the target of the sentiment. Therefore, we conclude that the general sentiment is negative, but the target remains unclear. In conclusion, given just the word \\"insults,\\" we can identify that the sentiment associated with this movie review is negative. However, the single-word nature of the review makes it difficult to draw any further conclusions regarding the specific target of this negative sentiment or to provide deeper insights into the overall emotional response of the reviewer to the film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Title: ZERO Stars for McCulloch Review: Weak PLASTIC Sprocket gear strips out after about an hour of normal use. McCulloch has not been in business for years, will not repair or supply parts. Warranty useless.This could have been a good tool, but for the poor design of the PLASTIC GEAR. It is the weak point and fails rapidly with normal use.Perhaps designed to strip to protect the motor? But it cannot handle even normal torque.Unacceptable for normal yard use. Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","completion":"The review is clearly negative. The reviewer is expressing dissatisfaction with the product, specifically mentioning several issues they encountered while using the McCulloch tool. Below, I have listed the main concerns raised by the reviewer which contribute to the negative sentiment of the review: 1. Weak Plastic Sprocket Gear: The reviewer complains about the weak plastic sprocket gear, stating that it strips out after about an hour of normal use. This implies that the tool does not serve its purpose effectively and fails to withstand the demands of regular use. 2. Business Status and Unavailability of Parts: The reviewer mentions that McCulloch has not been in business for years, which may affect the availability of replacement parts or support for their products. This further adds to the negative impression of the product and the manufacturer. 3. Warranty Uselessness: The reviewer deems the warranty to be useless, possibly due to the company's status or inability to provide support for their products. A warranty is intended to provide assurance to the customers, but in this case, the reviewer considers it to be ineffective. 4. Poor Design: The review highlights that the plastic gear is a result of poor design choices, making the tool unreliable and prone to failure during normal use. This criticism points out a significant flaw in the product's design, which contributes to the overall dissatisfaction with the tool. 5. Potential Protection Mechanism: The reviewer speculates that perhaps the plastic gear was designed to strip in order to protect the motor. However, they argue that this would still render the tool unfit for normal use, as it cannot handle the expected torque. 6. Unacceptable for Normal Yard Use: Lastly, the reviewer concludes that the McCulloch tool is unacceptable for normal yard use. This statement, along with the numerous issues mentioned earlier, solidifies the negative sentiment of the review. In summary, the review is negative due to the multiple concerns and criticisms expressed, including the weak plastic gear, the lack of support, poor design, and incapacity to perform its intended function under normal circumstances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Aimee Semple McPherson (Aimee, in the original French; October 9, 1890 - September 27, 1944), also known as Sister Aimee or simply Sister, was a Canadian-American Pentecostal evangelist and media celebrity in the 1920s and 1930s, famous for founding the Foursquare Church. McPherson has been noted as a pioneer in the use of modern media, because she used radio to draw on the growing appeal of popular entertainment in North America and incorporated other forms into her weekly sermons at Angelus Temple, one of the first megachurches. In her time she was the most publicized Christian evangelist, surpassing Billy Sunday and her other predecessors. She conducted public faith healing demonstrations before large crowds; testimonies conveyed tens of thousands of people healed. By early 1926, McPherson had become one of the most charismatic and influential women and ministers of her time. Her fame equaled, to name a few, Charles Lindbergh, Johnny Weissmuller, Jack Dempsey, Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Knute Rockne, Bobby Jones, Louise Brooks, and Rudolph Valentino. She was a major American phenomenon, who along with some other high-profile preachers of the time, unlike Hollywood celebrities, could be admired by their adoring public, \\"without apparently compromising their souls.\\" According to Carey McWilliams, she had become \\"more than just a household word: she was a folk hero and a civic institution; an honorary member of the fire and police departments; a patron saint of the service clubs; an official spokesman for the community on problems grave and frivolous.\\" She was influential in many social, educational and political areas. McPherson made personal crusades against anything that she felt threatened her Christian ideals, including the drinking of alcohol and teaching evolution in schools. McPherson became a strong supporter of William Jennings Bryan during the 1925 Scopes trial, in which John Scopes was tried for illegally teaching evolution at a Dayton, Tennessee, school. Bryan and McPherson had worked together in the Angelus Temple and they believed Darwinism had undermined students' morality. According to The New Yorker, McPherson said, evolution \\"is the greatest triumph of Satanic intelligence in 5,931 years of devilish warfare, against the Hosts of Heaven. It is poisoning the minds of the children of the nation.\\" She sent Bryan a telegram saying, \\"Ten thousand members of Angelus Temple with her millions of radio church membership send grateful appreciation of your lion-hearted championship of the Bible against evolution and throw our hats in the ring with you.\\" She organized \\"an all-night prayer service, a massive church meeting preceded by a Bible parade through Los Angeles.\\" Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: what were aimee's media relations like?","completion":"Aimee's media relations were quite strong and innovative for her time.

Adjacent to the L.A. Live development, it is located next to the Los Angeles Convention Center complex along Figueroa Street. Opening on October 17, 1999, it is one of the major sporting facilities in the Greater Los Angeles Area. - A knight is a person granted an honorary title of \\"knighthood\\" by a monarch or other political leader for service to the monarch or country, especially in a military capacity. Historically, in Europe, knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors. During the High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility. By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior. Often, a knight was a vassal who served as a fighter for a lord, with payment in the form of land holdings. The lords trusted the knights, who were skilled in battle on horseback. Since the early modern period, the title of knight is purely honorific, usually bestowed by a monarch, as in the British honours system, often for non-military service to the country. The modern female equivalent in the United Kingdom is Dame. - A team sport includes any sport which involves two or more players working together towards a shared objective.

The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\").

One day,when I was about 5 or 6 years old, my parents and brothers went on a trip. It was just me and Nanny in the house for the weekend. Nanny seemed so happy to be taking care of me all by herself. She made me a special breakfast that first morning. However, all I could do was to complain about how the food was not how Mom always made it. Nanny quietly put down the plate and went into the living room. I followed a minute later and saw that she had tears in her eyes. It was the first time I had ever seen my strong and proud grandmother cry and I was the one who had caused it. I walked over to Nanny, climbed on her lap, and for the first time in my short life I did something else too. I apologized without being told to and asked Nanny to forgive me.

San Francisco bartender gets visit from Google 'secret police' for possessing prototype smartphone A bartender in San Francisco found himself the target of the Google Gestapo after one of the search giant’s employees left a prototype smartphone at his bar. Jamin Barton, who is affectionately known as “Sudsy” by patrons of the 500 Club in San Francisco’s mission district,told Wired that he was closing up after a slow evening last month when he found a yet-to-be released Nexus 4 Android phone. “We find about 20 [phones] a week,” he said to the magazine. “Most people come back for them in 15 minutes.” The phone was locked and without a SIM card, making Barton unable to locate the owner. He showed the device to a regular customer from the tech industry that immediately identified the phone as being the upcoming Nexus 4. The customer reached out to Google HQ for Sudsy. The following day Barton heard back from the patron who sounded shaken up after his dealings with Google. “Dave sort of freaked out. [He said] ‘Google lost a phone. You just got a guy fired…The Google police are coming,’” Barton recalled to the tech magazine. “I probably shouldn’t have shown it to him. But I did. He didn’t work for Google, but Google had him pretty worked up. They told him he could be an accessory or something.” On the evening of September 20, Google sent their global investigations and intelligence manager to Barton’s bar to retrieve the phone. But the bartender tells Wired that he had already agreed to give the phone back to Google the next day as long as the person picking it up could prove that they worked for Google. “What was I supposed to do, look for the guy with Google shirt? How did I know this guy didn’t work for Apple,” Barton told Wired, adding that he felt he was being harassed and left the bar that night which led the google officer on a wild goose chase through the Mission District. Sudsy eventually gave the phone to the Google executive, but only after he was able to confirm his identity. Barton was then offered a free phone, provided he did not go to the media and speak about the incident, instead he was paid a freelance fee for providing photos of the Nexus 4 to Wired. Speculation about LG’s new Nexus 4 is that it boasts a 1,280 × 768 display, quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 CPU, an 8-megapixel rear camera and new Android operating system. Announcement of the new phone was expected to be held in New York on Monday but was cancelled in anticipation of Hurricane Sandy.

Write highlights for this article: British households will throw away the equivalent of 4.2 million dinners on Christmas Day, according to research. The food we leave on our plates on December 25 adds up to to 263,000 turkeys, 740,000 Christmas puddings and 17.2 million Brussels sprouts across the UK, a study revealed. Figures show that nearly 10 per cent of every festive meal is thrown away, which equates to an incredible £64million of wasted food. Scroll down for video. Christmas wastage: Britons will throw away an incredible £64m in excess food on 25 December. The sprouts alone would fill 1,000 wheelie bins, while leftover carrots could reach from London to Munich, end-to-end. And unused gravy would fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool. 17.2m Brussels sprouts. 11.9m carrots. 11.3m roast potatoes. 10.9m parsnips. 9.8m cups of gravy. 7.9m slices of turkey. 7.9m cups of stuffing. 7.5m mince pies. 7.4m slices of Christmas pudding. 7.1m pigs in blankets. The poll by Unilever showed that whoever hosts Christmas lunch spends on average £112 on food alone. Typically, there are six of us around the Christmas dinner table and we're each expected to eat £18.60 worth of food. But it would take the average family nearly four days to eat everything bought just for Christmas Day. The study also found a third of British diners admit to serving themselves an excessive Christmas dinner that they can't finish. More than a third (36 per cent) of adults cite 'getting caught up in the Christmas spirit' as their excuse for buying too much food for the day. Under-35s are the worst culprits: 15 per cent spend up to £200 on food but confess to discarding £27 worth each. One in five of us admit to buying traditional Christmas food we don't even like, the study revealed. The research was carried out as part of Unilever's Project Sunlight #ClearAPlate campaign, to show that food poverty is closer to home than many people think. Half a million meals will be provided to families in need through its partnership with Oxfam. Jon Goldstone, Unilever Foods Director, said: 'We were shocked to hear just how much food goes to waste at Christmas. 'The festive season is naturally a time when we indulge with our family and friends but throwing away 4.2 million perfectly good Christmas dinners is a staggering waste. 'Having seen these figures, this year I know I will be putting a little more thought into my Christmas shopping and through our #ClearAPlate campaign we're encouraging others to do the same.' The #ClearAPlate campaign pledges to provide an additional half a million meals to families in need through its partnership with Oxfam and calls on people to do their bit to address food waste in order to help fight hunger. People can show their support for the #ClearAPlate campaign through three simple steps:. • Clear their plate of food and take a photograph. • Upload the image on their social media using #ClearAPlate to raise awareness of the issue. • Visit projectsunlight.co.uk to find out other ways to support the campaign, including donating meals or time to Oxfam.There are also tips and advice on reducing food waste, and recipe ideas on the site.

Article: Follow the instructions provided with your sewing machine to change out the presser foot, replacing the standard one with a special rolled hem presser foot. Choose your rolled hem presser foot carefully if you do not already own one. The best and most versatile kind will allow you to make rolled hems using a straight stitch, zig zag stitch, or decorative stitch. For this project alone, however, you only need one that will allow you to make a standard straight stitch. Lower the presser foot onto the material without feeding the material into the guide. Sew a line of standard stitches 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) long, 1/4 inch (6 mm) above the raw edge. Leave long tails of thread after stitching this line. Both the line of stitches and the attached threads will help you guide the fabric into the presser foot. Do not fold your fabric in yet during this step. Stitch along the wrong side of the material. Note the guide along the front of your special presser foot. Feed the edge of your material into this guide, bending the raw edge over from one side and under the opposite side. Keep the presser foot lifted as you feed the material in, then lower the presser foot when finished. Feeding the material into the presser foot can be difficult. Use the threads attached to your small set of basting stitches to help lift, guide, and maneuver the edge into the presser foot. With the edge guided into the presser foot and the presser foot lowered onto the fabric, sew slowly and carefully along the entire edge of the chiffon, stopping only once you reach the end. If the edge has been fed into the presser foot guide correctly, the presser foot should continue to roll it under as you work. No further effort on your part should be required. Using your right hand, hold the remaining raw edge taut as you sew, allowing it to feed into the presser foot evenly. Work slowly and carefully to prevent bubbles or bumps from forming. When finished, your hemmed edge should be smooth. Do not back tack the material in place. Instead, leave a long tail of thread at the start and end of the seam and knot the thread in place by hand. You will only see one line of stitching from both the front and back of the material. Once your hem is finished, take the chiffon to an iron and gently press it down, flattening the fold as much as possible. This step should complete the process. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article provides a detailed guide on how to create a rolled hem using a sewing machine with a special rolled hem presser foot. The instructions cover changing the presser foot, sewing an initial line of stitches, feeding the fabric into the presser foot, sewing the edge carefully, and finishing the hem without back tacking. The process concludes with ironing the hemmed edge for a smooth finish.

Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this reason, hypertension is often called the \\"silent killer.\\" Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and medication. Foods thought to lower blood pressure include skim milk, spinach, beans, bananas and dark chocolate. I am facing a new situation today: At a doctor's office, two women are having their annual physical done.

Q:Combine facts and answer this: Which building is located at the center of City Hall Park in the Civic Center area of Lower Manhattan and was designed by Joseph-François Mangin? A:","completion":"The building located at the center of City Hall Park in the Civic Center area of Lower Manhattan, which was designed by Joseph-François Mangin, is the New York City Hall. This historic structure is a significant architectural landmark and is also the oldest city hall in the United States that still houses its original governmental functions. Designed by French immigrants Joseph-François Mangin and John McComb Jr., the construction of New York City Hall began in 1803 and was completed in 1812. The building showcases a blend of architectural styles, including elements of Georgian, French Renaissance, and Federal styles, reflecting the designers' diverse influences and creating a distinctive and elegant facade. The exterior of City Hall is constructed predominantly of white marble, which was quarried from Morris Island in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, and brownstone from the Hudson River Valley region. One notable feature is its asymmetrical design, with the rear of the building being less ornate and predominantly made of brownstone, while the front boasts a sophisticated marble facade. This cost-saving measure was a result of limited funding, as the city's budget only afforded the use of marble for the front and sides of the building. New York City Hall features a grand entrance with Ionic columns supporting a triangular pediment that exhibits a classical aesthetic. The building also boasts a beautifully designed rotunda with skylights and an inner courtyard, creating an impressive space that was used for various public events during the early 19th century. At the top of the building, you will find a striking cupola with a statue of Justice. This cupola not only adorns City Hall but also serves as a clock tower containing an original David Rittenhouse clock that was installed during the early 1800s. The clock's unique wooden construction, which uses cannonball weights and iron hands, adds further historical charm to New York City Hall. Over the years, City Hall has undergone several renovations and restoration projects to maintain its structural integrity and preserve its historic appearance. The building has been the site of numerous important events, such as U.S. President George Washington's first inauguration, and continues to function as the office of the Mayor of New York City and the meeting place for the New York City Council. In conclusion, New York City Hall holds significant historical and architectural value in the United States. Its unique design by Joseph-François Mangin and central location within the thriving metropolis make it an essential landmark symbolizing the rich history, culture, and evolution of the city. As the heart of the Civic Center area in Lower Manhattan, City Hall serves as a reminder of the nation's early development and the architectural achievements that helped shape the future of American cities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Stewart Armstrong Copeland was born in Alexandria, Virginia on July 16, 1952, the youngest of four children of CIA officer Miles Copeland, Jr. and Scottish archaeologist Lorraine Adie. The family moved to Cairo, Egypt, a few months after his birth, and Copeland spent his formative years in the Middle East. In 1957, his family moved to Beirut, Lebanon, and Copeland attended the American Community School there. He started taking drum lessons at age 12 and was playing drums for school dances within a year. In late 1976, Copeland founded the Police with lead singer-bass guitarist Sting and guitarist Henry Padovani (who was soon replaced by Andy Summers), and they became one of the top bands of the 1980s. The Police's early track list was mostly made of Copeland's compositions, including the band's first single \\"Fall Out\\" (Illegal Records, 1977) and the B side \\"Nothing Achieving\\". Though Copeland's songwriting contribution was reduced to a couple of songs per album as Sting started writing more material, he continued to co-arrange all the Police's songs with his two bandmates. Amongst Copeland's most notable songs are \\"On Any Other Day\\" (where he sang lead vocals too), \\"Does Everyone Stare\\" (later to be used as the title of his documentary on the band Everyone Stares: The Police Inside Out), \\"Contact\\", \\"Bombs Away\\", \\"Darkness\\" and \\"Miss Gradenko\\". Copeland also co-wrote a number of songs with Sting, including \\"Peanuts\\", \\"Landlord\\", \\"It's Alright for You\\" and \\"Re-Humanize Yourself\\". Copeland also recorded under the pseudonym Klark Kent, releasing several UK singles in 1978 with one (\\"Don't Care\\") entering the UK Singles Chart that year, along with an eponymously titled 10-inch album on green vinyl released in 1980. Recorded at Nigel Gray's Surrey Sound Studio, Copeland played all the instruments and sang the lead vocals himself. Kent's \\"Don't Care\\", which peaked at #48 UK in August 1978, actually predates the first chart single by the Police by several months (\\"Can't Stand Losing You\\", issued in October 1978) as \\"Don't Care\\" was released in early June 1978. In 1982 Copeland was involved in the production of a WOMAD benefit album called Music and Rhythm. Copeland's score for Rumble Fish secured him a Golden Globe nomination in 1983. The film, directed and produced by Francis Ford Coppola from the S. E. Hinton novel, also had a song released to radio on A&M Records \\"Don't Box Me In\\" (UK Singles Chart n. 91)--a collaboration between Copeland and singer/songwriter Stan Ridgway, leader of the band Wall of Voodoo--that received significant airplay upon release of the film that year. The Police stopped touring in 1984, and during this brief hiatus he released a solo album, The Rhythmatist. The record was the result of a pilgrimage to Africa and its people, and it features local drums and percussion, with more drums, percussion, other musical instruments and occasional lead vocals added by Copeland. The album was the official soundtrack to the movie of the same name, which was co-written by Stewart. He also starred in the film, which is \\"A musical odyssey through the heart of Africa in search of the roots of rock & roll.\\" (Copeland is seen playing the drums in a cage with lions surrounding him.)

Passage 1:Metzger was born to a Jewish family in Mainz on March 23, 1932, to a hardware store owner and a homemaker. Some of his relatives perished in the Holocaust. At the suggestion of his sisters, Metzger's father moved to the United States in 1937, followed by his wife and sons in January 1938. Henry Metzger attended the Bronx High School of Science, as did his brother, then earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Rochester in 1953, followed by a medical degree at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1957. Metzger completed his residency at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, and joined the Public Health Service in 1959, through which he began working at the National Institutes of Health. After two years of post-doctoral study with Seymour Jonathan Singer, funded partly by the Helen Hay Whitney Fellowship, Metzger returned to the National Institutes of Health, working primarily in the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. Passage 2:The SaGa series was created by game designer Akitoshi Kawazu, whose credits prior to the franchise's introduction include Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy II. At a time when Nintendo's Game Boy was becoming popular worldwide due to the puzzle game Tetris, then-Square president Masashi Miyamoto requested that a development team create a game for the handheld console. Kawazu and fellow designer Koichi Ishii suggested that the company develop a role-playing video game, thus making Makai Tōshi Sa·Ga, later released in North America as The Final Fantasy Legend, the company's first handheld title. The gameplay was designed to be difficult, described by Kawazu as the main difference between the SaGa and Final Fantasy series. The character illustrations in all the games in the SaGa series were done by Tomomi Kobayashi, who has also done the illustrations for the MMORPG Granado Espada. Although the series has been long-running, as of 2008 none of the ten production teams at Square Enix is assigned to the franchise. Akitoshi Kawazu and Production Team 2 are devoted to the Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles series.

On 14 February, Lardner sailed north with TF 38 to cover initial landings on Green Island, and on the way was attacked by six Aichi D3A \\"Val\\" dive bombers. Late in February, the destroyer bombarded Rabaul; searched the Bismarck Sea for enemy shipping; and then attacked Karavia Bay, sinking an enemy cargo ship of the Heito Maru class 25 February. Later that day she bombarded Kavieng, receiving a few shrapnel holes from extremely heavy and accurate enemy return fire. During March and April, Lardner operated with support forces for the Palaus raid, and with escort carriers during the landing at Hollandia, New Guinea.","completion":"Based on the provided passages, none of them contain information about the two bays the USS Lardner operated in or their land area sizes.

What is the first name of the person Black Francis told he was keen to record again? Answer the above question based on the context below: While the Pixies' 1991 album Trompe le Monde was being recorded, Thompson had discussions with the album's producer, Gil Norton, about a possible solo record. He told Norton he was keen to record again, even though he had no new material; as a result, the two decided on a cover album. However, by the time Thompson visited a recording studio again in 1992, he had \\"plenty of tunes and musical scraps.\\"He collaborated with Feldman to record new material; they began by trimming down the number of covers to one, The Beach Boys' \\"Hang On to Your Ego\\". Feldman became the album's producer, and played keyboard and bass guitar on several songs, with Santiago featuring on lead guitar and Nick Vincent on drums. Francis recorded the album during the hiatus and breakup of the Pixies in late 1992 and early 1993. He then adopted the stage name \\"Frank Black\\" (inverting his old persona \\"Black Francis\\") and released the results as Frank Black in March 1993. Frank Black was characterized by a focus on UFOs and science fiction, although he explored other subjects, such as in \\"I Heard Ramona Sing\\", a song about the Ramones. The album was similar in style, both musically and lyrically, to the Pixies' albums Bossanova and Trompe le Monde. Feldman later said that the first record connected his solo career with Trompe le Monde, \\"but at the same time it is an island, like nothing else he [Black] did.\\"The following year, Black released his second solo record, a 22-song double album entitled Teenager of the Year. Teenager included the song \\"Headache\\" (sample ), a moderate success on alternative rock playlists; critics described the song as \\"irresistible pop\\". The production of Teenager of the Year was markedly different from Frank Black; in the previous album, MIDI templates were used when writing songs, but in Teenager, Black showed individual parts to band members, the core of which included drummer Vincent and Lyle Workman on lead guitar. Feldman noted that Thompson's songwriting became \\"a lot more spontaneous\\" while recording the... The answer to this question is:","completion":"Gil"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: San Juan, Puerto Rico (CNN) -- Investigators don't know if the massive fire at a fuel storage facility near San Juan was deliberately started or was an accident, the agent in charge of the FBI's San Juan office said Monday. The blaze, which started with an explosion at the Caribbean Petroleum Corp. facility in Bayamon municipality early Friday, was extinguished Sunday, firefighters said. Some of the tanks continued to smolder and crews stood ready to fight any flare-up. \\"We don't know if it's a crime scene,\\" said FBI Special Agent Luis Fraticelli. \\"We don't know if it's an accident, so we're not making any determinations at this point until our experts do their work, do their analysis and then provide input to us as to what they feel happened here.\\" Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States. The FBI is investigating graffiti found on two San Juan tunnels that referred to a fire, Special Agent Harry Rodriguez said Friday. A spray-painted message on the tunnels, less than three miles apart, said: \\"Boom, fire, RIP, Gulf, Soul, ACNF.\\" Caribbean Petroleum owns the Gulf Oil brand, but Rodriguez said he did not know what ACNF referred to. Hundreds of firefighters battled the blaze, which began with an explosion early Friday morning. That explosion shook the ground with the force of a 2.8-magnitude earthquake, authorities said. Flames shot into the air while plumes of thick, black smoke hovered over the region. Agents from the FBI and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were investigating to determine whether the explosion was an act of sabotage or an accident. Seventeen tanks were destroyed by flames and the initial explosion. Puerto Rico's governor, Luis Fortuno, said the main priority of his government is to counter any long-term effects of air and water pollution caused by the disaster. Representatives from the Environmental Protection Agency have been checking air quality near the fire. \\"We're not finding levels that would be of concern,\\" said Bonnie Bellow, EPA spokeswoman. She said the fire had been so intense because it was \\"burning off chemicals that are part of the fuel.\\" About 600 displaced people stayed in shelters on Sunday night, but many were being sent home. Dr. Lorenzo Gonzalez, Puerto Rico's health secretary, tests conducted on the air and water showed no reason for concern. Because they were placed in close proximity in the facilities, everyone in the shelters and all the emergency personnel were vaccinated against the H1N1 flu virus as a precaution, Gonzalez said. President Obama declared an emergency in Puerto Rico, which frees up federal aid. Fortuno said the blaze has cost the island at least 6.4 million. The governor sought to allay fears over gasoline supplies. Caribbean Petroleum owns 200 gas stations in the island and several inland distribution facilities, and supplies much of the island's fuel. Puerto Rico will receive 3.6 million gallons of regular gasoline, more than 1 million gallons of premium gasoline and more than 1 million gallons of diesel fuel to help make up for what may have been lost, Fortuno said. The company has been cited for violations of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the main law in the United States that deals with the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, according to EPA spokeswoman Bellow. Caribbean Petroleum is under a corrective-action plan, she said. CNN's Rafael Romo and Arthur Brice contributed to this report.","completion":"A massive fire broke out at a fuel storage facility of the Caribbean Petroleum Corp. in Bayamon municipality, near San Juan, Puerto Rico, after an initial explosion at the site on early Friday. The fire was extinguished on Sunday, but some tanks still smoldered, so crews were on standby for potential flare-ups. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, with authorities and the FBI unsure if it was a deliberate act or an accident. The incident drew attention to graffiti found in two San Juan tunnels that referred to a fire. The explosion, which was equivalent to a 2.8-magnitude earthquake, destroyed 17 storage tanks and caused significant air and water pollution in the region. Puerto Rico's governor, Luis Fortuno, indicated that the primary focus of his government is to address the long-term effects of the disaster on air and water quality. The Environmental Protection Agency has been monitoring the air quality near the fire site, with no significant concern levels identified so far. As a result of the incident, about 600 people were displaced, with many staying in shelters. Precautionary measures included vaccinating all shelter residents and emergency personnel against H1N1 flu. U.S. President Barack Obama declared an emergency in Puerto Rico, with Governor Fortuno estimating the cost of the blaze at 6.4 million. Caribbean Petroleum Corp supplies much of the island's fuel, owning 200 gas stations and several inland distribution facilities.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Read this: Gellius says that in his day humanitas is commonly used as a synonym for philanthropy – or kindness and benevolence toward one's fellow human being. Gellius maintains that this common usage is wrong, and that model writers of Latin, such as Cicero and others, used the word only to mean what we might call \\"humane\\" or \\"polite\\" learning, or the Greek equivalent Paideia. Gellius became a favorite author in the Italian Renaissance, and, in fifteenth-century Italy, teachers and scholars of philosophy, poetry, and rhetoric were called and called themselves \\"humanists\\". Modern scholars, however, point out that Cicero (106 – 43 BCE), who was most responsible for defining and popularizing the term humanitas, in fact frequently used the word in both senses, as did his near contemporaries. For Cicero, a lawyer, what most distinguished humans from brutes was speech, which, allied to reason, could (and should) enable them to settle disputes and live together in concord and harmony under the rule of law. Thus humanitas included two meanings from the outset and these continue in the modern derivative, humanism, which even today can refer to both humanitarian benevolence and to scholarship. Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): What was humanism once considered the same as?","completion":"Once upon a time, a man named Gellius said that the word \\"humanism\\" was considered the same as \\"kindness and care\\" towards other people. This means people used to think being a humanist was all about being nice and friendly with others.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: It’s hard not getting what you want, and acknowledging that you’re receiving a different outcome than your desired one is one way to show compassion for yourself. Think about how you feel and why you might feel that way. If you’re sad or upset, don’t be afraid to acknowledge and express those feelings. Say to yourself, “It’s hard not being able to change something to an outcome I want.” Discussing the situation with your friends can help you normalize your experience. It can be very helpful to hear that your feelings are normal and they would feel similarly, too. It is easy to get very upset with relationships do not go as hoped. But usually these are imperfections rather than \\"dealbreakers\\". A disagreement or argument typically is not as serious as abuse, for example. Example: You had a falling out with a friend and you need someone to apologize to you to feel at peace. Perhaps it feels like that is the only way to experience peace, but does it have to have that outcome? Maybe you need to simply let go of the friendship and move on, as irritating as it is. You can experience peace even when you don’t get what you want. Example: Your friend dies in a car accident. Of course, there is no way around this loss. However, you accept in time that what has happened cannot be undone, and your friend's love, friendship, and lessons will always be with you even if he or she is not. You can move on from hurt feelings by choosing to do so. You don’t need anything from someone else to move on or let go. Try saying \\"I choose to forgive this person and move on with my life.\\" You may not feel it or believe it at first, but that's okay. Feeling in control of outcomes and the environment is associated with an increased sense of well-being. Feeling out of control can be threatening. If you’re having a hard time letting go of something, think about what is actually in your control. If you cannot control a situation, control how you ‘’’respond’’’ to it. For example, you may not be able to change the fact that you did not get accepted to medical school. However, you can control how you react to it and how much it affects how you feel. For example, you may feel sad, upset, and not smart enough. Yet, does this define how intelligent or worthy you are? Choose to maintain your sense of self even when you don’t get what you want. While something may feel hugely impactful to you right now, ask yourself how it will affect your future. Will it ultimately matter in five years? Are there positive things that can happen, even if you didn’t get what you wanted? Even if you feel disappointed now and don’t know what to do, it doesn’t mean that other opportunities will not arrive for you that will benefit you. Think about what other opportunities may be available for you. Maybe you didn’t get your dream job, but you may find a similar opportunity, or you may decide to pursue a different direction in your career. Consider, too, past disappointments. Did you eventually get over them? Did they impact your life irreparably, or were you able to move forward and let them go? This can help you gain perspective.","completion":"The article discusses the importance of self-compassion, recognizing one's feelings, and accepting uncontrollable outcomes, and it provides advice on how to mentally manage situations where expectations are not met, emphasizing that individual control over reactions can lead to personal growth and well-being even in the face of disappointment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Given the below context: Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song.

Input: Abstract: IMPORTANCE Exacerbations of respiratory symptoms in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have profound and long-lasting adverse effects on patients. OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers in individuals with stable COPD are associated with an increased risk of having exacerbations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective cohort study examining 61,650 participants with spirometry measurements from the Copenhagen City Heart Study (2001-2003) and the Copenhagen General Population Study (2003-2008). Of these, 6574 had COPD, defined as a ratio between forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity below 0.7. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Baseline levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen and leukocyte count were measured in participants at a time when they were not experiencing symptoms of exacerbations. Exacerbations were recorded and defined as short-course treatment with oral corticosteroids alone or in combination with an antibiotic or as a hospital admission due to COPD. Levels of CRP and fibrinogen and leukocyte count were defined as high or low according to cut points of 3 mg/L, 14 μmol/L, and 9 ×10(9)/L, respectively. RESULTS During follow-up, 3083 exacerbations were recorded (mean, 0.5/participant). In the first year of follow-up, multivariable-adjusted odds ratios for having frequent exacerbations were 1.2 (95% CI, 0.7-2.2; 17 events/1000 person-years) for individuals with 1 high biomarker, 1.7 (95% CI, 0.9-3.2; 32 events/1000 person-years) for individuals with 2 high biomarkers, and 3.7 (95% CI, 1.9-7.4; 81 events/1000 person-years) for individuals with 3 high biomarkers compared with individuals who had no elevated biomarkers (9 events/1000 person-years; trend: P = 2 × 10(-5)). Corresponding hazard ratios using maximum follow-up time were 1.4 (95% CI, 1.1-1.8), 1.6 (95% CI, 1.3-2.2), and 2.5 (95% CI, 1.8-3.4), respectively (trend: P = 1 × 10(-8)). The addition of inflammatory biomarkers to a basic model including age, sex, FEV1 percent predicted, smoking, use of any inhaled medication, body mass index, history of previous exacerbations, and time since most recent prior exacerbation improved the C statistics from 0.71 to 0.73 (comparison: P = 9 × 10(-5)). Relative risks were consistent in those with milder COPD, in those with no history of frequent exacerbations, and in the 2 studies separately. The highest 5-year absolute risks of having frequent exacerbations in those with 3 high biomarkers (vs no high biomarkers) were 62% (vs 24%) for those with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) grades C-D (n = 558), 98% (vs 64%) in those with a history of frequent exacerbations (n = 127), and 52% (vs 15%) for those with GOLD grades 3-4 (n = 465). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Simultaneously elevated levels of CRP and fibrinogen and leukocyte count in individuals with COPD were associated with increased risk of having exacerbations, even in those with milder COPD and in those without previous exacerbations. Further investigation is needed to determine the clinical value of these biomarkers for risk stratification..

They contributed to the development of symphonic rock, and by extension, progressive rock. Their best-known recording is their 1967 hit single \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\", which is considered a classic of popular music and is one of the few singles to have sold over 10 million copies. Although noted for its baroque and classical influence, Procol Harum's music also embraces the blues, R&B, and soul. - A power trio is a rock and roll band format having a lineup of guitar, bass and drums, leaving out the second guitar or keyboard that are used in other rock music quartets and quintets to fill out the sound with chords. While one or more band members typically sing, power trios emphasize instrumental performance and overall impact over vocals and lyrics. History. The rise of the power trio in the 1960s was made possible in part by developments in amplifier technology that greatly enhanced the volume of the electric guitar and bass. Particularly, the popularization of the electric bass guitar defined the bottom end and filled in the gaps. Since the amplified bass could also now be louder, the rest of the band could also play at higher volumes, without fear of being unable to hear the bass. This allowed a three-person band to have the same sonic impact as a large band but left far more room for improvisation and creativity, unencumbered by the need for detailed arrangements. As with the organ trio, a 1960s-era soul jazz group centered on the amplified Hammond organ, a three-piece group could fill a large bar or club with a big sound for a much lower price than a large rock and roll band. A power trio, at least in its blues rock incarnation, is also generally held to have developed out of Chicago-style blues bands such as Muddy Waters' trio. - Robin Leonard Trower (born 9 March 1945) is an English rock guitarist and vocalist who achieved success with Procol Harum during the 1960s, and then again as the bandleader of his own power trio. - 20th Century Blues is the fifteenth studio album by Robin Trower .

Write a title for this article: A painting by Amedeo Modigliani fetched 170.4 million at an auction Monday, setting a world record for the artist and achieving the second highest price ever garnered for a work of art at auction. \\"Reclining Nude\\" was sold at Christie's in Manhattan after a protracted bidding battle to a buyer who wished to remain anonymous, according to the auction house. Considered one of his best known works, the 1917-1918 painting nearly created a scandal when it was first exhibited in Paris. It depicts an unknown nude model reclining on a crimson couch and blue cushion. The previous auction record for a Modigliani was 71 million. Pablo Picasso's painting \\"Women of Algiers (Version O)\\" set the record for the highest sum ever paid for an artwork at auction. It sold for 179.4 million at Christie's in May. A Roy Lichtenstein painting not seen on the market for 20 years also set a world record for the artist. \\"Nurse\\" sold for 95.3 million, almost doubling the previous auction record for the pop artist of 56 million. Impressionist, modern and contemporary art by well-known artists \\"do not require a tremendous amount of aesthetic or intellectual risk on the part of the collector,\\" said Sarah Lichtman, assistant professor of design history at Parson School of Design. \\"They are beautiful paintings - some even exceptional as is the Modigliani - but they are tried and true.\\" Christie's expects to sell at least 1 billion of art over a series of evening, day and online sales this week. \\"There is clearly good appetite among collectors for exceptional works of art offered with appropriate estimates,\\" said Brook Hazelton, president of the Americas for Christie's. \\"This is a very broad and globally diverse market at the moment, with strong interest in paintings, sculpture and works on paper from the 10,000 level straight up to multimillion-dollar masterpieces at the top end.\\" Also on sale Monday night were two major works by Paul Gauguin from his Tahiti period. \\"Therese,\\" a carved wooden figure of a Tahitian female, brought in a record 30.9 million, topping its presale high estimate of 25 million. The previous auction record for a sculpture by the artist was 11.2 million. The other Gauguin, \\"Young Man with a Flower,\\" is a painting of a Tahitian youth wearing a white shirt, loose cravat and a white blossom tucked behind his ear. Christie's said it fetched 13.6 million, just above its low pre-sale estimate of 12 million. The portrait's first owner was Henri Matisse, who paid 200 francs for it in 1900. Later owners included John Quinn and Lillie Bliss, one of the original founders of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The current auction record for a Gauguin painting is 40.3 million. Among other highlights of \\"The Artist's Muse\\" sale is Pablo Picasso's \\"Man with a Sword,\\" a self-portrait of the artist as a musketeer created in 1969. It sold for 22.5 million. Christie's said interest in Picasso's late period musketeer portraits has grown dramatically in recent years. Also of interest were two works by Lucian Freud. \\"Naked Portrait on a Red Sofa\\" is a portrait of the artist's daughter, the fashion designer Bella Freud. Its pre-sale estimate was 20 million to 30 million, but it failed to sell Monday night. One of a series of portraits of his daughters, it is the first time it was offered at auction. On Tuesday, Christie's is offering Freud's \\"Brigadier,\\" a portrait of Andrew Parker Bowles, the former husband of Camilla Parker-Bowles, now the wife of Prince Charles. It was on view at the 2012 retrospective of the artist at the National Portrait Gallery in London and portrays the career soldier wearing his sumptuous army brigadier uniform. It's estimated to sell for around 30 million. Tuesday's post-war and contemporary art sale also has a mammoth bronze \\"Spider\\" sculpture by Louise Bourgeois, estimated at 25 million to 35 million.

Article: People may notice that you two aren’t friends anymore and ask you what went down. It’s okay to say something non-specific, like “we just kind of drifted apart,” but don’t get into the details. Talking trash about your former friend is mean and immature, no matter what happened to cause the friendship to fall apart. If your friend gets nasty, spreading rumors or gossiping about you on social media, try not to engage. There’s no point in dragging things out or defending yourself to someone you don’t even want to be friends with anymore. But most importantly don't do the same to her. If you talk behind somebodies back, word will most definitely come out. If anything, it shows that you made the right decision. Things might be awkward for a while, and your friend may be angry or hurt, but treat her with kindness and respect. Remember that this is someone who was once your friend—maybe even your best friend—so honor what you had. Don’t do the look-of-death thing or straight-up ignore her. Just give her a small smile or nod of acknowledgment and move along. If she talks to you, turn it into a friendly conversation that won't lead into getting closer. Try to keep talks short until she feels as if you don't seem interesting. Ending one friendship may cause ripples if you’re part of the same group.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the modern name of the photograph by the commercial photographer that inspired an 1888 oil painting? Farsari and other 19th-century commercial photographers generally concentrated on two types of subject matter: the scenery of Japan and the \\"manners and customs\\" of its inhabitants. Such subjects, and the ways in which they were literally and figuratively framed, were chosen to appeal to foreign taste; and the reason for this, apart from the photographer's individual aesthetics, vision and preconceptions, had much to do with economics. Photographs were expensive to make and accordingly expensive to buy. In 1870s Japan, a portrait photograph usually cost half a ryō \\"per head\\", about a month's pay for an artisan. Given such pricing, few Japanese could afford photographs and a photographer's clientele was largely drawn from the foreign residents of the European and American enclaves: colonial administrators, missionaries, merchants and the military. By the early 1870s, tourists had joined their number. To appeal to this clientele, photographers often staged and contrived the scenes they photographed, particularly the portraits depicting \\"manners and customs\\".In 1885, Charles J. S. Makin used some of Farsari's views to illustrate his travel account Land of the Rising Sun, Being a Short Account of Japan and the Japanese. As photomechanical printing was still in its infancy, it was common for artists and illustrators to create works derived from photographs. For example, Charles Wirgman's numerous engravings for the Illustrated London News were made from views by Wirgman's friend and sometime partner Felice Beato. Occasionally the link between a work of art and its photographic source material was less overt: Louis-Jules Dumoulin's 1888 oil painting Boys' Festival from the Bluff, Yokohama [sic] (now called Carp Banners in Kyoto) draws heavily from Farsari's photograph Gionmachi, Kioto (now often called View of Shijō-dōri, Kyoto); although the painted image strongly resembles the photographic source, the location of the subject has been changed in the title.

They shared many stories. Which friend had a smaller chance of developing Alzheimer’s disease? Answer:","completion":"To determine which friend has a smaller chance of developing Alzheimer's disease, we need to consider the risk factors associated with the condition. The main factor we will focus on here is age. Step 1: Compare their ages Jill is 55 years old, and Jane is 70 years old. Step 2: Analyze the risk factor Age is considered one of the most significant risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. The likelihood of developing Alzheimer's doubles approximately every five years after the age of 65. Step 3: Determine which friend has a smaller chance of developing Alzheimer's disease Since Jill is younger at 55 years old and still below the age of 65, while Jane is already 70, Jill has a smaller chance of developing Alzheimer's disease based on this risk factor. However, it's essential to note that age is just one of the factors, and other genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors may also play a role in determining the risk of developing the disease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Explanation: After months of studying and obtaining data on the behavior of birds, biologists from around the world will look at the data and come up with several possible interpretations. This is an important step for scientific analysis, inquiry, and experimentation. Option (B) – \\"reject it and do their own investigations\\" – is unlikely because biologists would generally not discard collected data without a sound reasoning that the data is unreliable or biased. Additionally, starting entirely new investigations may not be practical or efficient. Instead, they would review the existing data and try to build upon it or improve the methodology if needed. Option (C) – \\"change the data to fit their expectations\\" – is not in line with scientific principles and integrity. Researchers are supposed to base their hypotheses and conclusions on the empirical data they collect, rather than altering the data to conform to their expectations. Option (D) – \\"publish their own interpretations in a science journal\\" – is a potential step in the process, but not the immediate step after receiving the data. Before publishing their findings, biologists would first come up with several possible interpretations of the data (Option A), then discuss and analyze these interpretations among their peers. They might also conduct additional research to support or refute these interpretations. Only after a thorough examination and verification process, the biologists would publish their interpretations or findings in a science journal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the given facts and available options, the answer to the question \\"black objects absorb all visible what?\\" is 'rays or beams.' To provide further clarification, let's examine the options one by one: - Sunlight: Although black objects absorb the visible light that is a part of sunlight, sunlight is not solely light; it also comprises infrared and ultraviolet light. Therefore, this answer is not absolutely precise. - Microwaves: Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation separate from visible light; hence, this option is incorrect. - Energy: While black objects do absorb energy in the form of light, the term energy represents a broad category that includes various forms like electrical, mechanical, and thermal energy. Thus, this answer is not specific enough. - Black holes and dark matter: These astrophysical phenomena are unrelated to light absorption by black objects; they represent separate concepts in the field of astrophysics. - Activation energy and heat energy: These terms are primarily associated with chemical reactions and thermal energy, respectively, and do not directly relate to the absorption of visible light by black objects. In conclusion, the most suitable answer for the question \\"black objects absorb all visible what?\\" is 'rays or beams' since visible light is indicated to travel in this form, according to Fact 2."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: As soon as you meet, or even see, a person, you form an impression of him based on his posture, gesture and facial expressions. This is why it is important to make a good first impression on the person who will be interviewing you. Within the first 60 seconds of meeting you, the interviewer will have formed an impression about what type of person you are and what kind of employee you would become, and 55% of this will be based only on your body language. Here are some tips to make you that impression a good one. First of all, relax. Think positive thoughts and you are more likely to come across as a positive, confident person during the interview. Dress smartly, as your appearance is one of the first things an interviewer will notice you. Stand up straight, and walk in with your shoulders back and your head up. Try to avoid slowing down as you walk into the room because this suggests fear and uncertainty. Shake hands with the interviewer firmly. You should have a positive handshake and a warm smile. Open your coat or jacket as you sit down shows that you, too, are open. Posture is important. You should be sitting well back in your seat. Sit up straight and lean forward slightly, but not too much. Sitting at too much of an angel expresses discomfort and distrust. Two of the most common signals are crossing your arms and legs, so try to avoid them. Another important issue is eye contact. Looking someone in the eye shows confidence in yourself and trust in the other person. However, don't overdo it, as too much eye contact or starring will make the other person uncomfortable. Use more eye contact when listening than when talking, and when you look away, look down. Looking up at the ceiling will make you seem bored and rude.

A bunch of guys torture a girl for several days before finally killing her. And at this point, I will say that these films are NOT real! They are faked horror films which try to be as realistic as possible. The scenes are sickening but also unrealistic in many cases. For example, when they kick the girl in the floor, we can clearly see how they kick and stump the floor near the girl! And how stupid this looks! The sound effects are also unrealistic and don't make sense. Other scenes include animal intestines thrown on the girl, the girl exposed to loud noises for many hours, the ripping off of fingernails, worms placed on the wounds in the girl's body, the eye pierced and mutilated in horrific detail and stuff like that.

This first entry is the sickest and most amateurish Guinea Pig, although it is not as bloody as the next part, Flowers of Flesh and Blood, which tries to be as shocking as possible.

With its £50million price tag, this Grade II listed mansion already sounds like a home for someone with very deep pockets.That’s before you realise that the buyer will have to spend a further £20million restoring it. The run-down property, in Mayfair, is believed to be Britain’s most expensive ‘fixer-upper’ – estate agent slang for a home in need of a full refurbishment. But whoever buys it could be making a shrewd investment, as it is likely to be worth £100million after renovation. The mid-18th Century mansion, which has fallen into disrepair over the years, is set to attract keen interest from the super-rich, who often compete over trophy homes. Once restored, it will boast seven palatial bedroom suites, eight state rooms, a leisure complex and a private cinema. The main suite will span 2,000 sq/ft – twice the size of the average new UK home – and include ‘his and hers’ dressing rooms. There will be a mews home for staff, a wine room and several high-security vaults. The terraced property is thought to have been built after 1750, with previous residents including the Earl of Camperdown and the Marquis of Anglesey. Peter Wetherell, of estate agents Wetherell, said: ‘We anticipate a fierce battle by super-rich bidders. Once converted, it will be one of London’s most outstanding mansions.’ Exterior of property: London'­s most expensive fixer-upper has been put on the market for £50 million - and will need another £20million spent restoring it. Prime location in Mayfair: The Grade II -listed mansion has spent years in decline and is now a wreck, requiring a full restoration. Needs work: The property is in the middle of Mayfair, one of the world's most desirable locations, and billionaires are now preparing to battle over it. Scaffolding outside: The super-rich are looking at mansions in the same way they see mega-yachts and are playing wealthy games on one-upmanship. Top spot: The property is located near Green Park London Underground station - although it's unlikely the owners will ever need to use public transport. Going up in the world: The Mayfair property is likely to attract much interest from potential buyers, despite the appalling state in which it is available. Upstairs, downstairs: A fireplace sits below nature decorations on the wall (left), while a staircase inside the property is also pictured (right) Falling apart: A bath and sink in one bathroom (left), and a broken toilet and peeling wallpaper in another (right) Ultimate fixer-upper: A ground-floor room is in serious need of repair work, but sits in one of the most desirable parts of the whole of Britain. Bolted shut: Many elements of the property - such as the door bolt and key pictured - are looking old and will be modernised during the refurbishment. Looking desperate: The property has plenty of potential to become a wonderful abode for a billionaire, but is clearly in serious need of refurbishment. Floors and wallks: The bare floorboards can be seen in multiple rooms (left) and a detail of the door frame is pictured up close (right) Bare cabinet: There is plenty of work to be done on the property, but once it has been refurbished it will be a prime property in a superb location. Archaic look: The Mayfair mansion has spent years in decline and is now a sorry wreck, requiring a full refurbishment. Red walls: A hole can be seen in the roof of this room, but it has plenty of potential to be turned into a luxury dining room or lounge, with the large windows providing light. Changes: It could be transformed into one of Britain's finest city homes after the huge renovation project that is planned. Spacious: A light fitting, fireplace, windows, mirrors and wooden floor are the basis for what the developers have to work with in this room. Work to do: The property could be transformed into one of the UK's finest city homes worth a staggering £100million after renovation. Bedroom: There will an eight person lift, a mews home for guests or staff, a wine room, office, catering kitchen and a number of high security vaults. New look: The property currently has listed Chinese wallpaper and silk wall mountings which will be removed and reinstated as part of the refurbishment. Relaxing: The home is thought to have been built after 1750 by John Phillips and George Shakespeare after entering an agreement with Lord Berkeley of Stratton. History: Previous residents have included George Fieschi Heneage, MP for Lincolnshire (1836-1867), The Earl of Camperdown (1867-1918) and The Marquis of Anglesea. Sit back in comfort: Another view of the entertainment room, with a sofa, plenty of cushions and a large television screen.

Well lit: Another artist's impression of the refurbished house by Martin Kemp Design shows the type of decor that buyers would expect to see. View of trees: Another artist's impression of a bedroom in the mansion, which is available in one of the most exclusive areas of the country. Posh wash: The bathroom has an unusual formation of mirrors and also has pictures hanging on the wall. Lengthy appearance: A rectangular room with sofas and a table, as well as a TV screen which is mocked up to show a BBC News programme. Visual aspect: Various different portraits and photographs can be seen in this corridor - which appears to be covered in nothing but pictures. Hot property: The wood-panelled sauna room in the extensive house, which is on the market for an eye-watering £50million. Staircase: This artist's impression shows how different the entrance to the property will look once the refurbishment has taken place. Style: Ladies' hats and handbags are displayed in the centre of this room, which also features a fireplace and a set of cupboards. Reading material: Another artist's impression of one of the many lounges in the huge property, which also has plenty of books on the shelves. Light in the dark: Light fittings hang from the ceiling in a mocked-up view of the kitchen, with a table and sink in the frame. Food and drink: The kitchen is viewed from the reverse angle, looking out into the open. BBC News is again seen on a television screen. Pricey: Estate agent Wetherell, expects oil royals, African moguls, billionaires and property developers to look at the home - also being marketing by Beauchamp Estates. Plenty of colours: A bust is seen on the mantlepiece and glasses are in the cupboard on the left of this room, which has a black and white carpet. Comforts: Rolled up towels and another hanging on a towel rack are seen in this room, which also has a wash basin. Swimming pool: The mid-18th Century home will boast seven palatial bedroom suites, eight state rooms, a leisure complex and private cinema when completed. Billiards table and globe: The property has been put up for sale with estate agent Wetherell for a jaw-dropping £50million. From old to new: After World War Two, the property - like many in Mayfair - was converted to commercial use. Mayfair's finest: The area is undergoing its biggest overhaul in 100 years, with these grand properties being converted back into homes for the super-rich. Come outside: An artist's impression of how the garden at the £50million London property could look, with seating areas and parasols.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe's southwestern extremity. The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world).

What is the answer: Cruella DeVil was a villainess in which animated Disney film?","completion":"Cruella DeVil is the notorious villainess in the animated Disney film \\"One Hundred and One Dalmatians,\\" which made its debut in 1961. This film, based on Dodie Smith's 1956 novel \\"The Hundred and One Dalmatians,\\" features a captivating narrative centered around Dalmatian puppies who find themselves entangled in the cruel and menacing plans of the vile Cruella DeVil. The story revolves around a young couple, Roger and Anita, who end up uniting their Dalmatian dogs, Pongo and Perdita, in marriage. When Perdita gives birth to a charming litter of 15 puppies, Cruella DeVil, a rich and sinister woman known for her extravagance and malicious nature, becomes infatuated with the idea of acquiring these puppies for her own devious plans. Obsessed with fur, she dreams of fashioning a luxurious spotted fur coat out of the young Dalmatians’ skins. Determined to make her cruel ambition a reality, Cruella rudely offers to buy the puppies from Roger and Anita. The couple vehemently refuses, understanding the danger that she poses to their precious litter. However, Cruella devises a nefarious plan and employs her incompetent henchmen, Jasper and Horace, to steal the puppies. The plot takes an exciting turn as the Dalmatians and their parents embark on a thrilling quest to save the puppies and other dogs from the evil clutches of Cruella DeVil. \\"One Hundred and One Dalmatians\\" is a beloved tale that showcases the importance of courage, family, and loyalty. Audiences can also appreciate the artistry that went into creating this film, as it was one of the first Disney animated features to use the revolutionary Xerox process, which eliminated the need for inking and allowed artists to directly copy their drawings onto the cels, resulting in a vivid and stylized visual appearance. Cruella DeVil has become an iconic Disney villain over the years, with her distinctive fashion sense, shock of black and white hair, and a personality as cold and heartless as her name implies. The character has appeared in various adaptations since the release of the original animated film, including the live-action remake in 1996, titled \\"101 Dalmatians,\\" where Glenn Close portrayed the infamous villainess, and the more recent origin story titled \\"Cruella\\" released in 2021, starring Emma Stone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the next sentence. (CNN) -- It's easy to understand why comedians like Jim Carrey, Mike Myers, and Sacha Baron Cohen have flirted with adapting James Thurber's 1939 New Yorker story about a timid man with a vibrant fantasy life. Not only has CGI made it relatively simple to turn Walter Mitty's daydreams into Technicolor tapestries of digital eye candy, it's also the kind of emotionally textured role that can be a springboard out of the banana-peel slapstick ghetto. Ben Stiller's no stranger to such clown-crying-on-the-inside gambits (see: \\"Permanent Midnight\\" and \\"Greenberg\\"). But his new film, \\"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,\\" despite all of its visual razzle-dazzle, never locates the beating heart of its hero. As Stiller's","completion":"Mitty, he delivers a subtle performance of a man deeply embedded within his own imagination, a man so captivated by his fantasies that his real-world existence feels like an afterthought. This dichotomy is well realized in Mitty's thought-provoked escapades, magically enhanced by the power of CGI, which provides him the technicolor canvas to paint his adventures onto. Yet, with every beautifully crafted scene, each cinematically enchanting frame, one can’t help but feel a craving for a richer emotional context—a glimpse into the core of this delightful daydreamer. Stiller's interpretation of Mitty is understated, often buried under the grandiosity of his extravagant dreams. His performance manages to tread this intricate balance of subdued reality against the tsunami of his imaginings, graduating away from the tried formulas of over-the-top physical comedy—that Stiller being previously known for—to a more introspective type. However, this introspection, this insight into Mitty's inner life, feels oddly missing beneath the overwhelming visual spectacle. In his previous roles, Stiller has proven his adeptness at showcasing distressing emotional conflicts effectively. But here, in \\"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,\\" there’s a disconnect. The focus appears to be more on the breathtakingly vivid visuals, and less on the emotional gravity of Mitty's life — a point where fantasy and reality collide. This is a stark contrast to James Thurber's original work, in which the protagonist’s vibrant imagination is merely an escape, a survival mechanism against the dull drudgery of his life. Despite \\"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\\" boasting stunning digital sequences as Mitty drifts between reality and fantasy, there’s an unfulfilled emotional core—evidenced by the film's inability to locate and really showcase the 'beating heart' of its eponymous hero. Mitty, despite having his dreams come alive in an astounding digital display, seems a tad one-dimensional, incapable of evoking generating adequate empathy. Stiller's transition from slapstick comedy to more humorously heartbreaking roles has been well received in the past. But the lack of depth in his portrayal of Mitty—despite the cinematic spectacle that surrounds the character—leaves the audience wanting. Ultimately, despite the film's razzmatazz, it struggles to genuinely connect with its hero's emotional core, a necessity in order to truly empathize and resonate with the joys, fears, and frustrations of Walter Mitty. The story's original author, James Thurber, masterfully portrayed a protagonist with a vivid imagination as a counterpoint to his mundane existence. But in this rendition, the audience gets caught up in the awe-inspiring visuals while the emotional subtlety of the character that should underpin the narrative gets lost. While Stiller’s Mitty is certainly strengthened with the introduction of digital spectacle, his emotional presence is what seems to be entrapped in the celluloid. The viewer remains emotionally detached from the protagonist and his situation. In the end, although Stiller’s performance alongside the spectacular visual effects certainly brings life to the screen, this stylization seems to fail where it matters the most: in making us feel for the character and understanding his emotional world. Despite its potential, \\"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\\" pivots more on the dazzling spectacle than on the protagonist's emotional journey, thereby missing the mark on truly exploring the depths of the main character's secret life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1989, Jackson's annual earnings from album sales, endorsements, and concerts were estimated at 125 million. Forbes placed Jackson's annual income at 35 million in 1996 and 20 million in 1997. In the year after his death, more than 8.2 million of Jackson's albums sold in the US, and 35 million albums worldwide, more than any other artist in 2009. In 2014, Jackson became the first artist to have a top ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades. He became the first artist to sell one million music downloads in a week, with 2.6 million song downloads.

A:","completion":"Others may feel a variety of emotions and reactions as a result of Kai hiring an assistant to help with their daily chores. In this context, I will provide a more comprehensive analysis of how different groups of people may feel about Kai's decision: 1. Family members: If Kai's family members were previously responsible for helping them with chores, they might feel relieved by this decision. The assistant would potentially alleviate some of the burden of household tasks for each family member, allowing them more time to focus on their own responsibilities, interests, and hobbies. However, some family members could potentially feel envious or annoyed, especially if they perceive the assistant as an unnecessary luxury. This could lead to tension and discussions about everyone's contributions to the household. 2. Friends and acquaintances: For friends and acquaintances, their reactions could be mixed. Some friends might be happy for Kai, particularly those who understand how busy Kai has been or how much stress the daily chores have caused. They might see this decision as a smart and practical means of managing time and making life easier for Kai. On the other hand, some friends might view this as a sign of laziness or even extravagance, which could lead to judgment and gossip. The reactions of friends and acquaintances will highly depend on their relationship with Kai and their own personal values and beliefs. 3. Kai's assistant: The assistant themselves might feel grateful for the job opportunity and motivated to perform well. This newfound responsibility could lead to increased feelings of self-worth, along with a strong desire to ensure that all of Kai's tasks are completed efficiently and effectively. Alternatively, if the assistant feels overwhelmed or underappreciated, they might eventually experience burnout, resentment, or dissatisfaction with their role. 4. Colleagues, co-workers, and neighbors: Kai's colleagues, co-workers, and neighbors might not have a direct impact on their decision to hire an assistant. However, they could still form opinions based on their own personal values, experiences, and level of knowledge about Kai's household situation. Some might view the hiring of an assistant as evidence of success and ambition, while others may interpret it as an indicator of laziness, extravagance, or even elitism. There could also be neutral observers who do not form any strong opinions on the matter and may remain indifferent to the situation. In conclusion, the feelings and reactions of others to Kai hiring an assistant will greatly depend on their relationship with Kai, their own experiences, and their individual values and beliefs. While some people might feel relieved, happy, or grateful for the new arrangement, others could potentially experience jealousy, judgment, or tension. It is crucial for Kai to navigate these varied reactions and maintain open communication with all parties involved to ensure harmony and understanding in their personal and professional relationships."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A: A:","completion":"The column of hot rock that continuously brings hot rock up from the mantle toward the crust is called a mantle plume. Justification: 1) A volcanic vent refers to an opening on the Earth's surface through which magma and volcanic gases are expelled. This is more about the surface feature rather than the column of hot rock that brings the material up from the mantle. 2) A hotspot refers to the location on the Earth's surface over which a mantle plume is situated. Although related, the hotspot is not the actual column of hot rock. 3) A flue refers to a duct or passage for air, gas, or smoke. This term is commonly used in relation to chimneys or ventilation systems and is not closely related to the geological process described in the question.

Baseurl указывает URL-адрес репозитория, в то время как mirrorlist указывает список зеркал.\\" Вот более подробный и развёрнутый ответ: Repo - это сокращение от repository (на русском - репозиторий). Репозиторий используется для хранения, организации и предоставления доступа к пакетам программного обеспечения. Определение дополнительных репозиториев позволяет расширить доступный набор программ и компонентов для установки. Baseurl - это параметр, который указывает на URL-адрес основного источника репозитория. URL-адрес должен быть валидным и точно соответствовать адресу репозитория, с которым вы хотите работать.

Your task is to generate headline (title) for this text. Preferred headlines are under fifteen words. Input: We consider the problem of Bayesian parameter estimation for deep neural networks, which is important in problem settings where we may have little data, and/ or where we need accurate posterior predictive densities p(y|x,D), e.g., for applications involving bandits or active learning. One simple approach to this is to use online Monte Carlo methods, such as SGLD (stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics). Unfortunately, such a method needs to store many copies of the parameters (which wastes memory), and needs to make predictions using many versions of the model (which wastes time). We describe a method for “distilling” a Monte Carlo approximation to the posterior predictive density into a more compact form, namely a single deep neural network. We compare to two very recent approaches to Bayesian neural networks, namely an approach based on expectation propagation [HLA15] and an approach based on variational Bayes [BCKW15]. Our method performs better than both of these, is much simpler to implement, and uses less computation at test time.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Cristobal Perez was born on August 14, 1969 in San Antonio, Texas to Gilbert Perez, a computer programmer, and Carmen Medina. He is of Mexican-American ancestry. Perez's parents divorced in 1974, when he was four years old. His mother remarried in 1978. In spring 1995 Chris's father-in-law, Abraham found out Yolanda Saldivar, who managed Selena's boutiques and fan club, was embezzling money. They held a meeting in early March where it was rumored they had a sexual relationship, with Saldivar denying she had anything to do with fiscal discrepancies in checks that were found written in her name. Selena tried to repair her friendship with Saldivar despite her father's warnings. On March 30, 1995, Selena and Chris met with Saldivar at a motel to recover missing financial papers for tax purposes. When Selena arrived home she found that Saldivar did not give her the correct documents. She phoned Saldivar, who tried to convince Selena to return to her motel room alone. Chris insisted that it was too late, and he did not want Selena driving alone at night. Selena then agreed to meet with Saldivar the next morning. On March 31, Selena woke up early to meet Saldivar at the motel where she was staying. She met with Saldivar, who delayed the transfer of papers with a story about having been raped in Mexico. Selena took Saldivar to a local hospital, where doctors found no evidence of rape. When they returned to the motel room, Selena ended their four-year working relationship. As she turned to leave, Saldivar reached into her handbag, pulled out a Taurus Model 85 .38 caliber revolver, pointed it at Selena and pulled the trigger. The bullet entered Selena's right shoulder blade from the back, piercing a major artery running from her heart and exiting from just below her right collarbone. She ran to the motel lobby and collapsed to the floor. As the motel employees gathered round, she named Saldivar as her assailant. Selena was transferred to a nearby hospital, where doctors found the damage irreparable. She was pronounced dead within the hour. Chris couldn't eat for two days after his wife's murder. In his book he says that when he could not sleep he began abusing alcohol and other drugs, and went into seclusion. Family members noticed he was rapidly losing weight. Chris felt guilty for not protecting Selena from Saldivar. In 1996, he moved out of his Corpus Christi house and back in with his father in San Antonio. John Garza introduced him to Venessa Villanueva, and after getting to know each other they became a couple in 1998. In 2001 Chris married Villanueva and they had two children, a boy and a girl. Although it was rumored that Villanueva did not want to divorce, and wanted to try and work things out in their relationship, the couple finally decided their relationship was irreconcilable. They filed for divorce in 2008. Despite getting married again and having two children, Perez has since remained in touch with the Quintanillas following Selena's death.

If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. Bimmy and Harold are both four years old and are about to start attending school. Before that though, it is important that they have adequate supplies to be prepared. Bimmy's parents, who both have worn glasses their whole lives, took him to the store to pick up folders and pencils. While there, they bumped into Harold and his parents, who do not wear glasses. They quickly exchanged hellos before moving on with their shopping. Which boy will less likely struggle to see the chalkboard when they start school? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Bimmy will struggle to see the chalkboard when he starts school compared to Harold. This is because there is some evidence that myopia, or nearsightedness, is inherited, and since both of Bimmy's parents have worn glasses their whole lives, there is an increased chance that Bimmy will also need corrective lenses. On the other hand, Harold's parents do not wear glasses, which suggests that he may have a lower risk of developing nearsightedness due to heredity. However, it is important to note that genetics is not the only contributing factor when it comes to myopia. Environmental factors, such as spending a lot of time doing close visual work like reading or using a computer, can also play a role in the development of nearsightedness. It is worth mentioning that myopia typically progresses until about age 20 and can also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. So, while Bimmy may be at a higher risk for nearsightedness at the start of school, both children's vision could still change as they grow and encounter various environmental factors. In conclusion, Bimmy is more likely to struggle with seeing the chalkboard when starting school due to the increased risk of inheriting nearsightedness from his parents. However, it is essential for both Bimmy and Harold to have regular eye checkups and follow any recommendations from their eye care professionals to ensure they maintain optimal eye health and are prepared for success in school."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Quick and the Dead Movie plot: Duncan McKaskel (Tom Conti) and his wife, Susanna (Kate Capshaw), a married couple who, along with their 12-year-old son, Tom (Kenny Morrison), are travelling West hoping to start a new life. They have left a cholera-stricken wagon train and, alone, arrive in a small dilapidated town. Here, they meet no-good Doc Shabbitt (Matt Clark) and ask for directions. He suggests they stay in a deserted local building, but McKaskel senses danger and they leave. Shabbit decides to steal two of their horses. Con Vallian (Sam Elliott) is chasing a half-breed Indian, the latest recruit to Shabbit's gang who, it transpires, Vallian has tracked for hundreds of miles for personal reasons. Vallian witnesses the homesteader's encounter with Shabbit and turns up at the McKaskel's wagon during supper. He advises them their horses have been stolen. Against Susanna's advice, Duncan rides into town and tries to reclaim the horses. An intense gunfight ensues when Vallian, who has secretly followed him, shoots some of the Shabbit gang. When Doc Shabbitt finds that his son, who was about to shoot McKaskel in the back, has been killed, he vows to pursue the family and seek revenge. Susanna, Duncan, and Tom flee in their covered wagon, trying to keep ahead of their pursuers. Vallian keeps arriving to help protect them from Shabbitt and his gang. As time passes, Vallian manages to kill the bandits one by one. The remaining four keep up their pursuit. Vallian is obviously attracted to Susanna, and she to him. Following a moment of high drama, she succumbs to his advances and they share a passionate kiss. McKaskel never learns of the kiss, but tells Vallian, who is critical of his apparent pacifism, to back off several times. In an encounter with Indians, Susanna learns that her brother, an army officer, has likely been killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Out hunting, Vallian is shot. McKaskel removes the bullet, but Vallian runs a high fever and falls on the trail. He is rescued and nursed back to health by Susanna. Eventually, they...

For example, you could say, “Mom, I want you to know that I am bisexual. I’m comfortable with who I am, and I hope you can be, too.” Your parents might be surprised to hear that you are bisexual. They might not know much about what that actually means. Be prepared for them to have a lot of questions. Try to answer them as honestly as you can, but don’t feel like you have to share anything that you’re not comfortable with. For example, you could say, \\"This isn't a choice, it is the way I am.\\" Be prepared for questions such as: \\"Are you sure?\\" \\"Why would you make this choice?\\" \\"Don’t you think you’ll grow out of this?\\" Your parents might be really confused about what being bisexual actually means. For instance, they might wonder if that means you like boys 50% and girls 50%, or if you have a scale. It's important to let them know that it's not a black and white issue. Explain that you are attracted to different people for different reasons. It will be helpful for you to answer their questions. It’s also a good idea for you to help them understand by giving them additional information. Overall LGBT resources will be useful, but you can also ask your local support center to give you some information that helps to explain bisexuality more specifically.

Article: When you're a parent to a young child, you spend a lot of time talking about feelings: about having to share, about being disappointed because you may not have a cookie instead of broccoli , about the great injustice of a parent pressing the elevator button before the child has a chance to. And in a parenting culture that's increasingly concerned with centering children's needs above all else, mothers and fathers have become skillful at talking about their kids' feelings while masking their own. But new research suggests that parents who hide their negative emotions are doing their children, and themselves harm. A study published this month says that when parents put on a faux-happy face for their kids, they do damage to their own sense of wellbeing and authenticity. \\"For the average parent the findings suggest when they attempt to hide their negative emotion expression and overexpress their positive emotions with their children, it actually comes at a cost: doing so may lead parents to feel worse themselves,\\" researcher Dr Emily Impett, says. It makes sense that parents often fall back on amping up the positivity for the sake of their children--there are a lot of things in the world we want to protect our kids from. But children are often smarter than we expect and are quite in tune with what the people closest to them--their parents--are feeling. There was a time about a year or so ago, for example, when I received some bad news over the phone; I was home with my four-year-old and so I did my best to put on a brave face. She knew immediately something was wrong though, and was confused. When I finally let a few tears out and explained that Mom heard something sad about a friend, she was, of course, just fine. My daughter patted my shoulder, gave me a hug, and went back to playing. She felt better that she was able to help me, and the moment made a lot more sense to her emotionally than a smiling mom holding back sobs. I was glad that I could feel sad momentarily and not have to work hard to hide... Question: The author mentioned the example of her daughter to illustrate _ .

Your eyes can tell you that a glass ball is round. But by holding it in your hands, you can feel how smooth and cool the ball is. You can feel how heavy the glass is. When you feel all these about the ball, you really see it. With your skin, you can feel better. For example, your fingers can tell the difference between two coins in your pocket. You can feel a little drop of water on the back of your hand, too. You can even feel sounds against your skin. Have you ever wanted to know why some people like very loud music? They must like to feel the sounds of music. All children soon learn what \\"Don't touch!\\" means. They hear it often. Yet most of us keep on touching things as we grow up.

You know this when you walk on warm sand, cool grass or a bad floor. All feel different under your feet. There are ways of learning to see well by feeling. One way is to close your eyes and try to feel everything that is touching your skin. Feel the shoes on your feet, the clothes on your body, the air on your skin.

Tonight (1984), another dance-oriented album, found Bowie collaborating with Tina Turner and, once again, Iggy Pop. It included a number of cover songs, among them the 1966 Beach Boys hit \\"God Only Knows\\". The album bore the transatlantic Top 10 hit \\"Blue Jean\\", itself the inspiration for a short film that won Bowie a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video, Jazzin' for Blue Jean. Bowie performed at Wembley Stadium in 1985 for Live Aid, a multi-venue benefit concert for Ethiopian famine relief. During the event, the video for a fundraising single was premiered, Bowie's duet with Mick Jagger. \\"Dancing in the Street\\" quickly went to number one on release. The same year, Bowie worked with the Pat Metheny Group to record \\"This Is Not America\\" for the soundtrack of The Falcon and the Snowman. Released as a single, the song became a Top 40 hit in the UK and US.Bowie was given a role in the 1986 film Absolute Beginners. It was poorly received by critics, but Bowie's theme song, also named \\"Absolute Beginners\\", rose to No. 2 in the UK charts. He also appeared as Jareth, the Goblin King, in the 1986 Jim Henson film Labyrinth, for which he wrote five songs. His final solo album of the decade was 1987's Never Let Me Down, where he ditched the light sound of his previous two albums, instead offering harder rock with an industrial/techno dance edge. Peaking at No. 6 in the UK, the album yielded the hits \\"Day-In, Day-Out\\" (his 60th single), \\"Time Will Crawl\\", and \\"Never Let Me Down\\". Bowie later described it as his \\"nadir\\", calling it \\"an awful album\\". Supporting Never Let Me Down, and preceded by nine promotional press shows, the 86-concert Glass Spider Tour commenced on 30 May. Bowie's backing band included Peter Frampton on lead guitar.

Hasan ibn Ali ibn Muhammad (c. 846 - 874) was the 11th Imam of Twelver Shia Islam, after his father Ali al-Hadi. He was also called Abu Muhammad and Ibn al-Ridha. Because Samarra, the city where he lived, was a garrison town, he is generally known as al-Askari (Askar is the word for military in Arabic). Al-Askari married Narjis Khatun and was kept under house arrest or in prison for most of his life, until, according to some Shia sources, he was poisoned at the age of 28 on the orders of the Abbasid caliph Al-Mu'tamid and was buried in Samarra. Hasan al-Askari was born during a period when his father Ali al-Hadi, the tenth Imam, was suspected of being involved in a conspiracy against the Caliph Al-Mutawakkil. There is doubt as to whether al-Askari was born in Medina or Samarra. According to authentic shia hadith he was born in Medina on the 8th of Rabiul Akhar 232 Hijri (4 December 846 AD) and died in Samarrah Iraq on the 8th of Rabiul Awwal 260 Hijri (4 January 874) aged 28. The period of his imamate was 6 years. He was taken along with his family to Samarra in the year 230, 231 or 232 A.H., and was kept there under house arrest. In Samarra, al-Askari spent most of his time reading the Quran and the Sharia. According to Donaldson, al-Askari must also have studied languages, for in later years it was known that he could speak Hindi with the pilgrims from India, Turkish with the Turks, and Persian with the Persians. According to Shia accounts, however, it is part of the divine knowledge given to all Imams to be able to speak all human languages. It is said that even as a child, al-Askari was endowed with divine knowledge. One day a man passed by him, and saw that he was crying. The man told him he would buy a toy that he might play with. \\"No!\\" said al-Askari, \\"We have not been created for play.\\" The man was amazed at this answer and said, \\"Then, what for have we been created?\\" \\"For knowledge and worship.\\" answered the child. The man said \\"Where have you got this from?\\" Al-Askari said, \\"From the saying of God, Did you then think that We had created you in vain.\\" The man was confused, so he said, \\"What has happened to you while you are guiltless, little child?\\" al-Askari said, \\"Be away from me! I have seen my mother set fire to big pieces of firewood, but fire is not lit except with small pieces, and I fear that I shall be from the small pieces of the firewood of the Hell.\\" Al-Askari's mother, as in the case of the majority of The Twelve Imams, was a slave girl who was honoured after bearing children with the title Umm walad (mother of offspring). Her given name was Hadith, though some say she was called Susan, Ghazala, Salil, or Haribta. Al-Askari had other brothers, and among them was Ja'far who was also known as Ja'far al-Zaki or Jaffar-us-Sani. His other brother was Husayn, and together he and al-Askari were known as \\"as-Sibtayn\\", after their two grandfathers Hasan and Husayn, who were also called as-Sibtayn. Ask a question about this article.","completion":"Who is Hasan al-Askari and why is he important? Hasan al-Askari is a very important person for the Twelver Shia Islam. He was the 11th Imam, which means he was a very special leader who helped guide the Shia Muslims. He was born around 846 and died in 874. He had a lot of knowledge about the Quran and the Islamic rules known as Sharia. Even when he was just a child, he was very wise in understanding why people should be good and worship God. Hasan al-Askari was born during a difficult time when his father, the 10th Imam, was in trouble with a powerful ruler. Hasan was kept under house arrest for most of his life because the ruler was afraid of him and his family. It is said that he could speak many languages and help people from different places understand their religion better. He was called al-Askari because he lived in a city called Samarra, which was known as a military city. Hasan al-Askari eventually died at age 28, and some people believe he was poisoned by the ruler on purpose. His teachings and wisdom are still important for Shia Muslims today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated By Wajahat S. Khan ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — A powerful constitutional body in Pakistan proposed legislation last week that would allow husbands to \\"lightly beat\\" their wives who decline sex or refuse to wear what their mates prefer. The Council of Islamic Ideology says it has to finalize the 160-page draft before it is sent to lawmakers in the Punjab province, the country's most populated region, for approval. As well as beatings for wives who decline to have sex with their husbands, the document also advocates men use \\"limited violence\\" on spouses who do not bathe after intercourse or during menstruation. \\"Do not hit her vindictively, but only for reminding her about her religious duties\\" The council — known as CII — went so far as to provide guidelines on how to inflict the beatings. \\"Hit her in areas where her skin is not too thick and not too thin,\\" CII leader Maulana Muhammad Khan Sherani told a press conference in Islamabad on Thursday. \\"Do not use shoes or a broom on the head, or hit her on the nose or eyes.\\" \\"Do not break any bones or cut her skin or leave any marks,\\" he added. \\"Do not hit her vindictively, but only for reminding her about her religious duties.\\" Moulana Mohammad Khan Sherani Chairman of Council of Islamic Ideology in Pakistan. National Assembly of Pakistan / National Assembly of Pakistan The CII cannot make laws itself but gives suggestions to Pakistan's government and parliament. Already, the proposal has sparked outrage inside the country. \\"This is unbelievable,\\" said Allama Tahir Ashrafi, a former member of the CII who resigned for what he called religious regions. \\"So, what is 'light beating' and 'limited violence'? Not chopping off their heads but only, say, burning them in oil?\\" Ashrafi is now leader of the 110,000-member Pakistani Religious Scholars Council, a group of mullahs who debate Islam and preach. He told NBC News the CII was subverting the very religion it claimed to uphold: \\"Violence is forbidden by Islam, period.\\" He said the council should be speaking \\"about rape, about the increasing divorce rate, about suicide bombing — but they avoid these issues.\\" \\"Violence is forbidden by Islam, period\\" Others have questioned the practicality of the proposals. \\"Will the Maulana [religious scholar] observe every beating himself, personally?\\" said Rana Sanaullah, the Punjab province law minister, in another press conference in Lahore. \\"How will he ensure that 'light beating' doesn't become 'heavy beating'.\\" The draft bill has a step-by-step guide on how to administer these beatings. If a wife disobeys her husband, according to the document, the husband should try to talk to her. If that doesn't work, he should sleep separately and only finally use violence as a last resort. The CII suggests that any man who doesn't follow that process should be prosecuted. Related: Malala Becomes Lightning Rod For Anger in Hometown Pakistan was the first Islamic country to elect a woman to high office, with Benazir Bhutto serving as prime minister in the 80s and 90s before her assassination in 2007. However it consistently ranks as one of the world's worst countries for female employment and education. More than 1,000 \\"honor killings\\" were carried out in Pakistan last year, a practice where women are murdered by their own relatives if they are seen as bringing \\"dishonor\\" on their families. The CII's proposal was in response to an unconventionally liberal move by Pakistan's Punjab province, which pushed for a progressive gender-equality law called the Protection of Women Against Violence Act. The act sought to give women more rights, including fitting violent husbands with electronic tracking bracelets. Rejecting that bill as \\"un-Islamic,\\" the CII proposed its own document instead. The CII's draft bill has to be finalized by the council before it is sent to the provincial legislature for approval. In addition to the beatings, it also seeks to ban women from several aspects of society. Female co-eds? Nope, not after primary school. Women joining combat squads in the armed forces? That would be out too — a far more conservative approach than the country's air force, which has started training women to be fighter pilots. Women also would be barred for nursing male patients in hospital unless it is their husband, son, brother or father. Related: Sister Says Husband Stoned Wife in 'Honor Killing' The proposal does make some paltry concessions for the female population. It says they should be allowed to inherit property and given protection from being kicked out of their houses if their husband dies without a will. Women should not be subjected to forced marriage, acid attacks or honor killings, the draft also states. Still, the list of punishable offenses goes on. The draft said beatings also should be administered to any woman who does not wear a hijab, gives money to other people without her husband’s permission, and talks loudly so the neighbors can hear. Women would also be forced to breastfeed their kids for two years and banned from using contraception without their husband’s permission. \\"Disgusting,\\" human-rights lawyer Asma Jahangir said in an interview with Pakistani television this week. \\"But we shouldn't be worried. The women of Pakistan know how to protect themselves.\\" ||||| The Council of Islamic Ideology advises Pakistan’s government and lawmakers on Islamic issues. Its proposals are recommendations, and not legally enforced. The council drafted the controversial proposal in response to The Women's Protection Act, enacted in the province of Punjab in February, which is intended to improve legal protection to women from domestic, psychological and sexual violence. The CII criticised the Women’s Protection Act as being “un-Islamic”. Its alternative draft proposal, while suggesting some women’s rights be enshrined in law, also says: \\"A husband should be allowed to lightly beat his wife if she defies his commands and refuses to dress up as per his desires; turns down demand for intercourse without any religious excuse; or does not take bath after intercourse or menstrual periods.\\" The proposal also suggests interacting with strangers not wearing a hijab and speaking too loudly among other potential activities that might incur a light beating, the Express Tribune reports. • #GirlsAtDhabas: Pakistani women take selfies in 'male' spaces to promote gender equality |||||","completion":"In Pakistan, a powerful group called the Council of Islamic Ideology has come up with a new set of rules that say husbands can \\"lightly beat\\" their wives.

This group cannot make laws themselves, but they can give ideas to the people who do make laws in Pakistan. Some people in Pakistan are very angry about these new rules, but the leader of the group says they are just reminding wives about their religious duties.

Mention of occasional problems: The reviewer does mention a minor issue, which is the occasional loss of connection.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What was the first name of the person who calculated critical mass of a sphere of uranium in a theoretical paper? Answer the above question based on the context below: At Birmingham, Oliphant's team had reached a different conclusion. Oliphant had delegated the task to two German refugee scientists, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch, who could not work on Oliphant's radar project because they were enemy aliens and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance. Francis Perrin had calculated the critical mass of uranium to be about 40 tonnes (39 long tons; 44 short tons). He reckoned that if a neutron reflector were placed around it, this might be reduced to 12 tonnes (12 long tons; 13 short tons). Peierls attempted to simplify the problem by using the fast neutrons produced by fission, thus omitting consideration of moderator. He too calculated the critical mass of a sphere of uranium in a theoretical paper written in 1939 to be \\"of the order of tons\\".Peierls knew the importance of the size of the critical mass that would allow a chain reaction to take place and its practical significance. In the interior of a critical mass sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material. A very small portion of these neutrons are colliding with other nuclei, while a larger portion of the neutrons are escaping through the surface of the sphere. Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping.Niels Bohr had theorised that the rare uranium-235 isotope, which makes up only about 0.7% of natural uranium, was primarily responsible for fission with fast neutrons, although this was not yet universally accepted. Frisch and Peierls were thus able to revise their initial estimate of critical mass needed for nuclear fission in uranium to be substantially less than previously assumed. They estimated a metallic sphere of uranium-235 with a radius of 2.1 centimetres (0.83 in) could suffice. This amount represented approximately 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of uranium-235. These results led to the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which was the initial step in the development of the nuclear arms programme in Britain. This... The answer to this question is:","completion":"Rudolf. The first name of the person who calculated the critical mass of a sphere of uranium in a theoretical paper is Rudolf, as it was Rudolf Peierls who worked on this calculation along with Otto Frisch."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the best way to: How to make instant noodles","completion":"Making instant noodles is a relatively easy and quick task. Here are the steps I would suggest: 1. **Gather Your Materials**: The basic materials needed would be instant noodle package, a pot, a stove or electronic cooker, water, and a fork or chopsticks to stir and eat the noodles. These materials should be easily accessible in your kitchen. Justification: It's important to gather all required materials before starting the process in order to avoid rushing around or getting delayed once you've started cooking. 2. **Read the Instructions**: Despite most instant noodles being prepared similarly, they can have slight differences in instructions. Hence, it's best to familiarize yourself with the specific instructions for your preferred brand. Justification: Examining the instructions ensures that you're aware of any special cooking times or techniques that might need to be applied. 3. **Boil the Water**: The next step would be to pour the recommended amount of water into the pot. Typically, the water volume varies from 300ml to 500ml depending on the brand. Then, put the pot over medium or high heat until the water is boiling. Justification: Boiling water is a fundamental step in the preparation of instant noodles. The boiling water cooks the noodles and helps to release their flavor. 4. **Add the Noodles**: Once the water has reached a rolling boil, carefully add the noodles from the package to the pot. You may break the noodle block into pieces if you prefer smaller bites. Justification: This step focuses on cooking the actual noodle. Instant noodles are pre-cooked then dried, so boiling them makes them spring back to life. 5. **Add the Flavorings**: Most instant noodles come with a packet of flavoring. Open the seasoning packet(s) from the package and add to the boiling water and noodles. Justification: The flavoring packets are what give instant noodles their taste. Adding them while the noodles are boiling helps to ensure that the flavor is evenly distributed. 6. **Stir and Let it Cook**: Stir the noodles and flavoring (with a fork or chopsticks) and then let it cook for about 2-5 minutes (or per the instructions). Be sure to stir occasionally to prevent the noodles from sticking to the pot, and also to distribute the seasoning. Justification: This is when the noodles cook and soak up the seasoning. It's important to stir to avoid noodles sticking to each other or the pot and to ensure even flavor distribution. 7. **Check Noodles and Serve**: Check the noodles to see if they are at your preferred level of softness. Once done, carefully pour the noodles and soup into a bowl. Be mindful of the steam. Justification: Checking the noodles will ensure they are cooked to your preference. Also, serving the noodles and broth in a bowl makes it easier to eat. Remember, you can customize your instant noodles as you like, by adding extras such as vegetables, chicken, eggs, spices or herbs, etc. This concludes the steps to prepare instant noodles in the best possible way from a basic perspective."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Reaching high levels of professional and financial success at any cost has been the modern-day Mecca to multitudes of business men and women for several decades. Unfortunately, the attainment of such an all-consuming goal has not produced the peace and happiness that was expected. There was a dark side to success. Fairly recently, the question of balance and its impact on mental health and happiness has taken center stage in many circles of psychological research. Dozens of studies have been conducted and published on the subject as companies and individuals alike have noticed that their chaotic lifestyle has not produced the happiness they hoped to achieve. The cost has greatly outweighed the benefits. The majority of these studies agree on one thing – there is potential for incredible benefits from living a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences rather than living with an all-consuming focus on career. The studies also included some important findings about the effects of stress. Stress is not always detrimental to health and happiness. In fact, a bit of stress here and there is actually healthy, for both plants and animals – it stimulates growth and development. It depends on the source of the stress, how relentles it is, and how it is managed. The danger comes when relentless stress pounds the mind and body and the individuals accept it as the norm. They cope with it the best they can; but allow no time for recovery from the depletion of resources. Professional burnout from chronic stress debilitates the individual to the point that s/he can no longer function effectively on a personal or professional level. Psychology Today tells us that “Burnout is one of those road hazards in life that high-achievers really should be keeping a close eye out for, but sadly – often because of their “I can do everything” personalities, they rarely see it coming.” Question: Those who focus mainly on their career are probably: Options: A. As stressed as most people B. Less stressed than most people C. More stressed than most people D. not enough information === The correct answer is A:","completion":"C. More stressed than most people The text strongly points towards the hypothesis that those who have an all-consuming focus on their career, often at the expense of other areas of their lives, are likely experiencing a higher level of stress than many other people. The text refers to the \\"dark side of success\\", and alludes to a chaotic lifestyle dominated by career pursuit which has not produced the happiness they hoped to achieve. The focus on professional and financial success to the detriment of balance and varied experiences, according to the studies cited, contributes to a level of stress that can interfere with personal happiness and mental well-being. This stress extends into a discussion of burnout - a state of emotional, mental, and often physical exhaustion caused by prolonged or repeated stress. The quote from Psychology Today emphasizes that high-achievers, the ones perceived as those with an intense focus on their career, are prone to burnout and stress because they are often not aware that they are en-route to it due to their \\"I can do everything\\" attitude. The text does acknowledge that a certain level of stress can be beneficial as it can stimulate growth and development, but it is important to note that this is in moderation and not when it becomes relentless and without time for recovery. The harmful stress, as discussed in this context, seems to be particularly prevalent in those who focus intensively on their careers and likely contributes to them being more stressed than the majority of people. Therefore, the best choice considering the context would be option C. More stressed than most people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the “eighth wonder of the world.” The version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there’s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice’s major waterway. The Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge. Beginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge’s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge. Andrea Palladio’s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte’s. According to the above context, answer the following question. Andrea believes that: Answer:","completion":"Andrea believes that a design with three arches for the Rialto Bridge would be suitable, as seen in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, published in 1570.

If you're like most people, you eat it. Maybe you follow the \\"5-second rule\\", which claims foods are safe to eat if you pick them up within 5 seconds after dropping them. But you might want to think again. Scientists now say that 5 seconds is all it takes for foods to become polluted with enough bacteria to make you sick. Bacteria can cause many kinds of illnesses. Some kinds of bacteria can grow on food. If you eat foods on which these bacteria are growing, you can become sick. One of these food-borne bacteria is Salmonella. It makes 1.4 million people sick every year. Salmonella is often found in raw eggs and chicken. Cooking kills these bacteria, which is why it is so important to cook eggs, chicken, and other foods thoroughly. But how long does it take these bacteria to pollute food? A team of scientists in South Carolina did an experiment. First, they placed an amount of Salmonella on three surfaces; wood, tile , and carpet. They placed a piece of bread and a piece of bologna on each surface for 5,30, or 60 seconds. After just 5 seconds, both the bread and the bologna picked up enough bacteria to make you sick.

The Oscar-winner was speaking in front of an audience at the Hamptons Film Festival on Saturday when she made her remark. Ms Sarandon was recounting the time she sent a copy of Sister Helen Prejean's book Dead Man Walking - the film adaptation of which she starred in and won an Oscar for - to 'the Pope' in the mid-1990s. Controversy: Susan Sarandon onstage at the Hamptons Film Festival in New York on Saturday. During the interview she called Pope Benedict XVI a 'Nazi' She clarified that she was referring to Pope John Paul II by adding: 'The last one, not this Nazi one we have now.' When her interviewer, actor Bob Batalan,. gently chided her for the remark, Ms Sarandon again repeated it to a. quiet murmur of laughter from the crowd. But Catholic groups have been quick to hit out at the 65-year-old, saying her quip 'bespeaks unparalleled ignorance'. Pope Benedict, 84, was born Joseph Ratzinger in Marktl, Germany, in 1927. As a 14-year-old during World War Two, he was forced into the Hitler Youth, even though his Bavarian parents despised the Third Reich. In 2006, a year after his election as pontiff, he visited the Auschwitz death camp where he expressed horror at the Holocaust. He also said that the Nazis, by attempting to destroy the Jews, were striking at the root of the Catholic faith. Catholic League president Bill Donohue said: 'Joseph Ratzinger [the Pope] was conscripted into the Nazi Youth the way every other 14-year-old German boy was at the time. 'Unlike most others, he not only refused to go to the compulsory meetings, he actually deserted the Hitler Youth. 'Which is precisely why Jews today regard him as a friend, not as an enemy.' The Anti-Defamation League, which fights anti-Semitism, called on Sarandon to apologise to the Catholic Community. In a statement, it said: 'Ms Sarandon. may have her differences with the Catholic Church, but that is no. excuse for throwing around Nazi analogies. 'Such words are hateful, vindictive and only serve to diminish the true history and meaning of the Holocaust.' Ms Sarandon, who was raised in New York. as a Roman Catholic, is known for her support of causes ranging from. hunger and Aids to opposing the U.S.-led war in Iraq. She was appointed a.

During his life, he worked as a poet, essayist, journalist, translator, professor, and publisher. He was very politically active, and is considered an important revolutionary philosopher and political theorist. Through his writings and political activity, he became a symbol of Cuba's bid for independence against Spain in the 19th century, and is referred to as the \\"Apostle of Cuban Independence.\\" January 12, 1895, the North American authorities stopped the steamship Lagonda and two other suspicious ships, Amadis, and Baracoa at the Fernandina port in Florida, confiscating weapons and ruining Plan de Fernandina (Fernandina Plan). On January 29, Marti drew up the order of the uprising, signing it with general Jose Maria Rodriguez and Enrique Collazo. Juan Gualberto Gomez was assigned to orchestrate war preparations for La Habana Province, and was able to work right under the noses of the relatively unconcerned Spanish authorities. Marti decided to move to Montecristi, Dominican Republic to join Maximo Gomez and to plan out the uprising. The uprising finally took place on February 24, 1895. A month later, Marti and Maximo Gomez declared the Manifesto de Montecristi, an \\"exposition of the purposes and principles of the Cuban revolution\\". Marti had persuaded Gomez to lead an expedition into Cuba. Before leaving for Cuba, Marti wrote his \\"literary will\\" on April 1, 1895, leaving his personal papers and manuscripts to Gonzalo de Quesada, with instructions for editing. Knowing that the majority of his writing in newspapers in Honduras, Uruguay, and Chile would disappear over time, Marti instructed Quesada to arrange his papers in volumes. The volumes were to be arranged in the following way: volumes one and two, North Americas; volume three, Hispanic Americas; volume four, North American Scenes; volume five, Books about the Americas (this included both North and South America); volume six, Literature, education and painting. Another volume included his poetry. The expedition, composed of Marti, Gomez, Angel Guerra, Francisco Borreo, Cesar Salas and Marcos del Rosario, left Montecristi for Cuba on April 1, 1895. Despite delays and desertion by some members, they got to Cuba. They landed at Playitas, near Cape Maisi and Imias, Cuba, on April 11. Once there, they made contact with the Cuban rebels, who were headed by the Maceo brothers, and started fighting against Spanish troops. The revolt did not go as planned, \\"mainly because the call to revolution received no immediate, spontaneous support from the masses.\\" By May 13, the expedition reached Dos Rios. On May 19, Gomez faced Ximenez de Sandoval's troops and ordered Marti to stay rearguard, but Marti separated from the bulk of the Cuban forces, and entered the Spanish line.

Once they arrived, they met with Cuban rebels led by the Maceo brothers and started fighting against the Spanish forces. The revolt didn't go as they planned because not many people immediately joined their cause. Martí and Gómez continued to lead their forces against the Spanish soldiers.

Information: - A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the flowering plant genus \\"Vitis\\". - Pseudoperonospora is a genus of water moulds which includes several species known for causing downy mildew infections on plants . Species include : Pseudoperonospora cannabina - causes downy mildew on hemp Pseudoperonospora cubensis - causes downy mildew on cucurbits Pseudoperonospora humuli - causes downy mildew on hops - In everyday usage, a vegetable is any part of a plant that is consumed by humans as food as part of a savory meal. The term \\"vegetable\\" is somewhat arbitrary, and largely defined through culinary and cultural tradition. It normally excludes other food derived from plants such as fruits, nuts, and cereal grains, but includes seeds such as pulses. The original meaning of the word \\"vegetable\\", still used in biology, was to describe all types of plant, as in the terms \\"vegetable kingdom\\" and \\"vegetable matter\\". - Downy mildew refers to any of several types of oomycete microbes that are obligate parasites of plants. Downy mildews exclusively belong to Peronosporaceae. In commercial agriculture, they are a particular problem for growers of crucifers, grapes and vegetables that grow on vines. The prime example is \\"Peronospora farinosa\\" featured in NCBI-Taxonomy and HYP3. This pathogen does not produce survival structures in the northern states of the United States, and overwinters as live mildew colonies in Gulf Coast states. It progresses northward with cucurbit production each spring. Yield loss associated with downy mildew is most likely related to soft rots that occur after plant canopies collapse and sunburn occurs on fruit. Cucurbit downy mildew only affects leaves of cucurbit plants. - Peronosporaceae are a family of water moulds that contains 17 genera, comprising more than 600 species. Most of them are called downy mildews. The closest relative of Peronosporaceae is \\"Phytophthora\\". - Oomycota or oomycetes form a distinct phylogenetic lineage of fungus-like eukaryotic microorganisms. They are filamentous, microscopic, absorptive organisms that reproduce both sexually and asexually. Oomycetes occupy both saprophytic and pathogenic lifestyles, and include some of the most notorious pathogens of plants, causing devastating diseases such as late blight of potato and sudden oak death. One oomycete, the mycoparasite \\"Pythium oligandrum\\", is used for biocontrol, attacking plant pathogenic fungi. The oomycetes are also often referred to as water molds (or water moulds), although the water-preferring nature which led to that name is not true of most species, which are terrestrial pathogens. The Oomycota have a very sparse fossil record. A possible oomycete has been described from Cretaceous amber. - Agriculture is the cultivation and breeding of animals, plants and fungi for food, fiber, biofuel, medicinal plants and other products used to sustain and enhance human life. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization. The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science. The history of agriculture dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and technologies. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture farming has become the dominant agricultural methodology. - Peronospora farinosa is a plant pathogen.

Given the background: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally). and the situation: Two neighboring dairy farms produced milk for half the state. Berry farm produced conventional milk, while Rose farm produced organic milk. Answer the following question: Which farm had milk production which reduced leaching of nitrates? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Rose farm had milk production which reduced leaching of nitrates.

Article: Analysis of the composition of quicksand shows that there are four key ingredients--sand, obviously water, clay and salt. Together these materials form a structure resembling a house of cards, with large water-filled gaps between the sand particles, which are loosely glued in place by the clay. As long as it's left alone, the structure remains stable. But as soon as it's disturbed, by stepping on it, the clay changes from a jelly-like consistency to a runny liquid. The effect is the same as stirring a pot of yoghurt. Liquefying the clay makes the quicksand about one million times runnier, and the whole house of cards comes tumbling down, with you inside it. Very quickly, the sand sinks to the bottom and the water floats to the top. This is where the salt comes in. When there's enough salt present, as soon as the clay particles liquefy, electrical charges make them begin to stick together to form bigger particles and these also settle with the sand. Quicksand is a mixture which looks like solid, but behaves more like a liquid. Despite its murderous reputation, quicksand does not such people under and swallow them, although it can hold a person in firm grip. The human body is more buoyant in quicksand than in water, and sooner or later anyone trapped in it will float. Unlike most liquids, quicksand's viscosity, or \\"runniness\\" can suddenly change if it comes under pressure, for example under a human foot. The surface gives way and the victim quickly sinks in up to the knees, surrounded by an area of dirty things that turns semi-solid around its victim. Escaping from the quicksand's grip requires a large amount of force. Without something solid to pull at, people often find they are stuck fast. Pulling at one leg simply makes the other one sink further. So how do you escape from quicksand's control? Stay still and call for help. Staying still stops you sinking any further, until--with luck--help arrives on the scene. If no one appears and you need to draw yourself out, gently lie down on your back until your...

Context: SEOUL — South Korean Foreign Minister Kang, Kyung-wha said on Wednesday that the U.S. and South Korea jointly made the decision to suspend combined military exercises scheduled for August, but would not confirm if her government was given advanced notice before U.S. President Trump announced his intention to cancel the drills, after he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12. “We have made it clear that this is a goodwill gesture to strengthen the dialogue momentum at this point, but they are not irreversible. They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site. North Korea has long called for the end of these joint military exercises that it says are offensive “rehearsals for war.” In the past U.S. officials refused to suspend the joint drills, that they defended as defensive in nature...

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? how to keep chopped vegetables from becoming slimy","completion":"To prevent chopped vegetables from becoming slimy, one can follow these steps: 1. Choose fresh vegetables: Ensure that you select fresh, high-quality vegetables that show no signs of rot or decay. Fresh vegetables will remain in good condition for a longer period of time. 2. Wash vegetables thoroughly: Rinse the vegetables under cold running water to remove any dirt, bacteria, or pesticide residues. This will help keep them fresher and prevent bacterial growth that can contribute to sliminess. 3. Dry the vegetables: After washing, pat the vegetables dry with a clean paper towel or kitchen towel. Excess moisture can cause the vegetables to become slimy or encourage bacterial growth. 4. Use sharp knives: When chopping vegetables, use a sharp knife. This will help prevent bruising or crushing the vegetable cells, releasing more liquid and increasing the chances of sliminess. 5. Store vegetables properly: Keep the chopped vegetables in a clean airtight container or sealable plastic bag to protect them from air exposure, which can cause oxidation and deterioration. 6. Place a paper towel in the container: Put a dry paper towel at the bottom of the container or bag before adding the chopped vegetables. The paper towel will absorb excess moisture, further preventing sliminess. 7. Refrigerate the vegetables: Store the airtight container or sealed plastic bag with the chopped vegetables in the refrigerator. Cold temperatures slow down the bacterial growth and enzymatic activities, helping maintain the freshness of the vegetables. 8. Consume quickly: Use your chopped vegetables as soon as possible. The longer they're stored, the greater the chance that they will become slimy. 9. Avoid overcooking: Cook the vegetables for the appropriate amount of time, and don't overcook them. Overcooking can cause the vegetables to break down and release more moisture. By following these steps, chopped vegetables can be kept fresh and free from sliminess for a reasonable amount of time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the person that said \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\"? is inside the article: During the 1913 Ballets Russes season in Paris, Monteux conducted two more premieres. The first was Jeux, with music by Debussy and choreography by Nijinsky. The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano: I decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did. Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was \\"now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all. I had pleasure in conducting the fiftieth anniversary of Le Sacre this spring\\"., can you guess it ?","completion":"The name of the person who said \\"I did not like Le Sacre then.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"how can an animal learn actions?\\" is \\"chemical energy\\", given that actions can be learned through play? 1). Yes. 2). No. Answer:","completion":"2). No. The right answer to the question \\"how can an animal learn actions?\\" is not \\"chemical energy.\\" While chemical energy is involved in the process, as it is needed for the functioning of an animal's body and brain, it is not the core mechanism by which animals learn actions. Animals learn actions primarily through several different mechanisms: 1. Observational learning: Animals can learn by observing the behaviors and actions of other animals. They watch and imitate the actions of their peers or parents to learn new behaviors and skills. 2. Play: As you mentioned, play is an essential method through which animals learn actions. Play allows animals to practice and refine their motor skills, social interactions, and problem-solving abilities. 3. Trial and error: Animals can learn actions by trying different strategies and learning from their mistakes. Through trial and error, animals can figure out which behaviors lead to favorable outcomes and adapt their actions accordingly. 4. Classical and operant conditioning: Animals can learn actions through conditioning, where they associate specific behaviors with certain consequences. Classical conditioning involves forming associations between stimuli, while operant conditioning involves learning from the consequences of their actions. 5. Habituation and sensitization: These are processes through which animals adapt their responses to stimuli. Habituation reduces the response to repeated and irrelevant stimuli, while sensitization increases the response to important stimuli. In summary, the answer to the question \\"how can an animal learn actions?\\" is through various mechanisms like observational learning, play, trial and error, conditioning, and habituation/sensitization. Chemical energy is a factor in these processes, but it is not the correct answer in itself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer:","completion":"Ira Gruber is a prominent military historian who has extensively researched and written about the American Revolutionary War, a colonial revolt that began in 1775 and ended in 1783. Over these eight years, thirteen British colonies in North America joined together to form the United States of America by breaking away from the rule of the British Empire. The Revolutionary War is also referred to as the American War of Independence. During this period, the colonies faced a series of military, economic, and political challenges while fighting for their independence. The initial battles at Lexington and Concord took place in April 1775, marking the beginning of the military conflict. The situation escalated with the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, in which the thirteen colonies declared themselves independent states no longer under British rule. Numerous battles and skirmishes occurred between British forces and American colonists during the following years. Major events of this colonial revolt included the Battle of Bunker Hill, the Battle of Long Island, the Battle of Saratoga, the Battle of Brandywine, and the Siege of Yorktown. The war featured significant military leaders such as George Washington, Nathanael Greene, Marquis de Lafayette, and Benedict Arnold from the American side, while British commanders included Sir William Howe, Lord Charles Cornwallis, and Sir Henry Clinton. The Treaty of Paris, signed on September 3, 1783, officially marked the end of the American Revolutionary War. In the treaty, Great Britain recognized the independence and sovereignty of the United States and agreed to a series of territorial changes, including ceding several territories to the newly formed nation. The war had lasting consequences, setting the stage for American politics and development in the years to come.

Would the answer to the question \\"What English physician was born on January 18 , 1779 and went on to create two important inventions ?\\" be an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric value?","completion":"The answer to the question \\"What English physician was born on January 18, 1779, and went on to create two important inventions?\\" is a human entity. The person in question is Sir Humphry Davy, an English chemist and inventor who made significant contributions to the fields of chemistry and physics. Sir Humphry Davy, born on January 18, 1779, in Penzance, Cornwall, England, is particularly known for discovering several chemical elements, including potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium, among others, using a process called electrolysis. His experiments and findings greatly expanded the understanding of chemistry and the nature of elements during the early 19th century. Davy's two most notable inventions are the Davy lamp and the development of electrolysis. 1. Davy Lamp: Created in 1815, the Davy lamp was a revolutionary invention in the field of mining. It was designed as a safety lamp to be used in coal mines to prevent explosions caused by the presence of \\"fire-damp,\\" a flammable gas composed mainly of methane. The lamp featured a wire-gauze surrounding the flame that prevented the ignition of the flammable gas outside the gauze, thus reducing the risk of explosions and making mining operations safer. 2. Electrolysis: Although not an invention in the traditional sense, Davy's development of electrolysis was an important innovation in the field of chemistry. In 1800, Alessandro Volta introduced the first electric battery, known as the \\"Voltaic Pile.\\" Using this source of electric current, Davy conducted a series of experiments where he passed the current through various substances which would break down into their constituent elements. This process, now known as electrolysis, helps scientists identify and isolate different elements, and played a substantial role in the advancement of inorganic chemistry. In conclusion, Sir Humphry Davy was a remarkable English physician, chemist, and inventor who was born on January 18, 1779. His lasting contributions to the fields of chemistry and physics, as well as his development of life-saving mining equipment, make him a notable human entity within scientific history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Find the relationship between cost, selling price, and profit. Given that the profit is 110% of the cost. So, Profit = 110% of Cost Which means Profit = 1.1 * Cost Step 2: Calculate the new cost. Given the cost increases by 12%. So, New Cost = Cost + (12% of Cost) New Cost = Cost * (1 + 0.12) New Cost = 1.12 * Cost Step 3: Calculate new profit. The selling price remains constant; we can form an equation as follows: Selling Price = Cost + Profit Since profit remains constant, we can use the previously calculated Profit: Selling Price = Cost + 1.1 * Cost Selling Price = 2.1 * Cost Now find the new profit: New Profit = Selling Price - New Cost New Profit = 2.1 * Cost - 1.12 * Cost New Profit = 0.98 * Cost Step 4: Find the percentage of the selling price that is the new profit. Percentage = (New Profit / Selling Price) * 100 Percentage = (0.98 * Cost / 2.1 * Cost) * 100 Percentage ≈ 46.67 % Since the closest option to this value is 47%, the answer is: b) 47%"},{"prompt":"Definition: You are given a sentence in Persian.

Answer the following question: According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \\"rogue planets\\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements: John is an amateur astronomer. Last week he was observing the sky with his telescope. First he pointed his telescope at planet Mars. He noted it as case A. Then he pointed his telescope to planet Jupiter, which is farther form the Sun than Mars is. He noted it as case C. Finally, he pointed the telescope to a faraway planet called WASP-17b. He noted that as case B. Which case would see faster movement, case A or case C? Answer:","completion":"Case A would see faster movement. This is because Mars is closer to the Sun than Jupiter, and as stated, a planet's speed increases the closer it is to its star due to the stronger gravitational pull. Thus, when John observed Mars (case A), it would be moving faster than Jupiter (case C)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

An 18-year-old female orca named Unna died at SeaWorld San Antonio on Monday, park staff announced in a statement. The whale suffered from a fungal infection of the bladder called Candida, and had been receiving medical treatment of late. Candida, which causes lesions to appear near orifices on the body, occurs in both wild and captive populations of cetaceans (whales and dolphins). However, as the blog of a group of former SeaWorld trainers-turned-activists points out, it’s likely that stressors from life in captivity could have weakened the whale’s ability to fight off the infection. The park said that it was “saddened” at the whale’s death, adding that it will “cancel all the killer whale shows at SeaWorld San Antonio today.” SeaWorld’s animal care has been under extreme scrutiny lately, with outrage from the documentary “Blackfish” fueling a movement against the park. Unna is the third whale to die in just six months at the company’s chain of parks. At the San Diego park, local authorities have become so fed up with the park’s practices that the California Coastal Commission only approved a 100 million expansion projects under the condition that the park stop breeding orca whales. [Image via Getty] ||||| In this Nov. 30, 2006, file photo, Kasatka the killer whale performs during SeaWorld’s Shamu show in San Diego. (Chris Park/AP) When SeaWorld San Antonio announced the death of an 18-year-old killer whale this week, it sounded a lot like a somber broken record. “We are saddened to share the passing of Unna today,” the park’s statement said. Unna suffered from an infection from a resistant strain of fungus called Candida. The whale had been in serious condition and under around-the-clock care, although the exact cause of her death has yet to be determined. The life expectancy of a female killer whale ranges from 30 to 50 years. In her passing, Unna joins two other whales that have died at the park in the past six months. November saw the death of Stella, a beluga whale that was being treated for gastrointestinal problems. And in July, SeaWorld-goers mourned a newborn beluga who died after being born premature. The succession of deaths is raising eyebrows as SeaWorld has faced increasing scrutiny since the 2013 documentary “Blackfish,” which detailed the circumstances of orcas who live and perform at the company’s parks. The film focuses on the life of Tilikum, an orca at SeaWorld Orlando that killed one of his trainers and is associated with two other deaths. SeaWorld Antonio is accustomed by now to questions about its conduct. In fact, it preempted them with a “Frequently Asked Questions”-style addendum to the announcement of Unna’s death. The queries posed and answered include: “Some have claimed that SeaWorld has unbalanced water disinfection with high levels of chlorine. Is that true?,” “Activists claim that Unna’s immune system was compromised from stress, making her more susceptible to infections and ultimately causing her death. How do you respond to that?” and “We saw that SeaWorld Antonio had three whales die in six months. Is something wrong with the animals or the care they are receiving?” In response to the last, the park iterated that the deaths have no connection to each other. “After a review of each of these cases, none of the issues were related to each other, or to the care that the animals received, which is the care that SeaWorld is world-renowned for,” the release said. According to SeaWorld’s website, Unna began undergoing treatment as early as September, and received a medication that had never before been used on killer whales. This “novel treatment plan” was developed by SeaWorld veterinarians working with kidney and fungal experts from around the country. This plan was devised after Unna didn’t respond to conventional therapies. Her condition fluctuated over the months, and it was unclear whether she was responding well to the new treatment, which is commonly used on humans suffering from fungal infections. “We have no evidence that Unna was stressed from her environment,” the release said. It has been 25 years since a killer whale in SeaWorld’s care last died of a Candida infection. Unna’s passing caps a year of — some might say crippling — change for the marine park company. [The fate of SeaWorld’s ‘Shamu’ show was forecast by the very first whale performers] In this Nov. 30, 2006, file photo, four killer whales, including Kasatka and her calf, Kalia, leap out of the water while performing during SeaWorld’s Shamu show in San Diego. (Chris Park/AP) SeaWorld’s San Diego location announced in November that would be phasing out its controversial trademark “Shamu” shows, theatrical performances featuring trained orcas. A month before that, the California Coastal Commission banned the breeding of killer whales in captivity at the same time that it approved an expansion of SeaWorld San Diego’s killer whale habitat. The new regulations also restrict the sale, trade or transfer of orcas, though SeaWorld can still house beached and rescued animals approved by the government. The biggest blow was the breeding prohibition, which may mean that SeaWorld’s current crop of 11 killer whales will be its last. Prior to 2015, SeaWorld was already suffering declining revenue and attendance, in part as a result of the “Free Tilly” movement that emerged from “Blackfish.” Formerly loyal parkgoers began to see SeaWorld’s treatment of its whales as dangerous to both the animals and the humans who cared for them. SeaWorld San Antonio’s preemptive responses to questions about Unna’s death is reminiscent of an even lengthier document the company published in the lead-up to the release of “Blackfish.” The statement, sent to 50 film critics, pushed back against many of the points in the documentary, principally the notion that SeaWorld often neglected its animals for the sake of its bottom line. “We sleep and breath care of animals,” Kelly Flaherty Clark, a SeaWorld employee who works with Tilikum, told the New York Times. She said her testimony at an Occupational Safety and Health Administration hearing, at which SeaWorld was cited for violating safety regulations, was taken out of context and did not accurately represent her views. The public relations campaign ultimately did little to temper “Blackfish”-related fallout, which prompted the resignation of then-CEO Jim Atchison in December 2014. [A world of trouble for SeaWorld] The responses to SeaWorld’s Facebook announcement of Unna’s death were largely sympathetic. “I’m so sorry,” user Karen Kuchar wrote. “I just visited SeaWorld, and it’s obvious how much the trainers and workers love the whales and animals. It’s like losing a family member. Thank you Sea World for doing all you can, and for the great work you do.” More from Morning Mix A father’s desperate — but dangerous — strategy to keep his ‘brain dead’ son on life support #NotMyAbuela: Hillary Clinton offens some with ‘grandma’ pitch to Latinos U.S. keeps British Muslim family headed to Disneyland out of the country ||||| Summary:","completion":"An 18-year-old killer whale named Unna died at SeaWorld San Antonio last week from a Candida fungal infection. This marks the third whale death at the company's chain of parks in the past six months. SeaWorld has come under increased scrutiny since the release of the 2013 documentary, Blackfish, which detailed the circumstances of orcas living in captivity. As a result, SeaWorld San Antonio has faced questions about its practices, leading the park to issue a Frequently Asked Questions addendum to its announcement of Unna's death. Critics argue that stress from a life in captivity could have weakened Unna's immune system, making her more susceptible to an infection, but park officials maintain that the animal's welfare was never at risk."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, better known by the alias Lenin ( 21 January 1924), was a Russian communist revolutionary, politician, and political theorist. He served as head of government of the Russian Republic from 1917 to 1918, of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from 1918 to 1924, and of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1924. Under his administration, Russia and then the wider Soviet Union became a one-party socialist state governed by the Russian Communist Party. Ideologically a Marxist, he developed political theories known as Leninism. Born to a wealthy middle-class family in Simbirsk, Lenin embraced revolutionary socialist politics following his brother's execution in 1887. Expelled from Kazan Imperial University for participating in protests against the Russian Empire's Tsarist regime, he devoted the following years to a law degree. He moved to Saint Petersburg in 1893 and became a senior figure in the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). In 1897, he was arrested for sedition and exiled to Shushenskoye for three years, where he married Nadezhda Krupskaya. After his exile, he moved to Western Europe, where he became a prominent party theorist through his publications. In 1903, he took a key role in a RSDLP ideological split, leading the Bolshevik faction against Julius Martov's Mensheviks. Encouraging insurrection during Russia's failed Revolution of 1905, he later campaigned for the First World War to be transformed into a Europe-wide proletarian revolution, which as a Marxist he believed would cause the overthrow of capitalism and its replacement with socialism. After the 1917 February Revolution ousted the Tsar and established a Provisional Government, he returned to Russia to play a leading role in the October Revolution, in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the new regime. Lenin's government was led by the Bolsheviksnow renamed the Communist Partywith some powers initially also held by elected soviets. The new government called elections for the Constituent Assembly and... - A communist party is a political party that advocates the application of the social and economic principles of communism through state policy. The name originates from the 1848 tract \\"Manifesto of the Communist Party\\" by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. According to Leninist theory, a Communist party is the vanguard party of the working class (proletariat), whether ruling or non-ruling, but when such a party is in power in a specific country, the party is said to be the highest authority of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Vladimir Lenin's theories on the role of a Communist party were developed as the early 20th-century Russian social democracy divided into Bolshevik (meaning \\"\\"of the majority\\"\\") and Menshevik (meaning \\"of the minority\\") factions. Lenin, leader of the Bolsheviks, argued that a revolutionary party should be a small vanguard party with a centralized political command and a strict cadre policy; the Menshevik faction, however, argued that the party should be a broad-based mass movement. The Bolshevik party, which eventually became the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, took power in Russia after the October Revolution in 1917. With the creation of the Communist International, the Leninist concept of party building was copied by emerging Communist parties worldwide. - Uruguay, officially the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, is a country in the southeastern region of South America.

Right now, 'j' is being multiplied by -166. So, we need to do the opposite operation, which is dividing, to get rid of the -166. Let's divide both sides of the equation by -166. 3652 ÷ -166 = (-166 * j) ÷ -166 This simplifies the equation to: -22 = j So the solution to the math problem is j = -22.

Article: Some scientists have suggested that it might in some cases be ethically acceptable to clone existing people. One possibility is generating replacement for a dying . All such possibilities, however, raise the concern that the clone would be treated as less than a complete individual, because he or she would likely suffer from limitations and expectations based on the family's knowledge of the genetic \\"twin.\\" Those expectations might be false, because human personality is only partly determined by genes. The clone of an extrovert could have a quite different way of behavior. Clones of athletes, movie stars, or scientists might well choose different careers because of chance events in early life. Some people have also put forward the belief that couples in which one member is infertile might choose to make a copy of one or the other partner. But society ought to be concerned that a couple might not treat naturally a child who is a copy of just one of them. Because other methods are available for the treatment of all known types of infertility, the traditional choice seems more appropriate. None of the suggested uses of cloning for making copies of existing people is ethically acceptable to my way of thinking, because they are not in the interests of the resulting child. It should go without saying that I am strongly opposed to allowing cloned human embryos to develop so that they can be tissue donors.

Reciting a completely memorized speech can feel stiff, so just commit the content to memory well enough that you can explain your ideas clearly and consistently. While it’s generally okay to use slightly different phrasing, try to stick to your complete outline as best you can. If you veer off too much or insert too many additional words, you could end up exceeding your time limit. Keep in mind your speaking outline will help you stay focused.

In addition to projecting confidence, good posture will help you breathe deeply to support your voice. Once you’ve committed the speech to memory, work on making your delivery as engaging as possible. Watch yourself in a mirror or record yourself to make sure you appear confident and natural. Get a second opinion and ask a friend or relative to watch you and offer feedback. Have them point out any spots that dragged or seemed disorganized.

Although As I Lay Dying has stated on numerous occasions that all of the members of the group are practicing Christians, the band is usually described by media as being in the metalcore genre, not Christian metal. The band's lyrics do not focus on Christian themes the way many praise music bands do, nor do they treat their music as a direct extension of their private Christian worship or proselytizing efforts. For example, not once do the names God or Jesus appear in any As I Lay Dying song, nor do any of their songs explicitly invoke Christian doctrine or quote the Bible. Most songs tend to address broader spiritual concepts like existential angst or the struggle between reason and spirituality. Lyricist and lead singer Tim Lambesis has given mixed commentary on the subject: asked in 2008 if the members were \\"a Christian band\\" or \\"Christians in a band\\", Lambesis stated on the band's FAQ, \\"I'm not sure what the difference is between five Christians playing in a band and a Christian band, If you truly believe something, then it should affect every area of your life. All five of us are Christians. I believe that change should start with me first, and as a result, our lyrics do not come across very 'preachy.' Many of our songs are about life, struggles, mistakes, relationships and other issues that don't fit entirely in the spiritual category. However, all of these topics are written about through my perspective as a Christian.\\" Furthermore, during an August 2010 radio interview on the Christian metal radio show The Full Armor of God Broadcast, Lambesis stated \\"I can only really write about what I'm passionate about in life, so naturally my faith, my belief in the teachings of Jesus and His resurrection come across in our lyrics.\\" However, in later years, Lambesis showed an increasing philosophical skepticism towards Christianity and religion in general: Court documents stated Lambesis emailed his wife Meggan in August 2012, while on tour with As I Lay Dying, asking for a divorce and stating he \\"no longer believed in God\\". In explaining some of the lyrics from Awakened, Lambesis stated that his studies of theology had led him to the conclusion that \\"tradition and truth are often at odds with each other\\", and while he \\"didn't hate all religious belief\\", he was finding it \\"very difficult for to outline exactly who it is that's worth siding with.\\" He also quoted the book Pagan Christianity by George Barna and Frank Viola, claiming that both \\"Protestant and Catholic denominations have poisonous roots\\". While on house arrest in July 2013, after being charged with soliciting his wife's murder, Lambesis published a blog post in which he obliquely confirmed his previous loss of faith in Christianity. However, since his arrest it has been reported that Lambesis \\"has spent much of the last year reevaluating what originally convinced him to abandon belief in God. After much brokenness and repentance he sees things differently, considers himself a follower of Jesus, someone submitted to the will of God.\\" In 2014 Lambesis said that although they were marketed as a Christian band, the members privately considered themselves atheists.

Putnam's best-known work concerns philosophy of mind. His most noted original contributions to that field came in several key papers published in the late 1960s that set out the hypothesis of multiple realizability. In these papers, Putnam argues that, contrary to the famous claim of the type-identity theory, it is not necessarily true that \\"Pain is identical to C-fibre firing.\\" Pain, according to Putnam's papers, may correspond to utterly different physical states of the nervous system in different organisms, and yet they all experience the same mental state of \\"being in pain\\". Putnam cited examples from the animal kingdom to illustrate his thesis. He asked whether it was likely that the brain structures of diverse types of animals realize pain, or other mental states, the same way. If they do not share the same brain structures, they cannot share the same mental states and properties. The answer to this puzzle had to be that mental states were realized by different physical states in different species. Putnam then took his argument a step further, asking about such things as the nervous systems of alien beings, artificially intelligent robots and other silicon-based life forms. These hypothetical entities, he contended, should not be considered incapable of experiencing pain just because they lack the same neurochemistry as humans. Putnam concluded that type-identity theorists had been making an \\"ambitious\\" and \\"highly implausible\\" conjecture which could be disproven with one example of multiple realizability. This argument is sometimes referred to as the \\"likelihood argument\\". Putnam formulated a complementary argument based on what he called \\"functional isomorphism\\". He defined the concept in these terms: \\"Two systems are functionally isomorphic if 'there is a correspondence between the states of one and the states of the other that preserves functional relations'.\\" In the case of computers, two machines are functionally isomorphic if and only if the sequential relations among states in the first are exactly mirrored by the sequential relations among states in the other. Therefore, a computer made out of silicon chips and a computer made out of cogs and wheels can be functionally isomorphic but constitutionally diverse. Functional isomorphism implies multiple realizability. This argument is sometimes referred to as an \\"a priori argument\\". Jerry Fodor, Putnam, and others noted that, along with being an effective argument against type-identity theories, multiple realizability implies that any low-level explanation of higher-level mental phenomena is insufficiently abstract and general. Functionalism, which identifies mental kinds with functional kinds that are characterized exclusively in terms of causes and effects, abstracts from the level of microphysics, and therefore seemed to be a better explanation of the relation between mind and body. In fact, there are many functional kinds, such as mousetraps, software and bookshelves, which are multiply realized at the physical level. Answer this question \\"What did he discover through this?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"Through his work on the hypothesis of multiple realizability, Putnam discovered that mental states, such as pain, may correspond to different physical states of the nervous system in different organisms, yet they all experience the same mental state.

Earlier in the year, another teacher, Jim's best friend Dave Novotny (Mark Harelik) was fired from his job and divorced by his wife, Linda (Delaney Driscoll) after it came out that he and Tracy were having a sexual affair, while Tracy's reputation was unscathed. Against this backdrop, Tracy announces that she is running for student council president. Initially she is unopposed, as she is widely seen as the natural candidate for the job. When Tracy presents Mr. McAllister with her list of nominating signatures to qualify for the election ballot, she makes a remark about \\"working closely\\" together that he interprets as an indication she may try to seduce him. Perhaps annoyed by Tracy's presumptuousness, and/or concerned that he might give in to this seduction and share the same fate as his friend Dave, Mr. McAllister decides to persuade junior Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), a slow-witted, but affable and popular football player to enter the race. Paul is unable to play football as he is recovering from a ski injury that resulted in his left leg being broken, and Mr. McAllister suggests a new way to explore his talents through student council. Although Paul is ambivalent at first, he agrees to run, much to Tracy's consternation. Meanwhile, Paul's adopted younger sister Tammy (Jessica Campbell) is rejected by her romantic interest Lisa (Frankie Ingrassia), who dismisses their time together as \\"experimenting.\\" Lisa then engages in a passionate relationship with Paul. In retaliation, Tammy decides to run for school president as well.

Leading the league in a particular category is referred to as a \\"title\\". - The World Series is the annual championship series of Major League Baseball (MLB) in North America, contested since 1903 between the American League (AL) champion team and the National League (NL) champion team. The winner of the World Series championship is determined through a best-of-seven playoff, and the winning team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy. As the series is played in October (and occasionally November), during the autumn season in North America, it is often referred to as the Fall Classic. - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America. With over 2.7 million residents, it is the most populous city in the state of Illinois and the Midwestern United States, and the county seat of Cook County. The Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland, has nearly 10 million people and is the third-largest in the U.S. - The American League of Professional Baseball Clubs, or simply the American League (AL), is one of two leagues that make up Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada. It developed from the Western League, a minor league based in the Great Lakes states, which eventually aspired to major league status. It is sometimes called the Junior Circuit because it claimed Major League status for the 1901 season, 25 years after the formation of the National League (the \\"Senior Circuit\\"). - The National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP), or simply the National Association (NA), was founded in 1871 and continued through the 1875 season. It succeeded and incorporated several professional clubs from the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP); in turn several of its clubs created the succeeding National League of Professional Baseball Clubs. - The National League of Professional Baseball Clubs, known simply as the National League (NL), is the older of two leagues constituting Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada, and the world's oldest current professional team sports league. Founded on February 2, 1876, to replace the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, it is sometimes called the Senior Circuit, in contrast to MLB's other league, the American League, which was founded 25 years later. Both leagues currently have 15 teams. The two league champions of 1903 arranged to compete against each other in the inaugural World Series. After the 1904 champions failed to reach a similar agreement, the two leagues formalized the World Series as an arrangement between the leagues. National League teams have won 48 of the 112 World Series contested from 1903 to 2016. The 2016 National League champions are the Chicago Cubs. - The Chicago Cubs are an American professional baseball team based in Chicago, Illinois. The Cubs compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central division, where they are the defending World Series champions. The team plays its home games at Wrigley Field, located on the city's North Side. The Cubs are one of two major league teams in Chicago; the other, the Chicago White Sox, is a member of the American League (AL) Central division. The team, first known as the White Stockings, was a founding member of the NL in 1876, becoming the Chicago Cubs in 1903. - The Union Association was a league in Major League Baseball which lasted for only one season in 1884 . St. Louis won the pennant and joined the National League the following season . Chicago moved to Pittsburgh in late August , and four teams folded during the season and were replaced . Although the league is conventionally listed as a major league , this status has been questioned by a number of modern baseball historians , most notably Bill James in The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract . The league had a number of major league players ( on the St. Louis franchise , at least ) , but the league 's overall talent and organization was notably inferior to that of the two established major leagues . James found that the contemporary baseball guides did not consider the Union Association to be a major league either . The earliest record he could find of the Union Association as a major league was Ernest Lanigan 's The Baseball Cyclopedia , published in 1922 . For example , the league 's only \`\` star '' player , Fred Dunlap , led the league in batting average with .412 ( 86 points higher than his second - best season and 120 points higher than his career average ) , on - base percentage , slugging percentage , runs scored , hits , total bases , and home runs ( with just 13 , typical for the era ) . After the league folded , Dunlap never hit more than .274 or more than 10 home runs until he retired in 1891 , another measure of the inferior quality of the Union Association . Of the 272 players in the Association , 107 ( 39.34 % ) never played in another major league , while 72 ( 26.47 % ) played very briefly ( less than 300 at bats and / or 50 hits ) in other major leagues , and 79 ( 29.04 % ) had longer careers but little success in other major leagues . A relatively modern comparison could be the World Football League of the early 1970s contrasted with the National Football League . The WFL similarly resorted to putting clubs in small cities or cities with established teams , and collapsed in the middle of a...

Movie title: Friday Night Lights Context: Bissinger followed the team for the entire 1988 season, which culminated in a loss in the State semi-finals against Carter High School from Dallas, who eventually went on to win the championship game but would have their title stripped for playing an ineligible player. However, the book also deals with or alludes to a number of secondary political and social issues existing in Odessa, all of which share ties to the Permian Panthers football team. These include socioeconomic disparity; racism; segregation (and desegregation); and poverty.The coach, Gary Gaines, is constantly on the hot seat. After a loss, he comes back to see \\"For Sale\\" signs on his lawn. Tied into the successes and failure of the coach and the team in general are the conflicts the players struggle with on and off the gridiron. The coach overuses his star player, running back James \\"Boobie\\" Miles, who gets seriously injured (Miles tore his ACL, missed the playoffs, and had a limp for the rest of his life). When this happens, sports radios are flooded with calls for his resignation. Miles' once-arrogant attitude vanishes as he sees his once promising chance of playing big-time college football disappear and starts to question his future after he notices his not-so promising academic standing. Quarterback Mike Winchell struggles with being able to play consistently, and his inability to make decisions for himself. Fullback Don Billingsley has a rocky relationship with his father, who won a state championship at Permian and carries on a feud with his son for not performing on the level he'd like to see, despite the fact that Don doesn't do anything to light his father's temper. Third-string running back Chris Comer, who takes the spot of Miles after his injury, attempts to get rid of his fear of being hit and getting injured, especially when the player who last occupied his spot suffered a season ending injury. His obsession with fame and recognition also comes at a high price that he is at first not ready to pay. Safety Brian Chavez is harassed...

Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Where are antibiotics banned for animals? Context: The emergence of antibiotic resistance has prompted restrictions on their use in the UK in 1970 (Swann report 1969), and the EU has banned the use of antibiotics as growth-promotional agents since 2003. Moreover, several organizations (e.g., The American Society for Microbiology (ASM), American Public Health Association (APHA) and the American Medical Association (AMA)) have called for restrictions on antibiotic use in food animal production and an end to all nontherapeutic uses.[citation needed] However, commonly there are delays in regulatory and legislative actions to limit the use of antibiotics, attributable partly to resistance against such regulation by industries using or selling antibiotics, and to the time required for research to test causal links between their use and resistance to them. Two federal bills (S.742 and H.R. 2562) aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in US food animals were proposed, but have not passed. These bills were endorsed by public health and medical organizations, including the American Holistic Nurses' Association, the American Medical Association, and the American Public Health Association (APHA).

The mayor of Reslie, while having a meeting about how to spend the excess funds from tourism this year, was told that the city is experiencing soil piping. The neighboring city, Tichago, consumes many of Reslie's grilled cheese sandwiches. The mayor of Tichago has just received a phone call from the mayor of Reslie asking if Tichago is also having soil piping. Tichago's mayor replies that no, they are not. and a hint : Soil piping is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface. It causes levee and dam failure, as well as sink hole formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient. The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.Soil salination is the accumulation of free salts to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. Irrigation of arid lands is especially problematic. All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying water table. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the capillary fringe of saline groundwater. Soil salinity control involves watertable control and flushing with higher levels of applied water in combination with tile drainage or another form of subsurface drainage.

When you are doing lymphatic massage, you want to make sure that you don’t press too hard. The lymphatic vessels are located right under the skin, so if you press too hard, you are going to go deeper than the vessels. Press down enough so that your fingers are not sliding over your skin, but make sure that you can’t feel anything beneath the skin. You may feel like this is too light, especially if you are used to deeper tissue massages. You may be used to giving or receiving massages where you glide along the skin. A lymphatic massage needs to stimulate the lymphatic vessels, which are elastic and attached to the skin. You need to lightly stretch your skin to massage them. The direction of your stretch of the skin is important. You should stretch the skin in the direction that the lymph flows naturally. You want to help stimulate the natural flow. If you stretch the skin the wrong way, you are doing nothing. The lymph flow goes towards your trunk and heart. Make sure to take your fingers off the skin after each stretch. If you move your fingers back and forth, you are just moving the lymph and not helping to drain it. As you massage the lymph vessels, you should go slow. The normal rhythm of their flow is slow, so try to take around three seconds to perform each stretch of the skin. Release and wait for a few seconds before beginning again.

To make a wooden table water resistant for a short time,","completion":"To make a wooden table water-resistant for a short time, follow these steps: Step 1: Clean the table Begin by cleaning the wooden table thoroughly. Remove any debris, dust, and dirt using a damp cloth or sponge. Make sure the table is completely dry before proceeding to the next step. This ensures that the protective coating will adhere properly to the surface. Step 2: Lightly sand the surface Using fine-grit sandpaper (around 220 grit), lightly sand the entire surface of the table, including the edges and legs. This will help to remove any existing finish and create a slightly rough surface for the new water-resistant coating to bond to. Be sure to sand with the grain of the wood and wipe away any dust with a clean cloth. Step 3: Choose a water-resistant sealant Select an appropriate water-resistant sealant or finish for your wooden table. You have multiple options, such as water-resistant varnish, polyurethane, or a specialized sealant designed for wooden furniture. Ensure the product you choose is specifically designed for temporary protection and is suitable for the type of wood that your table is made from. Step 4: Apply the sealant Before applying the sealant, stir it well and use a good-quality brush or foam applicator. Apply the sealant or finish evenly to the entire surface of the table, paying special attention to any grooves, edges, or intricate designs. Follow the manufacturer's instructions in terms of drying and curing time before applying additional coats, usually 1-2 hours between coats. For short-term water resistance, two to three coats should suffice. Step 5: Let it dry Allow the final coat of the sealant to dry completely according to the manufacturer's instructions. This is usually 24 hours. It is essential to let it dry fully to guarantee effective water resistance. Step 6: Buff the surface Use a soft cloth or ultra-fine steel wool (0000 grade) to gently buff the surface of the table, removing any possible brush marks or imperfections left by the sealant. This step will give the table a smooth and professional-looking finish. Step 7: Maintain the table To ensure your table remains water-resistant for a short period, avoid leaving water or wet objects on its surface for extended durations. If water does make contact with the surface, wipe it off immediately with a dry cloth to minimize the potential for damage. Note that this method will provide temporary water resistance, and the table may need to be resealed in the future if prolonged exposure to moisture occurs."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Since adding 0 doesn't change anything, we can simplify it to: 94*u = 0 4. To find the value of 'u', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 94. Like this: u = 0 / 94 5.

From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was far from welcoming. The décor was outdated, and it seemed like the restaurant hadn't been updated since the 90's. There was a musty odor that persisted throughout the evening, which was off-putting and made it difficult to fully enjoy my meal. The service was another disappointment. For a place that is supposed to be high-end, the staff was inattentive and slow. Our waiter took an exceptionally long time to take our drink and food orders and barely checked on us throughout the meal. We had to flag him down just to get our drinks refilled, and it took almost 20 minutes to receive our check after we had finished eating. As for the food, it was mediocre at best. I ordered the filet mignon, which was overcooked and considerably smaller than I would have expected for the price. The vegetables that accompanied the dish were bland and wilted, as if they had been sitting under a heat lamp for too long. My companion ordered the seared tuna, but it had an unpleasant fishy taste, suggesting that it was not the freshest.

This line is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees relative to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. This tilt plays a significant role in the way sunlight reaches the Earth's surface and, subsequently, gives rise to the seasons. As the Earth revolves around the Sun, the angle at which sunlight reaches the planet varies throughout the year. This changing angle results in different amounts of sunlight being distributed across the globe, leading to the distinct seasons. The tilt ensures that during certain times of the year, the Northern Hemisphere will receive more direct sunlight, causing summer, while the Southern Hemisphere receives less light, experiencing winter. Half a year later, the situation is reversed, with the Southern Hemisphere experiencing summer and the Northern Hemisphere facing winter. When the Earth's tilt is positioned in such a way that neither hemisphere is tilted towards or away from the Sun, we observe the transitional seasons of spring and autumn. Each hemisphere will experience these seasons when the Earth's tilt is not directing them towards or away from the Sun, resulting in mild temperatures and moderate sunlight levels. In summary, the answer to the question \\"What being tilted on its rotating axis causes spring, summer, autumn, and winter?\\" is the Earth. The tilt of the Earth on its axis leads to the variation in sunlight distribution, which, in turn, gives rise to the different seasons throughout the year. The other options, such as the Sun, climate, wind, mild, the Moon, orbital plane, and growth, do not directly cause the seasons. While some of these options may play a role in seasonal characteristics (e.g., the Sun providing light and heat, and climate patterns influencing seasonal weather), it is the Earth's tilted axis that ultimately determines the occurrence and characteristics of the various seasons."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: Three masked men broke into a woman's home, bound her hands and feet before carving anti-gay slurs into her body in a vicious hate crime, authorities said. The attackers also spray-painted 'we found you ****' on a wall at the woman's home and tried to set it on fire. Police in Lincoln, Nebraska refused to elaborate on what had been carved into the 33-year-old woman's body with a knife in the horrific attack on Saturday night. Terror: The homophobic slur was spray-painted on the wall of the woman's basement at her home after she was bound and her body cut. United against hate: Residents of Lincoln, Nebraska hold a vigil after a 33-year-old woman had homophobic slurs carved into her body by three masked attackers. The distraught woman, who is openly lesbian, managed to walk to a neighbor's house following the assault when the attackers had left. Linda Rappl, 68, said the woman was naked and bleeding. She told CNN: 'She was naked, her hands were tied with zip ties. All I could see was a cut across her forehead and blood running down.' Mrs Rappl called police and the woman was treated at hospital after she was cut on the stomach and arms. She was being housed at an emergency shelter and had asked that her identity not be released. The local community banded together in a vigil organized by a local LGBT group on Sunday night. More than 500 people attended to show their outrage at the attack and support for the victim. Mayor Chris Beutler said authorities would do everything to ensure justice is done and denounced violence directed at any group. Hate crime: The attack happened on Saturday night in Lincoln, Nebraska. Katie Flood, a spokeswoman for the Lincoln Police Department, said that 'multiple detectives' are working on the case, but the department does not want to release many details this early in the investigation. 'Doing so could compromise our ability to conduct quality suspect interviews at a later date,' she said. Nothing was reported stolen from the home. The hate crime comes in the wake of public debate over the city's fairness amendment, a proposal to ban discrimination in housing and employment based on a person's sexual orientation or gender identity. The city council approved the measure in May but opponents obtained enough signatures to keep it from going into effect before an as-yet unscheduled public vote. 'It was the talk of the town,' said Tyler Richard, president of Outlinc, a Lincoln gay rights support group. He said public comments to the council about the ordinance have run in favor of keeping it. Omaha, Nebraska's largest city, approved anti-discrimination protections for gay and transgender residents in March. Richard, who attended Sunday's vigil, said Outlinc has 'full faith' in the Lincoln Police Department, which he said has a long history of support for the city's gay and lesbian community. 'We trust that their investigation will be fair and complete and we await the results,' Richard said in a statement. 'As we consider the possible impetus for this horrific attack we are reminded more than ever why fairness is vital in our city.'","completion":"Three masked men broke into an openly lesbian woman's home in Lincoln, Nebraska, bound her hands and feet, and carved anti-gay slurs on her body in a vicious hate crime.

Ivory turns well. Available options: [i] different meanings [ii] the same meaning","completion":"[i] different meanings In the given sentences, the word \\"turn\\" is used with different meanings. Let's analyze each sentence to understand the nuances in their meanings. 1. In Vermont, the leaves turn early. In this sentence, \\"turn\\" refers to the process of changing colors during the autumn season. Leaves on deciduous trees typically change from green to shades of yellow, orange, and red before falling off the tree. This process takes place when the weather starts getting colder in autumn. Therefore, \\"turn\\" in this context means the transformation or change in appearance of the leaves. 2. Ivory turns well. In the second sentence, \\"turn\\" has a different meaning. Here, \\"turn\\" is related to the process of shaping materials, in this case, ivory, using a lathe. A lathe is a machine that holds and rotates the material on its axis against a cutting tool to shape it. When it's mentioned that \\"ivory turns well,\\" it means that ivory is a material that can be easily and effectively shaped or worked on by using a lathe. In conclusion, the word \\"turn\\" has different meanings in these two sentences. In the first sentence, it refers to the changing colors of leaves in autumn, while in the second, it refers to the shaping of a material (ivory) on a lathe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Yet as Gever Tulley points out in Fifty Dangerous Things(You Should Let Your Children Do),children who grow up as safe as possible become adults who aren't adventurous,highly adaptable,or confident.Sometimes you have to fall out of a tree to figure out how to climb one the right way,and learning that you can accomplish such a thing on your own teaches you that you can be self--sufficient. With Fifty Dangerous Things,Gever Tulley,has written a handbook of activities that are,yes,dangerous at some level-like playing with fire,breaking glass,and opening batteries.The book is a blueprint to help parents and children explore the world,and ensure the children grow up,with a little common sense and a lot of curiosity. Both the advice and the warnings are down to earth.Yes,there are risks,but Tulley provides good ways to learn to avoid them through your own skill.It takes work to raise a child who can use a table saw or build a campfire.But with this book in hand,it'll be a satisfying adventure. We see a child climbing a tree and the first thing we think of is how they might fall and be disabled for life.We seldom say,\\"Look at how well Sarah is climbing that tree!\\" When we protect children from every possible source of danger,we also prevent them from having the kinds of experiences that develop their sense of self--reliance,their ability to deal with risks,and their sense of accomplishment.

Many politicians, including the President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, are of the view that a political party's performance in Istanbul is more significant than its general performance overall. This is due to the city's role as Turkey's financial centre, its large electorate and the fact that Erdoğan himself was elected Mayor of Istanbul in 1994. In the run-up to local elections in 2019, Erdoğan claimed 'if we fail in Istanbul, we will fail in Turkey'.Historically, Istanbul has voted for the winning party in general elections since 1995. Since 2002, the right-wing Justice and Development Party (AKP) has won pluralities in every general election, with 41.74% of the vote in the most recent parliamentary election on 24 June 2018. Erdoğan, the AKP's presidential candidate, received exactly 50.0% of the vote in the presidential election held on the same day. Starting with Erdoğan in 1994, Istanbul has had a conservative mayor for 25 years, until 2019. The second largest party in Istanbul is the centre-left Republican People's Party (CHP), which is also the country's main opposition. The left-wing pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) is the city's third largest political force due to a substantial number of Kurdish people migrating from south-eastern Turkey. More recently, Istanbul and many of Turkey's metropolitan cities are following a trend away from the government and their right-wing ideology. In 2013 and 2014, large-scale anti-AKP government protests began in İstanbul and spread throughout the nation. This trend first became evident electorally in the 2014 mayoral election where the centre-left opposition candidate won an impressive 40% of the vote, despite not winning. The first government defeat in Istanbul occurred in the 2017 constitutional referendum, where Istanbul voted 'No' by 51.4% to 48.6%. The AKP government had supported a 'Yes' vote and won the vote nationally due to high support in rural parts of the country...., can you guess it ?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the word \\"influence\\" used in the same way in the following two sentences? Used her parents' influence to get the job. She was the most important influence in my life.","completion":"The word \\"influence\\" is used in both sentences. However, it is not used in exactly the same way in both contexts. The main reasons for that differentiation lie in the nuances of meaning and in its linguistic function within each sentence. 1. \\"Used her parents' influence to get the job\\": In this context, the word \\"influence\\" is used as a noun and signifies the power that somebody's parents hold to affect circumstances or events. In other words, the parents' influence refers to their ability to sway decisions, possibly because of their reputation, status, connection, or credibility. Their influence is put to use, in this context, to secure a job, potentially indicating a situation where they were able to persuade or convince the job provider to hire their daughter. Here, the connotations of influence suggest more tangible impacts, involving external manipulation of situations to reach a desired result. Herein, \\"influence\\" leans towards an action regarding persuasion and control. 2. \\"She was the most important influence in my life\\": In contrast, in this case, the term \\"influence\\" also signifies some sort of power or effect, but it's more about the effect that a person (in this case, she) has had on the speaker's life. This influence could be through teaching, inspiration, guidance, or simply by setting an example that the speaker chooses to follow. Here, \\"influence\\" is used with more emotional and personal connotations. It points to a more intangible and less directly controllable impact on another person's thoughts, decisions, or life directions. To summarize, while \\"influence\\" in both sentences carries a sense of affecting something or someone, the first sentence emphasizes more concrete, perhaps immediate or transactional, influence, like using connections or authority. The second sentence, however, portrays a deeper, more personal and life-altering kind of influence, relating more to personality, behaviors, and values."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

She had a marvellous drey high up a spruce tree, carved out long ago by a woodpecker, and since extended into a two-chambered home full of bright things. The journey along the sky-road to her drey did not take long. When Patch looked inside, he saw a hundred colours glittering in the sunlight, shining from bits of metal and glass set into Silver's walls and floor. But his mother was not there. He could tell by the faintness of her smell that no squirrel had been here in some time. There were two faint traces of scent, several days old; that of Silver, and that of another squirrel, a musky scent that Patch did not recognize. A scent that made his tail stiffen as if danger was near. Patch stared into his mother's empty drey for a moment. It wasn't normal for a squirrel to abandon her drey for days, not in the middle of winter. And he hadn't seen Silver for three days. Not since all the acorns had disappeared from the earth. Patch ran back to his own tree, and then to the maple tree next door, to his brother Tuft's drey. He ran very fast. He was hungrier than ever, and he was beginning to be very worried. He was relieved when he looked into Tuft's drey and found it occupied. Tuft himself was not present, but Brighteyes was, and their babies, and it was clear from the smells that Tuft had only just departed. \\"Hello, Patch,\\" Brighteyes said weakly. \\"Would you like to come in?\\" Patch entered. Brighteyes was curled up with her babies in the drey's deepest, warmest corner. The last time Patch had visited, a week ago, this had been a den of noise and chaos, with all Brighteyes' four babies running and jumping and playfighting.

The tragedies followed another death on Tuesday, when a 13-year-old boy went into a fast-flowing section of the Thames in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, to retrieve a football. A high of 28.6C (83.5F) was recorded in the Solent in Hampshire yesterday, with other parts of the country seeing similar temperatures and occasional heavy showers. [caption. The sweltering heat, which is due to continue today, coincided with the start of the school holidays – prompting the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents to issue a warning to young people. Leisure safety manager Dave Walker said: ‘Even on a hot day, the water might be a lot colder or deeper than you were expecting, and there may be underwater debris that you cannot see.’ Rony John, 15, was found dead at 2am yesterday, ten hours after he got into trouble while swimming in the Great Ouse river near Hartford in Cambridgeshire. Search teams then discovered the body of Conor McColl, 16, from Luton, just after 1pm. Conor also disappeared on Thursday, at around 6pm, after swimming in a disused quarry in Clophill, Bedfordshire. Two other teenagers were rescued from the water. Weak swimmer Rony had jumped into the river with fellow pupils from St Peter’s School, Huntingdon. Rony John, 15, went missing in the River Great Ouse near Church Lane in Hartford, Cambridgeshire. One girl at the scene said: ‘Apparently he couldn’t swim and he went in with a group of boys. ‘They all held on to him so that he wouldn’t go under and then he said that he could swim.’ The two tragedies today come just. days after Arran Cooper, ten and Kyrece Francis, 13, died in separate. tragedies earlier this week. Schoolboy. Arran, from Rutherglen in South Lanarkshire, died in hospital in the. early hours of Wednesday after he fell into the River Orchy, in the. Caledonian forest reserve in Argyll and Bute, Scotland. His. death came less than 24 hours after 13-year-old Kyrece Francis drowned. in the River Thames in Marlow, Buckinghamshire after apparently jumping. in the fast-flowing water to retrieve a football. Arran Cooper (left), tem, from Rutherglen in South Lanarkshire, died after he fell into the River Orchy, in the Caledonian forest reserve in Argyll and Bute. Kyrece Francis (right) was remembered by friends as a promising footballer and a 'genuine' and 'great' guy. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution also urged the public to take care in the sea, after a 12-year-old girl and her 21-year-old brother had to be rescued on Wednesday. The pair were nearly swept into the path of a shipping lane by currents in Ramsgate, Kent. Thousands are being tempted to the coast as ocean temperatures have hit a seven-year high in some places. The water has reached 20.4C (68.7F) off Start Bay in Devon – a full degree warmer than Santa Monica in Los Angeles. Elsewhere, a mother who abandoned her baby in a boiling car to go shopping was cautioned by police. Passers-by called the emergency services after noticing the child had been left alone in the Surrey supermarket car park on Tuesday, when temperatures hit 20C (68F) in the shade, The Sun reported. Police gave the mother a caution for ‘wilful abandonment’. The baby did not require medical treatment. Forecasters said the high temperatures would continue today – making Britain hotter than Crete – before falling by up to four degrees on Sunday. Sun-worshippers who end up looking more like a lobster than a bronzed beauty can now get relief – using the first burn lotion containing ibuprofen. The cream, called Soleve, delivers the painkiller directly to burnt skin. In trials it was found to remove the stinging sensation for eight out of ten users. The lotion, which costs £9.95 for 100ml, also contains the emollient isopropyl myristate, which soothes and moisturises the skin and traps in water, helping the body’s healing process. Surveys show three out of five Britons have suffered from sunburn in the past five years, and say it has blighted their holidays. Other after-sun lotions currently available are simply forms of moisturisers and can do nothing to relieve the pain of mild to moderate sunburn. Dr Phil Rosher of Diomed Developments, which created Soleve, said trials showed it helped to relieve pain, swelling, inflammation and tenderness.","completion":"- Two teenagers drowned in separate incidents in dangerous waters during the heatwave, with another death occurring on Tuesday. - High temperatures reached 28.6C (83.5F) in the Solent in Hampshire, with other parts of the country experiencing similar temperatures and occasional heavy showers. - The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents issued a warning to young people, stating that even on a hot day, the water might be colder or deeper than expected and there may be underwater debris. - The Royal National Lifeboat Institution urged the public to exercise caution in the sea after a 12-year-old girl and her 21-year-old brother were rescued in Ramsgate, Kent. - Ocean temperatures hit a seven-year high in some areas, reaching 20.4C (68.7F) off Start Bay in Devon, making the water a full degree warmer than Santa Monica in Los Angeles."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize: In this method, you'll use water, glow sticks, and several other common ingredients to make water that doesn't need a black light to glow. As in the methods above, start by filling a clear container, like a bottle or jar, with water. You'll also need a few other things before you get started: One or more glow sticks Scissors Dish soap Hydrogen peroxide Waterproof gloves Take each glowstick, find the glass vial within, and bend the stick until you feel a \\"crack.\\" The tube should immediately begin to glow — this will be easiest to see if the lights are off. Repeat this for each glow stick. The more glow sticks you use, the brighter your water will be. Glow sticks are available at party stores and many department stores (especially around Halloween.) They are generally very cheap — a 100-pack can cost as little as 12. Try to find the largest glowsticks available, so that your water can offer the most luminescence as possible. Put your gloves on. Using your scissors, carefully cut off the tip of each glow stick and pour the glowing liquid within into the water. Mix the water and the glowing liquid. Be careful — remember that each glow stick contains broken glass. ) Your water should now be glowing, but with a few extra ingredients, you can make it even better. Measure out a few capfuls of hydrogen peroxide and pour them into the mixture, then squirt in about a half-teaspoon of ordinary dish soap (e.g., Palmolive, Ajax, etc.) The two chemicals in a glow stick are diphenyl oxalate (in the plastic tube) and hydrogen peroxide (in the inner glass vial.) When you crack the tube, the glass vial breaks and the two chemicals mix, producing light. Adding extra hydrogen peroxide is the same as adding more of the chemical in the glass vial, which makes the reaction brighter. Dish soap contains chemicals that reduce the surface tension of the water, making it easier for the hydrogen peroxide and the diphenyl oxalate to mix. When you're finished, seal your container and shake it (or just stir it) to make sure that all the ingredients have mixed. When you're done, your water will glow with or without a black light (though a black light can enhance the effect.) This mixture is not safe to drink.","completion":"The glow-in-the-dark water method involves using water, glow sticks, and other easily accessible ingredients to create water that can glow without the need for a black light. To create this glowing water, the following materials are required: a clear container (like a bottle or jar) filled with water, one or more glow sticks, scissors, dish soap, hydrogen peroxide, and waterproof gloves. To begin, activate each glow stick by finding the glass vial inside and bending the stick until it cracks. The glow sticks will start to glow, and the more glow sticks used, the brighter the resulting water will be. Glow sticks can be found at party or department stores, and the largest size is recommended for maximum luminescence. Next, while wearing gloves, carefully cut open each glow stick and pour the glowing liquid into the water. Be cautious of the broken glass inside the glow sticks. Mixing the water and the glowing liquid should result in glowing water. To enhance this effect, add a few capfuls of hydrogen peroxide and about half a teaspoon of dish soap. The hydrogen peroxide intensifies the reaction that produces light, while the dish soap allows the chemicals to mix more easily by reducing the water's surface tension. After adding these extra ingredients, seal the container and shake or stir it to ensure thorough mixing. The resulting glowing water can be observed without a black light, although a black light may enhance the effect. Note that this mixture is not safe for consumption."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Within the services sector, the financial services industry, particularly in banking and insurance, has been a dominant force and major contributor to the UK's economy. The UK's financial services industry is a global powerhouse and continues to flourish, with London being a major center for international business and considered an essential hub in the world's financial network. This success is due to various factors, including a thriving capital market, an established regulatory framework, cutting-edge technological infrastructure, and a highly skilled workforce. According to the latest available data, the financial services sector contributes around 6.9% of the UK's total Gross Value Added (GVA) while employing approximately 1.1 million people. In addition, exports of financial services account for around 10.4% of the total UK service exports, making it the largest exporter of financial services in the world. Alongside the financial services industry, the professional services industry, including legal, accounting, management consulting, and advertising services, also play a vital role in the UK's economy. These industries collectively employ around 25% of the nation's workforce and contribute significantly to the overall GVA. Moreover, digital technology and the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector have experienced significant growth in recent years. The UK is a renowned digital hub and home to various tech start-ups, which have contributed to the acceleration of the nation's digital economy. Consequently, there has been a growing demand for technology-based services and various digital products. Other major components of the UK's service sector include retail, healthcare, education and hospitality. These industries, though affected by the global pandemic, have prominently contributed to the economy and provided significant employment opportunities across the UK. It is important to note that the UK services sector, along with the other sectors, experienced some challenges due to Brexit. However, the country continues to grow and adapt to the changing global landscape, so it remains a significant player on the international stage. To sum up, the largest industry in the UK today is the services sector, with a strong focus on financial services, professional services, and digital technology. While the services sector is by far the most substantial in terms of GVA and employment, other sectors such as manufacturing, construction, and agriculture also contribute significantly to the UK's diversified economy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is It has been mentioned that most nonprofits will never be able to match the pay of the private sector and therefore should focus their attention on benefits packages, incentives and implementing pleasurable work environments. a good answer to this question?","completion":"Yes, that is a good answer to the question. Let me break down the answer and justify the steps taken to reach this conclusion. Step 1: Acknowledge the limitation of NPOs It is important to recognize that most nonprofits may not have the financial resources to compete with the private sector in terms of salaries. Step 2: Focus on alternative compensation As a solution, NPOs should consider offering competitive benefits and incentives that can make up for the difference in pay. These benefits might include health insurance, retirement plans, and professional development opportunities. Step 3: Emphasize the pleasurable work environment Since it's known that employee satisfaction and retention are highly influenced by the work environment, nonprofits should make conscious efforts to create a positive, fulfilling, and enjoyable atmosphere within their organizations. By providing these incentives and creating pleasurable work environments, NPOs can still attract and retain talented employees despite not offering the same level of wages as private-sector companies. This strategy takes into account the financial limitations of nonprofits while still allowing them to secure dedicated professionals driven by the organization's mission and values."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who gave her daughter life with her own blood? In ancient times, the Amazons, a proud and fierce race of warrior women, led by their Queen, Hippolyta, battled Ares, the god of war, and his army. During the battle, Hippolyta specifically targeted and beheaded her son Thrax, whom Ares forcibly conceived with her and who is fighting for his father. Hippolyta then defeated Ares, but Zeus stopped her from delivering the death strike. Instead, Hera bound his powers with magic bracers so that he was deprived of his ability to draw power from the psychic aura of violence and death he could instigate, and only another god could release him. In compensation, the Amazons were granted the island of Themyscira, where they would remain eternally youthful and isolated from Man in the course of their duty of holding Ares prisoner for all eternity. Later, Hippolyta was granted a daughter, Princess Diana, whom she shaped from the sand of the Themyscirian seashore and gave life with her own blood. Over a millennium later, an American fighter pilot, USAF Colonel Steve Trevor, is shot down in a dogfight and crash-lands his YF-23 on the island, where he soon runs afoul of the Amazon population, including the combative Artemis. Steve and Diana meet and fight, and Diana defeats him, taking him to the Amazons. After interrogating him with the use of the Amazons' golden lasso, Hippolyta decides he is not an enemy of the Amazons and as such, tradition dictates that an emissary be tasked to ensure his safe return to his own country. Diana volunteers, but is assigned to guard Ares's cell instead since her mother argues that she has not enough experience in dealing with the dangers of the outside world. Diana defies her mother and, her face hidden by a helmet and her guard duty covered by her bookish but kind-hearted Amazon sister Alexa, participates in contests of strength and wins the right to take Trevor back to his home.

Answer:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"A rubber band snapping causes the particles in the rubber band to\\" would be a combination of three answer choices presented: heat, sound, and waves. This is because when a rubber band snaps, it undergoes a rapid release of energy which results in vibrations in the particles of the rubber band. These vibrations cause various effects, including heat, sound, and waves. Here's a more detailed explanation of each effect: 1. Heat: The rapid release of energy when a rubber band snaps causes some of this energy to be converted into heat. This heat is generated due to the collision of the vibrating particles within the rubber band. 2. Sound: The vibrations caused by the snapping of a rubber band propagate through the air as sound waves. This is what we hear as the characteristic \\"snap\\" sound when a rubber band is broken. The sound is produced because the rapid movement and vibration of the particles push and pull the surrounding air, creating pressure waves that travel through the atmosphere and reach our ears. 3. Waves: In addition to sound waves, the rapid release of energy in a snapping rubber band also causes mechanical waves, which are essentially a transfer of energy through a medium. When the rubber band snaps, the particles of the rubber band move rapidly and generate vibrations that spread out as mechanical waves. These mechanical waves can travel through various media, such as solids, liquids, or gases. In summary, when a rubber band snaps, the particles in the rubber band vibrate and produce heat, sound, and waves as the energy transferred during the snapping process is rapidly dissipated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I can use this background: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally). Now, I have a new situation: Jimmy is currently shopping at his local grocery store during his weekly trip to get food and other necessities. He first picks up some frozen pizzas, his favorite meal when he is feeling lazy after work, and then stops off to pick up a loaf of bread. He then walks over to the dairy section to pick up some cheese for his lunches. Jimmy never buys milk, but today he has a sudden urge to get some. He walks over to the milk refrigerators and looks at all the options. He is currently debating between two brands, Luchene and Jean's. While trying to decide, he notices a sticker on the Luchene gallon that says \\"organic,\\" but is unable to find any such indication on the gallon of Jean's milk. After asking an employee, it is confirmed that Jean's is not organic milk. Unable to make up his mind, Jimmy simply leaves without buying any milk. Answer this question please: Which brand of milk has lower eutrophication potential per hectare of farmland? A:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland compared to conventional milk production. This is mainly because organic production potentially reduces the leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. In the situation you've described, the Luchene brand has a label indicating that it's an organic product, while Jean's milk does not have any such indication and is confirmed as not being organic by a store employee. Given this information, it can be concluded that the Luchene brand of milk likely has a lower eutrophication potential per hectare of farmland compared to Jean's milk. This is because Luchene's organic production practices would generally involve lower fertilizer application rates, thus reducing the potential for eutrophication. However, it is essential to note that differences in practices between individual farms, even within the organic sector, can influence environmental impacts.

To provide a detailed explanation, let us break down the key elements in this statement. Queen Victoria, who reigned as the monarch of the United Kingdom from 1837 to 1901, commissioned Sir Robert Peel, a prominent member of the Conservative Party (also known as the Tory party), to form a new government ministry. Sir Robert Peel served as the British Prime Minister twice, first from 1834 to 1835 and then from 1841 to 1846. In the United Kingdom, when the existing government loses the confidence of the majority in the House of Commons, either due to an election or other reasons, it is customary for the monarch to invite a leader from the party with the majority in the House to form a new government. In this case, Queen Victoria commissioned Sir Robert Peel, a notable Tory politician and statesman, to undertake this task and create a new ministry. Peel's tenure as Prime Minister saw several significant policy changes and reforms, including the establishment of the modern British police force, the reduction of import tariffs on foreign goods (a move for free trade), and the repeal of the Corn Laws, which caused a split in the Conservative Party but was intended to improve the country's economic situation.

Q: How often does Montana voted for a Democratic president? A: Overall, since 1889 the state has voted for Democratic governors 60 percent of the time and Democratic presidents 40 percent of the time, with these numbers being 40/60 for Republican candidates. Does the answer correctly answer the question pick from the following. -- yes -- no","completion":"A: Looking into the historical voting patterns of Montana for the Presidential elections, the state predominantly leans towards the Republican Party. Montana has been part of the United States since it got the statehood on November 8, 1889. The state has participated in 33 presidential elections since then. In the 20th century, Montana voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in nine out of 25 elections. This includes the four consecutive terms won by Franklin D. Roosevelt starting from 1932 to 1944, Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 and Bill Clinton in 1992. However, from 1952 to 1988, Montana heavily leaned towards the Republicans, voting Democratic only once. In the 21st century so far, Montana has shown a strong leaning towards the Republican party. The state hasn't voted for a Democratic president since 1992 and has consistently voted for Republican candidates in all elections. This includes George W. Bush's two terms starting from 2000 to 2008, Mitt Romney in 2012, and Donald Trump in both 2016 and 2020. So while Montana has elected Democratic governors relatively frequently, the state tends to be much more conservative when it comes to Presidential elections. It is important to note political leanings and voting patterns can change over time and are influenced by several factors, including the candidates running, their platforms, and the political climate both nationally and locally. Therefore, while historical voting patterns can provide some insights, they cannot predict with absolute certainty how a state will vote in future elections."},{"prompt":"Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

When faced with a very argumentative person, it is important to remind yourself that your antagonist does not likely want to hear your opinion. (1). Arguing will only confuse you and possibly disappoint them. Often it seems that everything just goes wrong when arguing with someone. (2). Defending yourself effectively while being involved with an argument will only make the person annoyed more; they will generally just start blowing it out of proportion. Of course, picking on yourself for being argumentative can be a common outcome, but it is easier to let it come up than putting blame out there to the other person or even yourself. (3). Nothing you say will be convincing enough to settle the argument, and an argumentative person will likely not admit it even if they are wrong. Save yourself a headache and just say you're not going to debate the topic. (4). Now if you start arguing by stepping on his toes, it means that you are pushing his buttons.

Question: President Donald Trump's approval rating has headed into unfamiliar territory in recent weeks — upward. Trump's approval hit 43 percent in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, with 52 percent disapproving. That represents a 3 percent improvement from last month in the same survey. Several other new surveys also show Trump at or slightly above 40 percent. The RealClearPolitics polling average puts the president's approval rating at 41 percent, a noticeable bump from August, when the rating was often in the mid-30s. For much of the second half of August, Trump's approval rating in the Gallup Daily Tracking poll was either 34 percent or 35 percent, historically a low mark for a new president. On Thursday, Gallup had Trump at 37 percent. The previous day, Trump hit 39 percent, his highest mark since late July. Trump's recent outreach to Democrats on budget issues and, possibly, immigration has boosted his poll numbers, as has his administration's response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 71 percent of those surveyed approved of Trump's deal with Democrats to fund the government until December and raise the debt ceiling, while 8 percent disapproved. The question is whether Trump has turned a political corner, or is merely seeing a temporary respite from the low poll ratings that have plagued him since the beginning of his presidency. That could depend on whether working with Democrats is a long-range goal or a passing fad, and experts said that making a forecast on that could turn out to be foolish. \\"When it comes to President Trump, I have gotten out of the prediction business,\\" said Brookings Institution scholar Bill Galston. \\"For now, this is a significant shift of strategy and tactics.

Their manager prostitutes the beautiful Gong-gil to rich customers, and Jang-saeng sickens of this practice. After Gonggil kills the manager in defense of Jang-saeng, the pair flees to Seoul, where they form a new group with three other street performers.Together the group comes up with a skit mocking some members of the Royal Court, including the king and his new concubine Jang Noksu. After they are arrested for treason, Jang-saeng makes a deal with Choseon, who turns out to be one of the King's servants, to either make the king laugh at their skit or to be executed. They perform their skit for the king, but the three minor performers are too terrified to perform well. Gong-gil and Jang-saeng barely save themselves with one last joke at the king, who laughs and then makes them part of his Court. The King falls for the effeminate Gong-gil, whom he calls to his private chambers often to perform finger puppet shows. Jang-saeng becomes jealous of this relationship. Meanwhile, the King becomes more and more unstable. He makes the clowns perform a skit depicting how his mother, the favorite concubine of the former king, was forced to take poison after being betrayed by other jealous concubines.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Our Smartphones, Ourselves Nokia, or at least the color psychologist it interviewed on its Conversations by Nokia blog, has a theory about why we choose the color phones that we do. (Hat tip to IntoMobile for spotting the post). “Every time you make a color choice, you’re making a statement about what’s going on in your head, even though most of the time you don’t know it,” according to color psychologist Angela Wright, head of Color Affects. “Around 80 percent of our color choices are sub-conscious.” Briefly, according to Wright, if you gravitate to cyan blue it means you are happy, brave and feel confident in your choice. Picking white as your phone color says you are a sophisticated smartphone aficionado with high standards. Fuchsia or magenta means you are a militant feminist, a sympathizer or possibly afraid of them and would to ingratiate oneself with them. And while black would seemingly suggest the owner is sophisticated and confident, in fact it does not, Wright says. Rather, the choice indicates a need for a security blanket or of protection or camouflage. (Reader, here is where I admit my phone is black). As a counter point to the black-is-the-new-security-blanket, Nokia’s Head of Industrial Design Stefan Pannenbecker offers this alternative theory: people like it because of its “technical” feel, making it appealing to your inner nerd. Whatever. It is a fun analysis and, I am sure or at least hope, mostly tongue-in-check. Nokia’s take on the subject, aside from making sure that people know the Lumina comes in cyan blue, also highlights the more serious marketing studies that pick apart smartphones and how and why consumers choose them–and what these choices mean for marketers targeting these people. Consider Apple’s push to expand its market share in China. Samsung, by far, is the top smartphone there but Apple is showing signs of making inroads among a very specific constituency, according to a report by Guohe, called Mobile Advertising: Six Key Trends in 2012. Google‘s Android is the dominant platform, at 54% of users interviewed. In addition, 39% had jailbroken phones. However, even though iPhone users are in the minority they are well worth targeting: they are, according to the study, more affluent city dwellers, entrepreneurs, businesspeople, and fashion-conscious users. They also tend to gravitate toward game, utility, and shopping apps. Also, a greater percentage of China’s iOS users spend more money on apps than do Android users (Apple was willing early on to accept China’s RMB currency as payment, which is one reason). Meanwhile, only 23% of the study’s Android users ever purchased any apps, though they’ve likely downloaded plenty of free apps from over 100 different third party app stores for Android in China. You can find a lot of analysis like that provided by mobile marketing platform providers and other related parties, and not just for the China market. My favorite study, though, comes at the subject, like Nokia did, in a slightly different way.

Article: Hurricane Fred formed just off the western coast of Africa early on Monday morning, coming in as the second-farthest east a hurricane has ever formed in the Atlantic Ocean since records began. It’s extremely unusual to see such a strong storm so close to Africa, but here we are! Experts widely expect this year’s Atlantic hurricane season to see below-normal activity thanks to the raging El Niño out in the Pacific Ocean, but below average or not, it’s turning into one of the most interesting Atlantic hurricane seasons in recent memory. Tropical Storm Ana—a rare May storm—made landfall in South Carolina, nudging its way into the record books as the second-earliest U.S. landfall on record. Tropical Storm Bill remained a tropical depression for four days (!!) after landfall in Texas as it made a wide curve through the middle of the United States, finally losing tropical characteristics somewhere near Cincinnati. Claudette became a potent little tropical storm off the Mid-Atlantic coast, spinning-up from thunderstorms in North Carolina a few days earlier. Danny was an incredibly tiny hurricane that unexpectedly became a category three with 115 MPH winds before rapidly falling apart, and Erika...well, Erika needs no introduction. That brings us to Fred. Hi Fred. There it is, spinning very close to the Cape Verde Islands and about 300 miles off the coast of western Africa. Most powerful tropical cyclones in the Atlantic are (in)famous for getting their start in this part of the world—many of the worst hurricanes in history developed as clusters of thunderstorms over sub-Saharan Africa, moving west off the coast where they slowly gather strength as they traverse the bath water that is the Atlantic in late summer. When conditions are right, these systems—called “Cape Verde-type” hurricanes, for obvious reasons—typically turn into ugly storms about halfway between Africa and the Caribbean. It’s pretty unusual for a system to threaten the Cape Verde Islands as a tropical storm or hurricane. This small island nation has only seen a hurricane twice in recorded history—Debbie back in 1961 and an unnamed hurricane that developed in 1892. Tropical waves usually don’t get their act together this quickly, but Fred’s a freak of nature. The storm took advantage of a short window with steering currents from the southeast and an environment capable of sustaining a low-end hurricane. The National Hurricane Center doesn’t expect the storm to last much longer—after a period of strengthening today, the hurricane will encounter a hostile environment that should slowly weaken it to nothing by the weekend. Hurricane Fred will produce heavy rain, flash flooding, mudslides, a small storm surge, and rough waves as it crosses the many islands that make up Cape Verde, a Portuguese-speaking country that’s home to about half a million people. The country’s capital, Praia, should escape the worst of the hurricane—the city is home to about a quarter of the country’s total population. Given Fred’s unusual nature, it’s posing some unique problems for experts and amateurs alike. A tropical storm or hurricane forming over/near the Cape Verde Islands is so rare that the software that produces the National Hurricane Center’s auto-generated map products doesn’t have the ability to draw watches or warnings for the Cape Verde Islands. You know a storm is strange when the agency responsible for storms in this ocean basin doesn’t have the capability to show your country’s hurricane warning on its maps. Fred became a hurricane at 22.5°W, securing its second place spot in recorded history. Many more storms could have formed along or east of this line of longitude before the satellite era, but we never would have known about it unless it hit land or ships in its path. The record for the farthest east a storm has ever become a hurricane in the Atlantic was Vince (above), which fittingly formed during the ridiculous 2005 hurricane season; the season itself probably holds the record for the most records ever broken in one season. Vince formed up near Madeira Island, which is a few hundred miles southwest of Spain. The water is supposed to be too cold in this area to support a hurricane, but Vince proved us wrong, as did just about every other storm that year. It isn’t 2005 by a longshot, but 2015 has been an interesting season so far. It makes a weather geek wonder: “what’s next?” (Knock on wood.) [Images: NOAA, EUMETSAT, author, NASA] Email: dennis.mersereau@gawker.com | Twitter: @wxdam ||||| For a time over the weekend, three powerful Category 4 hurricanes churned in the central and eastern Pacific basins at the same time, an event that is believed a meteorological first in the ocean region and another sign that the forces of El Niño are stirring up weather anomalies — and the jitters in Hawaii. Hawaii on Monday appeared to have dodged a swipe from Hurricane Ignacio, which had substantially weakened to a Category 2 on a five-point scale as it moved hundreds of miles off-shore of the state. But that sense of relief was tempered by the knowledge that the islands are just halfway through the hurricane season and already have seen almost as many named storms as the Pacific region usually gets in an entire period. Over the weekend, officials recorded three named hurricanes — Ignacio, Kilo and Jimena — and all were as strong as Category 4. Kilo and Jimena are not expected to directly hit the Hawaiian islands. National Weather Service meteorologist Chevy Chevalier said it was possible that Ignacio could stage a dramatic shift toward land, \\"but not likely.” Even though the storms are forecast to miss Hawaii, officials have had to gear up emergency measures as a precaution. Stores have reported an increase in purchases of emergency supplies, declarations of warning have been issued by state leaders and emergency management officials and hundreds of volunteers have been put at the ready by groups such as the Red Cross. “This hurricane season seems to be busier than normal,” said Krislyn Yano, communications manager for the state chapter of the Red Cross. “We don’t want residents to get fatigued by the close calls then think we’re invincible” when the storms pass. “We are always trying to be prepared, and we’re only half way through the season. Everyone should always be ready.” According to Chevalier, a meteorologist for the Honolulu-based Central Pacific Hurricane Center, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the region averaged 16.6 named storms a year from 1981 to 2010. The largest number, 28, was recorded in 1992 and the fewest, eight, was in 1977 and 2010. So far, there have been 14 named storms in the region, and the hurricane season, which runs from mid-May to the end of November, is only about half over, he said. The forecast had been for 15 to 22 storms this year, he said. “This year, we have had a very active hurricane season and the main reason is El Niño,” he explained. The El Niño effect occurs when sea water has a warmer than average temperature. In general, hurricanes are born in the eastern portion of the Pacific where warm waters generate water vapor and energy that climbs into the air. The heat of the water is like a fuel that feeds the hurricane, making it stronger and fiercer and as it travels over the water. Normally, the cool ocean water serves as a brake to the growth of hurricanes. But in an El Niño year, the ocean stays warm and continues to feed the baby hurricanes that then can grow into fearsome creatures. The tamest hurricane, as measured on the five-step Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, starts at 74 miles per hour, the low end of Category 1. The high end of Category 5 is more than 157 miles per hour. The top steps are considered major storms with winds in excess of 112 miles an hour. “When the hurricanes reach the Hawaiian Islands, the sea surface temperatures are normally relatively cooler, so the storms lose some power. This year is different [because of El Niño] and the hurricanes have maintained their intensity as they move north.” By Monday, Kilo remained a Category 4 storm, approaching the International Date Line with winds of 135 miles per hour. Jimena, with winds of 150 miles an hour, was more than 1,300 miles east of Hawaii. Ignacio weakened, with maximum winds of 105 miles per hour. It was forecast to continue to lose power through the week as it moved hundreds of miles past the Big Island and Maui. No coastal warnings or watches were in effect, according to the National Weather Service. Many storms brush the islands or cause enough disturbance in the ocean to have an effect, Chevalier said. Only four storms have made landfall in Hawaii since 1949; two caused major damage but none since 1992. Still, for a time all three were Category 4 storms in the same region. Even three Category 3 storms would be a record, Chevalier said. “I would say it’s very rare, extremely rare,” he said. “I don’t think it has ever happened before.” michael.muskal@latimes.com Follow @latmuskal for national news |||||Summary:","completion":"Hurricane Fred formed just off the western coast of Africa early on Monday morning, making it the second-farthest east a hurricane has ever formed in the Atlantic Ocean since records began.

But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket.

The couple had five children: Francis in 1845, Edmund junior (known as Ted) in 1847, Emily in 1849, Catherine (known as Kate) in 1850, and Alfred in 1853.When Sharpe moved his family from Lancaster to live in North Wales in early 1856 he was aged 47. The seven years he spent there were later described, in a Memoir published in 1882 by the Architectural Association, as \\"perhaps the happiest years of his life\\". The family initially lived in a semi-detached house called Bron Haul near Betws-y-Coed, on what is now the A5 road. Two years later he bought a larger property called Coed-y-Celyn on the east bank of the River Lledr, about a mile south of Betws-y-Coed. After moving to Geneva, the family lived for about three years in a rented property called Richemont on the road from Geneva to Chêne-Bougeries. Finally in 1866 the family moved back to Lancaster to live in Scotforth, then a small village to the south of the town.Elizabeth Sharpe died on 15 March 1876, a month after the consecration of St Paul, Scotforth where a plaque to her memory can be found in the chancel of the church. A year later, Sharpe travelled to northern Italy with his two daughters, his youngest son Alfred, and three research assistants, to make drawings of 12th-century churches in the region. During the trip he became seriously ill with a chest infection and died on 8 May, in or near Milan. His body was taken to Lancaster, where he was buried on 19 May, alongside his wife, in the municipal cemetery. \\"Glowing obituaries\\" were carried by the local newspapers and the architectural press, including The Builder, The Building News, and The Architect. His estate was valued at \\"under £14,000\\" (equivalent to £1,290,000 as of 2018). A plaque to his memory was placed in the chancel of St Paul's, next to that of his wife. contains an answer for the question: On what date was Sharpe buried?, what is it ?
