Question: What does Juror 9 realize about the witness after seeing Juror 4 rub his nose? Title: 12 Angry Men Movie plot: In a New York City courthouse, an eighteen-year-old boy from a slum is on trial for allegedly stabbing his father to death. Final closing arguments having been presented, a visibly bored judge instructs the jury to decide whether the boy is guilty of murder. If there is any reasonable doubt of his guilt they are to return a verdict of not guilty. The judge further informs them that a guilty verdict will be accompanied by a mandatory death sentence.The jury retires to a private room, where the jurors spend a short while getting acquainted before they begin deliberating. It is immediately apparent that the jurors have already decided that the boy is guilty, and that they plan to return their verdict without taking time for discussion with the sole exception of Juror 8 (Henry Fonda), who is the only \\"not guilty\\" vote in a preliminary tally. He explains that there is too much at stake for him to go along with the verdict without at least talking about it first. His vote annoys the other jurors, especially Juror 7 (Jack Warden), who has tickets to a baseball game that evening; and Juror 10 (Ed Begley Sr.), who believes that people from slum backgrounds are liars, wild, and dangerous.The rest of the film's focus is the jury's difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict. While several of the jurors harbor personal prejudices, Juror 8 maintains that the evidence presented in the case is circumstantial, and that the boy deserves a fair deliberation. He calls into question the accuracy and reliability of the only two witnesses to the murder, the \\"rarity\\" of the murder weapon (a common switchblade, of which he has an identical copy), and the overall questionable circumstances. He further argues that he cannot in good conscience vote \\"guilty\\" when he feels there is reasonable doubt of the boy's guilt.Having argued several points and gotten no favorable response from the others, Juror 8 reluctantly agrees that he has only succeeded in hanging the jury.

I was too little to reach the telephone, but used to listen with great interest when my mother used to talk to it. Then I discovered that somewhere inside the wonderful device lived an amazing person-- her name was Information Please and there was nothing she did not know. Information Please could supply anybody's number. My first personal experience with Information Please came one day while my mother was visiting a neighbor. I accidentally hit my finger with a hammer. The pain was terrible, but there didn't seem to be any reason in crying because there was no one home to give sympathy. I walked around the house sucking my hurting finger, finally arriving at the stairway--the telephone! Climbing up I unhooked the receiver and held it to my ear. \\"Information Please,\\" I said.

Hacking Isn’t the Only Way Your Cryptocurrency Can Get Stolen You don’t need to be hacked to lose your cryptocurrency to thieves. An unidentified New York City man found out the hard way when an acquaintance allegedly entered his apartment and took his digital wallet containing 1.8 million worth of ether after another man robbed him of his keys at gunpoint. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said this type of crime will become more frequent as values of cryptocurrencies continue to surge. Ether, the second biggest cryptocurrency, has spiked to all-time highs amid a bitcoin rally. \\"Hackers, data breaches and fraud aren’t the only threats to an individual’s wealth,\\" Vance said in a statement. \\"This case demonstrates the increasingly common intersection between cyber and violent crime.” The acquaintance, identified as 35-year-old Louis Meza of Passaic, New Jersey, is charged with burglary, robbery and kidnapping and faces as long as 25 years in prison if convicted of the the most serious offenses. He pleaded not guilty in court Tuesday. The holdup happened Nov. 4 after the two men met and the victim accepted a ride home in a minivan arranged by the acquaintance, according to prosecutors. Another person who’d been hiding in the van -- who has not been apprehended -- appeared and pulled out a gun, demanding the victim’s cell phone, wallet and keys. Security cameras at the apartment building recorded Meza leaving with a box that was believed to contain the digital wallet, and records show he later transferred the ether into his personal account, prosecutors said. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Reason I say it was the dumbest is because I still acknowledge that it’s not my kind of dating scene even though I ended up meeting the love of my life through the app. Other than that? Nothing was wrong or dumb. I have done nothing much because the man I am currently dating sent me a superlike after I was on the app for less than 12 hours. I joined, created profile, went through possible matches, and then went to bed. I didn’t have enough time to do something dumb. Now my boyfriend on the other hand was on the app for 4–5 months prior to me joining and him finding me. His story is that he had been in there long enough to end up matching with some bots (robots that somehow end up joining or hacking the app. I have not a clue how) that he would have conversations with to test if they were legitimate people. He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird. When he found me, what he saw in my profile was that I was local, I was a legitimate person because I knew someone that he knew through Facebook, and I had multiple pictures of myself that looked genuine. I also had a description where I stated my intention for using the app which was that I was looking for a serious relationship. What he did after I connected with him was talk to me and then test me as the conversation progressed. How did he test me? He told a corny joke which I laughed to.

Mary starts coming apart. Irrational, she crashes on a tree to camouflage the small dent with a bigger dent. Later the news reveals the missing man is kindergarten teacher Timothy Emser (Kevin Corrigan), bipolar and unstable when he vanished. Strange things occur in Mary's house, making her feel toyed with by someone unseen; she descends into paranoia. It transpires that Rick (Christopher Shand), her boyfriend, gets involved in the cover up and goes to retrieve incriminatory evidence (a blanket) off the corpse, but is killed, replaced in Emser's grave. It becomes clear Emser survived. Unhinged, he returns to make Mary live through the same nightmare she inflicted on him. He stalks Mary many ways.

The murdered woman was her mother, Edna, who was a small town prostitute. The man in bed with her was her latest john, and his body has apparently not been recovered. A social worker named Mullins (Milton Selzer) has Ellie temporarily housed in a hospital, but Ellie wants to leave and go in search of her estranged father, whom she has never met. Mullins refuses, since Ellie is still a minor and technically a ward of the state, and Mullins says if she leaves, he will have to report it to the sheriff. Ellie does pack a suitcase and makes a run for it, but a mysterious man follows her in a car. He reveals himself to be Calvin Carruthers (Vic Tayback), a former theater performer and now a detective working for the county Sheriff's department.

If you're looking at a tree in the shape of a bear, it's a topiary . A topiary is a tree or bush that is trained into a shape. Growing a topiary garden takes both time and skills. A topiary gardener should make a drawing first. The drawing shows the final shape that the gardener likes. The gardener then chooses a bush for the topiary. It may be one that just planted or one that is already in place. In June of the plant's first year, the gardener looks for new leaves. When the leaves grow, it's time to shape the bottom of the bush. It needs about five years. The top is not _ during this time. In the fifth year, the bush grows tall enough for shaping. Then the gardener begins to shape the whole bush. Once a topiary has been started, it needs care all year. In the summer it must be cut many times to keep its shape. This cutting also helps the bush grow. In the winter the bushes don't grow. The gardeners have to brush snow off the plants, or snow may hurt some parts of them. Topiary gardening is a very old art. The Romans did it in the first century. In the sixteenth century, people in Europe liked topiaries too. By the late 1600s, topiaries were also grown in America. Today it's popular in many parts of the world.

Article: The old saying that practice makes perfect seems to make no sense when it comes to schoolwork. Many educators today are looking for evidence to support the case for homework, but are coming up empty-handed. Mary Jane Cera is the academic administrator for the Kino School, and she maintains a no-homework policy across all grades. The purpose of the policy is to make sure learning remains a joy, not a thing that discourages social time and creative activity. At the Kino school, Cera says children often choose to take their favorite parts of school home. \\"A lot of what we see kids doing is practicing music with their friends, and taking experiments home to show their parents,\\" she says. Surveys of Kino graduates suggest that the early control they are given over their education continues to serve them well into college. \\"One of the reasons that we continue to assign much homework is our obsession with tests, although we can agree on the importance of kids doing better on tests through proper homework to some degree,\\"says author Alfie Kohn. In his book The Homework Myth, Kohn points out that no study has ever found a relation between homework and academic achievement and that if kids have no choice in the matter of homework, they're not really exercising judgment, and are instead losing their sense of self-control. However, many supporters of homework argue that life is filled with things we don't like to do, and that homework teaches self-discipline, time management and other non-academic life skills. Wherever the homework debate goes next, it's worth taking a moment to examine if we're doing the right thing about our children's education. The good news is -- it's never too late to start.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Background music may seem harmless, but it can have a powerful effect on those who hear it. Recorded background music first found its way into factories, shops and restaurants in the USA. Very soon it spread to other parts of the world. Now it is becoming difficult to go shopping or eat a meal without listening to background music. To begin with, background music was intended simply to create a soothing atmosphere. Recently, however, it's becoming a big business. An American marketing expert has shown that music can boost sales or increase factory production by as much as a third. But it has to be the light music. Lively music has no effect at all on sales. Slow music can increase receipts by 34%. This is probably because shoppers slow down and have more opportunity to spot items they would like to buy. Yet, slow music isn't always the answer. The expert found that in restaurants slow music meant customers took longer to eat their meals, which reduced overall sales. So restaurant owners might be well advised to play faster music to keep the customers moving-unless, of course, the resulting indigestion leads to complaints.

Destiny Nickson, 11, spent nine days in hospital after her newly pierced ear became infected. An 11-year-old schoolgirl was forced to spend more than a week in hospital after her newly-pierced ear became infected. Destiny Nickson, from Preston, needed eight stitches and IV antibiotics after the ear swelled dramatically. She is now facing a six week recovery period and the possibility of being scarred for life. Destiny had the top of her ear pierced on March 1 and, while it was fine for the first two weeks, it soon became infected. The schoolgirl returned to the beauty parlour in Preston Indoor Market, where the initial piercing was carried out and explained the problem. The staff removed the earring, cleaned her ear, and put a new earring in. They also insisted they could not be blamed for an infection that took hold three weeks after the piercing. Destiny’s mother, Veronica Nickson, 37, said: ‘It was okay for two weeks. It's not the first piercing that has caused the real damage. ‘I know there is a risk with ear piercing. It's what they did the second time when she went back that is my main concern.’ By the time she got home from the salon, Destiny’s ear had ‘doubled in size’, her mother claims. Seeing the swelling, she took her daughter to the doctor who gave her antibiotics. This failed to resolve the problem which just got progressively worse. Eventually,. Destiny was admitted to Royal Preston Hospital on March 26 where she. had the wound lanced and stitched up before she was discharged three. days later. Destiny (pictured with mother, Veronica) is now facing a six week recovery period and the possibility of being scarred for life. However, she then had to be readmitted on April 2 and was kept in for six days while she was given antibiotics through a drip. Ms Nickson said: ‘She had it lanced twice and she had surgery on it twice. After that she was on an IV drip of antibiotics. ‘They put two drains in it because the blood was collecting in her ear and the infection had rotted her cartilage. ‘She has actually lost some of that cartilage. She is a pretty girl and it could have a big impact on her life. The surgeon has said it could take up to six weeks to heal.’ Ms Nickson has raised concerns about the treatment her daughter received from the tattoo and piercing studio. However, Danny Kynaston, master body piercer at Beauty Spot, the piercing and tattoo parlour that Destiny visited, said his team carry out hundreds of ear piercings every week without any complaints and had followed stringent guidelines. The salon that pierced Destiny's ear claims it cannot be responsible for an infection that appeared three weeks after the piercing. Mr Kynaston added that if his shop had caused the infection it would have been apparent within 24 hours, not three weeks later. He said: ‘We pierce a lot of people's ears, more people in Lancashire than anyone probably, and this is a first for us. ‘I don't re-use anything, everything isn't cleaned, it's thrown away. ‘The drill goes away and is sterilised at a warehouse. There is no chance of infection. ‘If it was after about 24 hours I might think to myself something has gone wrong here, but three weeks later it's clearly not to do with us.’ He added that in very rare cases people can be allergic to the titanium used in all their piercings. He said: ‘We take it out and put a plastic one in if that's the case. ‘She would have got instructions on how to clean it. We give them free sea salt and instructions on how to use it.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"The article revolves around an 11-year-old schoolgirl, Destiny Nickson, who spent more than a week in the hospital due to an infected ear piercing.

Choose the correct sentiment from candidates: Options: (i) negative; (ii) positive; TEXT:My wife and I just finished this movie and I came onto to IMDb to commiserate with the reviewers that found this movie less than satisfactory. However, of the 10 pages of reviews, only a handful are negative. I feel that this movie is a great concept gone horribly awry and I want to warn those who are looking to watch the movie into the future. I admit, I'm more inspired to write reviews when I don't like a movie than as to when I do, so my handful of reviews are all negative. Still, that doesn't mean I'm biased towards not enjoying a movie, but I often find more eloquent reviews of movies I do enjoy. Paris je t'aime is the most pretentious movie I've seen in years. By using an \\"intelligent\\" concept and attaching some big talent to a couple of the WAY to many short stories, the movie ends up the worst of all worlds. It is art for arts sake, but something that a 2 year old could dream up and accomplish. Giving the director free reign of 5 minutes of screen time proves why there is a division of labor even in entertainment. Directors can't write, writers can't direct. (I'd like to throw in also that Clint Eastwood is overrated, but that is because he's an actor turn director {which rarely works, either}). What ends up on the screen is a garbled mess of short stories that don't make any sense, are not completed in 5 minutes and in total, spoil Paris to me. Why call it Paris je t'aime when a more apropos title is cluster f*ck? There are only a couple stories that are watchable, most notably the piece by Alfonso Cuarón, but everything else will fall into obscurity. The Coen brothers short is passable, but can you name a movie of theirs that does not contain a scene with a pick guitar? It's as if all the directors decided on doing whatever it is they want to do and chose Paris as the place to do it. As we all love Paris, present company included, we are blinded by the fact that this movie SUCKS. In fact, I think they put the directors names on each of the shorts because directors saw how poor of a film this is and decided to make sure they were blamed only for their 5 minutes. Seriously. SERIOUSLY. People, Natalie Portman is NOT a good actress. She is is not a pixie dream girl waiting to be yours. And Maggie Gyllenhaal, why?!? Are you people acting or just regurgitating performances from other movies? I'm looking at you Natalie Portman (Garden State, Closer), Elijah Wood (Sin City) and Catalina Sandino Moreno (Maria Full of Grace). One final comment on the acting: I give double kudos to Nick Nolte for acting and looking more humane than you have in ages or perhaps ever will again. Find his short on youtube as his 5 minutes are quite enjoyable. Writing short stories is very difficult and only a handful of authors have gotten it right. I'm thinking of Ernst Hemingway, Raymond Carver, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and John Cheever, just to name a few. It is much harder than writing a full novel and only the truly talented can accomplish this. The same can be said about short films. It appears that only one director will live on in the annals of history. If you uphold Paris as a gem to be discovered and reflected through your own lenses with your own story, then don't expect to enjoy this movie at all. The directors either didn't care or were lazy. In either scenario, by the time you are reading this it means you rented it. Praise be that you didn't pay 10 dollars a head in theaters for it.","completion":"I have analyzed the given text.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person who possibly acquired his later connections with the French royal chapel through early experiences at Saint-Quentin?, using the article: Little is known for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is inferential and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin was born in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, \\"des Prez\\" was an alternative name.According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a friend and librarian of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet.

Tracking these and other animals Choose your answer: based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Marine Biologists can not travel outside Illinois\\"? OPTIONS: --Yes. --It's impossible to say. --No. I think the answer is","completion":"--No. Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it is evident that marine biologists, like Kevin Kocot, can and do travel outside of Illinois. Kocot's research involves studying invertebrates, which requires him to embark on deep-sea expeditions to various locations around the world, such as Iceland, Australia, and even Antarctica. These expeditions allow him to track and study tiny mollusks and other marine animals. Marine biologists work to understand the marine ecosystem, its diverse species, and how they interact with their environment. This includes studying the effects of climate change on marine life and ecosystems. The habitats and ecosystems that marine biologists study are not confined to a specific location, such as Illinois, but instead span all oceans, seas, and coastal regions of the planet. Climate change has the potential to profoundly impact marine life and ecosystems across the globe. Rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and increased water temperatures all pose significant threats to marine species and their habitats. These factors can disrupt species distribution, reproductive processes, and food chains, leading to dire consequences for biodiversity and ocean health. Given the far-reaching implications of climate change on marine life and the vastness of the world's oceans, it is necessary for marine biologists to travel and study different regions to understand and address complex ecological challenges. Studying the effects of climate change specifically requires a global perspective and collaboration among scientists, as environmental stressors and their impacts on marine life cannot be fully understood or addressed by examining only one specific area. In summary, the answer is \\"No,\\" and the paragraph demonstrates that marine biologists, such as Kevin Kocot, do travel outside of Illinois to conduct their research. By exploring diverse locations and ecosystems, marine biologists can better understand the intricate relationships between marine life, their environment, and the challenges that climate change presents to our oceans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: A paradox is a statement that, despite apparently valid reasoning from true premises, leads to an apparently-self-contradictory or logically unacceptable conclusion.[1][2] A paradox involves contradictory-yet-interrelated elements that exist simultaneously and persist over time.[3][4][5] Paragraph: In ancient Greece King Juno asked two of his court philosophers, philosopher A and philosopher B, to come up with two interesting problems. Philosopher A devised a clever paradox and presented it before the court. He called the paradox Problem A. But philosopher B didn't come up with a paradox. He too presented a clever problem which was not a paradox - he called it problem B. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which problem would more likely have logically unacceptable conclusion, problem A or problem B?","completion":"Given the information provided in the paragraph: 1. Problem A is a clever paradox devised by Philosopher A. 2. Problem B is a clever problem (but not a paradox) devised by Philosopher B. By definition, a paradox is a statement that leads to an apparently-self-contradictory or logically unacceptable conclusion, even when reasoning from true premises. Since Problem A is a paradox, it is more likely to have a logically unacceptable conclusion. In comparison, Problem B, though a clever problem, is not a paradox; it does not necessarily lead to a logically unacceptable conclusion.

He began playing drums, and by junior high was organizing local drum and bugle parades with his neighborhood friends. He later joined his high school's marching and jazz bands and the orchestra. He played for the Connecticut and Norwalk Symphony Orchestras as part of their youth orchestra program. In 1965, Crane was offered the starring role in a television situation comedy about a German POW camp. Hogan's Heroes became a hit and finished in the top 10 in its first year on the air. The distinctive military-style snare drum rhythm that introduces the show's theme song was played by Crane himself. The series lasted for six seasons, and Crane was nominated for an Emmy Award twice, in 1966 and 1967. In 1968, he became romantically involved with cast member Patricia Olson, who played Hilda under the stage name Sigrid Valdis. He divorced Anne in 1970, just prior to their 21st anniversary, and married Olson on the set of the show later that year. Their son, Scotty, was born June 4, 1971, and they later adopted a daughter, Ana Marie. The couple separated in 1977, but according to several family members, reconciled shortly before Crane's death. In 1968, Crane and series costars Werner Klemperer, Leon Askin, and John Banner appeared with Elke Sommer in a feature film, The Wicked Dreams of Paula Schultz, set in the divided city of Berlin during the Cold War. In 1969, Crane starred with Abby Dalton in a dinner theater production of Cactus Flower. Crane frequently videotaped and photographed his own sexual escapades. During the run of Hogan's Heroes, Richard Dawson introduced Crane to John Henry Carpenter, a regional sales manager for Sony Electronics, who often helped famous clients with their video equipment. The two men struck up a friendship and began going to bars together. Crane attracted women due to his celebrity status and introduced Carpenter as his manager. Later, they would videotape their sexual encounters. While Crane's son Robert later insisted that all of the women were aware of the videotaping and consented to it, some, according to one source, had no idea that they had been filmed until informed by Scottsdale police after Crane's murder. Carpenter later became national sales manager at Akai, and arranged his business trips to coincide with Crane's dinner-theater touring schedule so that the two could continue seducing and videotaping women after Hogan's Heroes had run its course.

Although dissertations on clothing and its function appear from the 19th century as colonising countries dealt with new environments, concerted scientific research into psycho-social, physiological and other functions of clothing (e.g. protective, cartage) occurred in the first half of the 20th century, with publications such as J. C. Flügel's Psychology of Clothes in 1930, and Newburgh's seminal Physiology of Heat Regulation and The Science of Clothing in 1949. By 1968, the field of environmental physiology had advanced and expanded significantly, but the science of clothing in relation to environmental physiology had changed little. While considerable research has since occurred and the knowledge-base has grown significantly, the main concepts remain unchanged, and indeed Newburgh's book is still cited by contemporary authors, including those attempting to develop thermoregulatory models of clothing development.

A video was released on Saturday showing the beheading of a US aid worker and 18 Syrian prisoners. Earlier Home Secretary Theresa May told the Commons the killing of American Abdul-Rahman Kassig demonstrated the \\"deadly threat\\" faced by the UK. Mr Kassig - known as Peter before he converted to Islam - became the fifth western captive beheaded by IS in recent months. The father of a British man thought to be pictured in the video has denied it is his son. Ahmed Muthana said 20-year-old Nasser Muthana was not among the uniformed jihadists seen in the footage. Meanwhile the Ministry of Defence said it had carried out further air strikes against the militants in Iraq. It released a video which it said showed a single RAF missile strike on an IS communications vehicle. Appearing in the Commons after discussing the West's response to IS at the G20 in Australia, Mr Cameron said: \\"We will not be cowed by these sick terrorists. They will be defeated and they must face the justice that they deserve. \\"The threat is faced by countries right across the world. We must face it together.\\" Mr Cameron said new legislation aimed at tackling British citizens going abroad to fight with the militants would be introduced in the next two weeks. The Counter-Terrorism Bill would give police new powers to seize passports, stop suspects from travelling, and to stop Britons returning to the UK \\"unless they do so on our terms\\", he said. Mrs May said Mr Kassig's murder, and the recent attack on the Canadian parliament, were reminders of \\"the very deadly threat we face from terrorism at home and abroad\\". She told MPs: \\"That is why protecting the British public remains this government's number one priority and why we're taking urgent action to ensure our police and intelligence agencies have all the tools they need to keep people safe.\\" Labour leader Ed Miliband said the latest beheading was another demonstration of IS's \\"evil ideology\\" that reinforced \\"our determination\\" to defeat the militants.","completion":"The prime minister refers to IS as \\"sick terrorists\\" and promises they will be defeated.

Article: COLUMBUS, Ohio--The heart operation taking place in the pale-green operating room at the Ohio State University Medical Center was unusual. The patient, a 62-year-old man, was made to sleep, tied with blue drapes and lying face up on a narrow table. But no one was touching him. Instead, the operation was being performed by a robot, whose three metal arms went through pencil-sized holes in the man's chest. At the ends of the robot's arms were tiny metal fingers, with turning wrists, which held a tiny instrument, a light and a camera. The robot's arms and fingers were controlled by Dr. Randall K. Wolf, sitting at a computer in a corner of the operating room about 20 feet away. This sort of operation, heart surgeons say, is the start of what may be the biggest change in their profession since heart bypass surgery began nearly 30 years ago. \\"The reason we make cuts is that we have big hands,\\" said Dr. Wolf, the director of the surgery at Ohio State. The robot's _ fingers, no longer than a nail on the small finger, at the end of the long sticks could work better. Eventually, surgeons believe, most heart surgery will be done by robots whose arms are put in through pencil-sized holes punched in patients' chests. Instead of directly staring into a patient's body, surgeons will view magnified images of the operation on computer screens. In theory, the doctor would not have to be in the same room, or even the same country, as the patient. Question: The main idea of this passage is that heart surgery by robots _ .

Each chemical bond in a molecule vibrates at a frequency characteristic of that bond. A group of atoms in a molecule (e.g., CH2) may have multiple modes of oscillation caused by the stretching and bending motions of the group as a whole. If an oscillation leads to a change in dipole in the molecule then it will absorb a photon that has the same frequency. The vibrational frequencies of most molecules correspond to the frequencies of infrared light. Typically, the technique is used to study organic compounds using light radiation from 4000–400 cm−1, the mid-infrared. A spectrum of all the frequencies of absorption in a sample is recorded. This can be used to gain information about the sample composition in terms of chemical groups present and also its purity (for example, a wet sample will show a broad O-H absorption around 3200 cm−1). What is the technique that analyzes the constituent bonds of molecules to identify them? What is the answer?

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: I recently decided to revisit The Omen trilogy only to discover that {insert demonic music here} there is a fourth. I didn't expect much from it, and in that respect it certainly lived up to my expectations. If you're into watching bad movies for a laugh, then this just may be the movie for you. Oh, where do we start? From the onset, the \\"made for TV\\" look and feel of the movie was obvious. The music was often inappropriately matched with what was happening in the movie and therefore (at best) distracting. The script had all the suspense of an 8 year-olds work of fiction. But one thing that must be said is that the lacking script was very well matched up with the appalling acting. Numerous scenes left me contemplating whether it was the script or the acting that was the source of ridiculousness. The story itself is quite thin, centering on all the crazy antics of the daughter of Damien Thorn, adopted out by wrong-doing and badly acted nuns. There is the usual lot of mysterious and convoluted deaths that personally made me yawn as the \\"drama\\" unfolded, and the usual third-party investigator into the whole affair. Later, via some medical phenomena, Damien Thorn Jnr is born. And that pretty much wraps up the plot. The whole thing is executed rather badly right from the beginning with the lack of suspense making the movie one monotonous and/or ridiculous scene after another. There were many WTF?!? moments too that provides the unintended comedy relief. For example, what's with the major over-reaction at the beginning of the movie when the baby scratches the mother's cheek?? Hardly a 360-degree-head-turning omen. I also laughed at the over-reaction at the baptism. The baby cries, and everyone looks very concerned. The distressed mother runs out of the church and the priest is left looking very alarmed while crossing himself. Huh? Then there is the new-age nanny that seems to have carte blanche on exposing an 8 year-old to all kind of alternative spiritualism. I laughed when the nanny suggested bringing the troubled Delia to a psychic fair to meet the nanny's hippie friends and the mother just shrugs her shoulders and allows it. \\"Yeah that's groovy, fill my troubled 8 year old daughter's head with all this mysticism stuff. That's cool. I don't need to be there.\\" Of course this would be expected from a mother who allows her daughter to adopt a fully grown Rottweiler they encounter on the street that could bite the little girls head off as a snack. The entire scene at the psychic fair is quite comical in a slapstick kinda way, from the horrified reactionary stares of the psychics to Delia, to the ensuing inferno. I also laughed at how the nun's death is considered a \\"freak accident\\". Here we have a religious zealot, (who is described as being part of a cult), who is fanatically preaching in a pit full of rattlesnakes to prove how God's Glory will protect them. She antagonizes the snakes by handling them and SOMEHOW she is bitten several times. Hardly a freak accident. More like a successful suicide attempt. The snakes-vs-nun scene wasn't the only comical death. There is the slow-speed car accident resulting in decapitation in a school parking lot. Then there is the slow-motion demolition ball headed straight for the detective. I believe I may have gone and made a coffee when the slow-motion started only to come back to see the demolition ball still headed straight for the \\"concerned\\" detective. Then there is the quintessential who-shot-who cliché death, where a gun goes off and both act as if they have been shot for several seconds while exchanging horrified glances. Then someone goes tumbling down the stairs revealing who the real victim was. Additionally, the death of the priest at the beginning of the movie seemed a little strange and pointless to me. He runs around looking at the architecture of the church. Obviously finding this quite distressing, he eventually collapses, clutching his chest and dies. Apparently something demonic was happening, as this is what the music was suggesting. Ummm. OK. I am surprised that others have reviewed this film favorably and, in particularly, as a \\"worthy sequel\\". It is difficult not to notice the non-sensical script, the unrealistic acting, and the inappropriate musical score. The movie lacks any suspense, relying heavily on Delia's \\"demonic stare\\" to provide a sense of horror, which becomes rather annoying after a short time. Bottom line : This is a bad movie with the only redeeming feature being it's unintended potential for being a comedy.

Why do some countries have a variant of the name?\\" Please tell me if those questions are the same. OPT: (I) no. (II) yes.","completion":"I will first answer the initial questions, then I will address whether the two questions are the same or not. To provide a thorough response, I will first research the origin of the name 'Guinea' and the context in which it is used in various countries' names. Step 1: Research the origin of the term 'Guinea' The name 'Guinea' is believed to be derived from the Berber or Tuareg term \\"Akal n-Iguinawen\\", which means \\"the land of the black people.\\" It was used by North African traders to refer to the region they encountered south of the Sahara. Later, European traders and explorers adopted the name for the West African coastal region as they began exploring and trading in the area. Step 2: Identify countries with 'Guinea' in their name Some of the countries that have 'Guinea' in their name include Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, and Papua New Guinea. Step 3: Explain the use of 'Guinea' in these country names - Guinea and Guinea-Bissau: These countries are located on the West African coast, and their names reflect the historical practice of using 'Guinea' to refer to this broader region. The distinction between these two names is due to their colonial history - Guinea was a French colony, while Guinea-Bissau was a Portuguese colony. - Equatorial Guinea: This African country, previously a Spanish colony, is named so because of its location near the equatorial line and its historical association with the Guinea region. - Papua New Guinea: Papua New Guinea, an island nation to the north of Australia, has no geographical or historical connection to the Guinea region of Africa. The name came about because, when European explorers first encountered the indigenous people of Papua, they noticed similarities in appearance between them and the people from the Guinea coast of Africa. This led to the application of the name 'New Guinea' to the island. Now to address whether the two questions are the same or not: \\"Why do so many countries have 'Guinea' in their name?\\" - This question focuses on understanding the commonality between the various countries that have 'Guinea' in their name. \\"What does 'Guinea' mean? Why do some countries have a variant of the name?\\" - This question first asks about the meaning of 'Guinea,' and then inquires about the reason behind the use of this term in country names. Answer: (I) no. While the questions are related and their answers overlap, they are not the same. The first question seeks to explain the prevalence of 'Guinea' in country names, whereas the second question looks for the meaning of 'Guinea' and the reason for its usage in these names."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Please answer the following question: Background: As time passes, the number of HIV copies keeps increasing, while the number of helper T cells keeps decreasing. The graph in Figure below shows how the number of T cells typically declines over a period of many years following the initial HIV infection. As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections. Medicines can slow down the virus but not get rid of it, so there is no cure at present for HIV infections or AIDS. There also is no vaccine to immunize people against HIV infection, but scientists are working to develop one. Paragraph: Jacob recently contracted the HIV virus and is going to his first support meeting. While there, he meets Dan and strikes up a conversation with him. Dan says that he has had HIV for over a decade at this point and has learned ways to live with it. He is able to give Jacob some good advice on how to handle things and Jacob is very grateful to have someone to talk with. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person's body will struggle more to defend from the HIV infection? A:","completion":"Given the information provided in the paragraph, we can infer that Dan's body will struggle more to defend from the HIV infection. Dan has had HIV for over a decade, and as the explanation on the background states, the number of helper T cells decreases over time following the initial HIV infection. With a lower number of T cells, the ability of the immune system to defend the body is weakened, so Dan's body will likely have a harder time fighting off infections compared to Jacob, who has recently contracted the virus.

When considering the hypothesis, \\"The person is near the car,\\" we can analyze the given scenario and deduce that the hypothesis is indeed true. To break down the scenario further, we have a person who is not only near the car but also partially beneath it. This positioning indicates that the individual is not just close but in direct contact with the vehicle. The face-down position further suggests that they might be working on the underside of the car, observing something specific, or perhaps accidentally ended up in that position.

What is the most logical completion of this news story?. (CNN) -- Greg Allen's obsession with finding his missing daughter began more than a decade ago, when the mother finally made good on a threat and fled with the daughter from Texas to Mexico, according to him and authorities. Sabrina Allen was a month away from turning age 5, and the visit with her non-custodial mother, Dara Marie Llorens, was supposed to last only a weekend in April 2002, as part of a court agreement. But that weekend visitation in Austin lasted 12 years and finally ended Tuesday, when Mexican and U.S. authorities said they found the girl and her mother living in seclusion in a small apartment in a town between Mexico City and Puebla. The mother will face charges in Travis County, Texas, said Dan Powers, an FBI assistant special agent in charge in San Antonio, Texas.

Following the discovery of Sabrina Allen and her mother in Mexico, Greg Allen expressed relief and gratitude to the authorities for their relentless efforts in locating his daughter. In a statement, he thanked the FBI, the Mexican Federal Police, and the various organizations and individuals who had assisted in the search over the years. Sabrina Allen, now 17 years old, was taken into the custody of the U.S. State Department officials and underwent medical evaluations before being reunited with her father. Dara Marie Llorens was arrested and later extradited to Texas, where she faces multiple charges, including kidnapping, interference with child custody, and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. Llorens had violated the court agreement that granted Greg Allen custody of his daughter by fleeing to Mexico with Sabrina. Over the course of 12 years, she managed to evade law enforcement by constantly moving and using false identification documents. Sabrina Allen's case garnered significant media attention and public support, with her father's determination to find her gaining widespread admiration. As the story unfolded, it was revealed that Llorens had a history of mental health issues and had made threats to take Sabrina away on multiple occasions. Greg Allen, fearing for his daughter's safety, had founded a nonprofit organization to advocate for missing and exploited children and their families, turning his personal tragedy into a mission to help others. Upon reuniting with his daughter, Greg Allen expressed hope for the future but acknowledged the challenges that lie ahead as Sabrina adjusts to a new life and recovers from the traumatic experience. He requested privacy for their family during this transitional period and expressed his intention to help Sabrina reconnect with her previous life and ensure she receives the necessary support to heal and move forward. Meanwhile, as Dara Marie Llorens awaits trial for the charges against her, the public and media focus on what led her to take such drastic actions and the lasting impact it has had on both Sabrina Allen and Greg Allen. With the critical role of both Mexican and U.S. authorities in resolving this case, it also serves as a reminder of the importance of international cooperation in cases involving parental abduction and the need to continue working together to resolve similar situations worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Two neighboring countries France and Spain were competing for economical supremacy in Europe. Spain dug up fossil fuels and used it as an energy source. France used alternative sources of energy. Which country released less greenhouse gas into the atmosphere? A:","completion":"A: France released less greenhouse gas into the atmosphere due to its use of alternative sources of energy. To further elaborate on this answer, it is important to understand the differences between the energy sources used by both countries - fossil fuels and alternative (renewable) sources of energy - and their impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Fossil fuels are hydrocarbon compounds that are formed from the remains of dead plants and animals over millions of years. These fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, are commonly used to generate electricity, power transportation, and heat homes. When fossil fuels are burned, carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases trap heat and contribute to global warming and climate change, making it vital to reduce their emissions. Spain's reliance on fossil fuels for energy generation contributes to higher greenhouse gas emissions. Dug up from beneath the Earth's surface, these fuels release significant amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere when they are consumed. In addition, fossil fuel extraction and transportation can also lead to other environmental hazards, such as oil spills and air pollution. On the other hand, France's use of alternative sources of energy, which include solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear power, results in lower greenhouse gas emissions. These renewable energy sources generate electricity or heat without relying on the combustion of fossil fuels and, therefore, produce minimal CO2 emissions. Additionally, renewable energy sources are sustainable and replenish themselves naturally, making them more environmentally friendly compared to fossil fuels. Nuclear energy, a significant part of France's energy mix, also plays a role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Though not strictly considered a renewable energy source, nuclear power generation does not emit CO2 during the process of producing electricity. However, it is important to note that nuclear energy does come with its own set of concerns, such as radioactive waste management and risks associated with nuclear accidents. In summary, France released less greenhouse gas into the atmosphere due to its focus on alternative sources of energy, which generate lower amounts of CO2 and other greenhouse gases compared to fossil fuels. This approach not only helps the country decrease its environmental impact but also demonstrates a commitment to leveraging sustainable energy solutions and mitigating climate change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now, back to Caithness. A kind and caring lady named Gail Ross, who is the civic leader of this area, has noticed that the people in the Far North are not getting enough help from ambulances when they need it. That means, when someone gets sick or gets hurt, an ambulance might take a very long time to get there. This is not okay because when people need help, they need it fast! That's why Gail Ross is asking for more ambulances to be added to the Far North, so that everyone can get the help they need right away. Sure, adding more ambulances might cost some extra money, but Gail Ross knows that the safety and health of her neighbors are very important. She also understands that taking care of each other is what makes a community strong and happy.

Instead it is located in the middle of Silverado Ranch. The staff is friendly and warm. Genuine service is rare. Yes, they do stumble in certain aspects, but the amount of attentiveness is inspiring. I didn't go long without refilled glasses, finished plates were removed, and a quick overview of each dish was offered upon presentation. The food is solid. I need to go back again to see if the consistency is there. If so, it would definitely be elevated to a five star review. Reasonably priced and generous are two ways to describe Yuzu. Between four of us, we ordered a bevy of items and had a feast presented to us. They course out well. Yes, we were the only ones left at the end of the night, so I wonder how that will play off at full capacity. Generally, my favorite items were all soy based. The Zaru Tofu is some of the best I've had. The use of yuzu kosho, grated ginger, chives, and their special sauce made for a well balanced dish. The Yuba Sashimi comes from the skimmed off top from the tofu making process. I might have finished off most of the plate while my party wasn't looking. I am not a huge fan of salmon, but their collar had me picking at both orders on the table. It is very generous. Picking is not a good description, because there was very little work in finding meat. The halibut carpaccio in a sauce similar to chimichurri was spectacular. Tender slices of white fish in a garlicy green sauce was almost perfect. It just needed a little more acid. The green tea buckwheat noodles are cooked perfectly. The sauce is light. Nothing overbearing. The black pig cutlet was good, just not the best. Same goes with the karaage. I would order them again, but with so many other choices, I could stick to the non meat items and fish. I am not sure if I should be happy that they are so close.

Even though the reviewer mentioned a few areas of improvement, such as the lack of acid in one of the dishes and wondering about the restaurant's ability to handle full capacity, these are made in the context of primarily positive observations and thus do not change the overall sentiment to negative.

She was in her Carmel, California, home. She is survived by her older sister, actress Olivia de Havilland -- with whom she had not spoken for decades. Fontaine was born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland in 1916 in Tokyo, Japan, where her British father was a patent lawyer and teacher. She and her sister moved to Saratoga, California, with their mother in 1919 when her parents separated. Fontaine was a teenager when she began her acting career as Joan Burfield in the 1935 film \\"No More Ladies.\\" She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband. She wrote in her 1978 autobiography, \\"No Bed of Roses,\\" that her mother, who was an actress, began encouraging the rivalry with her older sister at an early age. The feud extended to their careers when both sisters were nominated for best actress Oscars in 1942. Fontaine, who was nominated for Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Suspicion,\\" beat her sister Olivia de Havilland, who was nominated for \\"Hold Back the Dawn.\\" De Havilland won the first of her two Oscars in 1947 when she was given the best actress award for \\"To Each His Own.\\" De Havilland and Fontaine remain the only sisters who have best-actress Academy Awards.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Who was the majority group in Sao Paulo province?, using the article: White Brazilians descended from the original Portuguese settlers. From the 1870s onwards this ethnic group also included other European immigrants: mainly Italians, Spaniards and Germans. Although whites could be found throughout the country, they were the majority group in the southern region and in São Paulo province. Whites also comprised a significant proportion (40%) of the population in the northeastern provinces of Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or brown. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piauí, Maranhão, Pará and Amazonas.Because of the existence of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% whites, 38.3% browns, 19.7% blacks and 3.9% Indians. The second official national census in 1890 revealed that in a population of 14,333,915, 44% were whites, 32.4% browns, 14.6% blacks and 9% Indians., what would be the answer ?

Answer the above question based on the context below: Big Butte Creek drains approximately 245 square miles (635 km2) of southern Oregon. Elevations range from 1,562 feet (476.1 m) at the creek's mouth to 9,495 feet (2,894 m) at the summit of Mount McLoughlin, with an average of 3,528 feet (1,075 m). About 56 percent is federally owned by the Bureau of Land Management and the United States Forest Service, 44 percent is privately owned, and a small fraction belongs to the City of Medford.The Big Butte Creek watershed experiences a Mediterranean climate. Temperatures range from 10 °F (−12 °C) in the winter to 100 °F (38 °C) in the summer. Precipitation averages between 35 and 80 inches (890 and 2,000 mm) annually. Most precipitation occurs between November and March. Nine percent of the watershed's surface runoff is collected from rain, 35 percent from rain on snow, and 56 percent from snow. The watershed contains the largest groundwater source in the entire Rogue River basin; one major outlet is at Big Butte Springs.The watershed is split into two geographic regions: the High Cascades and the Western Cascades, both volcanic in origin. The Western Cascades compose the western two thirds of the watershed. This region is highly eroded, being between 17 and 38 million years old. Its unstable slopes are primarily made of pyroclastic rock. Due to the rock's high ability to absorb moisture, earthflows are common. The High Cascades are much younger, around three to seven million years old. Mount McLoughlin is the most prominent High Cascade volcano in the watershed, last erupting between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago. Basalt and andesite are the most common rock types in this region.Nearby watersheds include Little Butte Creek to the south, small Klamath River tributaries such as Fourmile Creek to the east, the South Fork Rogue River to the east and north, and minor tributaries of the Rogue River including Reese and Indian creeks to the west.

Question: Dong Zhongshu's Confucianism was different from the one of? Context: The early Western Han court simultaneously accepted the philosophical teachings of Legalism, Huang-Lao Daoism, and Confucianism in making state decisions and shaping government policy. However, the Han court under Emperor Wu gave Confucianism exclusive patronage. He abolished all academic chairs or erudites (bóshì 博士) not dealing with the Confucian Five Classics in 136 BC and encouraged nominees for office to receive a Confucian-based education at the Imperial University that he established in 124 BC. Unlike the original ideology espoused by Confucius, or Kongzi (551–479 BC), Han Confucianism in Emperor Wu's reign was the creation of Dong Zhongshu (179–104 BC). Dong was a scholar and minor official who aggregated the ethical Confucian ideas of ritual, filial piety, and harmonious relationships with five phases and yin-yang cosmologies. Much to the interest of the ruler, Dong's synthesis justified the imperial system of government within the natural order of the universe. The Imperial University grew in importance as the student body grew to over 30,000 by the 2nd century AD. A Confucian-based education was also made available at commandery-level schools and private schools opened in small towns, where teachers earned respectable incomes from tuition payments.

Here is an article: WASHINGTON — With Tuesday’s primaries reinforcing the strength of the Republican establishment, House Democrats are reassessing their electoral strategy based on a major internal research project that shows their candidates stand a better chance when they portray Republicans as unsympathetic to the economic situation of working Americans while protecting the wealthy. The research, initiated to help the party find a way to spur midterm turnout, also found that calls for an increase in the minimum wage — a top recent priority of Congressional Democrats and the White House — is not by itself enough to motivate swing voters to go to the polls and back Democrats in the fall. “It concerns voters but doesn’t necessarily motivate them to vote in the midterms,” said Representative Steve Israel of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Mr. Israel presented the extensive findings to a meeting of House Democrats on Wednesday morning, the day after six states — Kentucky, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Pennsylvania and Oregon — held primaries. The primaries showed that incumbent Republicans in both the House and Senate are beating back challenges from the right in this election cycle, leaving Democrats fewer opportunities to take on either weakened incumbents or more conservative contenders who can be vulnerable in the general election. If the pattern continues, it will reduce the playing field for Democrats and increase the need for them to make their strongest case in races where they are competitive. The Democrats’ six-figure research project will shape the party’s strategy over the coming months. It involved four separate pollsters and included a special focus on Hispanic and African-American voters, going well beyond previous efforts by the campaign organization. It covered 67 House districts, included 16 focus groups and tested various advertising attacks and themes. The research illustrates clearly that Democrats, trying to prevent any loss of seats, recognize that they face a special challenge in again turning out Democratically inclined voters who gave President Obama a victory in 2012. Democrats say the most heartening finding was that economic themes that rally committed Democratic voters also serve to encourage unaffiliated voters and the so-called drop-off Democrats – those who voted in the presidential election but might not vote this year. In contrast, the research suggested to Democrats that the conservative issues that stir committed Republican voters, such as the new health care law, tend to turn off centrist voters that both parties are fighting over. “We are fortunate that we can use messages to both universes of people,” said Jefrey Pollock, president of the Global Strategy Group, a Democratic pollster who worked on the project, noting that Republicans “can’t talk to their right wing” without alienating independent voters. Republicans said that they believed they have the upper hand in the overall battle for the House and that Democrats remain on the defensive over the Affordable Care Act and the continuing slow recovery of the employment market. Earlier this week, Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, set a goal of gaining 12 seats in the election to bring the Republican majority to 245, an outcome that even Republicans acknowledged seemed ambitious. “I’m confident that with so many outstanding recruits in districts all across the country, and with the wind at our backs, that we will continue to expand the playing field and rise to this challenge,” Mr. Walden said. Democrats expressed surprise that Mr. Walden would put down such a definitive marker five months before the election and said their new data helped them formulate a game plan that should keep them competitive, given some advantages at the field organizing level and in party fund-raising. Democrats this week reported again that they had outraised House Republicans and that they retain a more than 11 million edge in available cash. In doing the research, Democratic consultants tested several advertisements with voters and found that the most effective one featured a fictitious Republican congressman who backed the government shutdown but continued to collect his check while the House gym remained open. It accused the make-believe House member of being more interested in the perquisites of office than representing his constituents. Democrats said the advertising response showed that while the shutdown seems like history in current political terms, it remains a powerful negative for Republicans when it is linked to the benefits of office. “You can expect to see a pairing of the two, Republicans protecting their perks while turning their backs on the middle class,” Mr. Israel said. According to Democrats, the research showed that many voters questioned were already inclined to believe that Republicans backed policies favoring the wealthy and corporate American. The consultants said Democrats could build on this distrust by emphasizing support for policies such as equal pay for men and women, ensuring that corporations pay a fair share of taxes and increased job opportunities in the United States. While the minimum wage was not a driver for swing voters, the polling of Hispanic voters showed that a wage increase was a winning issue with that constituency, which saw the economy as its most important issue. On health care, Democrats said the research reinforced their view that Republicans have been unable to make it the defining issue of the campaign. The polling suggested that Democrats who say they intend to correct “bad” elements of the health care law while retaining popular provisions such as preventing insurers from dropping sick customers earn a significant advantage over Republicans who favor straight repeal of the law. Assessing the findings, Democrats said they saw the possibility of using the composition of the electorate in swing districts to their advantage by focusing on a populist economic message given its appeal to both Democrats and independents.

Lindsey was always happy while Betty was always grumpy at school, so","completion":"it was quite a wonder how the two of them became best friends. Their classmates often couldn't understand how the ever-cheerful Lindsey and the constantly irritated Betty could even stand each other, let alone be inseparable. But that's precisely what they were, proving that opposites do indeed attract. They met in first grade when an art teacher paired them together for a group project. A seemingly random pairing would turn out to be a lifelong friendship. From the moment they began working together, it was evident that their dynamic was unique. Lindsey's happy-go-lucky attitude and optimism proved to be the perfect antidote to Betty's cynicism and negativity. In their own odd way, they balanced each other out. Their friendship blossomed over the years, with Lindsey inviting Betty to her birthdays and other social events, and Betty introducing Lindsey to her favorite hobbies, such as reading and writing. Initially, it was challenging for their classmates and teachers alike to understand how Lindsey's bubbly and enthusiastic demeanor could exist alongside Betty's grumpy and sometimes hostile attitude. Those on the outside were quick to judge their friendship, but they failed to see the strong bond that had been built on trust, support, and genuine love for one another. In middle school, when adolescent hormones were wreaking havoc on their peer group, Betty and Lindsey found solace in each other's company. Lindsey's positivity helped Betty wade through depression and anxiety, while Betty's brutally honest opinions allowed Lindsey to stay grounded and avoid becoming too naive or overly trusting. It was clear that, despite their vastly different personalities, they were utterly indispensable to one another. Entering high school, the girls' personalities continued to evolve, with Lindsey becoming more outgoing and vivacious and Betty developing a dry wit that occasionally brought a smile to her face. They both joined the debate team, a decision that puzzled many given that their arguments and discussions often turned into heated exchanges of differing perspectives. But even though they disagreed on numerous topics, their friendship only strengthened. Their bond had transcended expectations from the very beginning, and as they moved on to college, it was only fitting that they chose to attend the same university and even share a dorm room. Nights were spent staying up late in their cramped quarters, discussing everything from politics to their romantic interests and future aspirations. Through countless late-night conversations and shared experiences, their bond solidified – they were family now. After graduating, with Lindsey achieving her Bachelor's degree in English Literature and Betty completing her degree in Political Science, the real world laid ahead of them. Career choices took them down different paths, with Lindsey pursuing a career as an editor and writer while Betty delved into the realm of political strategist. And though their professional lives were separate, their time together never waned. Fridays were set aside for their traditional sleepovers, and Sunday brunches were strictly reserved for each other. Over the years, many people entered and exited the lives of both Lindsey and Betty. Friendships, relationships, and acquaintances shifted and changed, but the bond between them never wavered. Through life's ups and downs, this seemingly mismatched duo prevailed. As they grew older, Lindsey's contagious happiness eventually began to rub off on Betty, while Betty's realist tendencies taught Lindsey how to be more cautious and thoughtful. In the end, the love and admiration these two distinct souls had for one another triumphed over the cynicism and disbelief of those who never truly understood their friendship. And that is the story of how Lindsey, a beacon of hope and positivity, and Betty, a grumpy individual with a heart encrusted in cynicism, defied all odds and expectations, proving that friendship can flourish in even the most unlikely of circumstances."},{"prompt":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: In numerical order what US president built the brown house?

The banking group, which boasts of being the country’s largest in terms of assets, earned 5.4 billion for the quarter. [1] Notably, there were several one-time gains and losses that contributed to this figure. See our full analysis of JPMorgan We updated our price estimate for JPMorgan’s stock from 39 to 48 and attribute the near 25% upward revision to the following changes: JPMorgan’s investment banking division saw revenues under pressure over the second half of 2011 on weak global economic conditions. But the bad fortune seems to be a thing of the past – at least for now – with investment banking operations roping in 7.3 billion this quarter. While this is almost 70% more than last quarter, it is still a billion shy of the figure a year ago. The improved volatility in global markets clearly helped trading operations, which contributed a healthy 6 billion to the top-line this quarter.

Article: My father's reaction to the bank building at 43rd Street and Fifth Avenue in New York city was immediate and definite: \\"You won't catch me putting my money in there!\\" he declared, \\"Not in that glass box!\\" Of course, my father is a gentleman of the old school, a member of the generation to whom a good deal of modern architecture is upsetting, but I am convinced that his negative response was not so much to the architecture as to a violation of his concept of the nature of money. In his generation money was thought of as a real commodity that could be carried, or stolen. Consequently, to attract the custom of a sensible man, a bank had to have heavy walls, barred windows, and bronze doors, to affirm the fact, however untrue, that money would be safe inside. If a building's design made it appear impenetrable , the institution was necessarily reliable, and the meaning of the heavy wall as an architecture symbol reflected people's prevailing attitude toward money. But the attitude toward money has, of course, changed. Excepting pocket money, cash of any kind is now rarely used; money as a has largely been replaced by credit. A deficit economy, accompanied by huge expansion, has led us to think of money as product of the creative imagination. The banker no longer offers us a safe: he offers us a service in which the most valuable element is the creativity for the invention of large numbers. It is in no way surprising, in view of this change in attitude, that we are witnessing the disappearance of the heavy-walled bank. Just as the older bank emphasized its strength, this bank by its architecture boasts of imaginative powers. From this point of view it is hard to say where architecture ends and human assertion begins. Question: 38.

Many studies on happiness give negative answers. Here are some points in being happy. Basic Human Needs Must Be Met People whose basic needs for shelter, clothing and food are not met will find it very difficult to feel happy. Of course, there are exceptions, but for most of us, we can only be happy once our basic needs are met. The Joneses Cannot Be Escaped People's happiness is not determined by how much they have, but by how much people around them have. So, we tend to feel happy once our basic needs are met and we have more than the people surrounding us. This means that while keeping up with _ could be destructive if we let it go too far. It is also part of humana nature to want to feel at least on the same level, financially, as those surrounding us. You Should Escape The Rat Race We should know the importance of staying out of the rat race. So yes, you need to work hard, get the education you need to land a good job and work long enough and hard enough to get to a place where you can easily meet your basic needs. What are basic needs? For most middle or upper middle class Americans, basic needs are not very basic anymore. For most of us, once our basic needs have been met, happiness is achieved when we engage in activities we like, spend time with friends and family and stay active. Making money for the sake of making money does not make people happy. Ideally, these questions should be answered when you're still young and just starting out. Don't wait until your midlife crisis to realize that half your life has passed you by and you're still unhappy. Options: A To enjoy their life with family. B To get high education for better jobs.

I had been meaning to try Which Wich since they built it, but it just never happened. I had heard good/interesting things, and it was finally time to ring that bell. So, over lunch, I headed there with a buddy to try it out. The first thing that hit me was the selection. There is a LOT to choose from. Someone came out to help us through the process (figure out what you want, grab that bag, then mark the toppings, etc.). After that, there was no pressure - take your time and figure it out. I went with the Italian grinder - a pretty standard sandwich to set the benchmark. I was pretty conservative with the toppings as I didn't want anything to overpower the overall flavor of the italian meats. I went with onion (not often I do that), pickles and cole slaw. Cole slaw on a sandwich sounds like overdoing it, but it's OH SO good! I have to say the sandwich was pretty good. Best ever? Probably not, but it was much more flavorful than run-of-the-mill sandwich shops (I'm looking at you, Subway). The meat portion was good. Not New York deli portions, but you don't see that often around here. The 7\\" sub and a large soda was plenty for a sizable guy like me. I can't imagine going with \\"large\\" (14 inches) for a single meal. The \\"medium\\" was 10\\", but that would leave me in a food coma for the rest of the afternoon... The prices seemed to be a tad steep. A 7\\" sub was 5.50 (14\\" sub was 11 - no deal for ordering more, apparently). Throw on a soda and you're pushing 8 for a sandwich and drink. Add chips and you're getting some coins back from your 10 bill. If you're looking to fill up with large amounts of food for little money, stick with the 5 footlongs from Subway. If you're in for quality and the proper amount of food for one meal - and you don't mind spending the money - this is a great place to explore. I look forward to trying more options in the future! Next sandwich will be the corned beef with cole slaw... that sounds amazing!","completion":"The sentiment of this review can be described as mostly positive with a few reservations. The reviewer has a generally favorable impression about Which Wich, complimenting the variety of options available, the friendly and helpful service, and the quality of the food.

While the meat portions are not as generous as a New York deli, the reviewer acknowledges this is not a common occurrence in the area. They find the different sizes offered to accommodate various appetites, but they express that the price seems slightly higher than expected.

On December 4, 1920, when the Red Army entered Yerevan, the government of the First Republic of Armenia effectively surrendered. On December 5 the Armenian Revolutionary Committee , made up of mostly Armenians from Azerbaijan, also entered the city. Finally, on the following day, December 6, Felix Dzerzhinsky's dreaded secret police, the Cheka, entered Yerevan, thus effectively ending all existence of the First Republic of Armenia. The Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic was then proclaimed, under the leadership of Gevork Atarbekyan. On February 18, 1921, a national revolt against Bolsheviks started. Gen. Garegin Nzhdeh, commander Garo Sasouni and the last Prime Minister of independent Armenia Simon Vratsyan took the lead of the anti-Bolshevik rebellion and forced out the Bolsheviks from Yerevan and other places. By April the Red Army reconquered most part of Armenia. However, Atarbekyan was dismissed and Aleksandr Miasnikyan, an Armenian high-ranking Red Army commander, replaced him. Garegin Nzhdeh left the Zangezur mountains after the Sovietization of Armenia was finalized in July 1921, leaving Azeri-populated villages cleansed of their population. Persuaded by Soviet leadership, Zangezur had already been ceded by Azerbaijan to Armenia in November 1920 as a \\"symbol of friendship\\". How many months passed between the Red Army entering Yerevan and the sovietization of Armenia?","completion":"To find out how many months passed between the Red Army entering Yerevan and the Sovietization of Armenia, we need to calculate the time between December 4, 1920, and July 1921. 1. First, calculate the remaining days in December 1920: 31 (total days in December) - 4 (date the Red Army entered Yerevan) = 27 days. 2. Calculate the number of days in each month in 1921 until July: - January: 31 days - February: 28 days (1921 was not a leap year) - March: 31 days - April: 30 days - May: 31 days - June: 30 days - July: We don't know the exact date in July, so not including this month, we calculate until the end of June. 3. Add up the days: - Remaining December 1920: 27 days - January 1921: 31 days - February 1921: 28 days - March 1921: 31 days - April 1921: 30 days - May 1921: 31 days - June 1921: 30 days Total days: 27 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 = 208 days 4.

Jennings had an unused vocal, \\"Out of the Rain,\\" which was featured on the track.

But I can use this background: Noble gases are also used to fill the glass tubes of lighted signs like the one in the Figure below . Although noble gases are chemically nonreactive, their electrons can be energized by sending an electric current through them. When this happens, the electrons jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light. Different noble gases give off light of different colors.

Here is a question about this article: The political separation of the Church of England from Rome under Henry VIII brought England alongside this broad Reformation movement. Reformers in the Church of England alternated between sympathies for ancient Catholic tradition and more Reformed principles, gradually developing into a tradition considered a middle way (via media) between the Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions. The English Reformation followed a particular course. The different character of the English Reformation came primarily from the fact that it was driven initially by the political necessities of Henry VIII. King Henry decided to remove the Church of England from the authority of Rome. In 1534, the Act of Supremacy recognized Henry as the only Supreme Head on earth of the Church of England. Between 1535 and 1540, under Thomas Cromwell, the policy known as the Dissolution of the Monasteries was put into effect. Following a brief Roman Catholic restoration during the reign of Mary I, a loose consensus developed during the reign of Elizabeth I. The Elizabethan Religious Settlement largely formed Anglicanism into a distinctive church tradition. The compromise was uneasy and was capable of veering between extreme Calvinism on the one hand and Roman Catholicism on the other. It was relatively successful until the Puritan Revolution or English Civil War in the 17th century.

Article: Over the holidays, I took my three young children into a fancy chocolate shop to buy gifts. Halfway home, I noticed my 7-year-old son playing with a plastic noisemaker. Long story short: He had stolen the toy. I kept my cool -- even when he said, \\"but it was only 1.50, Mom!\\" --and explained why it was unacceptable to take things we didn't buy. A few hours later, I marched my son back to the store with two dollars from his piggy bank. He walked embarrassedly to the counter and told the clerk that he had taken something without paying for it, that he was sorry to break it and that he would pay for it now. I know exactly how terrible he was feeling. Returning to the scene of the crime is the same shame-causing punishment I received when I was five and stole something from a store. 1 remember my dad sending me back to return the item. It remains one of my clearest child- hood memories. After that day, I never stole again. My dad taught me such an important lesson 30 years ago and I saw an opportunity to do the same for my son. But now I wonder if it was the fight thing to do. \\"Returning to the store is absolutely the right thing to do,\\" Laura Markham, Ph.D., a child psychologist and author of Peaceful Parent, Happy Kids, says. \\"Many children steal -- they' re not born knowing the rules so it' s our job to teach them.\\" And stay calm when you set them. \\"If you overreact or yell, you might create a fascination with the behavior and a willful child will be more likely to fight against you,\\" she says.

This often requires a deep understanding of the subject matter as well as the ability to think outside the box to reimagine the concept in a new light. In the case of my reinterpretation of \\"American Beauty,\\" I knew I wanted to capture the essence of the original scene – a powerful and mesmerizing moment – but also make it uniquely African. With the difficulty in finding red roses, I was forced to think creatively and discovered that the plant wall in the hotel provided an ideal alternative. Its lush, vibrant colors not only provided a stunning backdrop but also symbolized the beauty and resilience of African nature. This experience has only reinforced my belief in the importance of staying true to one's artistic vision even in the face of challenges and limitations. It is through this process of adaptation and reinvention that African contemporary art can continue to thrive and make a lasting impact on the global stage. And that is precisely the driving force behind my work: to showcase the diversity and dynamism of African culture and to prove that we, as artists, can stand tall and proud alongside our international counterparts while bringing our own unique flair to the world of contemporary art."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is a news article: There is mystery at the heart of the oversupplied global oil market: missing barrels of crude. Last year, there were 800,000 barrels of oil a day unaccounted for by the International Energy Agency, the energy monitor that puts together data on crude supply and demand. Where these barrels ended up, or if they even existed, is key to an oil market that remains under pressure from the glut in crude. Some analysts say the barrels... ||||| LONDON Global oil production exceeded consumption by just over 1 billion barrels in 2014/15, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Production exceeded consumption by an average of 0.9 million barrels per day in 2014 and 2.0 million bpd in 2015 (tmsnrt.rs/1pvIEw8). Of the 1 billion barrels reportedly produced but not consumed, roughly 420 million are being stored on land in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Another 75 million barrels are thought to be stored at sea or in transit by tanker somewhere from the oil fields to the refineries. That leaves 550 million \\"missing barrels\\" unaccounted for, apparently produced but not consumed and not visible in the inventory statistics (\\"Oil Market Report\\", IEA, Feb. 2016). Missing barrels are recorded in the \\"miscellaneous to balance\\" line of the IEA's monthly Oil Market Report as the difference between production, consumption and reported stock changes. The miscellaneous item reflects errors in data from OECD countries, errors in the agency's estimates for supply and demand in non-OECD countries, and stockpile changes outside the OECD that go unrecorded. IEA data currently shows a miscellaneous to balance item of 0.5 million barrels per day in 2014 and 1.0 million barrels per day in 2015. Missing barrels have been a feature of IEA statistics since the 1970s (\\"International Energy Agency: How the Agency Prepares its World Oil Market Statistics\\", U.S. General Accounting Office, 1999). Over time, errors have occurred in both directions, and have ranged up to 1 million or even 2 million barrels per day (tmsnrt.rs/1pvIBjQ). Most of the time, the oil market ignores the miscellaneous to balance item, but it tends to become controversial when it becomes very large, either positive or negative. ERRORS AND OMISSIONS The last time the miscellaneous to balance item was this large and positive (implying an oversupplied market) was in 1997/98 when the issue triggered fierce criticism of the IEA's statistics. Critics accused the IEA of over-estimating supply, under-estimating demand, contributing to perception of a glut, depressing prices, and causing unnecessary hardship to the oil industry (\\"There Are No Missing Barrels\\", Simmons, 1999). Senator Pete Domenici, chairman of the U.S. Senate Budget Committee, asked the General Accounting Office to investigate the IEA's statistics and the question of missing barrels. In a report published in May 1999, GAO concluded \\"missing barrels are not a new condition, and the amount and direction of missing barrels have fluctuated over time\\". \\"At any point in time, the historical oil supply and demand as well as the stock data reported by IEA could be overstated or understated by an unknown magnitude.\\" It was not possible to \\"quantify how much of the missing barrels are due to statistical limitations and how much are the result of physical oil storage in unreported stocks\\". In 1997/98 episode, the IEA concluded most of the missing barrels went into non-OECD storage and uncounted OECD inventories (\\"Oil Market Report\\", IEA, June 1999). In the current episode, it is also very likely some of the 550 million barrels unaccounted for in 2014/15 have gone into unreported storage outside the OECD. China's government is known to have been filling its Strategic Petroleum Reserve. More barrels are likely to have gone into commercial storage in China and in other countries outside the OECD. But it is at least possible some of the missing barrels have been caused by the IEA over-estimating oil supplies or under-estimating demand. CLEARING THE OVERHANG The question of what has happened to the missing barrels, and whether some of them exist at all, is critical because it could affect how quickly the oil market rebalances. The IEA and most other forecasters predict the oil market will remain oversupplied throughout 2016 and the first half of 2017, ensuring stockpiles continue growing. In its \\"Medium-Term Oil Market Report\\", published last month, the IEA predicted consumption would not exceed supply on a full-year basis until 2018. Some analysts argue the market will need to eliminate the excess supply and work down some proportion of the inherited stocks before oil prices can rise sustainably. With the oil market expected to remain in surplus throughout 2016 and \\"already awash in oil\\" the IEA has said that \\"it is very hard to see how oil prices can rise significantly in the short term.\\" To the extent the miscellaneous to balance item reflects oil that has gone into unreported storage, it will take longer to clear the overhang of stocks that built up in 2014/15 and continue to build in 2016. But to the extent the missing barrels are the result of over-estimating supply and under-estimating demand, or have been absorbed into China's strategic stocks, the overhang could clear more quickly. POSSIBLE PRODUCTION FREEZE Following the 1997/98 episode, the missing barrels that accumulated in unreported non-OECD storage were drawn down in 1999, according to the IEA (\\"Oil Market Report\\", IEA, Dec 1999). In December 1999, the IEA wrote: \\"The weight of (the) evidence is that the missing barrels did exist and that they have now returned to the market.\\" \\"The return was triggered by the reversal in the shape of the forward price curve and the need for additional barrels following OPEC's effective production limitation\\" which began in March 1999. By the end of 1999, the oil market was seeing excess demand and prices were rising. But the rapid recovery depended on very strong economic growth in North America and Asia (after the East Asian financial crisis in 1997/98). It also depended on substantial production cuts by OPEC in conjunction with production restraint from non-OPEC countries. And it was both heralded and caused by a shift in the forward price curve from contango to a state of backwardation (which made oil less profitable to store). The events of 1999 illustrate the factors needed to clear an inherited glut of oil (strong demand, production restraint and a shift in the shape of the forward price curve). Current circumstances share some similarities with 1998/99 but there are also important differences which should not be overlooked. The current stock build has been caused by oversupply thanks to the shale revolution rather than a slowdown in demand as in the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis. The winter of 1997/98 also saw a strong El Nino, which suppressed oil demand as it has this winter. The current oversupply is not as bad as it was in the earlier episode, and the missing barrels problem is much smaller. The smaller (relative) surplus should make rebalancing faster this time around. In 1997/98, the market was oversupplied by 2.1 million barrels per day compared with total demand of around 74 million barrels per day, according to the IEA. In 2015, the oil market was also oversupplied by 2.0 million barrels per day but consumption was running at more than 94 million barrels per day, around 25 percent higher. At present, oil demand is growing strongly, just as it was in 1999, though there are concerns about the health of the global economy. The major oil exporting countries have not so far agreed to cut production, unlike 1998/99, but there has been discussion about a possible production freeze. Futures prices remain resolutely in contango, which is both a symptom of excess stockpiles and creates a financial incentive to continue holding them. There is no sign of the market moving into backwardation yet, which would indicate the supply-demand balance was shifting and would also create a financial incentive to release oil from storage. Several key OPEC and non-OPEC producers have announced a provisional production freeze which could speed up the rebalancing, assuming it is implemented. But it might not be enough to eliminate the glut quickly; outright production cuts may be needed to accelerate the process, depending on what happens to demand and production from other countries.

Photograph by Simon Dawson—Bloomberg Finance via Getty Images No One Knows Where These 800,000 Barrels of Oil Have Gone Just two months ago, the International Energy Agency warned that the global oil market could \\"drown in oversupply.\\" But according to a Wall Street Journal report , a large portion of the problematic oversupply that is worrying traders and potentially holding down oil prices is also nowhere to be found. The IEA was unable to account for 800,000 barrels of crude per day last year—the highest level of missing crude in 17 years. The missing crude could simply be a figment of statistics, showing up in the agency's data due to flawed accounting. But stockpiles could also be building up in non-OECD countries, like China, for which the IEA does not keep such rigorous data. If the oversupply has been exaggerated and those barrels don't exist, market analysts say that the oil market could tighten substantially. Crude prices have wallowed at their lowest point in more than a decade over the course of a nearly-two-year crash marked by concern about oversupply. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Imagine that there's a big mystery in the world of oil because a lot of barrels of oil have gone missing.

The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's...

But I can use this background: The brains of all mammals have a unique layer of nerve cells covering the cerebrum. This layer is called the neocortex (the pink region of the brains in Figure above ). The neocortex plays an important role in many complex brain functions. In some mammals, such as rats, the neocortex is relatively smooth. In other mammals, especially humans, the neocortex has many folds. The folds increase the surface area of the neocortex. The larger this area is, the greater the mental abilities of an animal.

(Published Friday, Sept. 4, 2015) A 3-month old Bengal-Siberian tiger cub was found roaming through the streets of Hemet, California on Thursday and sent to a shelter for aid. The abandoned animal was transferred about 70 miles to an animal shelter in Phelan, which is licensed to handle and treat exotic animals and currently houses eight adult tigers. \\"I have never seen a cub come through our doors in 20 years,\\" said Joel Almquist, a wildlife expert. \\"He's in good condition, in good spirits,\\" he said. The 25-pound cub was found declawed and will need surgery to remove a hernia from his abdomen. But he’ll get a lot of care - with regular bottle feedings, a meat-rich diet and plenty of room to run around. The cub will stay at the shelter until the California Department of Fish and Wildlife decide where he’ll end up. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A 3-month old Bengal-Siberian tiger cub is recovering after being found wandering the streets of Hemet, California.

The Gulls, who had to play the whole of the second half with 10 men after Myles Anderson was sent off, went closest when Jamie Reid hit the post. Chester are now nine points clear of trouble, with Torquay in 21st place. The closest either side came before the break were a pair of curled free kicks over the bar from Chester's Evan Horwood and Torquay front man Reid. The visitors went close to earning a 43rd-minute penalty when James Alabi was brought down on the edge of the box. But referee Sam Allison opted not to give the spot-kick and instead sent off Anderson. Chester had to survive a huge second-half scramble when Ruairi Keating was denied in a triple let-off that ended with keeper Alex Lynch touching Reid's shot onto the post Hughes, the best player on the park and already on the wish list of Football League clubs, then fired home before Chester had to survive a real scare when defender Ryan Astles somehow scooped over his own bar in the 86th minute.

I am reaching out to discuss some concerns I have recently encountered regarding my credit situation. I believe it is essential to address these issues so that I can maintain a good credit standing, which plays a critical role in managing my financial affairs. Over the past few months, I have experienced several unforeseen expenses that have led to an increased utilization of my credit card. This, coupled with the ongoing financial instability due to the pandemic, has made it difficult for me to manage my finances as meticulously as I have done in the past. Consequently, I have been unable to meet some of my credit obligations in a timely manner. I am, therefore, worried about the potential impact on my credit score and my ability to access credit services in the future. In an effort to improve my credit situation, I have taken several proactive steps, which include: 1. Creating a strict monthly budget: This will help me prioritize my expenses, curbing unnecessary spending and ensuring that I can allocate funds towards my financial obligations. 2. Consolidating my debts: By rolling all my credit card debts into one debt with a lower interest rate, I am working to lower my monthly payments and take control of my financial situation. 3. Seeking professional help: I have been in touch with a credit counselor who is providing me valuable guidance on how to navigate these credit issues and improve my credit score. I understand that communication and transparency are crucial in situations like these, and I wanted to keep you informed of the steps I am taking to rectify this situation.

But this year's surprise on the birthday of the great British playwright William Shakespeare is surely one of the most dramatic. On April 22, one day before his 441st birthday anniversary, experts discovered that one of the most recognizable portraits of William Shakespeare is a fake. This means that we no longer have a good idea of what Shakespeare looked like. \\"It's very possible that many pictures of Shakespeare might be unreliable because many of them are copies of this one,\\" said an expert from Britain's National Portrait Gallery. The discovery comes after four months of testing using X-rays, ultraviolet light, microphotography and paint samples. The experts from the gallery say the image --commonly known as the \\"Flower portrait\\"-- was actually painted in the 1800s, about two centuries after Shakespeare's death. The art experts who work at the gallery say they also used modern chemistry technology to check the paint on the picture. These checks found traces of paint dating from about 1814. Shakespeare died in 1616, and the date that appears on the portrait is 1609. \\"We now think the portrait dates back to around 1818 to 1840. This was when there was a renewed interest in Shakespeare's plays,\\" Tarnya Cooper, the gallery's curator , told the Associated President. The fake picture has often been used as a cover for collections of his plays. It is called the Flower portrait because one of its owners, Desmond Flower, gave it to the Royal Shakespeare Company. \\"There have always been questions about the painting,\\" said David Howells, curator for the Royal Shakespeare Company. \\"Now we know the truth, we can put the image in its proper place in the history of Shakespearean portraiture.\\" Two other images of Shakespeare, are also being studied as part of the investigation and the results will come out later this month. _ What makes the birthday of Shakespeare dramatic this year? A) It was found that he painted a portrait in 1814 instead of in 1609. B) The Flower portrait has been found to be a fake. C) Three portraits of Shakespeare are being tested to identify a real one.

Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin (/'pUSkIn/; Russian: Aleksandr Sergeevich Pushkin, tr. Aleksandr Sergeyevich Pushkin; IPA: [aljI'ksandr sjI'rgjejIvjItc 'puskjIn]; 6 June [O.S. 26 May] 1799 - 10 February [O.S. 29 January] 1837) was a Russian author of the Romantic era who is considered by many to be the greatest Russian poet and the founder of modern Russian literature. Pushkin was born into Russian nobility in Moscow. His matrilineal great grandfather was Abram Gannibal, who was brought over as a slave from what is now Cameroon. Pushkin published his first poem at the age of fifteen, and was widely recognized by the literary establishment by the time of his graduation from the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum. While under the strict surveillance of the Tsar's political police and unable to publish, Pushkin wrote his most famous play, the drama Boris Godunov. His novel in verse, Eugene Onegin, was serialized between 1825 and 1832. Notoriously touchy about his honour, Pushkin fought as many as twenty-nine duels, and was fatally wounded in such an encounter with Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d'Anthes. Pushkin had accused D'Anthes, a French officer serving with the Chevalier Guard Regiment of attempting to seduce the poet's wife, Natalya Pushkina. After reading the above, is \\"26\\" the correct answer to the question \\"How old was Pushkin when Eugene Onegin began serialization?\\"? Available choices: [-] no; [-] yes;","completion":"To determine the correct answer, we need to calculate Pushkin's age when Eugene Onegin began serialization in 1825. Step 1: Determine the year of birth - Pushkin was born on 6 June 1799. Step 2: Calculate the difference between the year of birth and the year the serialization began - The difference between 1799 and 1825 is 26 years. Step 3: Check whether that is the correct age - Since the difference is 26 years, that means Pushkin was 26 years old when Eugene Onegin began serialization.

Make an extra effort in all your classes and schedule in time to study after school each day. If you are an adult with a job, try to focus on keeping your performance up to par. If you have trouble studying at home, visit a coffee shop or library. If your grades are falling, considering seeking out a tutor to help you. If your parent's condition interferes with your job performance, ask for some time off to pull yourself together. Staying busy can help you better cope with your parent’s drinking. The more productive things on your schedule, the less time you’ll have to sit around worrying. Plus, getting involved in sports, clubs, and organizations at your school or in your local community can keep you away from home a lot. Taking part in extracurriculars helps you spend time with positive people and may even protect you from using alcohol or drugs yourself. If you have a few buddies you trust, dedicate more time to hanging out with them. Talk to them about what’s happening at home. You might feel ashamed to share all the details of your parent’s drinking, but it’s important that you have social support. Tell your closest pals a little of what’s happening and then gauge their reactions to decide how much more you might want to share.

The good Santas all realize one thing: In the mind of a child, Santa Claus is perfect. That's difficult. And so they come from around the world to attend the Charles W. Howard School in Midland, Mich. The school offers a three-day, 40-hour course for Santas hoping to be excellent. A former Macy's Santa named Charles Howard founded the Michigan school in 1937. \\"Many people will think if you have a suit and you're a Santa,\\" said Tom Valent, the school's current dean. \\"It's more than that.\\" The school teaches everything from breathing techniques for carol singing to the beard maintenance. There are lessons in child psychology, sign language and even media training for talk-show appearances and call-in shows. Santas also need to make sure they know all the names of the reindeer . What's harder to deal with, however, is children who ask for Christmas gifts like bringing daddy home or making mommy happy again. After spending time in the classroom, Weir went to the mall to test his training. However, at one point, his hat fell off, and he was unsure how to react. \\"You're the real Santa,\\" Valent said. \\"Pick that hat up, slip it back on, keep smiling and do your job.

Primarily because they are proactive in your health care. Almost all of the doctors have all been nice and some are exceptional. We rarely have to wait in line for anything. The main criticism I would have is that they tend to rush through the appointments and I would prefer a more casual discussion with my doctors. Taking the time to listen and discuss issues and concerns seems to me to be part of health care. They provide a wide range of alternative health services which we love to take advantage of. If you are considering this health service you can rest assured that you will get excellent health care here. You just need to be prepared for their system of time management. The short lines are one of the positives of this method. When you make your appointment you have to be specific about what you are seeing the doctor for and know about how much time it will take. Once the appointment is set, that will be the time you will have. Their customer service has always been helpful and very friendly on the phone. This alone is a super big plus to us. Their billing is relatively easy to understand. With the new Health Care Reform Bill they sent out a letter informing us that there will be little to no impact on our service because GHC was already doing the things that the Bill requires!

As the second sentence is a simplified version of the information provided in the first sentence, the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true. In Sentence 1, we learn that there is a Sacred Pool located in the grounds of the Pamukkale Motel. This pool has therapeutic and restorative spring waters that will float visitors among the surrounding broken columns and Corinthian capitals. The first sentence provides a detailed description of the pool's location and its atmosphere. In Sentence 2, we are informed about the existence of a Sacred Pool in which guests can bathe at the Pamukkale Motel. Although it is less detailed and does not provide specific information about the pool's surrounding area or its nature, it still shares the fact that a Sacred Pool exists at the motel and can be used for bathing.

Baying crowds: Becoming Britain's first male Wimbledon winner since 1936 will reduce the pressure on Murray 'The grass here is great, okay you cant get like Wimbledon, but it is a perfect event.' Ivanisevic went on to share his thoughts on why Murray's recent performance might not necessarily be indicative of his chances at Wimbledon. He explained that the unique nature of grass courts, and specifically the ones at Wimbledon, can be the deciding factor that works in favor of some players, as opposed to the clay courts of the French Open. Furthermore, Ivanisevic believes that the absence of a recent tournament victory for Murray could be seen as an advantage, allowing him to enter Wimbledon without the burden of recent expectations. In this context, it is essential to note that Murray has demonstrated impressive progress throughout his career. With multiple Grand Slam titles and the historic achievement of being the first British male player to win Wimbledon in over 70 years, he has already proven himself as a fierce competitor in the world of tennis. Whether or not Murray will be able to replicate his past success at Wimbledon remains to be seen. However, there is no doubt that the All England Club holds a special place in his heart and that he will be more determined than ever to showcase his skills on the grass courts that brought him one of his most significant career achievements. The outcome of this year's tournament will ultimately depend on various factors - preparation, mindset, determination, and perhaps even a bit of luck. As the countdown to Wimbledon begins, tennis fans from around the world eagerly anticipate the event, knowing full well that anything can happen at this prestigious venue, where old champions and young hopefuls alike all dream of hoisting the coveted trophy. Murray's performance, whether triumphant or not, will indeed be one to watch, as he aims to make history once again on the hallowed grounds of the All England Club."},{"prompt":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: I call my story the story of a bad boy, partly to distinguish myself from those faultless young gentlemen, and partly because I really was not an angle.

Q:Information: - Raja Ram Mohan Roy , also known as Rammohan Roy or Rammohun Roy , ( 22 May 1772 -- 27 September , 1833 ) was the founder of the Brahmo Sabha movement in 1828 , which engendered the Brahmo Samaj , an influential Bengali socio - religious reform movement . His influence was apparent in the fields of politics , public administration and education as well as religion . He is best known for his efforts to establish the abolishment of the practice of sati , the Hindu funeral practice in which the widow was compelled to sacrifice herself in her husband 's funeral pyre in some parts of Bengal . It was he who first introduced the word \`\` Hinduism '' into the English language in 1816 . For his diverse contributions to society , Raja Ram Mohan Roy is regarded as one of the most important figures in the Bengali renaissance . His efforts to protect Hinduism and Indian rights by participating in British government earned him the title \`\` The Father of the Indian Renaissance '' . The British government has named a street in memory of Ram Mohan Roy as \`\` Raja Rammohan Way '' . - South Asia or Southern Asia is a term used to represent the southern region of the Asian continent, which comprises the sub-Himalayan SAARC countries and, for some authorities, adjoining countries to the west and east. Topographically, it is dominated by the Indian Plate, which rises above sea level as Nepal and northern parts of India situated south of the Himalayas and the Hindu Kush. South Asia is bounded on the south by the Indian Ocean and on land (clockwise, from west) by West Asia, Central Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia. - Adi Dharm refers to the religion of Adi Brahmo Samaj the first development of Brahmoism and includes those Sadharan Brahmo Samajists who were reintegrated into Brahmoism after the 2nd schism of 1878 at the instance of Hemendranath Tagore. This was the first organised casteless movement in British India and reverberated from its heart of Bengal to Assam, Bombay State (modern Sindh, Maharashtra and Gujarat), Punjab and Madras, Hyderabad, and Bangalore. - Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. - The Bengali renaissance or simply Bengal renaissance was a cultural, social, intellectual and artistic movement in Bengal region of the Indian Subcontinent during the period of British rule, from the nineteenth century to the early twentieth century dominated by educated Brahmos and Bengali Hindus. The Bengal renaissance can be said to have started with Raja Ram Mohan Roy (17721833) and ended with Rabindranath Tagore (18611941), although there have been many stalwarts thereafter embodying particular aspects of the unique intellectual and creative output. Nineteenth-century Bengal was a unique blend of religious and social reformers, scholars, literary giants, journalists, patriotic orators and scientists, all merging to form the image of a renaissance, and marked the transition from the 'medieval' to the 'modern'. - The Renaissance was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history. It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe, marking the beginning of the Early Modern Age. - Brahmoism is a religious movement from the late 19th century Bengal originating the Bengali Renaissance, the nascent Indian independence movement and the wider Hindu reform movements of the period. Adherents, known as \\"Brahmos\\" (singular Brahmo), are mainly of Indian or Bangladeshi origin or nationality. The Brahmo Samaj, literally the \\"Divine Society\\", was founded as a movement by Ram Mohan Roy. Placing great importance on the use of reason, he aimed to reform Hindu religious and social practices, being influenced by the monotheistic religions and modern science. - Public administration is the implementation of government policy and also an academic discipline that studies this implementation and prepares civil servants for working in the public service. As a \\"field of inquiry with a diverse scope\\" its \\"fundamental goal... is to advance management and policies so that government can function.\\" Some of the various definitions which have been offered for the term are: \\"the management of public programs\\"; the \\"translation of politics into the reality that citizens see every day\\"; and \\"the study of government decision making, the analysis of the policies themselves, the various inputs that have produced them, and the inputs necessary to produce alternative policies.\\" - Hinduism is a religion, or a way of life, found most notably in India and Nepal. Hinduism has been called the oldest religion in the world, and some practitioners and scholars refer to it as \\"\\", \\"the eternal law,\\" or the \\"eternal way,\\" beyond human origins. Scholars regard Hinduism as a fusion or synthesis of various Indian cultures and traditions, with diverse roots and no founder. This \\"Hindu synthesis\\" started to develop between 500 BCE and 300 CE following the Vedic period (1500 BCE to 500 BCE). - Hemendranath Tagore (18441884), Debendranath Tagore's third son, is notable for being the first ever Brahmo as he was the first child born in 1844 to any of the 21 Brahmos who swore the First Brahmo Covenant on 21 December 1843 at Calcutta (now Kolkata). An intensely private person, he was also well known as the strict disciplinarian entrusted with the responsibility of looking after the education of his younger brothers in addition to being administrator for the large family estates of Debendranath's branch of Tagore family. While alive, he was also the constant spiritual companion to his father Debendranath Tagore who founded Brahmoism and, despite his extreme youth, acted as the channel between his father and the seniors of the \\"Tattwabodhini Sabha\\". At the time of the First Brahmo Schism of 1865 he was responsible for expelling the non-Brahmin workers from the Calcutta Brahmo Samaj. The Adi Dharm religion is founded exclusively on his philosophy and is today the largest development from Brahmoism with over 8 million adherents in India. - Raja (also spelled Rajah, from Sanskrit '), is a title for a Monarch or princely ruler in South and Southeast Asia. The female form Rani (sometimes spelled ranee) applies equally to the wife of a Raja (or of an equivalent style such as Rana), usually as queen consort and occasionally as regent. - Lahore is the capital city of the Pakistani province of Punjab. It is the second largest and most populous city in Pakistan,and the 32nd most populous urban city in the world. The city is located in the north east part of Punjab province, near the border with India. Lahore is ranked as a world city, and is one of Pakistan's wealthiest cities with an estimated GDP of 58.14 billion (PPP) as of 2014. - Hindu refers to any person who regards themselves as culturally, ethnically, or religiously adhering to aspects of Hinduism. It has historically been used as a geographical, cultural, rather than a religious identifier for people indigenous to South Asia. - Bengal (bgl; Bengali: , and ) is a region in Asia which is located in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent at the apex of the Bay of Bengal. Geographically, it is made up by the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta system, the largest such formation in the world; along with mountains in its north (bordering the Himalayan states) and east (bordering Northeast India and Burma). - Rabindranath Tagore FRAS, also written Ravndrantha Thkura (7 May 1861 7 August 1941), sobriquet Gurudev, was a Bengali polymath who reshaped Bengali literature and music, as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of \\"Gitanjali\\" and its \\"profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse\\", he became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913. Sometimes referred to as \\"the Bard of Bengal\\", Tagore's poetry was viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his \\"elegant prose and magical poetry\\" remain largely unknown outside Bengal. - Rani (Nepali / Sanskrit / Hindi: ), sometimes spelled Ranee, is a Hindu/Sanskrit feminine given name, which means \\"duchess,\\" \\"queen\\", or \\"sovereign\\". The term is the female form of the term for princely rulers in Southeast Asia and applies equally to the wife of a Raja or Rana. - Politics (from Greek: Politiká: P\\"olitika\\", definition \\"affairs of the cities\\") is the process of making decisions applying to all members of each group. More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities. - Brahmo Samaj (Bengali \\"Bramho Shômaj\\") is the societal component of Brahmoism, a monotheistic reformist and renaissance movement of Hindu religion. It is practised today mainly as the Adi Dharm after its eclipse in Bengal consequent to the exit of the Tattwabodini Sabha from its ranks in 1859. After the publication of Hemendranath Tagore's Brahmo \\"Anusthan\\" (code of practice) in 1860 which formally divorced Brahmoism from Hinduism, the first Brahmo Samaj was founded in 1861 at Lahore by Pandit Nobin Chandra Roy. - Belief is the state of mind in which a person thinks something to be the case, with or without there being empirical evidence to prove that something is the case with factual certainty. Another way of defining belief sees it as a mental representation of an attitude positively oriented towards the likelihood of something being true. In the context of Ancient Greek thought, two related concepts were identified with regards to the concept of belief: \\"pistis\\" and \\"doxa\\". Simplified, we may say that \\"pistis\\" refers to \\"trust\\" and \\"confidence\\", while \\"doxa\\" refers to \\"opinion\\" and \\"acceptance\\". The English word \\"orthodoxy\\" derives from \\"doxa\\". Jonathan Leicester suggests that belief has the purpose of guiding action rather than indicating truth.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question: Before we are able to run what do we need to know how to do? Here are possible answers to this question: - act quickly - learn to walk - stretches - buy shoes - go quickly I believe the correct choice is \\"learn to walk\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"The correct choice is indeed \\"learn to walk\\". Before anyone can run, they must first learn how to walk. Walking is a fundamental skill that we develop early in our lives, and it's the basis for more advanced movements like running. Here's why this answer is the most appropriate among the options provided: 1. Act quickly: This option is related to reaction time and decision-making, but it does not directly relate to the physical ability needed to run. 2. Learn to walk: As mentioned earlier, walking is the foundation for more advanced movements such as running. Once a person has learned to walk, they can gradually progress to running by increasing their pace, taking longer strides, and improving their coordination and balance. 3. Stretches: While stretching is essential for flexibility and can help prevent injuries during physical activities like running, it's not a prerequisite for learning to run. Stretching can be incorporated into a running routine only after one has learned how to walk and run. 4. Buy shoes: Having appropriate footwear is important for comfort and injury prevention while running, but it's not a core skill or requirement to learn before running. You can learn to walk and run barefoot or with minimal footwear if necessary. 5. Go quickly: This option is a vague description of running, as it implies moving at a fast pace. However, it does not address the fundamental requirement of learning to walk before running. In summary, learning to walk is the most appropriate answer because it's the foundational skill that allows us to progress from basic walking movements to the more advanced skills required for running. Knowing how to walk provides the necessary balance, coordination, and muscle development needed to run efficiently and safely."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Solve 1384*f = 1550*f - 7304 for f.","completion":"Alright, let's break this down. We have an equation that looks like this: 1384 * f = 1550 * f - 7304 Now, we want to find out what \\"f\\" is. To do that, we need to get \\"f\\" all by itself on one side of the equation. First, let's move the 1384 * f from the left side to the right side by subtracting the same thing from both sides. We can do that like this: 1550 * f - 1384 * f = 7304 Now, subtract 1384 * f from 1550 * f. In this step, we're just finding the difference between both numbers: 166 * f = 7304 We are almost there! Now we need to get \\"f\\" all by itself. Since 166 is being multiplied by \\"f\\", we can divide both sides of the equation by 166. This will cancel out the 166 on the left side and leave us only with \\"f\\": f = 7304 ÷ 166 Now, we need to divide 7304 by 166: f = 44 So, the final answer is f = 44. And there you go!

Epigenetics is the study of mitotically and/or meiotically heritable changes in gene function that cannot be explained by changes in the underlying DNA sequence but cause the organism's genes to behave (or \\"express themselves\\") differently. One example of epigenetic change is the marking of the genes by DNA methylation which determines whether they will be expressed or not. Gene expression can also be controlled by repressor proteins that attach to silencer regions of the DNA and prevent that region of the DNA code from being expressed. Epigenetic marks may be added or removed from the DNA during programmed stages of development of the plant, and are responsible, for example, for the differences between anthers, petals and normal leaves, despite the fact that they all have the same underlying genetic code. Epigenetic changes may be temporary or may remain through successive cell divisions for the remainder of the cell's life.

Pangaea straddled the equator and extended toward the poles, with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean (Panthalassa, the universal sea), and the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, a large ocean that was between Asia and Gondwana. The Cimmeria continent rifted away from Gondwana and drifted north to Laurasia, causing the Paleo-Tethys to shrink.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Not long ago, people could only buy organic food in small shops. Today it is common in most major supermarkets. The reason for the increase is that more and more people are demanding food grown without chemicals. Since the 1990s, organic farm production has gone up 20 percent every year. This pattern is expected to continue around the globe. Australia leads the world in land used for organic agriculture. It has four times as much land devoted to organic farming as all of Asia. However, most of the land is not very fertile, and it only produces a modest amount of food. Argentina is a distant second, followed by Brazil, the United States and China. In Africa, only a very small amount of land is registered for organic farming. That does not mean Africa relies on chemicals. In fact, many farmers do not use chemicals because they cannot afford them. Yet there are no programs for these farmers to prove they do not use chemicals. Without these programs their food can never be approved organic. India has had the most dramatic recent increase in organic farming. Like many other countries, India sees continual growth in organic food sales around the world. This, of course, leads to growth in profits. Sales of organic food were more than doubled from 2000 to 2005. Like India, many countries are trying to increase commercial organic farming to get a share of the sales. This has led to criticism. Some people believe that organic farming should not just be about making money. They think the goal is to help the environment. Others say organic farming will not continue if it is not profitable. They say that people should be able to make money while providing food that is healthy to mankind. A:","completion":"Which country currently leads the world in land used for organic agriculture?

Choices: - lie - deceive - hide from - manipulate - charming The rationale to choose \\"deceive\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"The honest real estate agent refused to deceive a client. The rationale for choosing \\"deceive\\" as the answer is multifold and can be discussed in detail as follows: 1. Ethical Considerations: Firstly, an honest real estate agent adheres to a strict ethical code and respects the trust their clients place in them. They understand the magnitude of property investment and how it can deeply impact the financial well-being and quality of life of their clients. Deception contradicts the agent's ethical convictions and would compromise the integrity of their professional standing. 2. Building lasting relationships: Establishing trust and credibility are key aspects of nurturing long-term relationships in the real estate field. For an honest agent, honesty and transparency are of utmost importance, and they wouldn't deceive a client to jeopardize any potential for maintaining healthy, ongoing connections with them. Satisfied clients might even refer the agent to their friends and family, contributing to the agent's continued success. 3. Legal implications: Deceptive practices in real estate, such as withholding or misrepresenting critical information about a property, could result in severe legal consequences for the agent. These consequences could include lawsuits, revocation of their license, and damage to their reputation. An honest real estate agent is well aware of these possible outcomes and, therefore, would refuse to deceive a client to avoid experiencing such repercussions. 4. Focusing on the long-term: Honest real estate agents have a long-term vision for their business, aiming to build an excellent reputation for years to come. Engaging in deceptive practices could tarnish their professional brand and jeopardize their ability to thrive in the competitive real estate industry. Thus, they refuse to deceive clients to maintain a successful, credible business characterized by integrity and fair practices. 5. Client's best interest: A diligent and honest real estate agent's primary concern is finding the right property that matches the client's needs and preferences. Deceiving a client contradicts this objective, as it could lead the client to make uniformed decisions that may not be in their best interest. The agent is driven by the genuine desire to assist clients in achieving their property goals, not by the prospect of making a quick sale or profit by means of deception. In conclusion, the honest real estate agent refuses to deceive a client due to various reasons, including ethical considerations, fostering trustful client relationships, legal implications, long-term vision, and prioritizing their clients' best interests. Deception would not only breach the agent's ethical standards but also threaten the sustainability and success of their business in the long run."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A writer from Capital XTRA described it as having a \\"mellow beat\\", while Rolling Stone's Daniel Sannwald wrote it has a \\"party-vibe production\\".During the track, Stefani's vocal range spans from the low note of D3 to the high note of A4. Williams equated Stefani's tone to that of a \\"child whisperer\\" due to her ability to make music that appeals to children. The lyrics are about Paddington Bear and his travels; Rolling Stone called it \\"a pop-reggae allegory about a bear with an identity crisis\\". The song opens with Stefani singing the first verse and Williams joining in the chorus, the lyrics including \\"When you're trying to get home / When you don't wanna be alone / Look at yourself in the mirror / That's your way home\\".

Q:Given the following context: In 1951, with secret means of communications established, Wolters sent his first letter to Speer in five years. He suggested that Speer move ahead with his memoirs. In January 1953, Speer began work on his draft memoirs, and over the next year lengthy missives, sometimes written on tobacco wrappings or candy wrappers but most often on toilet paper, made their way to Wolters' office in Coesfeld. Marion Riesser, who had continued as Wolters' secretary as he began private architectural practice, transcribed these notes into as many as forty closely typed pages per missive, and the draft totalled 1,100 pages. Wolters objected that Speer called Hitler a criminal in the draft, and Speer presciently observed that he would likely lose a good many friends were the memoirs ever to be published. Wolters had come to believe that reports of Nazi genocide were exaggerated by a factor of at least ten, that Hitler had not been given credit for the things he did right and that Germany had been harshly treated by the Allies.In the mid-1950s, Wolters quarrelled with Kempf who effectively dropped out of the network for a number of years, adding to the burden on Wolters and Riesser. While Speer's pleas for his former associate and his former secretary to work together eventually brought about a healing of the breach, this was to some degree superficial as Kempf was aware that Wolters, even then, disagreed with Speer's opinions. Wolters questioned Speer's readiness to accept responsibility for the Nazi regime's excesses and did not believe Speer had anything to apologise for, though the strength of his feelings on this point was kept from Speer—but not from Kempf and Riesser.Wolters was tireless in his efforts on behalf of Speer and his family to such an extent that his son, Fritz, later expressed feelings of neglect.

What is the best way to: To bake a pie, you can","completion":"begin by following these steps: 1. Choose the pie recipe: Select a recipe that suits your preferences, such as a traditional apple pie, a sweet cherry pie, or a savory meat pie. Consider factors like the season, the occasion, and the dietary needs and preferences of your guests. 2. Gather ingredients: Obtain all the necessary ingredients required by your chosen recipe. This would typically include fresh fruit or vegetables, sugar, butter, eggs, spices, and some form of pie crust. In most cases, the crust can be homemade or store-bought. 3. Prepare the pie crust: If making a homemade pie crust from scratch, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and butter using a food processor, a pastry cutter, or even your hands. Add cold water and mix while being cautious not to overwork the dough. When the dough has come together, form it into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least an hour. 4. Preheat the oven: Check your recipe for the recommended baking temperature, which usually ranges between 350°F (180°C) and 425°F (220°C). Preheat your oven to the required temperature. 5. Prepare the filling: While the crust chills, wash, peel, and cut the fruit or vegetables needed for your pie. In a separate bowl, combine the sugar, spices, and any thickeners (if applicable), such as cornstarch or tapioca. Mix the dry ingredients with the fruit, ensuring even coating. 6. Roll out the pie crust: Remove the crust dough from the refrigerator and let it sit for a few minutes to soften slightly. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a circle roughly 1/8 inch (3 millimeters) thick and large enough to cover the pie dish. Ensure that it's neither too thick nor too thin, as this can affect the final texture of the pie. 7. Fit the crust in the pie dish: Gently place the rolled-out dough into the pie dish, carefully pressing it against the bottom and sides. Trim the excess dough, leaving about a 1/2-inch (1 centimeter) overhang around the edges. If making a double-crust pie, save the trimmed dough to create the top crust. 8. Fill the pie: Transfer the filling mixture into the dough-lined pie dish, spreading it out evenly. Be sure not to overfill the pie, as this can lead to spillage during baking. 9. Add the top crust (if necessary): If making a double-crust pie, roll out the remaining dough into a circle large enough to cover the pie. Carefully place it on top of the filling, trim the excess dough, and crimp or fold the edges of the two layers of dough together to seal. Cut slits into the top crust to allow steam to escape. 10. Apply an egg wash (optional): If desired, create an egg wash by whisking one egg with a tablespoon of water. Brush the wash over the top crust for a shiny, golden finish. 11. Bake the pie: Place the pie dish on a baking sheet to catch any spills, and bake as directed by your chosen recipe. Most pies require 45 minutes to an hour of baking time. If the crust edges begin to brown too quickly, wrap them in strips of aluminum foil to prevent burning. 12. Cool the pie: Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for a couple of hours. This allows the filling to set, making the pie easier to slice. 13. Serve: Once cooled, slice the pie and serve it with your choice of toppings, such as whipped cream or ice cream. Enjoy your delicious, homemade pie! Remember, practice makes perfect when it comes to baking pies, and experimenting with different flavors and recipes can help you perfect your technique and find your favorite pie combinations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ollie moved a tomato plant to an area that receives more sunlight. The tomato plant will now produce more or less food? Answer:","completion":"Moving the tomato plant to an area that receives more sunlight will likely result in the tomato plant producing more food. This is because photosynthesis is the process by which plants, including tomato plants, convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into oxygen and nutrients (such as glucose) that act as food for the plant to grow and thrive. The rate of photosynthesis is directly related to the amount of sunlight available to the plant. When Ollie moved the tomato plant to a location with increased sunlight exposure, the plant has a better opportunity to undergo a higher rate of photosynthesis. In this scenario, with increased sunlight, the plant can absorb more energy from the sunlight, allowing it to generate more ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), which are essential for the plants' growth and maintenance. This increased energy production will enable the plant to produce more nutrients and carbohydrates required for its growth, resulting in the plant producing more food. As a result, the tomato plant may grow larger, healthier, and produce more fruit in this new location. Additionally, with more sunlight, the tomato plant will be better equipped to fight off various diseases and pests, further enhancing its ability to produce food. When a plant receives insufficient sunlight, it often grows weaker and is more susceptible to damage from diseases, pests, and environmental stressors. In the case of phytoplankton, these microscopic marine algae also depend on sunlight for photosynthesis. When the availability of sunlight increases, these organisms are able to produce more organic compounds, which serve as the base of the marine food chain. As a result, the increased food supply benefits the entire marine ecosystem. In conclusion, by moving the tomato plant to an area with greater sunlight exposure, Ollie has provided the plant with optimal conditions for photosynthesis, which will likely lead to increased production of food and better overall health for the plant. This will ultimately result in improved growth, a stronger plant, increased fruit production, and a more robust tomato plant overall."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What is the title of this article: White light can be formed by mixing differently colored lights; the most common method is to use red, green, and blue (RGB). Hence the method is called multi-color white LEDs (sometimes referred to as RGB LEDs). Because these need electronic circuits to control the blending and diffusion of different colors, and because the individual color LEDs typically have slightly different emission patterns (leading to variation of the color depending on direction) even if they are made as a single unit, these are seldom used to produce white lighting. Nonetheless, this method has many applications because of the flexibility of mixing different colors, and in principle, this mechanism also has higher quantum efficiency in producing white light.[citation needed] Title:","completion":"\\"RGB LEDs: The Multi-Color Method for Creating White Light and its Diverse Applications\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Since there are two terms containing the variable d (86*d and -667*d), combine them to simplify the equation. 86*d - 667*d = -581*d Now the equation looks like this: -581*d - 14146 = 62*d Step 2: Add 581*d to both sides of the equation to isolate the variable on one side. Adding 581*d to both sides will eliminate the -581*d term on the left side: -581*d + 581*d - 14146 = 62*d + 581*d This simplifies to: -14146 = 643*d Step 3: Solve for the variable d by dividing both sides of the equation by 643. To isolate d, divide both sides by 643: (-14146) / 643 = 643*d / 643 This simplifies to: d = -22 So, the solution for the equation 86*d - 667*d - 14146 = 62*d is d = -22."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Information: - A nightclub (also known as a discothèque, disco, dance club or club) is an entertainment venue and bar which serves alcoholic beverages that usually operates late into the night. A nightclub is generally distinguished from regular bars, pubs or taverns by the inclusion of a stage for live music, one or more dance floor areas and a DJ booth, where a DJ plays recorded music and where coloured lights illuminate the dance area. Another distinction is that whereas many pubs and sports bars aim at a mass market, nightclubs typically aim at a niche market of music and dancing enthusiasts and clubgoers. The upmarket nature of nightclubs can be seen in the inclusion of VIP areas in some nightclubs, for celebrities and their guests. Nightclubs are much more likely than pubs or sports bars to use bouncers to screen prospective clubgoers for entry. Some nightclub bouncers do not admit people with ripped jeans or other informal clothing as part of a dress code. The busiest nights for a nightclub are Friday and Saturday night. Most clubs or club nights cater to certain music genres. - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance.

What is the answer for the question: What was the last name of the person who painted a Western Australian politician? from the following article ? Further recognition came with the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung at the same time included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work ... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity ... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme ... The details of the picture disclose untiring care. By the time Summer Breezes was on display, Fuller had returned to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to Perth in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her \\"one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time\\". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who had known him. It was acquired by the gallery whose board he chaired. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist Kathleen O'Connor. Fuller's paintings from this period included A Golden Hour, described by the National Gallery of Australia as \\"a masterpiece ... giving us a gentle insight into the people, places and times that make up our history\\".

We can also term it as \\"self-raising\\". In slow parenting children are allowed to do what they think proper and parents just keep a watch over the child. Curiosity of the child leads to exploring and discovering things. Parents provide little help only when it's too necessary, otherwise keep themselves away from the child and just have a look on him/her: This brings about a feeling of self-dependency and they are encouraged to solve their problems. This is a natural way of learning. When a child is left to learn in a natural environment, the child's natural development takes place. Influence of any materialistic way doesn't let the mind develop naturally. Watching TV, playing video games or joining classes of dance, swimming or any other sports will not let the mind develop naturally. Here creativity of their mind is developed. They explore ideas. The logic behind this is that the kids of animals learn by nature, so can our kids. So let our children play in the garden, to watch flowers, plants, birds, butterflies and other gifts of nature. In the classes of dance, swimming etc. their creativity is influenced and their natural creativity is suppressed . In these classes they are overburdened and can't train their creativity. So let them play in the open air or garden without any burden instead of joining classes. Generally parents give toys to their children and explain how to operate them. But those parents who believe in slow parenting give toys and observe how the children are managing them. Their skill to learn and understand comes out.

NASA's Orion spacecraft, atop a United Launch Alliance Delta 4-Heavy rocket, lifts off on its first unmanned orbital test flight from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Friday, Dec. 5, 2014, in Cape... (Associated Press) CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — NASA's new Orion spacecraft streaked into orbit Friday on a high-stakes test flight meant to usher in a new era of human exploration leading ultimately to Mars. The unmanned orbital journey began with a sunrise liftoff witnessed by thousands of NASA guests. Parts of the spacecraft peeled away exactly as planned, falling back toward Earth as onboard cameras provided stunning views of our blue, cloud-covered planet. \\"The star of the day is Orion,\\" said NASA Administrator Charles Bolden Jr., back for the second morning in a row. He called it \\"Day One of the Mars era.\\" Orion's debut will be brief — just 4½ hours from launch to splashdown, with two orbits of Earth. But for the first time in 42 years, NASA is sending a spacecraft built for humans farther than a couple hundred miles from Earth. The previous time was the Apollo 17 moon shot. And it's NASA's first new vehicle for space travel since the shuttle. \\"Very exciting,\\" NASA's Orion program manager, Mark Geyer, pleased by the successful jettison tests during the flight's early minutes. \\"We still have a bunch to go.\\" Friday's flight test brings NASA \\"one step closer\\" to putting humans aboard Orion, Bolden said just before liftoff. Sluggish rocket valves and wind halted Thursday's launch attempt. Everything went NASA's way Friday as the Delta IV rocket carried Orion over the Atlantic on a route over South Africa as it zoomed into orbit. NASA was aiming for a peak altitude of 3,600 miles on Orion's second lap around the planet, in order to give the capsule the necessary momentum for a scorchingly high-speed re-entry over the Pacific. Engineers want to see how the heat shield — the largest of its kind ever built — holds up when Orion comes back through the atmosphere traveling 20,000 mph and enduring 4,000 degrees. The atmosphere at Kennedy Space Center was reminiscent of the shuttle-flying days. After more than three years since the last shuttle flight, NASA reveled in all the attention. Roads appeared to be less jammed before dawn for try two, and NASA was uncertain how many of the estimated 27,000 invited guests returned. Nonetheless, the press site remained jammed, the hotels packed and the excitement level high. \\"It's a big day for the world, for people who know and like space,\\" Bolden said, observing the crowds. In Houston, NASA's Mission Control took over the entire operation once Orion was aloft. The flight program was loaded into Orion's computers well in advance, allowing the spacecraft to fly essentially on autopilot. Flight controllers — all shuttle veterans — could intervene in the event of an emergency breakdown. And in the Pacific off the Mexican Baja coast, Navy ships waited for Orion's return. The spacecraft is rigged with 1,200 sensors to gauge everything from heat to vibration to radiation. At 11 feet tall with a 16.5-foot base, Orion is bigger than the old-time Apollo capsules and, obviously, more advanced. NASA deliberately kept astronauts off this first Orion. Managers want to test the riskiest parts of the spacecraft — the heat shield, parachutes, various jettisoning components — before committing to a crew. In addition, on-board computers were going to endure the high-radiation Van Allen belts; engineers wondered whether they might falter. Lockheed Martin Corp. already has begun work on a second Orion, and plans to eventually build a fleet of the capsules. The earliest that astronauts might fly on an Orion is 2021. An asteroid redirected to lunar orbit is intended for the first stop in the 2020s, followed by Mars in the 2030s. The company handled the 370 million test flight for NASA from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, opting for the Delta IV rocket this time given its heft. It's the most powerful unmanned rocket in the U.S. right now. The entire rocket and capsule, topped by a launch abort tower, stretched 242 feet and weighed 1.6 million pounds — an \\"incredible monster,\\" according to Bolden. To push Orion farther out on future flights, NASA is developing a megarocket known as Space Launch System or SLS. The first Orion-SLS combo will fly around 2018, again without a crew to shake out the rocket. NASA's last trip beyond low-Earth orbit in a vessel built for people was the three-man Apollo 17 in December 1972. Orion will be capable of carrying four astronauts on long hauls and as many as six on three-week hikes. Dozens of astronauts, present and past, gathered at Kennedy for the historic send-off. One of them — Bolden — now leads NASA. He called Mars \\"the ultimate destination of this generation,\\" but said his three young granddaughters think otherwise, telling him, \\"Don't get hung up on Mars because there are other places to go once we get there.\\" ___ Online: NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/orion/ Lockheed Martin: http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/ssc/orion-eft1.html ||||| KENNEDY SPACE CENTER — NASA's dream to eventually carry astronauts to Mars got off to a near-flawless start on Friday as the new Orion spacecraft blasted off from Cape Canaveral, flew 3,604 miles into space and splashed down on a \\"bull's-eye\\" in the Pacific Ocean. The launch atop a Delta IV Heavy rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station delighted NASA, its contactors and thousands of onlookers along the coast. Orion blasted off backlit by sunrise, right on time at 7:05 a.m. It flew to the highest point any craft built for humans has gone since Apollo, re-entered the atmosphere at 20,000 mph and, after four hours and 24 minutes, parachuted into the Pacific Ocean just a little more than a mile from its target. \\"America has driven a golden spike as it crosses a bridge into the future,\\" NASA announcer Rob Navias said after Orion gently fell into the water west of Baja California, Mexico. For NASA, much was riding on Orion's maiden flight. Since the end of the space shuttle program in 2011, the space agency has tried to come up with a new vision for human space exploration. After an earlier rocket program was canceled, plans emerged to use the Orion capsule and another new rocket to launch astronauts into deep space in coming decades. The Orion space capsule successfully launched into space from Kennedy Space Center on Dec. 5, 2014. The capsule rode atop the world’s most powerful rocket, the Delta IV Heavy. (Red Huber) The Space Launch System rocket, the most powerful ever created, is expected to be ready for Orion's next test flight in 2018. NASA wants to use the SLS and Orion for manned flights around and perhaps to the moon, to Mars and to other points in the 2020s and 2030s. \\"We as a species are meant to push human presence into the solar system, and this is a step in starting to do that,\\" said Bill Gerstenmaier, NASA's associate administrator for human exploration. NASA, Orion builder Lockheed-Martin and the Delta's builder, United Space Alliance, \\"put their hearts and souls into this mission,\\" said NASA Orion Flight Director Mike Serafin. \\"We became something greater than ourselves. And while this was an unmanned mission, we were all on board.\\" The only apparent flaw occurred after splashdown, when only three of five floatation airbags deployed fully. Still, the unmanned capsule bobbed upright and floated properly anyway. Officials also expressed some concern about certain electronic units onboard resetting during the flight. But NASA Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said that was not totally unexpected. NASA and Lockheed-Martin, which built Orion, will know more when they retrieve and analyze flight recorders that collected data from 1,200 on-board sensors. Analysis will begin almost immediately. The capsule itself will be trucked back to Kennedy Space Center, arriving around Christmas. \\"There was a bit of an 'Aha!' that it worked so well,\\" Geyer said. \\"In that environment, with how difficult this test was, it flew right down the middle.\\" The liftoff appeared to reawaken excitement about space in Central Florida, as thousands of area residents and tourists gathered in Brevard County to watch the launch. \\"I have always dreamed of being an astronaut,\\" said Lizzi Gunn, 24, of Kissimmee, who watched from Kennedy Space Center. \\"I'm so proud of this country for doing it and deciding we are going to Mars.\\" Alice Chen of Seward, Alaska, said she hoped Orion would help renew interest in space from younger people. \\"It was pretty incredible,\\" Seward, 56, said of the launch. \\"The noise. The look. It was just a ball of fire. It was very exciting.\\" After a deep rumble went over the crowd, they watched the fireball disappear behind a gray December sky. For Saul Reza of Mexico City, whose fiancée lives in Orlando, the launch signaled a potential return to a golden age of exploration. \\"This is probably mankind's best chance at returning to space,\\" he said. \\"It's the most important thing we are doing.\\" Astronauts are just as excited about NASA's next big thing. \\"I think you'll be hard-pressed to find an astronaut, past, present or future, who wouldn't love to fly on Orion,\\" said Rex Walheim, who flew on Atlantis, the last space shuttle, in 2011. smpowers@tribune.com or 407-420-5441. msantana@tribune.com or 407-420-5256. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"NASA's new Orion spacecraft had a successful test flight, launching into orbit and returning to Earth safely.

They didn't pay the bill: This is a possibility, as sometimes people forget to pay their bills, leading to service disconnection. However, this would also depend on whether the beach house is owned or rented, and who is responsible for paying the bills. 2. They never had it hooked up: If the beach house is newly purchased, or the owners don't frequently use it, they might not have had internet service set up. This would especially be true if the house is meant for relaxation, and the owners intentionally avoid providing internet access. 3. They don't offer Wi-Fi where they are staying: Depending on the location of the beach house, there might be a limited number of ISPs or none at all. This would mean that no internet service is available in that area. 4. They are in the middle of nowhere: Similar to option 3, a remote location would restrict the availability of internet services. Limited infrastructure in remote areas often results in the absence or unavailability of internet connectivity. Based on the analysis, the most likely reasons for not having internet at the beach house would be either \\"They never had it hooked up\\" or \\"They don't offer Wi-Fi where they are staying.\\" Since both of these options consider the possibility of lacking infrastructure or the owner's intentions related to the beach house, they offer a more plausible explanation than simply not paying the bill or being in the middle of nowhere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - A dervish or darvesh (from , \\"Darvsh\\" via Turkish, , , \\"\\") is someone guiding a Sufi Muslim ascetic down a \\"path\\" or \\"Tariqah\\", known for their extreme poverty and austerity. Their focus is on the universal values of love and service, deserting the illusions of ego to reach God. In most Sufi orders, a dervish is known to practice dhikr through physical exertions or religious practices to attain the ecstatic trance to reach God. Their most common practice is Sama which is associated with Rumi. - Baku is the capital and largest city of Azerbaijan, as well as the largest city on the Caspian Sea and of the Caucasus region. Baku is located below sea level, which makes it the lowest lying national capital in the world and also the largest city in the world located below sea level. It is located on the southern shore of the Absheron Peninsula, alongside the Bay of Baku. At the beginning of 2009, Baku's urban population was estimated at just over two million people. Officially, about 25 percent of all inhabitants of the country live in Baku's metropolitan area. - Madrasa (\\",\\" pl. , \\"\\", ) is the Arabic word for any type of educational institution, whether secular or religious (of any religion). The word is variously transliterated \\"madrasah\\", \\"medresa\\", \\"madrassa\\", \\"madraza\\", \\"medrese\\", etc. In the West, the word usually refers to a specific type of religious school or college for the study of the Islamic religion, though this may not be the only subject studied. In countries like India, not all students in madrasas are Muslims; there is also a modern curriculum. - A talibé (also called \\"talibe\\", plural \\"talibés\\", Arabic, lib, \\"\\"student\\"\\", lit. \\"\\"seeker\\"\\"; pl. \\"ullb\\") is a boy, usually from Senegal, the Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali or Mauritania, who studies the Quran at a daara (West African equivalent of madrasa). This education is guided by a teacher known as a marabout. In most cases talibés leave their parents to stay in the daara. - Shirvan (from Tat: \\"irvan\\"), also spelled as Sharvn, Shirwan, Shervan, Sherwan and Šervn, is a historical region in the eastern Caucasus, known by this name in both Islamic and modern times. Today, the region is an industrially and agriculturally developed part of the Azerbaijan Republic that stretches between the western shores of the Caspian Sea and the Kura River and is centered on the Shirvan Plain. - The Caspian Sea is the largest enclosed inland body of water on Earth by area, variously classed as the world's largest lake or a full-fledged sea. It is in an endorheic basin (it has no outflows) located between Europe and Asia. It is bound by Kazakhstan to the northeast, Russia to the northwest, Azerbaijan to the west, Iran to the south, and Turkmenistan to the southeast. - A khanqah or khaniqah (also transliterated as khankahs , khaneqa, khanegah or khaneqah), also known as a ribat among other terms is a building designed specifically for gatherings of a Sufi brotherhood or \\"tariqa\\" and is a place for spiritual retreat and character reformation. In the past, and to a lesser extent nowadays, they often served as hospices for salik (Sufi travelers) and talibe (Islamic students). Khanqahs are very often found adjoined to dargahs (shrines of Sufi saints), mosques and madrasas (Islamic schools). - Azerbaijan, officially the Republic of Azerbaijan, is a country in the South Caucasus region, situated at the crossroads of Southwest Asia and Southeastern Europe. It is bounded by the Caspian Sea to the east, Russia to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia to the west and Iran to the south. The exclave of Nakhchivan is bounded by Armenia to the north and east, Iran to the south and west, while having an 8 km border with Turkey in the north west. - The Absheron Peninsula is a peninsula in Azerbaijan. It is host to Baku, the biggest and the most populous city of the country, and also the Baku metropolitan area, with its satellite cities Sumqayit and Khyrdalan. - Shirvanshah, also spelled as Shrwn Shh or Sharwn Shh, was the title of the rulers of Shirvan, located in modern Azerbaijan, from the mid-9th century to the early 16th century. The title remained in a single family, the Yazidids, an originally Arab but gradually Persianized dynasty, although the later \\"Shirvanshahs\\" are also known as the Kasranids or Kaqanids. The Shirvanshah established a native state in Shirvan (located in modern Azerbaijan Republic). - Jall ad-Dn Muhammad Rm, also known as Jall ad-Dn Muhammad Balkh, Mevlânâ/Mawln (\\"our master\\"), Mevlevî/Mawlaw (\\"my master\\"), and more popularly simply as Rumi (30 September 1207 17 December 1273), was a 13th-century Persian Sunni Muslim poet, jurist, Islamic scholar, theologian, and Sufi mystic. Rumi's influence transcends national borders and ethnic divisions: Iranians, Tajiks, Turks, Greeks, Pashtuns, other Central Asian Muslims, and the Muslims of South Asia have greatly appreciated his spiritual legacy for the past seven centuries. His poems have been widely translated into many of the world's languages and transposed into various formats. Rumi has been described as the \\"most popular poet\\" and the \\"best selling poet\\" in the United States. - The Pir Huseyn Khanqah and Mausoleum lies along the left bank of Pirsaat River ( Pirsaatçay ) , 126 kilometers to the southwest of Baku . The inscription plaque over the portal , read by V. Kratchkovskaya in 1952 , announces that the khanqah ( dervish monastery ) was built by Sharaf al - Dawla wal - din Hasan during the reign of the Shirvanshah Afridhun Abul - Muzaffar Fariburz ( Fariburz III , 1225 - 1255 ) . The title gives a later date : \`\` Here lies the sheikh , imam , mystic ... Al - Husain , son of ' Ali , known as Pir Husain Rawanan ... His tomb was rebuilt by ' Umar , son of Muhammad al - Shirzadi of Qazvin and completed in the year of 684 ( 1280 B.C.E. ) . '' It is likely that the tomb of Pir Husayn bin Ali , an Azeri sheikh of the Qalandari sect who lived in the 11th century , existed on this site before a formal khanqah was built around it in the 13th century . Built out of cut - stone , the roughly rectangular complex was centered on an open courtyard fortified with ramparts , similar to a ribat . The crenellated rampart walls were buttressed with round bastions at the corners and semi-circular bastions at the middle of the south , east and west walls . A monumental gate centered on the eastern wall gave access to the courtyard , which was surrounded with halls of different sizes to its north and west , including a mosque on the western wing and a single minaret near the northeastern corner .

It just might increase your risk of color1ectal cancer .Nurses who worked the night shift at least three times a month for t5 years or more were 35%more likely to develop that type of cancer than nurses who never worked nights,Harvard University researchers report in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. The finding,from the ongoing Nurses Health Study,is the first to link night shift work with a higher risk of color1ectal cancer,expected to kill 57,100 Americans this, according to the American Cancer Society.Another research,including a report out of the Nurses Health Study, has suggested that working night shifts increases women's breast cancer risk. The researchers asked 78,586 nurses whether they had ever worked three or more night shifts a month.The nurses indicated whether they had done so for less than 15 years or 15 years or more.The scientists followed the women to see who developed color1ectal cancer. Researchers believe that lowered levels of melatonin might increase night-shift workers' cancer risk.Melatonin levels usually reach the highest point in the middle of the night. Turn on the lights,though,and _ dropped measurably in just 10 minutes,says Richard Stevens a cancer epidemiologist at the University of Connecticut who did not take part in the new study.After two weeks of continuous nightly exposure to light,humans experience a sharp drop in melatonin production,Nurses Health Study researchers write. In the lab,melatonin appears to stop tumor growth.Other studies suggest that color1ectal cancer patients have lower blood levels of melatonin than healthy people,the authors write.However,that could be a result of the disease,not a cause of it.Stevens says.

Their daily catch would define the life of their own and their families. But it only took a few hours to remove their life-long habitat right in front of their eyes. Some fishermen had set sail on Christmas night. A very few were lucky enough to return the next morning. But none found any of what they left behind the other night. They were made to lose their families by the very waters that they used to love the most. The few who made it through the day have been wondering about the meaning of their lives. They had used the sea for decades, but the sea used them for a single day. Is it justice ? Or killing? What would become of them? For whom would they go fishing again? As they struggle with their conflicting feelings, they also come to remind themselves of their struggle for survival. Where are they now? They didn't leave the beach, or the sea. They will be back because the sea is their home and the only means of living, so they will continue in their fight for destiny . But will it be the same? Sadly not.

The eruption of fighting in Iraq's Anbar Province is causing much consternation and recrimination in U.S. foreign policy circles. Conservative hawks, including Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham, are especially vocal in criticizing the Obama administration's Iraq policy. They argue that the administration's fecklessness has opened Iraq to an al Qaeda offensive that now has the terrorist group's flag flying over portions of Falluja and Ramadi, two cities subdued during the Bush administration at great cost in blood and treasure. If Obama had not foolishly withdrawn the remaining U.S. troops from Iraq at the end of 2011, hawkish critics insist, Washington would now have far greater ability to prevent the country's alarming slide into turmoil. It is a grotesque oversimplification to assume that","completion":"the mere presence of U.S. troops in Iraq post-2011 would have been enough to guarantee the nation's stability and prevent it from being engulfed in chaos. Such an argument, rooted in a flawed understanding of the geopolitical complexities, historical context, and the internal dynamics within Iraq, blatantly disregards the fact that external forces alone cannot guarantee long-term peace. The fragile political landscape of Iraq, further fueled by sectarian tensions and the rise of ISIS, is a consequence of years-long intricate processes, and the responsibility for the current state of affairs in the country goes beyond the scope of any single administration's policies. One needs to take into consideration the broader context under which the withdrawal decision was made. Following the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, Iraq was plunged into a vicious circle of violent conflicts, mass displacement, and the breakdown of law and order. The goal of establishing a sovereign, democratic, viable, and pluralistic state to replace Saddam Hussein's brutal dictatorship seemed further than ever and these issues persisted throughout the Bush administration and into Obama's presidency. As the U.S. pressed on with its military engagement in Iraq, the high cost of war in terms of human lives and financial resources strained American public opinion and ultimately, the populace began to demand an end to the conflict. The reduction of U.S. military presence in Iraq was not an abrupt decision made by the Obama administration, but a gradual process initiated by the U.S. and Iraqi governments in 2008 with the signing of the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) which established specific deadlines for the departure of U.S. combat forces. The Bush administration fully endorsed this agreement and it laid the foundation for the withdrawal plan that the Obama administration later executed. It is disingenuous to pin the responsibility solely on Obama, as he was following an agreement that already anticipated the eventual exit of American troops from Iraq. Furthermore, it is important to emphasize that the withdrawal was not solely a U.S. initiative, but also reflected the wishes of the Iraqi government and the local population that sought to reclaim their sovereignty and desired control over their nation. A continued presence of U.S. troops could have provoked the very anti-American sentiments that the Iraqi insurgency sought to exploit, as well as undermine the legitimacy of the Iraqi government that was attempting to establish itself as the primary authority within the country. Ultimately, to assert that the presence of U.S. troops would have entirely prevented the present-day turmoil in Iraq grossly underestimates the immensely complex and multifaceted nature of the crisis. Factors such as the rise of ISIS in neighboring Syria, the prevalence of transnational terrorist networks, Iran's growing influence in the region, and the internal divisions within Iraq are among the many elements that have contributed to the chaotic situation we observe today. Blaming the Obama administration for the entirety of Iraq's current predicament is not only an unjust oversimplification, but also a disservice to any meaningful attempt at comprehending and addressing the true extent and root causes of the ongoing conflict in the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I've seen tons of HK actioners, and this one is right at the top of the genre. The action scenes are as exciting and kinetic as anything you've ever seen in any action movie. The kung fu is spectacular, the pyrotechnics eye-popping, the stunt work heartstopping. The editing is perfectly paced, heightening the tension and complimenting the fluid camera work. This film is directed by old pro Corey Yuen, whose resume is stuffed with some of the best work of the genre, including the Jet Li vehicle The Legend of Fong Sai-Yuk. If there is one thing lacking in this film it is the presence of a three-dimensional character, though Martin, the male lead, comes closest to it.

The SCR111.sys program is experiencing freezing and system crashing issues due to some critical system components not functioning properly. In this particular case, the vital components are scmstcs.sys and stcusb.sys. 1. scmstcs.sys: This component is typically known as a system control manager (SCM) file, which is an integral part of the Windows operating system. Its primary function is to handle the interactions between different software and hardware drivers. The file serves as the heart of the system's dynamic link library (DLL) and acts as the main command center for the overall software and hardware communication. 2. stcusb.sys: This is another critical system component, which is associated with the USB drivers and devices. Its purpose is to handle the functioning of USB devices and usually takes care of the input-output requests from various applications and operating systems. In essence, this file is responsible for maintaining a smooth communication bridge between different USB devices and the computer. When these files become abnormal, they may result in program freezing and system crashing, as is the case with SCR111.sys. This is highly undesirable, as it affects the overall performance and functionality of the operating system. To resolve these issues, consider doing the following: 1. Run an antivirus scan: Malware or viruses can infect system files, causing them to become abnormal and unstable. Running an updated antivirus program can help identify and resolve any potential threats. 2. Run System File Checker (SFC): The SFC tool scans the integrity of all important system files and attempts to repair any corrupted files. To do this, open an elevated command prompt and type \\"sfc /scannow\\" (without quotes) before hitting Enter. 3. Update your drivers and software: Incompatibility issues between the software and drivers can lead to system instability. Make sure to update all your software and drivers to their latest versions to prevent potential conflicts. 4. Uninstall and reinstall USB drivers: If stcusb.sys specifically is causing the problem, navigate to Device Manager in Windows and uninstall the USB drivers. Restart your computer, which will prompt Windows to reinstall the drivers automatically. This process can help refresh any corrupt or malfunctioning driver files. 5. Perform a system restore: In case none of the previous solutions work, you may want to consider performing a system restore to an earlier point before the issue started occurring. This can help you revert your system to a stable state by rolling back any recent changes that could have caused the problem. By addressing the abnormalities and issues associated with scmstcs.sys and stcusb.sys, you can restore the functionality of the SCR111.sys program, preventing any further freezing or crashing issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person who bought the portrait of the wife of the man who was heartbroken and did not remarry? Joséphine-Éléonore-Marie-Pauline de Galard de Brassac de Béarn (1825–1860) married Albert de Broglie on 18 June 1845, and they had five sons together. Although not high royalty, on the occasion of their marriage, they styled themselves Prince and Princesse respectively. Pauline was a highly intelligent and religious woman, who was well read and wrote a number of texts in her lifetime. Her shyness was well known; she was widely considered strikingly beautiful and charming, but those around her would often avoid eye contact so as not to embarrass her. Albert was devoted to his wife, and commissioned the painting after being impressed by Ingres' 1845 portrait of his sister, the Comtesse d'Haussonville. Albert approached Ingres around 1850 to undertake the portrait. Ingres dined with the de Broglie family in January 1850, and according to one eye witness, \\"seemed to be very happy with his model.\\"Although Ingres' main source of income came from portraiture, it distracted from his main interest in history painting, which early in his career, was far less lucrative. He found acclaim in the 1840s, when he became successful enough to no longer depend on commissions. This painting was Ingres' second-last female portrait, and final society portrait.Influenced by the working methods of Jacques-Louis David, Ingres began with a number of nude preparatory sketches, for which he employed professional models. He built up a picture of the sitter's underlying anatomical structure, as seen in the Musée Bonnat study, before deciding on how to build the lavish costume and accessories. Although there is no surviving record of the commissions, and the exact sequence of events is uncertain, the sketches can be dated from 1850, the year the style of her evening dress came into fashion. Ingres signed and dated the final picture at the left center \\"J. INGRES. pit 1853\\".Pauline died in 1860 aged 35 from tuberculosis. After her death, Albert published three volumes of her essays on religious history.

Notable marathoners such as Frank Shorter, Dick Beardsley, Alberto Salazar, Grete Waitz, Paula Radcliffe, Joan Benoit-Samuelson, and Kathrine Switzer provide commentary about the sport. The focus is then on the six featured runners and their training for the 2005 Chicago Marathon. American Deena Kastor and Kenyan Daniel Njenga are both elite runners, and are determined to win the race. Kastor was the bronze medalist at the 2004 Olympic Marathon, but has yet to win a marathon. Njenga had finished second multiple times in previous Chicago Marathons. Kastor is shown training and recovering from an injury in Mammoth Lakes, California, while Njenga's life as a sponsored runner in Tokyo is profiled. The rest of the runners featured live in Chicago. Ryan Bradley and Lori O'Connor are both married young professionals; Bradley is a veteran marathoner who hopes to earn a qualifying time for the Boston Marathon, and O'Connor is running her first marathon. She finds it humorous when colleagues ask if she expects to win. Jerry Meyers is a jovial 70-year-old who claims to run marathons for the T-shirt.

Summarize the following: If they are behaving generally rational, your ex’s advances are fueled by contact with you. Don’t give fuel to the fire. Try to avoid them whenever possible. This may be difficult if you work together or socialize in the same circles. Nonetheless, the more you can break off contact with them, the easier it should be to gradually come to terms with the break up. Take note if your ex intensifies their attempts see you after you break off contact. This irrational behavior may be a sign of criminal harassment or even psychosis. If they become more desperate or abusive, contact the police immediately. It is important that you have a support network in times like these. Keeping others aware of your ex’s behavior will also serve as an impartial judge of whether they cross the line. Have them check in with you regularly to make sure you are okay and the pestering hasn’t intensified to abusive harassment. If they leave you messages/texts that make your blood boil, take a moment before doing anything. It is probably best not to respond at all, and let their feelings for you suffocate. Alternately, you may think that will only make them more determined to getting in touch with you. If so, keep your comments and responses as positive, respectful and brief as possible. Communicate to them that you respect them, but no longer wish to have a romantic relationship. If they won't stop texting you, try a quick message like, \\"I still respect you, but I don't want to date you. Please stop sending these texts.\\" Until this blows over, you may want to avoid seeing their correspondence. Most email clients make it easy to filter out unwanted messages. However, if you don’t even want to be confronted with the possibility of opening their email, you might create a new temporary email account. Share the address only with those you need to contact, and tell them why. Making sure your ex doesn’t find out this email address will create a safe space for you. For a step-by-step guide to creating an email filter, see this. Their phone calls and voice messages will be harder to ignore than their emails. This will be a major source of stress for you until the issue is resolved. Luckily, it is easy to block phone numbers. Look at this guide for instructions on how to do this with a variety of phone carriers. If your ex is part of one of your circles of friends, take this as an opportunity to explore new forms of entertainment and cultivate new friendships. It is unlikely that all your old friends break off contact with you unless they have a reason to. Nonetheless, take the stress off of your interactions with them by keeping a safe distance. They will appreciate you keeping them out of the dispute as well. Sometimes you cannot avoid direct contact with an ex. Try to keep the contact brief and public. They are unlikely to do anything abusive with others around, and it should make you more comfortable. If they do cross the line to harassment, others will be around to step in or at least act as witnesses. Acting stressed or hysterical may make your ex feel like they need to ‘help’ you. By having calm, public interactions with them, they may see your happiness and not want to disturb it. After all, if they truly cared for you, they would want you to prosper even if it meant leaving you alone.","completion":"To deal with an ex's advances, minimize contact with them and maintain a support network.

Yet they have changed a lot since 1804, when the first train moved at 8 km/hr. Today's high speed trains can go 300 km/hr or faster. Besides their speed, they have many advantages over other transportation types. Japan built the world's first high speed railway. In 1964, Japan's \\"Shinkansen\\" trains started traveling between Osaka and Tokyo at 200 km/hr. Over time, more lines, as well as faster trains, were built. Korea, England, and the USA, now have their own high speed systems. Taiwan Province's started running in 2007. Its trains are based on two types of Shinkansen trains. They can carry 989 people and travel from Taipei to Kaohsiung in less than two hours. These systems are expensive to build, but they have many advantages. For example, they are good for the environment. Trains on the London to Paris line create 1/10 the pollution that planes create. High speed trains are also safer and cleaner than cars. Super fast trains can even help a country's economy . They make it easier to travel to faraway places. That helps businesses and land values in those areas.

Q:Everybody knew Shandor Marley's mother liked to spend more time flirting with serial killers than she did taking care of things at home. So when her son went round with an air rifle popping his neighbours like they were allotment pigeons, they figured all the boy really needed was a bit of attention. Shandor finally flipped one day after finding out the inbred farm boys who made his life hell most days were in fact his half-brothers. He returned home to confront his mother only to find her pritt-sticking press cuttings of the Mad Killer into a brand new scrapbook and seemingly not in the least bit concerned by her son's unexpected discovery. Luckily Shandor's shooting spree didn't do too much damage beyond putting one of his so-called new father's eyes out, which could be considered doubly unfortunate given as the so-called new father in question owned the old byre Shandor and his mother called home. After Shandor had spent enough time shut away in borstal with the kind of kids who would've sent his mother all weak at the knees, he went straight home half-expecting the byre to be boarded up with a blu-tacked note saying she was lugging her stupid arse to Texas to spring her latest psycho boyfriend from his cell on death row. Shandor was thinking how much that excuse would sit well with her as he scuffed up the stone track to the byre with a black bin-bag of belongings and a sunburned arm across his forehead to shield himself from the glare.

Article: The 11 billion self-help industry is built on the idea that you should turn negative thoughts like \\"I never do anything right\\" into positive ones like \\"I can succeed.\\" But was positive thinking advocate Norman Vincent Peale right? Is there power in positive thinking? Researchers in Canada just published a study in the journal Psychological Science that says trying to get people to think more positively can actually have the opposite effect: it can simply highlight how unhappy they are. The study's authors, Joanne Wood and John Lee of the University of Waterloo and Elaine Perunovic of the University of New Brunswick, begin by citing older research showing that when people get feedback which they believe is overly positive, they actually feel worse, not better. If you tell your friend who is slow to learn that he has the potential of an Einstein, _ . In one 1990s experiment, a team including psychologist Joel Cooper of Princeton asked participants to write essays opposing funding for the disabled. When the essayists were later praised for their sympathy, they felt even worse about what they had written. In this experiment, Wood, Lee and Perunovic measured 68 students' self-esteem. The participants were then asked to write down their thoughts and feelings for four minutes. Every 15 seconds, one group of students heard a bell. When it rang, they were supposed to tell themselves, \\"I am lovable.\\" Those with low self-esteem didn't feel better after the forced self-affirmation . In fact, their moods turned significantly darker than those of members of the control group, who weren't urged to think positive thoughts. The paper provides support for newer forms of psychotherapy that urge people to accept their negative thoughts and feelings rather than fight them. In the fighting, we not only often fail but can make things worse. Meditation techniques, in contrast, can teach people to put their shortcomings into a larger, more realistic viewpoint. Call it the power of negative thinking. Question: According to the study of the Canadian researchers, _ .

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I didn't even knew this movie existed until shortly after seeing Blade: Trinity, I was messing around on the Trinity board when I saw some user mention how the Wes Craven series is a lot better then the 'crap' that's Blade, So I did my quick research: Checked the scores on IMDb & RottenTomatoes for Dracula: Ascension, and somewhere along the search I found out that this is a sequel to Dracula 2000. I also noticed that within the Wes Craven Dracula boards there was a real strong following for this movie which is a big contradiction to the scores I was seeing. Now let's take a quick personal recap here. I remember seeing Dracula 2000, and I remember not liking it at all, and then seeing the scores of Dracula: Ascension just lowered my expectations even more, but then again, I'm the type of person that truly needs to watch the movie myself (any movie) so that I can form my own opinion. A couple of things I went in knowing when I started watching this movie was that it's low budget, so because of that, I'm going to have to ignore a lot of the v/fx and just figure it's going to compensated by story & acting, I was also slightly impressed by some of the casting in this movie (Jason London, Roy Schieder & Jason Scott Lee) Oh geez This movie was CHEESY! But cheesy can be entertaining at least, I found it pretty fricken laughable, the bad audio synch from the re-recording of dialogue in a FEW scenes, the stupidity of the characters in this movie. Sure they all knew about vampires and some of the basic things, Luke even had a book on it, but did it prevent them from wanting to purposely get 'infected'? Nope, this is worst then slasher flicks where the girl has to get out of the shower and check out the noise she hears with nothing more than a towel on.

Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking. - Bowling Green is a city in and the county seat of Wood County, Ohio, United States.

Lake Erie's northern shore is bounded by the Canadian province of Ontario, with the U.S. states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York on its southern and easternmost shores and Michigan on the west. These jurisdictions divide the surface area of the lake by water boundaries. The lake was named by the Erie people, a Native Americans people who lived along its southern shore. That Iroquoian tribe called it \\"\\"Erige\\"\\" \\"(\\"cat\\")\\" because of its unpredictable and sometimes violently dangerous nature. It is a matter of conjecture whether the lake was named after the tribe, or if the tribe was called \\"\\"Erie\\"\\" because of its proximity to the lake. - Ohio is an Eastern state in the Great Lakes region of the United States.

With his distinctive raspy voice and a stage show that features guillotines, electric chairs, fake blood, deadly snakes, baby dolls, and dueling swords, Cooper is considered by music journalists and peers alike to be \\"The Godfather of Shock Rock\\". He has drawn equally from horror films, vaudeville, and garage rock to pioneer a macabre and theatrical brand of rock designed to shock people. Originating in Phoenix, Arizona, in the late 1960s after he moved from Detroit, Michigan, \\"Alice Cooper\\" was originally a band consisting of Furnier on vocals and harmonica, lead guitarist Glen Buxton, Michael Bruce on rhythm guitar, Dennis Dunaway on bass guitar, and drummer Neal Smith. Cooper is a fan of the NHL's Arizona Coyotes. On February 18, 2012, the Coyotes gave away his bobblehead in a promotion for the first 10,000 fans for a game with the Dallas Stars. Cooper is a longtime baseball fan, supporting the Arizona Diamondbacks and Detroit Tigers. As a child, he dreamed of playing left field in the Tiger's outfield alongside Tigers Hall of Famer Al Kaline. He has coached Little League baseball teams since his son played in the early 1990s. Cooper is also a fan of NBA basketball, supporting the Detroit Pistons. Cooper has on several occasions credited golf with playing a major role in helping him overcome his addiction to alcohol, and has even gone so far as to say that when he took up golf, it was a case of replacing one addiction with another. The importance that the game has had in his life is also reflected in the title to his 2007 autobiography, Alice Cooper, Golf Monster. Cooper, who has participated in a number of Pro-Am competitions, plays the game six days a week, off a handicap of two. Since 1997 he has hosted an annual golf competition, the Alice Cooper Celebrity AM Golf Tournament, all proceeds from which go to his charity, the Solid Rock Foundation. Cooper has also appeared in commercials for Callaway Golf equipment and was a guest of veteran British player and broadcaster Peter Alliss on A Golfer's Travels. He wrote the foreword to the Gary McCord book Ryder Cup and participated in the second All*Star Cup in Newport, Wales. In an interview with VH1, friend and fellow golfer Pat Boone said that Cooper was \\"this close\\" to being a pro. did alice cooper do anything with sports?","completion":"Yes, Alice Cooper is involved with sports, especially with hockey, baseball, basketball, and golf.

Baseball - He supports the Arizona Diamondbacks and Detroit Tigers. He used to coach Little League baseball teams too. 3. Basketball - He supports the Detroit Pistons in NBA games. 4. Golf - Alice Cooper loves playing golf, and it helped him overcome alcohol addiction. He plays golf almost every day and has a golf charity event called the Alice Cooper Celebrity AM Golf Tournament.

Mantle played his entire Major League Baseball (MLB) career with the New York Yankees as a center fielder and first baseman, from 1951 through 1968. Mantle was one of the best players and sluggers, and is regarded by many as the greatest switch hitter in baseball history. Mantle was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974 and was elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. Mantle was invited to the Yankees instructional camp before the 1951 season. After an impressive spring training, Yankees manager Casey Stengel decided to promote Mantle to the majors as a right fielder instead of sending him to the minors. Mickey Mantle's salary for the 1951 season was 7,500. Mantle was assigned uniform #6, signifying the expectation that he would become the next Yankees star, following Babe Ruth (#3), Lou Gehrig (#4) and Joe DiMaggio (#5). Stengel, speaking to SPORT, stated \\"He's got more natural power from both sides than anybody I ever saw.\\" Bill Dickey called Mantle \\"the greatest prospect [he's] seen in [his] time.\\" After a brief slump, Mantle was sent down to the Yankees' top farm team, the Kansas City Blues. However, he was not able to find the power he once had in the lower minors. Out of frustration, he called his father one day and told him, \\"I don't think I can play baseball anymore.\\" Mutt drove up to Kansas City that day. When he arrived, he started packing his son's clothes and, according to Mantle's memory, said \\"I thought I raised a man. I see I raised a coward instead. You can come back to Oklahoma and work the mines with me.\\" Mantle immediately broke out of his slump, going on to hit .361 with 11 homers and 50 RBIs during his stay in Kansas City. Mantle was called up to the Yankees after 40 games with Kansas City, this time wearing uniform #7. He hit .267 with 13 home runs and 65 RBI in 96 games. In the second game of the 1951 World Series, New York Giants rookie Willie Mays hit a fly ball to right-center field. Mantle, playing right field, raced for the ball together with center fielder Joe DiMaggio, who called for the ball (and made the catch). In getting out of DiMaggio's way, Mantle tripped over an exposed drain pipe and severely injured his right knee. This was the first of numerous injuries that plagued his 18-year career with the Yankees. He played the rest of his career with a torn ACL. Did it keep him from playing?","completion":"Despite the torn ACL and numerous other injuries that plagued Mickey Mantle's career, he continued to play and persevered through the pain. Mantle's incredible determination and love for the game allowed him to maintain a high level of performance, even with his physical setbacks. Over his 18-year career with the New York Yankees, Mantle achieved numerous accolades and milestones, solidifying his place in baseball history. Mantle appeared in 12 World Series and won 7 championships alongside the Yankees. Additionally, he was named an All-Star 20 times, won three American League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, and achieved the AL Triple Crown in 1956, leading the league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in for that season. Despite his knee injury, Mantle managed to hit a remarkable 536 career home runs, which, at the time of his retirement, placed him third on the all-time home run list, behind only Babe Ruth and Willie Mays. Furthermore, his career on-base plus slugging (OPS) of .977 remains one of the highest in MLB history. Mickey Mantle's commitment to playing through his injuries demonstrated his dedication to the sport and his teammates, earning him immense respect and admiration from fans, players, and critics alike. His lasting impact on the game of baseball is a testament to his resilience in the face of physical adversity, and he continues to be remembered as one of the greatest players to have ever stepped on a baseball field."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Initially, Marie had meticulously measured the wood structure and the doorway to ensure compatibility, confident that the dimensions would allow for a streamlined process. However, upon closer inspection, she realized that the structure's irregular shape, as well as protruding edges and bulky corners, had added unforeseen complications to the task at hand. Refusing to give up, Marie tapped into her endless reserves of determination and creativity. She began brainstorming various techniques and strategies to facilitate the passage of the wood structure, such as disassembling and reassembling it on the other side of the door, or locating an alternate entrance that could accommodate its size. Unfortunately, despite her exhaustive research and consultations with friends and experts, she found that the options available to her were either impractical or still left her unable to manage the unwieldy structure. In the spirit of perseverance, Marie turned to problem-solving tools and resources, such as moving straps, sliders, and even considering the use of ropes and pulleys to aid her in this increasingly arduous endeavor. She meticulously tested each method, noting their efficacy and potential drawbacks, but ultimately found that none provided the precise combination of ease and security she believed crucial to the safe transportation of the wood structure. As though the universe had conspired against her, Marie encountered additional, unforeseen challenges. As she endeavored, yet again, to maneuver the wood structure through the narrow doorway, she found that her original calculations had not accounted for the added difficulty brought on by obstructions, such as the frame, hinges, and even light fixtures in the immediate area. These physical barriers further impeded her progress and increased the likelihood of damaging the structure, causing her great distress and concern. Despite Marie's valiant efforts, the combination of the wood structure's unwieldy size, its challenging shape, logistical and spatial limitations, and additional obstacles presented by the environment, finally led her to accept that she was unable to complete this formidable task without incurring damage or compromising the integrity of the structure.

The last 30 minutes of the movie seem to leave a particularly negative impression, with outlandish developments and ludicrous resolutions. Despite Bruce Willis' desire to return to crime-fighter roles and co-producing this film, critics believe it does not bring anything new or refreshing to the table. Hostage is considered a lurid, exploitative actioner that takes a kitchen sink approach to the thriller genre, borrowing elements from various similar films without making a unique or standout contribution. In summary, critics seem to view this movie as a recycled, often improbably plotted pulp thriller collapsing into exhausting familiarity by resorting to clichés and borrowed elements from successful predecessors like Die Hard."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

So, people in different countries, including India, decided to make rules to protect kids like you and your friends.

If I had known what I was missing, I wouldve been there everyday! Dave's is located on ASUs campus, south (about 4 blocks) of the Forest and University intersection. This is a very small place w/ limited seating. Luckily, this is a college campus so there is seating everywhere outside. Theyre open til 10 M-T and close at 7 on Fridays. They also deliver, though their delivery area isnt noted on their website. Now for the good stuff: the dogs. I had perused the menu online before hand and man do they have some good stuff. My husband opted for the Mac & Chez dog (a campus fave). It cames covered in (what tasted like) Kraft mac and cheese and real bacon. He *throughly* enjoyed it. I believe his exact words were \\"This is the picture of culinary perfection\\". It did look ridiculous. I opted for the Boston dog (mustard, onions, and relish). When it came I realized I had ordered wrong. I had been salivating over the pics of their Beantown dog (baked beans, mustard, and onions) online and mustve been flustered after my bad day.

Please answer the following question: WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump on Monday declared he has an \\"absolute right\\" to pardon himself and then also tweeted his assertion that the federal government investigation into ties between his 2016 election campaign and Russia is \\"totally unconstitutional.\\" While Trump has frequently ignored established norms and challenged the understood limits of presidential powers, his latest comments are viewed by some legal scholars as unprecedented and testing constitutional boundaries. \\"I was shocked\\" by Trump’s tweets, said Susan Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University. \\"No president has ever tried it,\\" she told VOA News. \\"It’s unlikely the president can pardon himself. I think the court would say no\\" and if he did give himself a pardon, \\"most congresses would impeach him.\\" Bloch also notes when most people accept a pardon \\"it’s an admission of guilt,\\" thus it would be a bad idea for Trump to pursue such a course of action. The professor, who has testified before the Senate on whether a president can be indicted and tried while in office, says the special counsel is \\"absolutely constitutional.\\" Another constitutional scholar, Keith Whittington at Princeton University, said, \\"I think it is important to note that the president’s comments reference serious arguments that are being debated by legal scholars, but these are difficult and unusual constitutional questions that would ultimately be answered in the courts.\\" According to Northwestern University Law Professor Andrew Koppelman, \\"Trump's position on pardons is consistent with the Constitution's text, but inconsistent with the overall structure.

I suppose it was ok… oh, who am I kidding, the harbour is spectacular. Let me also point out that none of these images are touched by editing. Like 99% of my images in this blog (the other 1% is cropping and making slight adjustments), these are entirely un-doctored. We began as all good things do, by hanging out in their airport lounge, offered a mini-pastry and a hot beverage – I adventurously went for an ‘English Mist’, an Earl-Grey Latte to make myself feel a little more soothed boarding a tiny propeller plane (note: it didn’t work.) With a slightly chaotic boarding process (more noticeable after such a serene start) we were too busy sorting out the seats to realise that we had hopped on board, and within in seconds it seemed, our pilot had lifted off smoothly in a flurry of water foam. As we began to watch the world turn into a Lilliput version of itself, we barely blinked for watching beautiful vistas unfold. From tiny little islands (the above Passage Island technically belongs to West Vancouver, known as the Hollywood suburb of the city, and a couple of the homes are allegedly owned by celebrities) where the residents enjoy views of downtown Vancouver, the University of British Columbia campus, Vancouver Island, and the snow-capped mountains of Howe Sound – to the fjords all the way along the Sea to Sky Highway to Whistler.

Leto formed the rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars in 1998 in Los Angeles, California with his brother Shannon. When the group first started, Jared Leto did not allow his position of Hollywood actor to be used in promotion of the band. Their debut album had been in the works for a couple of years, with Leto writing the majority of the songs. Their work led to a number of record labels being interested in signing Thirty Seconds to Mars, which eventually signed to Immortal Records. In 1999, Leto played a gay high school teacher who attracts the attentions of Robert Downey, Jr. in Black and White, and got a supporting role in the drama Girl, Interrupted, an adaptation of the memoir of the same name by Susanna Kaysen. He then portrayed Angel Face in Fight Club (1999), a film adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name, directed by David Fincher. He began dating actress Cameron Diaz in 1999 and the couple became engaged in 2000. Leto played Paul Allen, a rival of Patrick Bateman, in the psychological thriller American Psycho (2000). Though the film polarized audiences and critics, Leto's performance was well received. The same year, he starred as heroin addict Harry Goldfarb in Requiem for a Dream, an adaptation of Hubert Selby, Jr.'s novel of the same name, directed by Darren Aronofsky and co-starring Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans. To prepare for his role, Leto lived on the streets of New York City and refrained from having sex for two months prior to shooting. He starved himself for months, losing 28 pounds to realistically play his heroin addict character. After the shooting of the film, Leto moved to Portugal and lived in a monastery for several months to gain weight. His performance received critical acclaim by film critics who notably praised the actor's emotional courage in portraying the character's physical and mental degradation. Peter Travers from Rolling Stone commented that Leto \\"excels by going beyond Harry's gaunt look to capture his grieving heart. His scenes with Ellen Burstyn as Sara, Harry's widowed mother, achieve a rare poignancy as son and mother drown in delusions.\\" Leto next appeared in the independent film Highway. Set in 1994, Leto is caught with the wife of his employer, a Vegas thug, and flees to Seattle with his best friend Jake Gyllenhaal in the week preceding Kurt Cobain's suicide. Filming finished in early 2000, but the film was not released until March 2002 on home video formats, although originally scheduled for a theatrical release. During this period Leto focused increasingly on his music career, working with producers Bob Ezrin and Brian Virtue on his band's debut album 30 Seconds to Mars, which was released on August 27, 2002, in the United States through Immortal and Virgin. It reached number 107 on the US Billboard 200 and number one on the US Top Heatseekers. Upon its release, 30 Seconds to Mars was met with mostly positive reviews; music critic Megan O'Toole felt that the band managed to \\"carve out a unique niche for themselves in the rock realm.\\" The album was a slow-burning success, and eventually sold two million copies worldwide.

Article:In Facebook posts, two of PM Lee Hsien Loong's siblings accused him of going against their late father Lee Kuan Yew's wishes and abusing his power. The family dispute centres on a legal tussle over a house which belonged to their father. The prime minister, a popular leader, strongly denied all the allegations. But the row has shocked many in the city-state, where the Lees, widely considered Singapore's \\"First Family\\", are held in high regard. Lee Kuan Yew was the prime minister of Singapore when it reluctantly became independent in 1965, and is credited with steering its rapid economic and political transformation. Known to many as LKY, he was often criticised for his restrictive approach to politics, jailing or suing his opponents and restricting freedoms. Despite this, he is still held in huge affection by Singaporeans, who turned out in the thousands to mourn him when he died in 2015. The family dispute first became public last year on the anniversary of Mr Lee's death, when the prime minister's sister, Lee Wei Ling, accused him of exploiting the late leader's legacy for his own gain. In the early hours of Wednesday, Ms Lee and her brother, Lee Hsien Yang, released a statement saying they had lost confidence in their brother as the nation's leader. They accused the prime minister of being opposed to carrying out their late father's wishes - as stated in his will - that the family home at 38 Oxley Road be eventually demolished, rather than becoming a monument to him. The prime minister had previously stated he would remove himself from all government decisions on the house, and he personally wished to honour his father's wishes. But his siblings accused him of backtracking from this position, and said they felt \\"threatened\\" by Mr Lee's \\"misuse of his position and influence over the Singapore government and its agencies to drive his personal agenda\\" and \\"fear the use of the organs of state\\" against them. They gave no specific evidence of alleged personal harassment. Lee Hsien Loong, the prime minister since 2004, said in a statement on Wednesday that he was \\"very disappointed\\" that his siblings had publicised \\"private family matters\\" in a statement that \\"has hurt our father's legacy\\". He denied all their allegations, including \\"the absurd claim\\" that he had political ambitions for one of his sons. Mr Lee, who is overseas and on leave, said he would consider the matter further after his return this weekend. Lee Hsien Yang, who is chair of Singapore's aviation authority, told the BBC he would \\"leave Singapore soon\\" and was \\"looking at a number of options\\" on places to move to. The allegations have generated intense debate online, with many expressing sympathy for the prime minister while others have sided with his siblings. But the general reaction appeared to be of shock and dismay at the family feud spilling out in public once again, with many urging for reconciliation. \\"Don't disgrace your father by making use of media to settle personal disagreement, that's childish and it will only make issues and [the] sibling relationship worse,\\" said one Facebook user called Marcellus Louie. Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"The article discusses a family dispute involving Singapore's Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong, and his siblings, Lee Wei Ling and Lee Hsien Yang.

This is my first post ever on reddit, so please take it easy on me if I screw up on protocol. I'm a guy that really values his personal privacy/space and I don't like people randomly showing up at my house. I'm not particularly religious, but I don't care if people want to believe in something, just don't try to force it on me. I'm all about people being free to do what they want to in their own life. Before I get too deep, a little background info and I'll try to keep it brief...I had a fairly large business in a small town with a large customer base. My dad passed away and left me a big enough inheritance that I decided to shut down my business and take some time for myself and to process losing my best friend. I enjoy building cars, so that's what I do for entertainment. During the summer I usually work at night and sleep during the day because of the heat. Several times I would go to bed at like 8 or 9am and be woken up by friends or former customers beating on my door at like 11am and giving me shit because I was sleeping. Like I'm just being lazy when they have no idea what I've been up to. I got sick of it. Don't show up randomly, wake me up, call me lazy and then ask me for a favor because I did you a favor before when I had my shop. Fuck you. I wound up putting a sign on my door that says \\"If I didn't specifically invite you here, you don't belong here. DO NOT knock on my door for any reason.\\" Saturday late morning, I'm in my kitchen and I see Jehovah's witnesses across the street. I shake my head and go about my business. A couple minutes later, I hear car doors shut in front of my house. I'm irritated. I can see through the curtains on my front door, a silhouette of a small elderly woman walk up to the door, read the sign and, of course, knock. I lose it. Keep in mind that I'm a 6'3\\", 300 pound biker kinda guy that can make a racket. I yell from inside \\"Get the fuck off of my property! Now!\\". She shits a stripe in her undies and I see leaflets go flying. She's apologizing and picking up the leaflets and I yell something to the effect of, \\"You better pick up that bullshit and take it with you.\\" She does and apologizes again while shes walking back to their van. I move the curtains to get a good look at them, and it looks like she is crying when they pull away. I feel like a major asshole for making an old lady cry, but I feel like they invaded my space when it was clearly stated that I didn't want to be bothered. AITA here?","completion":"Part #1: Identify the complex ethical situation. Usage: The main character has a strong desire for privacy and personal space, and confronts Jehovah's Witnesses who knock on his door despite a warning sign not to do so.

Part #2: Generate a suitable title that describes the main event. Usage: \\"Confronting Unwanted Visitors: A Battle Between Privacy and Beliefs\\" This proposed title meets the criteria because it summarizes the main event, which is the confrontation between the main character and Jehovah's Witnesses, and highlights the deeper ethical issues involved, such as the tensions between personal privacy and the beliefs of others.

In this case, the person might be tired of the situation or the conversation itself. For example, it is possible that Danielle has spent considerable time or effort trying to get in touch with Robb, making her feel physically or mentally tired. [ii] Sad: Sadness is an emotion usually experienced when something doesn't go according to one's expectations or when one experiences loss. In this context, if Danielle is sad, it may be due to a previous disagreement or unresolved problem between her and Robb. This unresolved issue could have left Danielle feeling emotionally vulnerable and sad at the time of the phone conversation. [iii] Hopeful: Hopeful is an emotion characterized by a sense of expectation and desire for a particular thing to happen. It typically carries a positive connotation. In the case of Danielle, she might feel hopeful if she has reached out to Robb in order to resolve any previous issues or disagreements. Danielle could be feeling hopeful that their conversation will go well and that they will be able to resolve any conflicts between them. [iv] None of the above choices: Lastly, it is also entirely possible that the person in question is not experiencing any of the aforementioned emotions. Instead, they could be calm, content, or indifferent during the conversation. For example, Danielle might simply be calling Robb to catch up and have a casual, friendly conversation.

Serie A, Inter 5-0 Parma; Impressive Inter continues winning ways - Serie A News Updated Jan 7, 2012 6:45 PM ET Inter Milan began 2012 with a bang as they thrashed Parma 5-0 in their Serie A clash at the Stadio San Siro. Diego Milito scored twice and Thiago Motta was also on target as Inter laid the foundations for victory with one of their best halves of the season. Giampaolo Pazzini and Marco Faraoni struck after the break to seal an impressive win which sends the Nerazzurri to within three points of the top three ahead of Sunday's remaining fixtures. Milito was the hosts' main threat in the penalty area, but the architect of the performance was Ricardo Alvarez. From the moment he dragged the ball past a defender with the studs of his boot with his first touch he appeared to have a new air of confidence about him, and it did not take long for him to create the opening goal. His perfect cross to the near post was guided home with the outside of his right boot by Milito. In the 18th minute, Milito's shot was blocked and the ball fell out to Motta, whose volley from 20 yards flew past Antonio Mirante to make it 2-0. Sebastian Giovinco was Parma's only threat and his header wide in the 20th minute was followed by two trademark free-kicks which Julio Cesar had to be alert to keep out. Inter's third came in the 41st minute with Maicon lifting the ball into the area for Milito to head in unchallenged from eight yards for his sixth goal of the season. There was no let-up from Inter in the second half and Pazzini made it four 10 minutes in when he latched on to Milito's pass, despite a hint of offside, and lifted the ball over the onrushing Mirante. It was clearly not Parma's night as they had a goal disallowed when Javier Zanetti put through his own net, but the offside flag was raised against the nearest Parma striker. Five minutes later, Inter substitute Faraoni sealed the win with a dipping shot from 20 yards out which grazed the underside of the crossbar on its way in. Alvarez and Milito both left the field as boss Claudio Ranieri withdrew the pair in the final 10 minutes, affording them a standing ovation, as Inter got their title challenge back on track. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Inter Milan crushed Parma 5-0 in their Serie A clash at the Stadio San Siro, with Diego Milito scoring twice alongside goals from Thiago Motta, Giampaolo Pazzini, and Marco Faraoni.

The band primarily consisted of vocalist Chrissy Amphlett and guitarist Mark McEntee. Amphlett garnered widespread attention for performing on stage in a school uniform and fishnet stockings, and often used an illuminated neon tube as a prop for displaying aggression towards both band members and the audience. Originally a five-piece, the band underwent numerous line-up changes, with Amphlett and McEntee remaining as core members, before its dissolution in 1996. Divinyls released five studio albums--four placed in the Top 10 Australian chart, while one (Divinyls) reached No. 15 in the United States (US) and No. 33 for 3 weeks in Canada. Their biggest-selling single \\"I Touch Myself\\" (1990) achieved a No. 1 ranking in Australia, No. 4 in the US, No. 10 in the United Kingdom (UK), and No. 13 in Canada. Amphlett was the cousin of 1960s Australian pop icon Patricia \\"Little Pattie\\" Amphlett, who had been married to Keith Jacobsen--younger brother of pioneer rocker Col Joye and leading promoter Kevin Jacobsen. In her autobiography Pleasure and Pain (2005), Amphlett described breaking into the music scene from the age of fourteen, being arrested for busking when seventeen and travelling in Spain, and how her performances drew upon childhood pain. Amphlett and guitarist Mark McEntee were introduced by Jeremy Paul (ex-Air Supply) in the car park of a small music venue in Collaroy, Sydney, after Amphlett and Paul had finished a gig with their then band, Batonrouge. Amphlett and McEntee met again at the Sydney Opera House where Amphlett and Paul were singing in a choral concert in 1980. They recruited keyboardist Bjarne Ohlin later in 1980 and drummer Richard Harvey in 1981, respectively, and for almost two years they performed in pubs and clubs in Sydney's Kings Cross. During this time, Paul negotiated publishing and recording agreements that led to the band signing with WEA. Australian film director Ken Cameron saw Divinyls performing in a club. This led to them providing the soundtrack for his 1982 film Monkey Grip and also gave Amphlett, Paul and McEntee supporting roles in the movie. The group released two singles from the soundtrack, Music from Monkey Grip EP, \\"Boys in Town\\", which reached No. 8 on the national singles chart, and \\"Only Lonely\\". The band was the opening act at the 1983 US Festival. After the band's initial success, original manager and bassist Jeremy Paul left. He was replaced on bass, briefly by Ken Firth (ex-The Ferrets) and more permanently by Rick Grossman (ex-Matt Finish). Grossman left in 1987 to replace Clyde Bramley in Hoodoo Gurus. By early 1988, Divinyls consisted of Amphlett and McEntee with augmentation by additional musicians when recording or touring. Over the decade Divinyls released four albums, Music from Monkey Grip EP on WEA in 1982, Desperate on Chrysalis Records in 1983, What a Life! in 1985 and Temperamental in 1988. The latter two albums were also released by Chrysalis in the US. They had hit singles in Australia with, \\"Science Fiction\\" No. 13 in 1983, \\"Good Die Young\\" No. 32 in 1984 and \\"Pleasure and Pain\\" which was written by Holly Knight and Mike Chapman (The Best, Love Is A Battlefield) and went No. 1 in 1985. Their later manager Vince Lovegrove organised Divinyls' transfer from WEA to Chrysalis and their first tours of United States. They established a fan base there, without achieving major commercial success. Divinyls also had Australian hits with cover versions of The Easybeats' \\"I'll Make You Happy\\", and Syndicate of Sound's \\"Hey Little Boy\\" (\\"Hey Little Girl\\" with the gender switched) which reached No. 25 in 1988.

Title: Looks like a great little faucet, but doesn't fit my sink Review: This review is for Amazon's listing not for the faucet since I couldn't really use it.I just bought a house with an old 1950's era sink in one bathroom: it's a great sink, but the chrome faucet & handles are horribly pitted & corroded, so I wanted to replace them. I found what I thought was perfect for my classic sink: this Kohler cross-handled faucet. The price is also very good: much less than the hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars needed to buy wall mounted designer faucets.But, the description doesn't list the width of the faucet stems: they are only 5.5 inches apart. This 5.5 in. center is far less than the 8 inch center i need.Faucet looks great, but I can't use it so, I'm sending it back.Alicia Is this product review negative? Answer:","completion":"Yes, this product review is negative. Although Alicia, the reviewer, mentions some positive attributes of the Kohler cross-handled faucet, like its good looks and reasonable price compared to similar designer faucets, the overall tone and conclusion of the review is negative. The primary reason for this negative review is that the faucet does not fit Alicia's 1950's era sink due to the faucet stems being only 5.5 inches apart in width, which is significantly less than the 8 inches required for her sink. This information, according to Alicia, was not adequately provided in the product's description on Amazon, which resulted in her purchasing a product that was unsuitable for her needs. Moreover, because the faucet does not fit her sink, Alicia cannot utilize it for its intended purpose which is definitely a significant drawback. In fact, it nullifies the positive characteristics she pointed out earlier in the review since she cannot benefit from them due to the fitting issue. This inconvenience has also compelled her to return the product, which further adds to her negative experience. Thus, despite some positive points about the aesthetic appeal and cost of the faucet, the crux of the review centers around a negative experience - the inability of the product to be used as intended due to the design of the faucet stems. Hence, yes, this product review is indeed negative."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

In flashback, David is shown to be the wealthy owner of a large publishing firm in New York City which he inherited from his father, leaving its regular duties to his father's trusted associates. As David enjoys the bachelor lifestyle, he is introduced to Sofia Serrano (PenÃ©lope Cruz) by his best friend, author Brian Shelby (Jason Lee) at a party. David and Sofia spend a night together talking and fall in love. When David's former lover, Julianna \\"Julie\\" Gianni (Cameron Diaz), hears of Sofia, she attempts to kill herself and David in a car crash. Julie dies but David survives, his face grotesquely disfigured,[4] leading him to wear a mask to hide the injuries. With no hope to use plastic surgery to repair the damage, David cannot come to grips with the idea of wearing the mask for the rest of his life. On a night out with Sofia and Brian, David gets hopelessly drunk and Sofia and Brian leave David to wallow in the street outside. David is awakened the next day in the street by Sofia, who apologises for deserting him the night before, and takes him home. The two continue to see each other, and David has his face surgically repaired despite being told it was impossible before. Though his life seems perfectly content, David finds oddities, such as brief visions of his distorted face, and a man (Noah Taylor) at a bar that tells him David can control the world and everyone in it, if he wanted to. One day, when he goes to Sofia's apartment, he finds Julie there instead; all of the previous mementos of Sofia now show Julie's face. Angry and confused, David suffocates Julie, and is later arrested and placed in a mental institution, finding his face has reverted to its previously disfigured state.

In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization. and the situation: Two neighboring ponds were stocked with adult fish last year.

A number of plates in this group reveal a scepticism towards idolatry of religious images. There are instances in the group where early Christian iconography, in particular statues and processional images, are mocked and denigrated. Plate 67, Esta no lo es menos (This is no less curious), shows two statues carried by two stooped members of clergy. One statue is recognisable as the \\"Virgin of Solitude\\". In Goya's image, the statue is not carried vertically in processional triumph, rather it lies flat and undignified on the backs of the two almost crouched men. Shown horizontal, the object loses its aura, and becomes a mere everyday object. Art critics Victor Stoichita and Anna Maria Coderch wrote, \\"It is in effect a deposed, toppled image, stripped of its powers and its connotations.\\" Goya is making a general statement: that the Church's attempts to support and restore the Bourbons were \\"illusory, since what they proposed was nothing more than the adoration of an empty form\\".The published edition of The Disasters of War ends as it begins; with the portrayal of a single, agonized figure.

Article: Duck, you suckers – this darkly comic bonfire of a movie shoots off dangerous sparks that can burn and leave marks. A livewire Frances McDormand will blow you away as Mildred Hayes, a divorced woman who's mad as hell at the police in her town of Ebbing, Missouri. So mad, in fact, that she rents three billboards at 5000 per month to embarrass the local cops who haven't found the killer who raped and incinerated her teen daughter seven months before – since, according to Mildred, cops are \\"too busy torturing black folks.\\" Related 10 Best Movies We Saw at 2017 Toronto Film Festival From Louis C.K.'s cringe-comedy to a female coming-of-age movie, a tennis-coach doc to 'The Disaster Artist' – our picks for the best of the fest Sheriff Willoughby (a soulful, exasperated Woody Harrelson) doesn’t like being publicly mocked by billboards that read: \\"Still No Arrests?\\" \\"How Come, Chief Willoughby?\\" and \\"Raped While Dying.\\" It's Willoughby’s racist, hot-tempered, pea-brained, momma's-boy deputy Dixon (Sam Rockwell), however, who's practically pissing himself from rage. Rockwell, who makes Dixon horrendous and humane sometimes both in a same breath, is just tremendous – so crazy good and volcanically funny that you want to spontaneously applaud whenever he shows up. Explosively written and directed by Irish playwright Martin McDonagh (his first two films were In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths), the film is a launching pad for the combustible force of nature that is McDormand. She batters and cusses her way through the role, digging into McDonagh's ripe, raunchy language like the verbal feast it is. To a hapless TV news reporter who claims the case is closed, Mildred retorts: \\"This is just getting started – why don't you put that on your Good Morning, fucking Missouri fucking wakeup broadcast, bitch.” (This needs to become a meme ASAP.) In a dynamite portrayal to rank with her Oscar-winning Fargo, her Tony-lauded Good People and her Emmy-crowned Olive Kitteridge, McDormand should be adding more gold to her impressive collection. She's phenomenal, though all of the performances are first-rate – including Lucas Hedges as Mildred’s son, John Hawkes as her abusive ex-husband and Peter Dinklage as a local who takes Mildred on a date (God help him). By turns hellaciously hilarious and deeply sorrowful, the film hits you where it hurts, at the nexus of helplessness and fury where a lot of citizens of Trump's America find themselves these days. A blunt-force artist with the soul of a poet, McDonagh is not afraid of adding salt to an open wound; more importantly, he offers no easy answers, outside a hint of forgiveness. Thanks to him and his firebrand star, Three Billboards is more is a no-brainer awards contender – it's a renegade masterpiece that will get you good. ||||| But while that is a rage that's exhilarating to witness, it's a rage that's not available to everyone. Just as not everyone in Ebbing can claim the protection of being considering \\"good,\\" we still don't live in a world where everyone gets to be angry. ||||| 3 out of 4 stars Title Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri Written by Martin McDonagh Directed by Martin McDonagh Starring Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell Genre Drama Classification 14A Country U.K./U.S. Language English Year 2017 Midway through Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, a fawn appears, Bambi-like, in a clearing. The grieving Mildred Hayes, the film's protagonist, almost shakes her head in disbelief: Could this delicate but persistent creature be the spirit of her murdered teenage daughter? No, of course not. \\"You're pretty, but you ain't her,\\" she tells the little deer, squelching the symbolic apparition just as it materializes. Three Billboards is a movie full of such reversals; venturing into the American heartland, the British writer and director Martin McDonagh has created a comic tragedy that ducks and feints, defying expectations with many admirable and some less convincing results. Infuriated that local authorities can't find her daughter's rapist and killer, Mildred (Frances McDormand) erects the three billboards of the title. In black letters on a blood-red ground two storeys high, they call out Ebbing police chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) and demand to know why, after seven months, there have been no arrests. Story continues below advertisement This unmediated accusation sets the small community and its police force against Mildred, but Ebbing's hilariously inept coppers are no match for a mother's righteous anger. The decent Willoughby (another finely crafted portrait of sympathetic masculinity from Harrelson) tries to pacify her and rein in the most vicious of his officers, the explosively racist Dixon, played by Sam Rockwell in full psychopath mode. McDonagh, however, dispenses with Willoughby halfway through the film – that's perhaps the boldest reversal in his script and its execution is a doozy – but then, rather limply, relies on letters from the police chief to mould the action. That action becomes increasingly violent: It is not merely because the protagonist is played by the powerful McDormand, best remembered as the pregnant Marge in Fargo, that the film recalls the heights of the Coen brothers' black comedies. McDonagh, previously recognized for the comic crime drama In Bruges, reaches for that same kind of black and bloody mix where the audience has no choice but to laugh at the savagery. In the finest moment of a delightfully over-the-top performance, Rockwell's Dixon pushes a law-abiding citizen out a window and off a roof. Often such scenes make the film viciously funny and pointedly poignant; Three Billboards satirizes police brutality and prejudice to great effect while gradually exposing the danger in Mildred's well-earned but corrosive rage. Occasionally, however, the emotional plausibility in all this mayhem goes missing, as Mildred's violent ex-husband (John Hawkes) attacks her again – in broad daylight with his nice new girlfriend nearby – or as Mildred herself takes her campaign against the police one step too far. And finally, McDonagh's attempts to craft some kind of redemptive U-turn for Dixon fall flat. If the film fails to solve Dixon's emotional puzzle, another one that remains troubling is Mildred's relationship with her teenage son, Robbie (Lucas Hedges), the only remnant of her family and link to her motherhood, yet apparently an afterthought in her crazed planning. McDormand can't quite seem to fit Hedges' character into her otherwise viscerally moving performance. Perhaps the trouble is that the confident young Hedges (Manchester by the Sea) is playing too bourgeois a figure for the gritty setting of a film in which McDonagh has not entirely resolved American issues of class and race. On shifting ground, it is McDormand's fine performance that holds steady here, her wit and her fury eliciting more admiration than pity for the unrelenting Mildred. McDonagh does not always conquer this heartland, but McDormand already owns it. ||||| Because nothing is out of bounds where McDonogh's work is concerned, there are moments, as its characters wrestle with anger and the consequences of anguish, when you may fear we'll be left with no one to side with, but a director this smart has got that covered as well. Just not in the way you have in mind. ||||| Published on Mar 23, 2017 Now On Digital: http://bit.ly/ThreeBillboardsDigitial Now On Blu-ray & DVD: http://bit.ly/Get3Billboards THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI is a darkly comedic drama from Academy Award® winner Martin McDonagh (IN BRUGES).

Fox Searchlight Frances McDormand stars as a grieving mother who's had enough with police incompetence in the dark comedy \\"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.\\" (Photo: Merrick Morton) They say hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, but Mildred Hayes would put the fear of God in the devil himself. Wielding righteous anger, fiery emotion, biting humor and an ornery manner right out of a Clint Eastwood Western, Frances McDormand unleashes 2017’s most indelible movie mom in the darkly comic crime drama Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (**** out of four; rated R; in theaters Friday in New York and Los Angeles, expands to additional cities throughout November, goes nationwide Dec. 1). Writer/director Martin McDonagh (In Bruges) crafts an expertly structured, brutal, yet surprisingly rousing narrative around a woman who’s ready to torch her entire life if it means catching a killer. Several months after her teenage daughter is raped and burned to death by an unknown assailant, Mildred has had it with the small-town cops bumbling the case and rents space on three rickety billboards at the murder site that haven’t been used in years. In black letters with a red background and no subtlety whatsoever, the grieving mother calls out the chief of police, Bill Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), as the scapegoat for his officers’ haplessness.

More confrontational is Mildred’s dynamic with Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell), a mama’s boy with a screw loose who’s best known for torturing black prisoners, and her volatile ex-husband (John Hawkes). There are even complicated feelings between Mildred and those closest to her, including her son Robbie (Lucas Hedges) and loyal pal James (Peter Dinklage). Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell) and Mildred (Frances McDormand) clash in 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.' (Photo: Merrick Morton) Mildred’s madder than hell and she’s not taking it anymore, and McDormand infuses her with such pain and presence that, even though she’s not that likable, her wounded mother is a wonderfully primal sight to behold. Everyone from her dentist to the reporters who cover the over-the-top billboards incurs her wrath, and when a priest shows up at her house to urge her to turn the other cheek, Mildred launches a nuclear rebuke comparing the church to the Crips and Bloods. Among a standout cast across the board, McDormand's and Rockwell’s performances give Three Billboards most of its emotional weight — and two instant Oscar contenders, especially McDormand, who should follow up her Fargo win two decades later with this showpiece. Both of their characters have exquisite arcs that test their beliefs and each come out the other side changed people. More: Hey, Academy voters!

But it remains a satisfying narrative throughout, blending black humor and menace, and fostering a pervading sense of hope amid a relentless story of revenge.

The scalpel was used to cut the incision instead of the razor, because the","completion":"scalpel provides better precision and control, minimizing tissue damage and ensuring a smoother healing process for the patient. In surgical procedures, the choice of instruments is crucial to ensure the success of the intervention and reduce the risk of complications. Although razors might seem like a viable option, as they are often used in shaving or other cutting tasks, they lack the specific characteristics that make scalpels more suitable for surgical incisions. Firstly, scalpels are designed with precision in mind. They are characterized by their sharp, thin, and pointed blades, specifically engineered to create clean and accurate cuts with minimal tissue damage. This sharpness allows surgeons to exert less force when cutting, reducing the risk of unwanted tissue damage. On the other hand, razors are typically broader, and while they are sharp, they are not as finely honed as scalpels. This lack of precision can result in unnecessary tissue trauma, which can lead to increased bleeding, inflammation, and slower healing times. Moreover, razors are more likely to pull on the tissue rather than slicing through it, which can be painful for the patient and may result in an uneven or jagged incision. Secondly, the design of the scalpel handle allows for better control and maneuverability during surgery. Handles are typically metal or plastic and are shaped to comfortably fit in the hand of the surgeon. They're often ribbed or textured, which provides a secure grip, ensuring that the blade doesn't slip out of the surgeon's hand. This level of control is crucial during delicate procedures, where even the slightest error can lead to serious complications or unwanted side effects. In contrast, razor handles are often designed for a completely different purpose - shaving. As such, they may not offer the same level of grip security and control required for surgical contexts. Furthermore, razors are generally designed for single-handed use, whereas many surgical procedures require the use of both hands on the instrument for increased precision and stability. Another critical factor influencing the choice of scalpel over razor is sterility. In surgical environments, maintaining a sterile field is essential to prevent infection. Scalpels are specifically designed for use in these environments, with single-use, disposable blades that can be easily mounted onto reusable handles. The blades are typically packaged in a sterile manner, making them suitable for use in an operating room. Razors, however, are not expressly designed for maintaining surgical sterility. While disposable razors could be theoretically used in a surgical setting, they're not packaged with the same level of sterility as scalpels. Furthermore, their construction may not allow them to be adequately cleaned and sterilized between procedures, posing a high risk of cross-contamination and infection. Lastly, surgeons undergo extensive training to master the use of scalpels and other surgical tools. This expertise allows them to skillfully execute various techniques that ensure accurate, efficient, and safe incisions. Replacing a scalpel with a razor could compromise patient safety, as the surgeon may not be familiar with its performance and limitations. In conclusion, the scalpel was used to cut the incision instead of the razor because of its superior precision, better control, sterile design, and compatibility with established surgical techniques. This choice ultimately supports the patient's well-being by minimizing tissue damage and ensuring a smoother, safer, and quicker healing process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Build a movie plot around this: What did the opposition hope would happen between the colonies and England? ends in a tie Answer:","completion":"Title: The Colonies' Tie Genre: Historical Drama-Action Setting: Late 18th Century, Colonies and England Main Characters: 1. Thomas Reed - A colonial (American) spy working secretly for the opposition 2. Lady Margaret - A tempestuous British noblewoman who supports the colonies 3. Sir James Hunt - A cunning British general who wants to subdue the colonies 4. Elizabeth Marks - A colonial merchant and Thomas Reed's love interest 5. Paul Fletcher - A wise British diplomat hoping for peace between Colonies and England Plot: The story opens in a colonial town, where the opposition (a group of colonial and British supporters, secretly working to foment conflict between the colonies and England) is planning to upend ongoing peace negotiations. Thomas Reed, an intelligence agent pretending to be a horse trader from the colonies, infiltrates the group and discovers that they believe a tie in the ongoing conflict between England and the colonies would greatly benefit them. In England, we meet Lady Margaret, a high-ranking British noblewoman. Despite her privileged upbringing, she supports the cause of the colonies. With the aid of her intelligence and charm, she tries to persuade her peers in the British high society to support the colonies, carefully concealing her own sympathy for them. Thomas Reed sets off to England, where he meets Elizabeth Marks, a sharp businesswoman and merchant from the colonies. They are to work together in secret to gather intel on the opposition's plans and identify potential allies in Britain. Their paths cross with Lady Margaret, who learns of their mission and provides them with valuable information on the opposition's hidden motives. Simultaneously, Sir James Hunt, a cunning British general, believes that brutally subduing the colonies is crucial to maintain British dominance on the world stage. His numerous victories on the battlefield have earned him a loyal following. He despises any notion of negotiations with the colonies, seeing the opposition's plan as the perfect strategy behind which to rally his forces. As Thomas, Elizabeth, and Lady Margaret work together to gather information on the opposition, they are met with numerous challenges, escalating conflicts, and thrilling high-stakes espionage. Their efforts unveil a plot by the opposition to engineer a tie in the battle between the colonies and England, forcing negotiations to stall and enabling them to manipulate the outcome to their advantage. Paul Fletcher, a respected diplomat and a key figure in the peace negotiations between England and the colonies, discovers the machinations of the opposition and reaches out to Thomas, Elizabeth, and Lady Margaret. Recognizing the importance of his role, he joins forces with them to expose the opposition and prevent the plot from materializing. Despite setbacks and betrayals from unexpected sources, our protagonists ultimately succeed in uncovering the opposition's plans and putting an end to their nefarious scheme. The truth comes out, revealing Sir James Hunt's central role in the conspiracy, and he is arrested for treason. The battle ends in a tie, but with newfound understanding and a commitment to peace. In a thrilling conclusion, the peace negotiations between England and the colonies resume, and the political intrigue and unrest that fueled the opposition's plot are replaced by hope for a new era of cooperation and understanding between the once-warring parties. The movie ends with Thomas standing at the docks with Elizabeth, deciding to leave his life as a spy behind and settle down with Elizabeth in her hometown. As they sail towards their new life, they remain hopeful for the Colonies and England's prospects and unaware of the eventual independence that would come to the Colonies."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After the second World Trade Center crash, Boston Center managers recognized that both aircraft were transcontinental 767 jetliners that had departed Logan Airport. Remembering the \\"we have some planes\\" remark, Boston Center guessed that Delta 1989 might also be hijacked. Boston Center called NEADS at 9:41 and identified Delta 1989, a 767 jet that had left Logan Airport for Las Vegas, as a possible hijack. NEADS warned the FAA's Cleveland Center to watch Delta 1989. The Command Center and FAA headquarters watched it too. During the course of the morning, there were multiple erroneous reports of hijacked aircraft. The report of American 11 heading south was the first; Delta 1989 was the second. NEADS never lost track of Delta 1989, and even ordered fighter aircraft from Ohio and Michigan to intercept it. The flight never turned off its transponder. NEADS soon learned that the aircraft was not hijacked, and tracked Delta 1989 as it reversed course over Toledo, headed east, and landed in Cleveland.

Translate to German","completion":"Ein ehrgeiziges Ziel wird zweifellos auch den globalen Kohlenstoffmarkt stärken. Dieser muss bestehen bleiben, um die Kosten, die durch Emissionsreduktionen entstehen, zu begrenzen. Ein ehrgeiziges Ziel, wie es hier beschrieben wird, bezieht sich auf eine Verringerung der Treibhausgasemissionen, um den durch menschliche Aktivitäten verursachten Klimawandel einzudämmen. Ein solches Ziel kann durch die Festlegung von Obergrenzen für Emissionen, wirtschaftliche Anreize oder andere politische Maßnahmen erreicht werden. Ein starker globaler Kohlenstoffmarkt ist entscheidend, um die Kosten, die mit solchen Reduktionen einhergehen, zu bewältigen. Der globale Kohlenstoffmarkt ist ein Mechanismus, der Unternehmen und Ländern ermöglicht, Emissionsrechte voneinander zu kaufen und zu verkaufen. Dieses System beruht auf dem Prinzip, dass die gesamten Emissionen auf globaler Ebene reduziert werden, indem denjenigen, die sie verringern können, finanzielle Anreize geboten werden. Ein ehrgeiziges Ziel sorgt dafür, dass die Beteiligten stärker in Technologien und Strategien investieren, die ihre Emissionen reduzieren. Dadurch erhöht sich die Nachfrage nach Emissionsrechten, was wiederum deren Preis steigen lässt. Mit dem Anstieg des Preises für Emissionsrechte steigt auch der Anreiz für Investitionen in kohlenstoffarme Technologien und Innovationen. Der globale Kohlenstoffmarkt spielt eine wichtige Rolle für die weltweite Senkung der Treibhausgasemissionen, da er kosteneffiziente Lösungen zur Verringerung der Emissionen bietet. Länder und Unternehmen, die ihre Emissionen erfolgreich reduzieren, können die erzielten Einsparungen handeln, was ihnen zusätzliche Finanzmittel für weitere CO2-Reduktionsmaßnahmen zur Verfügung stellt. Um das globale Ziel zur Emissionsreduktion effektiv und nachhaltig zu erreichen, muss der Kohlenstoffmarkt weiterhin bestehen bleiben und gestärkt werden. Dies erfordert eine internationale Zusammenarbeit sowie die Bereitschaft, ehrgeizige Zielvorgaben zu verfolgen, um die durch den Klimawandel verursachten Kosten und Schäden einzudämmen. Das System muss jedoch auch dafür sorgen, dass die am besten geeigneten Technologien und Methoden zum Einsatz kommen, um die Emissionen tatsächlich zu reduzieren. Insgesamt zeigt sich, dass ein ehrgeiziges Ziel zur Reduktion von Treibhausgasemissionen den globalen Kohlenstoffmarkt stärkt und somit dafür sorgt, dass die Kosten im Zusammenhang mit Emissionsreduktionen begrenzt werden. Es ist wichtig, gemeinsam an einer wirkungsvollen Strategie zur Bekämpfung des Klimawandels zu arbeiten, die sowohl auf nationaler als auch auf globaler Ebene effektive Lösungen bietet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: The bells of York Minster were silent on Christmas Day for what is thought to be the first time in more than 600 years. Article:","completion":"Title: A Silent Christmas: The Bells of York Minster Fall Silent for the First Time in Over Six Centuries Summary: The bells of York Minster, a historic cathedral located in York, England, did not ring on Christmas Day for what is believed to be the first time in over 600 years. This unusually quiet Christmas has left many residents and tourists with mixed emotions, as the bells have long been the symbol of the yuletide season in the city. Introduction: Christmas Day is a time for joyous celebrations, festive cheer, and time-honored traditions, but in the ancient city York, England, a centuries-long annual tradition was sadly broken this year. The bells of the iconic York Minster, a centerpiece of the city's landscape and heritage, remained silent throughout the day, marking what experts believe to be the first such occurrence in over 600 years. Background of York Minster: The history of York Minster dates back to the 7th century, and it has seen numerous iterations and enlargements over the following centuries. As the mother church for the Province of York and the largest Gothic cathedral in Northern Europe, York Minster is not just an architectural masterpiece; it holds immense significance in the religious, cultural, and historical life in the region. York Minster is home to what are believed to be the finest cathedral bells in England. The 56-bell carillon, which includes 35 change-ringing bells and 21 additional ringable chime bells, has been the pride of the city and has played a central role in the local Christmas celebrations. Residents and visitors alike look forward to hearing the joyous peals that typically fill the air on Christmas morning. Reasons for the Silence: Though there has been no official statement explaining the unexpected stillness of the bells on this particular Christmas Day, some speculate that it may be due to ongoing maintenance work or a variety of logistical issues. Others have suggested it might be related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to affect many aspects of public life, including religious services and gatherings. In an effort to maintain social distancing and limit the spread of the virus, modifications to traditional services and events have been made across the globe. Therefore, the silence of York Minster's bells may well be another consequence of the pandemic. Reactions and Emotional Significance: For many in York and its nearby areas, the absence of the bells' customary peal weighed heavy on their hearts. As a long-standing tradition that marks the beginning of the Christmas Day festivities, the ringing of the Minster bells evokes a sense of warmth, unity, and nostalgia; their silence this year seemingly symbolizes the interruption of countless cherished traditions worldwide. Of course, there are those who view the quiet Christmas morning from a different perspective, embracing the silence and seeing it as an opportunity to celebrate the season and one another in quieter, more contemplative ways. It's a reminder for some of the true spirit of Christmas, beyond the festive extravagance and the noise. Conclusion: The silence of the York Minster bells this Christmas Day has provided both a note of sadness and a reminder of the resilience and adaptability of the human spirit in these unprecedented times. Perhaps this unusual event will enable us to reevaluate and reemphasize the essence of what Christmas truly stands for in our hearts. Ultimately, whether enjoyed in the company of friends and family or in quiet solitude, Christmas remains a time for hope, love, and unity—and the proud Minster bells will surely ring across York again in the future."},{"prompt":"Information: - Biffy Clyro are a Scottish rock band that formed in Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire, composed of Simon Neil (guitar, lead vocals), James Johnston (bass, vocals) and Ben Johnston (drums, vocals).

Write an article based on this summary: Notice whether she shows open appreciation for women. Recognize that it’s possible she’s attracted to women but doesn’t realize she’s bisexual. Determine whether she is going out of her way to be around another woman. Figure out her relationship status.","completion":"Title: Understanding Bisexuality: Clues for Recognizing Signs in Women Introduction Bisexuality is the attraction to both men and women. In today's increasingly diverse society, it is important to understand and accept people's varying sexual preferences. However, some people may not be fully aware of their bisexuality, making it difficult for them to acknowledge and embrace it. This article will discuss how to recognize signs of bisexuality in women, helping friends and loved ones provide the necessary support and understanding. Step 1: Notice her appreciation for women One of the initial signs to consider when trying to determine someone's bisexuality is their open appreciation for women. This includes not just admiration for a woman's appearance or style, but also her intellect, personality, and talents. Pay attention to her compliments, remarks, or attention towards other women and whether these gestures show genuine appreciation. Step 2: Consider the possibility she may not realize her attraction It is essential to remember that not everyone is aware of their own sexuality. Some women might be attracted to both genders but may not recognize their bisexuality. In these cases, they may need time to explore and understand their feelings. Friends and loved ones should be supportive and non-judgmental, helping to create a safe environment for self-exploration. Step 3: Observe her interactions with other women Another indication of bisexuality is the desire to be in close proximity with another woman. Notice if she spends more time with women than men or if she goes out of her way to be around a particular woman. These actions may suggest an attraction that goes deeper than just friendship. However, keep in mind that this is not a definitive sign, as people have different preferences when it comes to social interactions. Step 4: Determine her relationship status In addition to observing her interactions and appreciations, it's helpful to know her relationship status. A woman who has dated both men and women in the past or who is open to the idea of dating both genders may be more likely to identify as bisexual. However, bear in mind that her relationship history is not a guaranteed indicator of her bisexuality, as people's preferences and identities may evolve over time. Conclusion Recognizing bisexuality in women can be a complex process since sexuality is a deeply personal and diverse aspect of human experience. Paying attention to her appreciation for women, considering the possibility that she might not be aware of her attraction, observing her interactions with other women, and determining her relationship status are crucial steps in this process. Remember, it's essential to provide a supportive, understanding, and non-judgmental environment fueled by empathy and open-mindedness. This allows individuals to safely explore and embrace their bisexuality, ultimately contributing to an inclusive and accepting society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Sit down and take a handful of deep breaths. Focus in on how the air flows through your body and how you exhale. Do you naturally inhale with your mouth? Do you automatically exhale through your nose? As you head toward a nose-centered breathing technique this will help you to identify your strengths and weaknesses. The goal is to maintain a continual, uninterrupted air supply while playing the didgeridoo. You will pull air in with your nose while simultaneously pushing air out through your mouth into the didj mouthpiece. You will also continue to drone throughout this process. With circular breathing you consider the air that you breath in and the air in your mouth as two different entities. They should both feel as if they are never empty and consistently in motion. Establishing a rhythm is important here. One of the keys is to resist blowing the air out of your mouth. That will empty your lungs and stop the drone. Instead, slowly push the air out of your mouth mimicking the same motion as you would when spitting out water. Before you are ready to hit the didj, you need to practice. Get a straw and a glass of water. Place the straw in the water and put your lips the tip of the straw. Inhale through your nose while blowing bubbles in the water. Try to keep the bubbles constant as they represent the constancy of your drone. Repeat this multiple times a day until it becomes easy. Another way to practice is to drink and hold water in your mouth until your cheeks puff out. Then, slowly spit the water out of your mouth. Inhale through your nose as you do this. Your tongue should keep you from gagging or swallowing the water. It is easy to practice this one in the shower. Without the didj, simulate your breathing movements. Breath in until your cheeks are full. Keep inhaling through your nose as you push the air out of your mouth. Be controlled in these movements. Apply your circular breathing techniques when playing the didgeridoo. Keep up the inhale/push out rhythm while maintaining your drone. Avoid incorporating any extra sounds until you have a good handle on the breathing. If your breath is holding steady, the didj will sound steady and full of air as well. You should not expect to master circular breathing right away. It is generally one of the more frustrating parts of learning to play the didgeridoo. Keep working on your breathing but recognize that you can still play the didj without holding long notes. Inhale in a controlled manner until your lungs feel full. Hold this air in for one second before exhaling slowing until your lungs feel totally drained. Pause for a second and repeat. Do this exercise for 10-15 minutes every day and you will see results. You can also improve your lung capacity by avoiding smoking and regularly exercising.

The premise states that \\"Napoleon named it Fort-de-France and that name was taken over for the town.\\" From this information, we can understand that Napoleon is the one who bestowed the name \\"Fort-de-France\\" upon the location in question, which was then adopted for the town. This directly supports the hypothesis that Fort-de-France was named by Napoleon. As a historical background, Fort-de-France is the capital city of Martinique, which is an overseas region of France in the Caribbean. Although it was formerly known as Fort-Royal under French colonial rule in the 17th and 18th centuries, it was renamed Fort-de-France by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1800. This name change reflected the desire to enhance the strategic importance of Martinique and its capital in the French Empire while also aligning the town's name with the revolutionary spirit of the era.

Patri Friedman is planning to do just that. He left Google years ago to set up the Seasteading Institute. And his dream is to build seasteads-----floating micro-nations in the middle of the ocean. So, what will life on a seastead be like? Probably a bit like life on a cruise liner , but much larger, with shops, gyms, swimming pools, schools and other areas. In fact, the early seasteads may actually be specially-rebuilt cruise liners. But as science advances, Friedman believes they'll become more like floating cities, with several hundred people. Seasteading raises a lot of questions. First of all, how will the new countries make money? The Seasteading Institute has suggested several money-making ideas, including ocean-based theme parks, casinos and fish farming. There's also the questions of safety. With storms, typhoons and pirates , the high seas are a dangerous place. However, the Institute says that it can stand bad weather and prevent crimes with its well-designed systems. So, is this just a day dream? Well, maybe not. One of the people behind the project is Peter Thiel. He founded PayPal and was one of the first investors in Facebook. So far, he's donated 500,000 to the project. And Friedman isn't wasting any time. He recently announced the creation of the Poseidon Award. This will be given to the first seastead with fifty people.

If you have large spaces between your teeth, pick an extra thick floss. Some options include dental tape or super dental floss.","completion":"These types of floss are specially designed to clean wider spaces effectively, ensuring that you can easily remove plaque and food particles that might get trapped between those large gaps. On the other hand, if your teeth are closely spaced or you have tight contacts, opt for a thinner floss. You may want to try waxed, PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) floss, or even dental floss picks, which can glide smoothly between tight spaces without shredding or getting stuck. These thinner flosses can help you access hard-to-reach areas without causing discomfort or damaging your gums. Moreover, it is essential to consider the material and texture of the dental floss. It comes in a variety of materials such as nylon, PTFE, Gore-Tex, and silk. Nylon floss is widely available and affordable, but it may shred or fray when used in tight spaces. PTFE flosses are more resistant to shredding; however, they may also be more expensive. If you're looking for a natural and eco-friendly option, you can try biodegradable silk floss. Additionally, dental floss also comes in textured varieties, such as fluffy, woven, or tufted, which can help remove plaque more effectively but may be more challenging to use in tight spaces. Another factor you should consider is whether to use waxed or unwaxed dental floss. Waxed floss has a coating of wax, making it smoother and easier to slide between tight spaces. Unwaxed floss, while slightly rougher, can still be effective in removing plaque and debris. At the end of the day, choosing between waxed and unwaxed floss will come down to personal preference. To aid in using dental floss, there are several flossing tools available, including floss holders, floss threaders, and pre-threaded floss picks. These tools can make flossing easier and more convenient, especially for those with dexterity issues or those who have braces, dental bridges, or other dental appliances. Lastly, it's a good idea to try various types of dental floss to determine which one works best for you. Factors such as taste, comfort, and ease of use can also influence your choice. Many dental flosses come in flavored varieties, such as mint or cinnamon, which can leave your mouth feeling fresh and clean. Just remember that the most important thing is to floss regularly and correctly, regardless of the type or thickness of dental floss you choose. This will help you maintain good oral hygiene and prevent various dental problems such as cavities, gum disease, and bad breath."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (April 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The story focuses on a British photographer, John Bradley, who is sent into the Thai rain forest to take wildlife photographs. While on assignment, a tribe native to the area takes him captive. Bradley starts in Bangkok, taking photos and seeing the sights, until he arrives at a boxing match with a date. His date grows increasingly bored and disgruntled by Bradley's refusal to leave, until she finally walks out on him, which doesn't bother him in the slightest. An unidentified man sees her leave, and presumably upset over the disrespect shown towards the young woman, he follows Bradley to a bar where he confronts him with a knife. After a brief struggle, Bradley manages to turn the weapon against the man and kills him. Even though he killed in self-defense, Bradley immediately flees the scene. The next day, John begins his trip deep into the rain forest. He rents a canoe and a guide to take him down a nearby river. Still fearing that he'll be captured by the authorities, he pays off the man to not mention their encounter. After rowing a ways and taking several wildlife photos, Bradley's guide, Tuan, mentions his concerns about traveling so far down river, which he reports as being dangerous. John agrees to head back after one more day of traveling. John falls asleep, and when he awakes, he finds Tuan dead with an arrow in his throat. Before he has any chance to escape, a native tribe captures him in a net and carries him to their village. The chief, LuhanÃ , is told that the group has captured a large fish-man. At the village, Bradley is hung in the net from a high pole, where a group of young children hit him with bamboo stalks. While hanging, Bradley witnesses the execution of two war criminals by his captive tribe. The tribe is at war with another, even more primitive tribe of cannibals, the...

Rebel groups overran army positions and moved into villages nearby where members of President Bashar al-Assad's Alawite sect lived, HRW claims. HRW identified five rebel groups instrumental to funding, organising, planning and carrying out the Latakia attacks. Assad's forces are also accused by rights groups of committing atrocities.","completion":"Title: The Impact of Militant Groups on Syrian Villagers: A Human Rights Watch Report Introduction: The crisis in Syria has been escalating for almost a decade now, and the situation continues to deteriorate as militant groups, some with links to al-Qaeda, perpetrate violence against innocent civilians. Human Rights Watch (HRW), an international human rights organization, has recently released a report highlighting the atrocities carried out by various rebel aroups against the villagers belonging to the Alawite sect, a minority in Syria. This sect is significant due to its affiliation with President Bashar al-Assad. In this article, we will examine the details of the HRW report and the claims made concerning these heinous acts. Militant Groups' Assault on Villagers: The report from HRW details the ruthless execution of villagers by militant groups, some of whom have links to al-Qaeda. It states that rebel groups successfully overran army positions and gained access to villages that were predominantly occupied by members of President Bashar al-Assad’s Alawite sect. The invasion of these villages led to the subsequent abduction and killing of numerous innocent civilians. Five Rebel Groups Instrumental to the Latakia Attacks: HRW has identified five rebel groups as the main sources of funding, organization, planning, and execution of the Latakia attacks. These groups' involvement has intensified the atrocities against Alawite villagers. Although the report does not specifically name the organizations, it highlights their roles in carrying out such gruesome acts. Accusations Against Assad's Forces: While the HRW report focuses primarily on the atrocities committed by militant groups, it also acknowledges that Assad's forces have been accused by various rights groups of committing heinous crimes as well. The Syrian regime has allegedly carried out indiscriminate attacks on rebel-held areas, resulting in significant loss of life and destruction of infrastructure. The involvement of both militant groups and Assad's forces in atrocious acts has complicated the situation on the ground in Syria, causing immense suffering to the civilian population. Impact on Civilians: The escalating violence in Syria has had catastrophic consequences for the civilian population, particularly those belonging to the Alawite sect. Amidst ongoing conflict, entire communities have been displaced, resulting in a refugee crisis that has shaken neighboring nations. The influx of Syrian refugees has also strained international political relations and placed a higher demand on governmental resources. Conclusion: The HRW report serves as a stark reminder of the horrific violence that continues to plague Syria and its people. Both rebel forces and the Assad regime have been implicated in carrying out atrocities against the civilian population. The suffering of innocent civilians, particularly those belonging to the Alawite sect, has reached critical levels. It is imperative that the international community comes together to facilitate a resolution to this ongoing conflict and hold the responsible parties accountable for their actions. Until such a resolution is achieved, the lives of innocent Syrians will continue to lay in limbo and at the mercy of those who are meant to protect them. However, resolution and accountability may only be the first steps towards healing the wounds inflicted upon the Syrian people during this long and brutal conflict."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Within the next ten years, the U. S., China, Israel, and a crowd of private companies plan to set up camp on the moon. So if and when they plant a flag, does _ give them property rights? A NASA working group hosted a discussion this week to ask: Who owns the moon? The answer, of course, is no use. The Outer Space Treaty, the international signed by more than 100 countries, states that the moon and other celestial bodies are the province of all mankind. No doubt that would annoy all of the people throughout the ages, like monks from the Middle Ages, who have tried to claim the moon was theirs. But ownership is different from property rights. People who rent apartments, for example, don't own where they live, but they still hold rights. So with all of the upcoming missions to visit the moon and beyond, space industry thought leaders are seriously asking themselves how to deal with a potential land rush. \\" This is a very relevant discussion right now. We've got this wave of new lunar missions from around the world,\\" said William Marshall, a scientist in the small-spacecraft office at NASA, but who spoke this week at an event hosted by NASA's Co Lab, a collaborative public-private working group. He was speaking from his personal interest and not on behalf of the agency. To be sure, the United States aims to send astronauts back to the moon by as early as 2015, in a mission that would include a long-term settlement. China and Israel, among others, are also working on lunar projects. And for the first time, several private groups are building spacecraft to land on the moon in an attempt to win millions of dollars in the Google Lunar X Prize. Some participants say that they plan to gain some property rights in the mission. Question: \\" The Google Lunar X Prize\\" aims to _ .

Water spilled out of the tub when Hannah put the bucket in it because the Options are: 1. bucket is too large.; 2. tub is too large.;","completion":"Water spilled out of the tub when Hannah put the bucket in it because the bucket is too large. Let's examine this situation and understand the physics behind it. When a large bucket is placed into a tub filled with water, it causes a displacement of the liquid. This phenomenon is governed by Archimedes' principle, which states that any object submerged in a fluid (in this case, water) will experience an upward buoyant force equal to the weight of fluid displaced by the object. As the large bucket is submerged into the water, the weight of the water displaced by the bucket is greater than the upward buoyant force the bucket experiences. In this scenario, the large bucket occupies a significant portion of the volume inside the tub, and thus increases the total volume of the system (water + bucket) occupying the tub. As the water level rises, the pressure within the tub also increases, eventually reaching a point where the water can no longer be contained. This is when the excess water spills out of the tub. In essence, the large bucket has caused the tub to be effectively smaller. On the contrary, if the tub were too large, there would be minimal impact when the bucket is submerged. The water displacement caused by the bucket would be easily accommodated by the massive size of the tub without causing overflow. In this situation, the water level rise would be negligible, and there would be no spillage. One effective way to handle this situation would be to slowly immerse the bucket into the tub in a controlled manner. This would enable the water displaced by the bucket to be distributed over a longer period of time, reducing the chances of any sudden spillovers. Another practical solution would be to reduce the initial water level in the tub so that it can accommodate the bucket without causing water to spill out. In conclusion, water spilled out of the tub when Hannah put the bucket in it because the bucket is too large, causing a rapid displacement of water which led to an overflow. To prevent such a scenario in the future, one may need to consider the size of the bucket, control the water level in the tub, or simply choose a larger tub to accommodate the bucket and water more effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on. In fact it is probably the nicest one I’ve been on because everything is new,” said Bob McElroy, a Camp Humphreys public affairs officer. What is probably true about Puskas? A. He hates army life B. not enough information C. He's a good father D. He likes soccer","completion":"C.

Edward Wadie Said (Arabic: dwrd wdy\` s\`yd [waedi:? sae?i:d], Idward Wadi' Sa'id; 1 November 1935 - 25 September 2003) was a professor of literature at Columbia University, a public intellectual, and a founder of the academic field of postcolonial studies. A Palestinian American born in Mandatory Palestine, he was a citizen of the United States by way of his father, a U.S. Army veteran. Orientalism provoked much professional and personal criticism for Said among academics. Traditional Orientalists, such as Albert Hourani, Robert Graham Irwin, Nikki Keddie, Bernard Lewis, and Kanan Makiya, suffered negative consequences, because Orientalism affected public perception of their intellectual integrity and the quality of their Orientalist scholarship. The historian Keddie said that Said's critical work about the field of Orientalism had caused, in their academic disciplines: Some unfortunate consequences ... I think that there has been a tendency in the Middle East [studies] field to adopt the word Orientalism as a generalized swear-word, essentially referring to people who take the \\"wrong\\" position on the Arab-Israeli dispute, or to people who are judged \\"too conservative.\\" It has nothing to do with whether they are good or not good in their disciplines. So, Orientalism, for many people, is a word that substitutes for thought, and enables people to dismiss certain scholars and their works. I think that is too bad. It may not have been what Edward Said meant, at all, but the term has become a kind of slogan. In Orientalism, Said described Bernard Lewis, the Anglo-American Orientalist, as \\"a perfect exemplification [of an] Establishment Orientalist [whose work] purports to be objective, liberal scholarship, but is, in reality, very close to being propaganda against his subject material.\\" Lewis responded with a harsh critique of Orientalism accusing Said of politicizing the scientific study of the Middle East (and Arabic studies in particular); neglecting to critique the scholarly findings of the Orientalists; and giving \\"free rein\\" to his biases. Said retorted that in The Muslim Discovery of Europe (1982), Lewis responded to his thesis with the claim that the Western quest for knowledge about other societies was unique in its display of disinterested curiosity, which Muslims did not reciprocate towards Europe. Lewis was saying that \\"knowledge about Europe [was] the only acceptable criterion for true knowledge.\\" The appearance of academic impartiality was part of Lewis's role as an academic authority for zealous \\"anti-Islamic, anti-Arab, Zionist, and Cold War crusades.\\" Moreover, in the Afterword to the 1995 edition of the book, Said replied to Lewis's criticisms of the first edition of Orientalism (1978). Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"Yes, there are other interesting aspects in the article.

Hillary Clinton earned a seat on the senate in 2001, and then later served as the U.S Secretary of State in 2009. Hillary's position as the secretary of state ended in 2013, and in 2015 she announced her plans to run for the 2016 Presidency. As of March 30, 2016; Hillary has won 1,712 delegates in the Presidential Primaries and will likely become the democratic nominee. ||||| She's the picture of presidential ambition. Just days after becoming a private citizen, Hillary Clinton is stoking speculation about running for President in 2016 by launching a mysterious new website that boldly features her in an attention-grabbing photo. A mass e-mail sent Tuesday by her husband Bill Clinton and their daughter Chelsea is adding to the speculation: It urges recipients to “thank Hillary for making our country and our world, stronger, safer and better.” “She inspires us every day — and we hope she inspires you, too. Please take a moment to send Hillary your personal note of thanks,” it adds, providing a link for fans to do just that. When Hillary Clinton stepped down Friday after four grueling years as secretary of state, it was assumed that she would relax and recharge while contemplating her next move. Her friend Ann Lewis fueled that notion, telling NBC that Clinton would “take some time, put her feet up, take a nap.” So much for retirement. Clinton receives applause after her last day in office as Secretary of State. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) The website and e-mail show that Clinton already has given great thought to the future — and that she wants to keep the option open of running for the White House, political consultants said. “These are not the kind of things you do if you want to fade quietly into the night,” said Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf. “It's a long time between now and 2016,” he added, “and she can use this to create a candidacy, make people think she's creating a candidacy or simply maintain her power. It's a perfect strategic move.” The new website emerged with no fanfare. Visitors to HillaryClinton.com, the remnant of campaigns past, were presented with a link directing them to the new address, HillaryClintonOffice.com, which was registered Thursday, 24 hours before Clinton left the State Department. Aides did not disclose when Clinton posed for the smiling glamour shot at the new site. Clinton is not wearing the thick glasses she has sported in recent weeks to counter the double vision she suffered as a result of a concussion in December. The site also contains a contact form for visitors to fill out — allowing Clinton to add to her already robust mailing list. Speculation is running running wild after Clinton launched the new site as people are questioning if she's planning a run to become the leader of the free world. (Carlos Alvarez/Getty Images) Clinton aides downplayed the site’s significance, insisting that it is simply a way for fans and the media to reach Clinton now that she is out of office. The mass e-mail was sent by her husband’s nonprofit foundation to its subscribers. Analysts said that even if Hillary Clinton is inclined not to run again, the e-mail and website are smart politically. “There is no downside. It’s always good for people to think that you might run,” said Hunter College Prof. Kenneth Sherrill. “Should she want to endorse a candidate or ... raise money for a cause she cares about, this is an extraordinary resource. At the very least, it’s a sign she’ll remain active in politics.” On mobile?

After her position ended in 2013, she announced her run for the 2016 Presidency. In early 2016, Clinton launched a website featuring her in an eye-catching photo, sparking speculation of her running for President again.

Media playback is not supported on this device Despite losing 2-1 to England, Chris Coleman's side beat their neighbours to the group's summit with an impressive 3-0 dismantling of Russia. Playing in their first major tournament for 58 years, Wales face Northern Ireland in the last 16 on Saturday. \\"Obviously you come to the tournament for one reason. To win,\\" said Bale. He continued: \\"Not to play three games and go home. The ultimate goal is we want to try and win the tournament. \\"It's a cliche but we'll take each one as it comes. Yes we would love to win it, but all our focus now is on Northern Ireland.\\" Bale had stoked the fires ahead of Wales' defeat against England, claiming they were prouder and more passionate about representing their country than Roy Hodgson's men. Despite the defeat by England, Wales finished top of Group B thanks to their victory over Russia and England's goalless draw with Slovakia - giving Coleman's side a favourable draw for the knockout stages. The eight teams on Wales' side of the draw have no major international honours between them, whereas the other side - featuring Spain, Germany, Italy, France and England - boasts 20 titles. Wales would face Hungary or Belgium in the quarter-finals if they were to beat Northern Ireland but, despite revelling in finishing above England, Bale is not looking too far ahead. \\"It is a moral victory for us, bragging rights to finish top. It is always nice to get one over on the English,\\" he said. \\"We can't think about Belgium. We know our side of the draw. Maybe it is more favourable. But it is not favourable if you don't get through.\\" Wales' match against Northern Ireland will be just their second in the knockout stages of a major tournament, with their last being a quarter-final defeat by Brazil in the 1958 World Cup. Before their match against Russia, the squad watched BBC Wales' documentary 'Wales: The Road to the Euros', which charted the national side's long and painful wait for an appearance at an international competition. According to Bale, the programme resonated with the current squad, who have enjoyed a remarkable rise in recent years. \\"It's an amazing feeling in the camp. We've not just been working on it two years,\\" he added. \\"It's been since we were all young boys, playing together. I was 16, some were 17, 18,\\" he added. \\"We've come through a massive journey. We've been in some bad places, we were 112th in the world. \\"Now we're in the last 16 of the Euros. These days are to enjoy, some of the others not so much.\\" What was that article about?","completion":"The article discusses the optimism and determination of the Wales national football team during the Euro 2016 tournament.

Welsh football star Gareth Bale expressed his team's ambition to win the tournament and highlighted their journey and progress from being ranked 112th in the world to reaching the last 16 of the Euros.

It’s October, which means it’s that time of the year again: flu vaccination time! Back when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.) Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren’t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don’t like needles. Or maybe they aren’t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer “stronger” versions, designed for older adults? I’m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it’s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC’s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I’m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I’m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza. This month, you’ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I’ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns. Here’s what I’ll cover: * The basics of influenza and vaccination against the flu * What to know about flu shots for older adults * What’s new and resources for the 2017-2018 flu...

After Lynch visited the city earlier this week and met with the family of Freddie Gray, she said she started considering a federal investigation even though Baltimore had made \\"significant strides\\" in a voluntary review of use of force. That review began last October, after the Sun reported that Baltimore had paid 5.7 million in 102 court judgments over alleged police misconduct since 2011.

Article:","completion":"Baltimore Civil Rights Investigation Launched by Attorney General Loretta Lynch Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced today at a Washington, D.C. press conference that the Department of Justice (DOJ) will launch a full-scale civil rights investigation into the Baltimore Police Department. This decision comes in the wake of recent events, including the tragic death of Freddie Gray in police custody, which has led to a serious erosion of public trust. According to The Guardian, Lynch said at the press conference that she began considering the federal investigation after visiting Baltimore earlier this week and meeting the family of Freddie Gray. Though the city of Baltimore has made significant strides in a voluntary review of use-of-force since last October, recent incidents and the substantial damage they have caused to communities' trust in the police force have prompted the need for a wider investigation. The review began last October when Baltimore Sun reported that the city had paid 5.7 million in 102 court judgments for alleged police misconduct since 2011. Lynch acknowledged that \\"none of us have any illusions that reform is easy,\\" and emphasized the importance of rebuilding trust between the police force and the community and achieving sustainable reforms. She stated that \\"change will not come overnight\\" as a result of the investigation, which is effective immediately as per MSNBC's report. Lynch expressed her confidence in, and support from the police union during the press conference according to notes by CNN, and Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said yesterday that he wouldn't object to an outside investigation, as mentioned in the New York Times. Batts also stated his commitment to winning back the trust of the community by saying, \\"I am willing to do anything it takes to win that trust back.\\" This investigation is one of 20 DOJ investigations of various police departments in the last six years. The Baltimore Sun notes that the outcomes of these investigations could lead to years of court monitoring. It is important to highlight that this DOJ probe is separate from its inquiry into the death of Freddie Gray. As incidents of alleged police misconduct and racial injustice continue to make headlines, Attorney General Loretta Lynch's decision to initiate a full-scale Justice Department civil rights investigation demonstrates the government's commitment to addressing these issues. The challenge, however, lies in achieving sustainable reforms that create long-lasting trust between the police force and the communities they serve."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Is not necessarily worth two of anything, anywhere else. But it can certainly be a heck of a lot of fun. During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet).

I think revenge is a dish best enjoyed in secret with no chance of counter-revenge to spoil the occasion. And so it was that I laid my plans against Scut. The occasion and place were set.

While hiding out at the home of Mattie and her two children, Bowie unwittingly insults Mattie by comparing her with his mother during an exchange that initially sounds like a pick-up. The insult, combined with the lascivious attention of the much older T-Dub toward Mattie's daughter Lula, and Bowie's later return with the young Keechie (now pregnant with Bowie's child) in tow inspires Mattie's revenge against Bowie. Bowie is injured in an auto accident and takes refuge with the daughter of the gas station attendant, Keechie.

Pope Francis blesses faithful gathered to attend the Palm Sunday Mass in Saint Peter's Square at the Vatican, March 25, 2018 REUTERS/Tony Gentile Francis spoke a day after hundreds of thousands of young Americans and their supporters answered a call to action from survivors of last month’s Florida high school massacre and rallied across the United States to demand tighter gun laws. He did not mention the demonstrations. Catholic News Service (CNS) said Gabriella Zuniga, 16, and her sister Valentina, 15, both students from Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, where 17 people were killed in February, attended the service with their parents. CNS posted a photo of the two holding up signs in St. Peter’s Square, with one reading, “Protect Our Children, Not Our Guns.” The 81-year-old Francis led a long and solemn Palm Sunday service before tens of thousands in the square, many of them young people there for the Catholic Church’s World Day of Youth. Pope Francis holds palm as he leads the Palm Sunday Mass in Saint Peter's Square at the Vatican, March 25, 2018 REUTERS/Tony Gentile Carrying a woven palm branch known as a “palmurello,” Francis led a procession in front of the largest church in Christendom to commemorate the day the Bible says Jesus rode into Jerusalem and was hailed as a savior, only to be crucified five days later. “YOU HAVE IT IN YOU TO SHOUT” Drawing on biblical parallels, Francis urged the young people in the crowd not to let themselves be manipulated. “The temptation to silence young people has always existed,” Francis said in the homily of a Mass. “There are many ways to silence young people and make them invisible. Many ways to anesthetize them, to make them keep quiet, ask nothing, question nothing. There are many ways to sedate them, to keep them from getting involved, to make their dreams flat and dreary, petty and plaintive,” he said. “Dear young people, you have it in you to shout,” he told young people, urging them to be like the people who welcomed Jesus with palms rather than those who shouted for his crucifixion only days later. Slideshow (10 Images) “It is up to you not to keep quiet. Even if others keep quiet, if we older people and leaders, some corrupt, keep quiet, if the whole world keeps quiet and loses its joy, I ask you: Will you cry out?” The young people in the crowd shouted, “Yes!” While Francis did not mention Saturday’s marches in the United States, he has often condemned weapons manufacturing and mass shootings. Palm Sunday marked the start of a hectic week of activities for the pope. On Holy Thursday he is due to preside at two services, including one in which he will wash the feet of 12 inmates in a Rome jail to commemorate Jesus’ gesture of humility toward his apostles the night before he died. On Good Friday, he is due to lead a Via Crucis (Way of the Cross) procession at Rome’s Colosseum. On Saturday night he leads a Easter vigil service and on Easter Sunday he delivers his twice-yearly “Urbi et Orbi” (to the city and the world) message. ||||| A view of St. Peter's Square filled with faithful as Pope Francis celebrates a Palm Sunday Mass, at the Vatican, Sunday, March 25, 2018.

Answer the following question: Why would the tourists subject themselves to walking ?","completion":"The tourists found themselves walking on the second day of their trip in Paris primarily due to the fact that public transportation was shut down because the transport workers were on strike. Even though strikes in France may seem unusual, they do occur from time to time, and during such situations, locals and visitors alike need to find alternative means of transportation. While walking may have been involuntary in this case due to the unavailability of public transportation, it could also have turned into an opportunity for the tourists to further explore and experience the city in a more immersive way. Walking through the streets of Paris gives them a chance to witness and appreciate the culture, architecture, and vibrancy of the city up-close, allowing them to notice intricate details that they might have missed when using public transportation. Moreover, walking can have additional benefits for the tourists. It allows them to get some physical exercise while enjoying their vacation, something that is essential for staying healthy and counteracting the effects of indulging in delicious local cuisines. Walking can also be a more sustainable and environmentally friendly way of exploring the city, cutting down on the use of fossil fuels and reducing carbon emissions. Given the context, the most fitting answer to the question of why the tourists would subject themselves to walking is A. Public transportation was shut down, as this was the Prime motivating factor.

Article: Former representative Barney Frank revealed today that he had asked Governor Deval Patrick to appoint him to the interim Senate seat that would need to be filled if Senator John F. Kerry resigns to serve as secretary of state. The governor laughed at the breach of confidentiality about what he has considered a private process, before conceding, “He’d be a great senator.” Nonetheless, Patrick quickly added: “I have a lot of factors I’m considering.” Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Frank told the Globe that he changed his mind about continuing in public life after President Obama and congressional leaders announced their fiscal cliff compromise over the New Year’s holiday. While that deal raised tax rates on individuals earning more than 400,000 per year, it delayed for two months any resolution to government program cuts or changes in entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. “The first months of the new Senate will be among the most important in American history. I may be a little immodest, but I called the governor and said I think I can be a help in reaching a fair solution to some of these issues,” Frank said. “I think there are progressive ways to work on Social Security and Medicare. I think making the case against them (Tea Party Republicans) on the debt limit is important,” the Newton Democrat added. “A split emerged in the Republican Party over the fiscal cliff, with mainstream Republicans splitting with the radical right. I think it’s important for us to continue to exploit that. We need to reach out to conservative Republicans who nonetheless are willing to compromise, and find a way to reach a deal.” Frank also said he wanted to fight for the Massachusetts medical community as health care changes are debated. Asked for the governor’s reaction to his offer, apparently made in a phone call Thursday, the former congressman said: “He said, ‘Thank-you for telling me.’ As you expect, he was noncommittal.” Patrick addressed the subject Friday afternoon, during a State House news conference called for other topics. “Congressman Frank is a really gifted legislator, and he’d be a great senator – even on an interim basis. I have a lot of factors I’m considering and he’s definitely on the list,” the governor told reporters. The governor has cloaked his search in secrecy, acknowledging that he has spoken with people who are interested in appointment or who have recommended others, but he has refused to discuss individual names. “I think in every case the other person has treated (the conversations) as confidential. In congressman Frank’s case, he’s chosen not to on his end. I’m going to keep my end confidential,” Patrick said. Asked if he would have preferred that Frank kept their conversation private, the governor let out a laugh and said of the famously irrepressible congressman, “Does it matter, in the case of Congressman Frank, what I would have preferred?” Turning serious, he added: “Congressman Frank is an incredible public leader, thought leader, and legislator.” Asked if Frank had a senatorial temperament, the governor repeated: “I think he’d be a great interim senator and, like I say, he’s on the list.” During another Globe interview in mid-November, Frank flatly ruled out running in the special election that would be held simultaneously to permanently fill any Senate vacancy. The 72-year-old said he wanted to write books, teach, and speak on the lecture circuit after 45 years in public life. He repeated that vow today, saying, “Absolutely not, there’s no way I would run.” He noted that he already has paid speeches lined up for the period when he would be interim senator, which he would cancel were he appointed. But said the temporary nature of the interim appointment and the new issues confronting the Senate would make the interim job appealing. Frank said he changed his mind “as I sat in the caucus room and listened to them as they outlined the deal.” A Patrick aide said the governor has not changed his posture on the situation and will not fill the seat until Kerry has been confirmed for his new job and a vacancy officially exists. Patrick aides told the Globe earlier this week that the governor feels no need to fill the seat with a political luminary, and instead is solely focused on someone who would be a good political partner for the state and not have their own political agenda. Among the type of candidate that might fill that bill is outgoing Administration and Finance Secretary Jay Gonzalez. The election to permanently fill the seat would then have to be held in 145 days to 160 days, meaning the interim appointee would likely serve until late June. Outlining his rationale for the interim appointment, Frank told the Globe: “Given that there’s not going to be any preparation time, I could be right in the middle of resolving some of the most important issues facing the country.” Frank first mentioned his call to Patrick during an appearance this morning on the MSNBC program “Morning Joe.” ||||| Fmr. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., proves there’s no rest for the recently retired. On Friday’s Morning Joe, he said conclusively that he has asked Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick if he can temporarily fill Sen. John Kerry’s seat, a seat he’s held now for almost 20 years. President Obama, of course, has nominated Sen. Kerry for Secretary of State, thus leaving Kerry’s seat wide open. But Massachussetts won’t hold a special election for Kerry’s seat until spring, so that means there’s some time to fill. Hence Frank’s interest. “Would you consider possibly being future Sen. Barney Frank if [Mass. Gov. Deval Patrick] calls you and says “Fill in for a couple of months?,” Joe Scarborough asked Frank Friday. “Two weeks ago I said I wasn’t interested, which is kind of like you’re about to graduate, and they said ‘You have to go to summer school,’” Frank said. “That deal now means that February, March and April are going to be among the most important months in American financial [history].” “So you’d consider it?,” Scarborough continued. Frank replied: “I’m not going to be coy. It’s not something I’ve ever been good at. I’ve told the governor that I would now like frankly to do that because I would like to be a part of that. It’s only a three-month period; I wouldn’t want to do anything more.

Kerry resigns to serve as Secretary of State. Governor Patrick, while considering Frank a great fit for the role, stated that he is considering several factors before making a decision. Frank expressed his interest in the appointment, stating he believes he can contribute to reaching a fair solution on various issues such as Social Security and Medicare. He reiterates that he would not run for a Senate seat in a special election but finds the temporary nature of the interim appointment appealing. Governor Patrick has not made any decision as of yet, as the vacancy would not exist until Kerry's confirmation for his new role."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

How to hold a farewell party Pick a theme. The best farewell parties revolve around a specific theme that honors your guest. Themes typically highlight the next part of this person's journey and commemorate your time together. Available options: (I). For instance, if you have just moved away, a nearby theme might be \\" stay a while longer. \\" your friends and family will undoubtedly celebrate meeting up for a fun reunion. (II). To create a theme, think of things that your guest is likely to like. Do they usually enjoy drinking wine? Coffee? Star wars? Fantasy vacations? Anything with elements that will remind this person they are travelling from the point of view of whoever they are seeing. (III). The theme can include a specific event, a situation, or a key person. If you are celebrating a special holiday, for example, invite the ceo of the company to have their holiday dinner at the office together. (IV).

If your friend is moving away think about what kind of themes would work. You might want to host a \\" bon voyage \\" party that utilizes themes of travel and exploration. Explanation: In this situation, we are talking about holding a farewell party. The best choice for a theme is option IV, which is about hosting a \\"bon voyage\\" party that uses the themes of travel and exploration. This fits well with saying goodbye to someone who is moving away. Option I is incorrect because it talks about a reunion after moving away, not a farewell party. Option II is not specific enough and talks about creating a theme based on the person's likes, which is not particularly related to a farewell party. Option III is incorrect because it talks about celebrating a special holiday instead of a farewell party."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In which city did Richard Wagner die in 1883? What is the answer?","completion":"Richard Wagner, the influential German composer known for his operas and music dramas, died in Venice, Italy, on February 13, 1883. Born on May 22, 1813, in Leipzig, Germany, Wagner was a revolutionary figure in the world of classical music. He is particularly famous for his four-opera cycle, Der Ring des Nibelungen, and the iconic opera Tristan und Isolde. Wagner's innovative approach to harmony, dramatic narrative, and using leitmotifs has profoundly impacted generations of composers and musicians. In the last years of his life, Wagner found solace in Venice, where he often retreated to work on his compositions and escape the pressures of his daily life. Venice was a city that Wagner admired for its beauty and serenity. In that period of his life, he was dealing with various health issues, in particular, heart problems. On the fateful day of February 13, 1883, Wagner suffered a heart attack at the Palazzo Vendramin on the Grand Canal, where he was staying with his family. He passed away at the age of 70. His body was repatriated to Germany and is now buried in the garden of his villa, Wahnfried, in Bayreuth, the city where his legacy lives on through the renowned Bayreuth Festival dedicated to his works. Venice's connection to Wagner is enshrined not only in his death but also in his works, with the famous Prelude to Act III of Tristan und Isolde first being performed in the city in 1862. Today, many music enthusiasts and admirers of Wagner journey to Venice to pay homage to the great composer and visit locations associated with his life and death."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background Paragraph: When you go to the dentist to get a tooth pulled, you really don’t want to feel any pain. The dentist injects an anesthetic into your gum and it eventually becomes numb. One theory as to why anesthetics work deals with the movement of ions across the cell membrane. The anesthetic gets into the membrane structure and causes shifts in how ions move across the membrane. If ion movement is disrupted, nerve impulses will not be transmitted and you will not sense pain – at least not until the anesthetic wears off.","completion":"Relationship(s) in the paragraph: Anesthetic usage in dentistry, movement of ions across cell membranes, disruption of nerve impulses and pain sensation. Story: In the small town of Grinville, there was a young girl named Amelia who loved to eat sweets.

Upon arriving at the gentle Dr. Benson's dental clinic, Amelia explained the excruciating pain she was experiencing. The kind dentist expressed his understanding and assured Amelia that he could help her without causing any further discomfort. He carefully prepared a syringe filled with a special anesthetic to prevent any pain during the procedure. As Amelia sat anxiously in the dental chair, the anesthetic was gently injected into her sore gum. Within a few moments, she felt her mouth become numb, and her worries began to fade away. Dr. Benson explained to his curious patient that the anesthetic works by interfering with the movement of ions across the cell membranes of her nerve cells, effectively preventing any nerve impulses from being transmitted and thus eliminating her sensation of pain. With Amelia's fears calmed and the anesthetic working its magic, the dentist successfully extracted her rotten tooth. Although she still felt some pressure during the procedure, the pain she had been dreading never materialized. After the anesthetic wore off, Amelia was pain-free and grateful for Dr. Benson's skill and the wonders of modern anesthetics. The experience taught Amelia the importance of dental care and the science behind pain relief.

Given the question: Given the following context: In an isolated villa on the small Italian island of Pantelleria, world-famous rock singer Marianne Lane is on holiday with her filmmaker lover Paul. She is recovering from surgery and has lost her voice, communicating only by signs and occasional whispers. He is in recovery from alcohol addiction and a suicide attempt. Neither speaks Italian but solitude is what both need, until an aeroplane from Rome brings a man neither wants to see. This is Harry, an extroverted music promoter who was Marianne's lover until he passed her on to his protegé, Paul. With him is Penelope, a previously unknown daughter of his who says she is 22. Moving into the villa, Harry starts inviting friends around as if it were his home and taking everybody out to various sights and festivities. His arrogant manner bores Pen and annoys Paul, but Marianne starts falling under his spell again; however, when Harry and Marianne begin to become intimate while alone, Marianne stops Harry. She tells him that she does love him, but that she cannot be with him and that she is with Paul. The sultry Pen then makes a play for the unhappy Paul; it is not shown, but implied, that Paul succumbs to Pen's overtures. answer the following question: What is the full name of the person who tells someone that they do love them but cannot be with them?

This House would allow the patenting of genes What is a possible side to this debate?","completion":"A possible side to this debate would be supporting the idea of allowing gene patenting. Step 1: Explaining the reasoning behind allowing gene patenting One could argue that allowing the patenting of genes may foster innovation and encourage further research in genetics. By granting patents, researchers and organizations would be given exclusive rights to use and profit from their discoveries, which may incentivize investment in genetic research and development. Step 2: Addressing potential concerns It is important to consider potential downsides to gene patenting, such as restricting access to genetic research, monopolistic control, and ethical concerns. To alleviate these issues, one could advocate for regulations that promote responsible gene patenting, including guidelines on patent duration and limitations on patent scope to ensure fair access and competition. Step 3: Citing examples of benefits from gene patenting By allowing gene patenting, important advancements in fields such as medicine, agriculture, and environmental science could be highlighted. For instance, the development of genetically modified crops might lead to reduced pesticide use and improved nutrition, while advances in gene therapy could offer potential cures for genetic diseases. Step 4: Comparing gene patenting to other forms of intellectual property protection Drawing parallels with other forms of intellectual property, like copyrights and trademarks, could be useful in justifying gene patenting. Similar to how these protective measures incentivize innovation and creativity, allowing gene patenting may lead to increased research, technological advancements, and overall societal benefits. In conclusion, supporting the idea of allowing gene patenting revolves around promoting innovation and investment in genetic research, addressing potential concerns through regulation, and emphasizing the potential benefits that can be derived from discoveries in the field. It is important, however, to consider the implications of such a stance and make appropriate adjustments to ensure a fair balance between the interests of researchers, companies, and the public."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The army defending Constantinople was relatively small, totaling about 7,000 men, 2,000 of whom were foreigners. At the onset of the siege, probably fewer than 50,000 people were living within the walls, including the refugees from the surrounding area.:32 Turkish commander Dorgano, who was in Constantinople in the pay of the Emperor, was also guarding one of the quarters of the city on the seaward side with the Turks in his pay. These Turks kept loyal to the Emperor and perished in the ensuing battle. The defending army's Genoese corps were well trained and equipped, while the rest of the army consisted of small numbers of well-trained soldiers, armed civilians, sailors and volunteer forces from foreign communities, and finally monks. The garrison used a few small-calibre artillery pieces, which nonetheless proved ineffective. The rest of the city repaired walls, stood guard on observation posts, collected and distributed food provisions, and collected gold and silver objects from churches to melt down into coins to pay the foreign soldiers. The Ottomans had a much larger force. Recent studies and Ottoman archival data state that there were about 50,000-80,000 Ottoman soldiers including between 5,000 and 10,000 Janissaries, *70 cannons:139-140 an elite infantry corps, and thousands of Christian troops, notably 1,500 Serbian cavalry that the Serbian lord Đurađ Branković was forced to supply as part of his obligation to the Ottoman sultan—just a few months before, he had supplied the money for the reconstruction of the walls of Constantinople. Contemporaneous Western witnesses of the siege, who tend to exaggerate the military power of the Sultan, provide disparate and higher numbers ranging from 160,000 to 200,000 and to 300,000. Answer this question: How many of the army defending Constantinople were not foreigners?","completion":"To determine the number of defending soldiers who were not foreigners, we need to subtract the number of foreigners from the total number of defending soldiers in Constantinople. The total number of defending soldiers: 7,000 Number of foreign soldiers: 2,000 Now we will subtract the number of foreign soldiers from the total number of defending soldiers: 7,000 (total soldiers) - 2,000 (foreign soldiers) = 5,000 So, there were 5,000 soldiers defending Constantinople who were not foreigners."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article with the title: \\"5 Rules for Professional Social Networking Success\\"","completion":"Title: 5 Rules for Professional Social Networking Success Introduction: In today's fast-paced digital world, professional social networking has become an essential element of career advancement and personal brand promotion for professionals. With platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook offering users the opportunity to connect and collaborate with a global audience, many are leveraging the power of these networks to achieve their professional goals. To ensure you make the most of your social networking efforts, it's crucial to follow some best practices and rules. Here are five fundamental rules for achieving professional social networking success. 1. Optimize your profile for discoverability and credibility An attractive and informative online presence is the key to successful networking. Dedicate some time to complete your profile information, upload a high-quality, professional-looking profile picture, and review the content you share to make sure it showcases your achievements and expertise. Having a polished and complete profile not only helps you stand out from the crowd but also enhances your credibility in the eyes of potential employers, partners, or clients. 2. Engage and interact with your connections Building a genuine and meaningful network isn't just about growing your list of connections, but also actively engaging with them. Respond to comments on your posts, congratulate your connections on their accomplishments, and share interesting content or articles that you find relevant to your industry. Participating in discussions and showing your support for your peers will not only keep you in the loop about industry trends but also demonstrate your commitment to your career growth and willingness to help others succeed. 3. Tap into the power of groups and communities Professional social networks often have groups, forums, and communities where like-minded individuals come together to discuss industry-specific topics, share insights, or collaborate on projects. Join groups relevant to your field and participate in conversations to establish yourself as an industry expert. It's also essential to share your own insights and experiences while respecting the opinions of others. Engaging in these groups can help you expand your network further, stay informed, and uncover potential opportunities. 4. Be selective about your connections The quality of your network is just as important as the size of your network. While it can be tempting to add anyone you come across, it's crucial to be selective about who you connect with to maintain the strength of your network. Focus on building connections with professionals within your industry or with those who share your interests and goals. Connecting with such individuals will help ensure that your network remains valuable, relevant, and mutually beneficial. 5. Maintain a balance between personal and professional content Striking a balance between personal and professional content when sharing on professional social networks is a crucial rule to follow. While showcasing your personality is essential in establishing a personal brand, remember that your posts and interactions should primarily focus on your professional interests, industry events, and achievements. Refrain from oversharing personal information or engaging in controversial discussions that might potentially damage your professional reputation. Conclusion: Following these five fundamental rules will enable you to establish a strong and supportive professional network and enhance your reputation within your industry. Remember to invest time and effort into maintaining your network by engaging with your connections regularly, sharing valuable content, and participating in industry-specific groups. Professional social networking success isn't just about the number of connections, but also about the quality of relationships you build and the value you provide to others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Flights to and from Bali resume after ash cloud left passengers stranded Tigerair has delayed two of its flights to and from Bali. (File/AAP) Some flights will resume in and out of Bali after a volcanic ash cloud left dozens of passengers stranded during the first week of school holidays. Jetstar says it will add extra services to deal with the backlog after Mount Rinjani erupted overnight. Passengers on Virgin and Tigerair flights from Perth, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Sydney have also been delayed. Tigerair says it will resume flights but expects three delayed services. Virgin Australia is expected to announce shortly if they will resume flights. The Volcanic Ash Centre said conditions weren't suitable for flying out of Denpasar Airport after Mount Rinjani, near Lombok, began shooting ash into the atmosphere. Frustrated passengers have taken to social media to attack Jetstar over its communication about flight cancellations. Two Facebook users reported they were incorrectly told flights would remain grounded on Wednesday after phoning the airline. \\"On phone to jetstar now and they are telling me they are NOT flying today! we were meant to be leaving last night and now not rebooked until Saturday night!\\" Emma Denny posted on Jetstar's Facebook page. Other travellers took the delays in their stride, praising the airline for prioritising safety and joking about there being worse places to be stuck. \\"Lucky we all have travel insurance booked,\\" Zoe Kennedy commented on Facebook. \\"My life is [sic] important to me.

This happy-go-luck 1939 military swashbuckler, based rather loosely on Rudyard Kipling's memorable poem as well as his novel \\"Soldiers Three,\\" qualifies as first-rate entertainment about the British Imperial Army in India in the 1880s. Cary Grant delivers more knock-about blows with his knuckled-up fists than he did in all of his movies put together. Set in faraway India, this six-fisted yarn dwells on the exploits of three rugged British sergeants and their native water bearer Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe) who contend with a bloodthirsty cult of murderous Indians called the Thuggee. Sergeant Archibald Cutter (Cary Grant of \\"The Last Outpost\\"), Sergeant MacChesney (Oscar-winner Victor McLaglen of \\"The Informer\\"), and Sergeant Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. of \\"The Dawn Patrol\\"), are a competitive trio of hard-drinking, hard-brawling, and fun-loving Alpha males whose years of frolic are about to become history because Ballantine plans to marry Emmy Stebbins (Joan Fontaine) and enter the tea business. Naturally, Cutter and MacChesney drum up assorted schemes to derail Ballentine's plans. When their superiors order them back into action with Sgt. Bertie Higginbotham (Robert Coote of \\"The Sheik Steps Out\\"), Cutter and MacChesney drug Higginbotham so that he cannot accompany them and Ballantine has to replace him. Half of the fun here is watching the principals trying to outwit each other without hating themselves.

The features describe aspects of articulation and perception, are from a universally fixed set, and have the binary values + or −. There are at least two levels of representation: underlying representation and surface phonetic representation. Ordered phonological rules govern how underlying representation is transformed into the actual pronunciation (the so-called surface form). An important consequence of the influence SPE had on phonological theory was the downplaying of the syllable and the emphasis on segments. Furthermore, the generativists folded morphophonology into phonology, which both solved and created problems.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Ryanair has been told it must look after passengers when flights are grounded by natural catastrophes, strikes and technical faults. The European Court of Justice ruling yesterday means the airline must cover the cost of meals, hotels and transport. The case dates back to the disruption caused by the eruption of a volcano in Iceland in 2010. Angry: Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said that the European Court of Justice's ruling may cause some airlines to go bust. Passengers were stranded across Europe. Ryanair alone cancelled 9,400 flights due to the ash cloud. The ruling is a blow to Ryanair boss. Michael O’Leary, who at first refused to abide by EU laws which state. airlines should support stranded passengers until they fly them home. After pressure from ministers, he was. forced into a U-turn, but Ryanair then became embroiled in a legal. battle to limit future refunds. The ECJ ruling follows on from a. British court’s decision earlier this week to allow passengers to claim. damages after long delays, as reported in the Daily Mail yesterday. The ruling was made after passenger Denise McDonagh was stranded in Faro, Portugal after volcano Eyjafjallajokull erupted. She claimed 1,130 Euros, or £970, to cover costs incurred while she was stuck. The volcanic eruption left millions of passengers unable to return home because it was deemed too dangerous to fly through the ash clouds. Today's ruling could leave airlines open to a raft of future claims. The court recognised compensation claims could have 'substantial negative economic consequences' for airlines, but said a high level of protection must be afforded to passengers. The court also said airlines should foresee any costs but pointed out that ticket prices could be hiked as a result. Mr O'Leary said the court's decision made the airlines 'insurers of last resort' and said whoever was responsible for cancellations should pay compensation. Price hike? Budget airline Ryanair said that it may have to put its prices up due to a ruling that airlines must cover the cost of stranded passengers expenses. He blamed the Government for closing British airspace in 2010, even though 'there was clearly no ash cloud over the UK.' He said: 'We now have a position that when the next time there's an ash cloud or the skies are closed by Europe's governments, the travel insurance companies will walk away and wash their hands and say it was an act of God and the airlines will become the insurers of last resort.' 'Somebody who has paid us fifty quid to travel to the Canaries, who may be stuck there for two weeks, two months, six months, will now sue the airlines and you will have airlines going out of business, and the ones who stay in business will be putting up the air fares to recover these crazy claims.' Mr O'Leary said Ryanair had paid out to everyone affected by the volcano eruption in 2010, including Ms McDonagh, but had still not covered costs despite introducing a compensation surcharge. Stranded: Hundreds of flights were cancelled in 2010 when a volcano erupted in Iceland. He added: 'It's a crazy decision, it's another crazy decision coming from the European court. 'You can't expect us to be providing compensation for the world and his mother when we are prevented from flying. 'Why does somebody have to pay? Why do we take responsibility for something that has been caused by others? 'This compensation culture is running riot in this country.' The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) today reiterated its advice to passengers affected by flight delays and cancellations and advised passengers who were not being treated properly to contact them. Passengers whose flights are delayed or cancelled are entitled to assistance from the airline such as food, drinks and accommodation where necessary, the CAA said. In addition, passengers whose flights have been cancelled at short notice or arrive three hours or more later than scheduled are also entitled to claim for compensation - unless the delay or cancellation was out of the airline's control. A CAA spokesman said: 'These regulations are in place to protect people when things go wrong with their flights. 'Anyone with concerns that they are not being treated correctly by their airline can contact the CAA for advice or to make a complaint.' Ryanair also issued an official statement this afternoon warning of hikes in fares after the ruling. It read: 'Ryanair regrets the decision of the European Court which now allows passengers to claim for flight delays which are clearly and unambiguously outside of an airline's control. Stuck: Passengers pictured stranded at Heathrow airport during the ash cloud crisis. 'Today's decision will materially increase the cost of flying across Europe and consumer airfares will increase as airlines will be obliged to recover the cost of these claims from their customers, because the defective European regulation does not allow us to recover such costs from the governments or unions who are responsible for over 95 per cent of flight delays in Europe.' Like other carriers, the airline said it had already paid out millions of pounds in compensation to passengers affected by the ash cloud. But it contested Ms McDonagh's case because it deemed the amount to be 'excessive'. The case centred around the EU 261 regulations, a European law which means carriers were obliged to refund the bills of thousands of passengers caught up in the crisis which put a ban on great swathes of airspace. It was seen as a test case as Ryanair was the only airline to take a challenge to the European courts. Last October the European Court decided that delays of more than three hours, where the airline was at fault - because of technical faults or lack of flight crew, for example - warranted compensation. With 200million passengers using UK airports annually, and around 2million of those delayed by more than three hours, that may result in 400,000 fliers eligible for refunds every year. British Airways, easyJet, Tui Travel and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) had all opposed that ruling. Compensation to British customers was put on hold until the final ruling in October. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"The European Court of Justice has ruled that Ryanair must provide care for passengers in situations where flights are grounded due to natural catastrophes, strikes, and technical faults.

The Supreme Court is allowing Ohio to clean up its voting rolls by targeting people who haven't cast ballots in a while. The justices are rejecting, by a 5-4 vote... (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court ruled Monday that states can clean up their voting rolls by targeting people who haven't cast ballots in a while. The justices rejected, by a 5-4 vote Monday, arguments in a case from Ohio that the practice violates a federal law intended to increase the ranks of registered voters. A handful of other states also use voters' inactivity to trigger a process that could lead to their removal from the voting rolls. Justice Samuel Alito said for the court that Ohio is complying with the 1993 National Voter Registration Act. He was joined by his four conservative colleagues. The four liberal justices dissented. Partisan fights over ballot access are being fought across the country. Democrats have accused Republicans of trying to suppress votes from minorities and poorer people who tend to vote for Democrats. Republicans have argued that they are trying to promote ballot integrity and prevent voter fraud. Under Ohio rules, registered voters who fail to vote in a two-year period are targeted for eventual removal from registration rolls, even if they haven't moved and remain eligible. The state said it only uses the disputed process after first comparing its voter lists with a U.S. postal service list of people who have reported a change of address. But not everyone who moves notifies the post office, the state said. So the state asks people who haven't voted in two years to confirm their eligibility. If they do, or if they show up to vote over the next four years, voters remain registered. If they do nothing, their names eventually fall off the list of registered voters. \\"Combined with the two years of nonvoting before notice is sent, that makes a total of six years of nonvoting before removal,\\" Alito wrote. Justice Stephen Breyer, writing in dissent, said the 1993 law prohibits removing someone from the voting rolls \\"by reason of the person's failure to vote. In my view, Ohio's program does just that.\\" In a separate dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said Congress enacted the voter registration law \\"against the backdrop of substantial efforts by states to disenfranchise low-income and minority voters.\\" The court's decision essentially endorses \\"the very purging that Congress expressly sought to protect against,\\" Sotomayor wrote. Civil rights groups said the court should be focused on making it easier for people to vote, not allowing states to put up roadblocks to casting ballots. \\"With the midterm election season now underway, the court's ruling demands heightened levels of vigilance as we anticipate that officials will read this ruling as a green light for loosely purging the registration rolls in their community,\\" said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. ||||| WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court handed Republicans a major victory Monday when justices upheld an Ohio law that allows election officials to remove voters from the rolls if they have neither voted during a six-year span nor responded to notices mailed by elections boards. In a 5-4 decision Monday, Justice Samuel Alito sided with Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine and Secretary of State Jon Husted by ruling Ohio’s system does not violate laws approved by Congress in 1993 and 2002. “We have no authority to second-guess Congress or to decide whether (Ohio's law) is the ideal method for keeping its voting rolls up to date,” Alito wrote. “The only question before us is whether it violates federal law. It does not.” >> Join the conversation at Facebook.com/dispatchpolitics and connect with us on Twitter @OhioPoliticsNow The justices overruled a 2016 decision by a three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that the Ohio system violated federal law in a way critics charged works against low-income voters. DeWine and Husted, the Republican nominees for governor and lieutenant governor, respectively, both hailed the ruling, with Husted saying it was “a victory for election integrity and a defeat for those who use the federal court system to make election law across the country.” The decision could emerge as a major election issue this year in the race between DeWine and Democratic gubernatorial nominee Rich Cordray, who said “the right to vote is vital to our democracy. We need to focus on making the right to vote more accessible to Ohioans, not on taking it away.” Joining Alito to form the majority were Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Anthony Kennedy. Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented. Sotomayor wrote that Congress passed the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 “against the backdrop of substantial efforts by states to disenfranchise low-income and minority voters, including programs that purged eligible voters from registration lists because they failed to vote in prior elections.” “The court errs in ignoring this history and distorting the statutory text to arrive at a conclusion that not only is contrary to the plain language of the (1993 law) but also contradicts the essential purposes of the statute, ultimately sanctioning the very purging that Congress expressly sought to protect against,” she wrote. That prompted a stinging response from Alito, who wrote that Sotomayor’s dissent “says nothing about what is relevant in this case — namely the language\\" of the 1993 federal law. He described as “misconceived” her assertion that minority and low-income voters would be disenfranchised. Alito’s ruling provoked sharp criticism from Ohio Democrats. U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, a former secretary of state, said the “decision empowers Ohio to further strip away the right to vote for thousands of Ohioans, threatening the integrity of our state’s election process.” Rep. Tim Ryan of Niles warned that Husted “has been given the all-clear to continue purging thousands of Ohioans from the voter rolls.” But Ohio Republican Chairwoman Jane Timken tweeted, \\"As #SCOTUS majority notes in today’s decision, #Ohio has not violated the law. In fact, the state’s removal process follows the law to the letter.\\" The Ohio law provides what the state considers a housekeeping device to determine if a voter's information is still accurate. Voters who don't cast a ballot for two years receive a notice from their county board of elections checking to see if they still live there. If they don't reply, they get a variety of mailings over the ensuing four years, such as requests for absentee ballots, a change of address card and notice of polling sites. If the voter responds to any of those notices — or votes even once during those four years — he or she remains registered. If elections officials don't hear from a voter in the six-year period — no votes, no response to mailings — his or her name is purged from the list of eligible voters. The voter can register again to regain eligibility. “It is undisputed that Ohio does not remove a registrant on change-of-residence grounds unless the registrant is sent and fails to mail back a return card and then fails to vote for an additional four years,” Alito wrote. The procedure has been the same for years, under both GOP and Democratic secretaries of state. State Rep. Kathleen Clyde of Kent, the Democrat running for secretary of state, said she was disappointed in the ruling and called on Husted to “leave eligible voters on the rolls and only remove people for legitimate reasons such as death or moving out of state.” \\"Justice Alito’s opinion only holds that federal law allows this purging, it does not suggest that federal law requires it nor that it is good policy,” she said. “Under this decision, whether or not to purge is left to the states.\\" State Sen. Frank LaRose, the Hudson Republican running against Clyde, said, “Maintaining accurate and up-to-date voter rolls is critical to ensuring the integrity and efficiency of our elections ... By working with the bipartisan county boards of election, we can balance the responsibility to maintain accurate voter rolls while still being fair to all voters.” Husted's office did not immediately respond to questions about his office's plan to purge additional voters in the wake of the court's ruling. In the 2016 election, the ACLU determined that roughly 7,500 people in Ohio showed up to vote only to discover that they had been purged. And while those 7,500 voters would not have been enough to tip the presidential election from President Donald Trump to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, scores of Ohio elections have been decided by a handful of votes. Rep. Joyce Beatty, a Columbus-area Democrat, said the “right to vote is not a ‘use it or lose it’ proposition. Rather, voting is a permanent guarantee that is essential to democracy.” jtorry@dispatch.com @jacktorry1 rludlow@dispatch.com @randyludlow |||||","completion":"The US Supreme Court has upheld an Ohio law enabling the removal of voters from registration lists if they fail to vote during a six-year period and do not respond to notices.

Neither option (i) yes, nor (ii) no is sufficient to provide a detailed explanation for this answer. First, let's understand the background. The United States has a complex legal system, with multiple sources of law at the federal level. One of these sources is the United States Code, while another is the Code of Federal Regulations. The statement in the question pertains to the United States Code, but the query is about where to find regulations from executive branch agencies, which is a different source of law. The United States Code is a compilation and codification of the general and permanent federal statutes enacted by the United States Congress. It is organized into 54 titles, each covering a specific topic area, such as transportation, taxation, or labor. It provides a comprehensive and consolidated source of federal statutory law that is currently in force. However, the regulations from executive branch agencies are not found in the United States Code. Instead, they are found in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The CFR is a codification of the general and permanent rules and regulations promulgated by federal agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, or the Federal Communications Commission. These regulations provide more specific details for how the statutes in the United States Code are to be implemented, administered, and enforced. The CFR is divided into 50 titles, most of which correspond to an area of federal regulation. Each title is further divided into chapters which typically bear the name of the issuing agency. Regulations are issued as a result of legislation, executive orders, or other actions taken by the President or Congress. The process of creating and amending regulations is known as rulemaking, and often involves the interpretation of statutes found within the United States Code. In summary, while it is true that the United States Code is the official compilation and codification of general and permanent federal statutes, it does not correctly answer the question of where the regulations from executive branch agencies are found. Instead, you would need to consult the Code of Federal Regulations to find such regulations."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

New Legitimacy: Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in its bid to control Las Vegas — corporate cash. Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, 300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget. In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort. He bought several Strip properties — the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them — and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — Mirage — which became an instant success.

Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group.

Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year.

James Alvin Palmer (born October 15, 1945) is a retired American right-handed pitcher who played all of his 19 years in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Baltimore Orioles (1965-67, 1969-84) and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1990. Palmer was the winning pitcher in 186 games in the 1970s, the most wins in that decade by any MLB pitcher. He also won at least twenty games in each of eight seasons and received three Cy Young Awards and four Gold Gloves during the decade. His 268 career victories are currently an Orioles record. In 1991, Palmer attempted a comeback with the Orioles. Palmer said that he wanted to make sure that he had not retired too early. ESPN, which was trying to cut expenses, had asked him to take a pay cut and to sign a three-year contract. Palmer said he would sign a one-year contract for less pay, but ESPN refused. \\"I wouldn't be here today if the broadcasting climate had been more to my liking. That was really my prime motivation, the fact that I no longer had that obligation\\", Palmer said during spring training. Covering Palmer's spring training workouts, Richard Hoffer of Sports Illustrated said that Palmer's comeback was not entirely about money. He wrote that \\"it is fair to suspect that a certain vanity is involved.\\" Hoffer said that Palmer \\"has failed to excite either ridicule or astonishment. He's in fabulous condition, no question. But no matter whom he lines up with on the row of practice mounds, there is more pop in the gloves of catchers other than his.\\" While working out at the University of Miami during his comeback attempt, Palmer was approached by Miami assistant coach Lazaro Collazo. Collazo reportedly told him, \\"You'll never get into the Hall of Fame with those mechanics.\\" \\"I'm already in the Hall of Fame\\", Palmer replied. To help Palmer's pitching motion, Collazo and Palmer completed unusual drills that involved Palmer placing a knee or foot on a chair as he tossed the ball. After giving up five hits and two runs in two innings of a spring training game, he retired permanently. Palmer said that he tore his hamstring while warming up for the game, commenting, \\"I'm not saying I wouldn't like to continue, but I can't\\", he said. \\"I heard something pop in my leg yesterday. It wasn't a nice sound. I don't know what that means, but I think it's going to play havoc with my tennis game.\\" He retired with a 268-152 win-loss record and a 2.86 ERA.

The film follows the story of Brockovich, a single mother struggling to make ends meet who stumbles upon a substantial legal case concerning a large utility company named Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E). The company is accused of contaminating the water supply of the small town of Hinkley, California, with dangerous levels of chromium-6, which led to numerous health issues among the residents. Brockovich's tenacity and relentless pursuit of justice for the affected community resulted in a significant lawsuit against PG&E and ultimately, the largest direct action settlement in US history at that time – 333 million. Julia Roberts' portrayal of Erin Brockovish earned her widespread praise from critics and audiences alike. Her exceptional acting skills truly brought to life the diverse aspects of the character, from her determination and courage to her vulnerability and the challenges she faces as a single mother. This role was a milestone for Roberts' career and solidified her as a top-tier actress in Hollywood. In recognition of her stupendous performance, Julia Roberts was awarded the Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role at the 73rd Annual Academy Awards held on March 25, 2001. This achievement was particularly significant, marking Roberts' first and only Academy Award win to date, despite having received multiple nominations in the past.

While lucrative, the implant has cost Johnny his childhood memories, and he seeks to have the implant removed to regain his memories back; his handler, Ralfi assigns him one more job that would cover the costs of the operation (which are extremely expensive), sending Johnny to Beijing to deliver the latest information. On the way to the job, in the elevator he uses a Pemex Memory Doubler to upgrade his memory capacity from 80 gigabytes to 160 gigabytes. At the designated place, he finds a group of frantic scientists watching anime who have the data he is to carry, but at 320 GB it far exceeds Johnny's storage capacity, even with the use of compression folders to decrease the size of the information, and if he tries to upload the data in, the remaining amount of data will be uploaded directly in his brain, causing severe psychological damage and potentially, death. Johnny accepts anyway, in need of the money. After uploading their data, the group is massacred by Yakuza, but Johnny manages to escape with a portion of the encryption password. After contacting Ralfi, Johnny returns to Newark and soon finds that two groups are after the data he carries. One is the international pharmacological company, Pharmakom, led by its United States executive, Takahashi, who believes the data to be critical to the company's interests. The other is the Yakuza guided by Shinji, who wishes to deny this information to Takahashi and claim it for themselves. Johnny soon learns that Ralfi is in the Yakuza's employ, and ready to kill Johnny to extract the data storage hardware.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"less effect. When there is no oxygen to breathe in, the oxygen levels in the air decrease significantly. This directly affects the process of oxygen absorption and distribution throughout the body. When the diaphragm contracts and the lungs expand, air is still pulled into the lungs; however, this air has a lower concentration of oxygen molecules. As a result, the membranes in the lungs collect fewer oxygen molecules to transfer to the red blood cells. Consequently, red blood cells have less oxygen to distribute throughout the body, leading to a reduced oxygen supply for various body tissues and organs. This perturbation, or disruption in the availability of oxygen, creates a \\"less effect\\" on the subsequent processes in the respiratory system.

The estimate of tonnes of bombs an enemy could drop per day grew as aircraft technology advanced, from 75 in 1922, to 150 in 1934, to 644 in 1937. That year the Committee on Imperial Defence estimated that an attack of 60 days would result in 600,000 dead and 1,200,000 wounded. News reports of the Spanish Civil War, such as the bombing of Barcelona, supported the 50-casualties-per-tonne estimate. By 1938 experts generally expected that Germany would attempt to drop as much as 3,500 tonnes in the first 24 hours of war and average 700 tonnes a day for several weeks. In addition to high explosive and incendiary bombs the enemy would possibly use poison gas and even bacteriological warfare, all with a high degree of accuracy.

In 1922, they estimated that an enemy could drop 75 tonnes of bombs per day, which increased to 150 tonnes in 1934, and further to 644 tonnes in 1937.

By 1938, experts generally expected Germany to attempt to drop as much as 3,500 tonnes in the first 24 hours of war and average 700 tonnes a day for several weeks.

In Sentence 1, \\"From 1931 to the outbreak of the Second World War in Shanghai in 1939, he worked in Europe,\\" the focus is on the time frame, which is emphasized at the beginning of the sentence. It primarily highlights the duration of the person's work, starting in 1931, and lasting till the Second World War began in Shanghai in 1939. The location where the person worked, Europe, comes at the end of the sentence. The wording implies that the outbreak of World War II in Europe caused the person to cease working in Shanghai.

The temporal information \\"from 1931 until the outbreak of World War II in Europe in 1939\\" comes after introducing that the person worked, making the time period secondary to the act of working. While these differences in structure and emphasis may not significantly alter the information conveyed in the sentences, they indicate that the sentences were potentially written with slightly different intentions.

Ranked as a beta world city, the city is Pakistan's premier industrial and financial centre. Karachi is also Pakistan's most cosmopolitan city. Located on the shores of the Arabian Sea, Karachi is a major transportation hub. The city is home to two of Pakistan's two largest seaports, the Port of Karachi and Port Bin Qasim, as well as the busiest airport in Pakistan. - A parliamentary republic is a republic that operates under a parliamentary system of government where the executive branch (the government) derives its legitimacy from and is accountable to the legislature (the parliament). There are a number of variations of parliamentary republics. Most have a clear differentiation between the head of government and the head of state, with the head of government holding real power, much like constitutional monarchies. Some have combined the roles of head of state and head of government, much like presidential systems, but with a dependency upon parliamentary power. - The Port of Karachi (\\"Bandar gh Karch\\") is one of South Asia's largest and busiest deep-water seaports, handling about 60% of the nation's cargo (25 million tons per annum) located in Karachi, Pakistan.

The key to deciphering these messages might be right at our feet--literally. Body language experts suggest that observing the movements and positions of a person's feet and knees can reveal vital information about their thoughts, feelings, and even intentions. In this article, we explore the importance of this often-overlooked aspect of nonverbal communication and how you can successfully tap into its hidden messages. The Role of Feet and Knees in Body Language While facial expressions and arm movements tend to be the center of attention when discussing body language, our feet and knees can provide valuable insights into one's emotions and attitude as well. This is primarily because these parts of the body are typically less controlled and, therefore, can unintentionally reveal feelings that people are trying to hide consciously. In fact, the direction of one's toes, the positions of their legs, and the movement of their feet can offer clues to a person's true thoughts during a conversation. Decoding the Direction of Toes When you are interacting with someone, pay close attention to the direction their toes are pointing. If their toes are pointed towards you, this generally indicates interest and engagement in the conversation. In contrast, if their toes are pointed away from you or towards an exit, it may be a sign that they want to leave or remove themselves from the conversation. This subtle yet vital piece of information can help you gauge the level of interest in your discussion and determine if it is worth delving deeper or switching topics. The Restlessness of Feet and Legs Constantly moving or tapping feet can also convey important messages about a person's emotional state. Restless feet and legs signal discomfort, anxiety, or impatience. If you notice that the person you are talking to has restless legs or tapping feet, it might be a sign that they are looking for a way to escape the conversation or may be experiencing increased anxiety. This knowledge can help you adjust your approach accordingly, either by addressing their concerns or allowing them space to express their emotions. Reading Knees and Spatial Orientation Another crucial aspect of body language is the position of a person's knees concerning the person they are interacting with. If both their feet and knees are facing you, this often signifies openness and engagement in the conversation. However, if their knees are pointed away from you, it can indicate discomfort or an attempt to create distance. Observing these signals can provide an opportunity to assess how comfortable and receptive the other person is towards your dialogue, enabling you to adjust your approach as needed. Conclusion While facial expressions and gestures are undoubtedly vital components of body language, the movements and positions of our feet and knees can also give away subtle clues about a person's true thoughts and emotions. By paying attention to the direction of their toes, the restlessness of their legs, and the orientation of their knees, you can gain a better understanding of their mindset and adjust your approach accordingly. Remember, the language of feet and knees can speak volumes if you know how to listen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The African Space Research Programme founder has been helped by 600 volunteers. And once the African Skyhawk has had a successful test flight sometime next year, the 28-year-old plans to turn his hand to building the continent's first space shuttle. He firmly believes it will launch in the next 'four to six years'. But given the condition of his project at the moment, he might be advised to buy a gigantic rubber band to help it on its way. The former astronomy student said: 'It isn't about money, it isn't about competition or pride. 'The mission is about advancement in space technology as a continent and what we can contribute towards that growth. 'We are trying to have Africa participate in the contribution of knowledge into mankind's destiny.' The cynical may question how NSamba can launch his own space programme without any money, and be entirely reliant on donations. Is he mad? Chris NSamba's mother, Sarah Lugwama, watches as the African Skyhawk is constructed in her backyard. The former astronomy student said: 'We are trying to have Africa participate in the contribution of knowledge into mankind's destiny.' Chris Nsamba leans against the wing of the Skyhawk. He is confident the Skyhawk's test flight will take place next year, and he will have a fully fledged space shuttle in operation in 'four to six years'. They may also ask how it can be achieved, seeing as Uganda has no history of space exploration and he is teaching the aspiring astronauts himself. But he said he was confident the Skyhawk's test flight would take place next year, and he would have a fully fledged space shuttle in operation in 'four to six years'. He added: 'This is not a one-man mission. We work jointly to achieve goals. 'I have trained my crew (in) advanced astronomy. They are very good at astronomy in regards to calculations and identifications of various space objects.' And when asked how he plans to simulate zero gravity for training, he said it would be 'easy'. He added: 'I've got a jet engine on order so I'm planning to build a tunnel, put the engine at one end and when I throw a guy in he'll float in a similar way to how he would in space.' NSamba, who admits that 'one time or another every successful scientists has been called a madman' has been toiling away in his mother's backyard, in the Kampala suburb of Ntinda, for three years. But despite the challenges he faces, he said was confident his space shuttle, dubbed The Dynacraft, would be ready sooner rather than later. And he cited funding from foreigners, and the promise of cash from the Ugandan government, as markers to their ongoing success. He said: 'It will first operate in Earth's lower orbit then advance with time. We might not have money in our system but we do get our homework done.'

Article: YUXI, China -- Many people of this city in southwester China spent Saturday night in tents, too scared to sleep in their homes after an earthquake which killed 188 people early that morning. Countless homes were destroyed and lots of people became homeless after the earthquake which is believed to have a magnitude of 7. The quake was not as serious as the 7.9-magnitude earthquake in 2008 that left more than 70,000 people dead in the Wenchuan area. But villagers who work in Chengdu, about 100 miles away, hurried back home Sunday morning, many on foot, the lucky ones on motorbikes, to check on their homes. Song Yuanqing, 43, a worker, arrived back after a 22-hour trip and found his house was still there but had already been very unstable . \\"We would like to do something, but we can't do anything,\\" Mr. Song said as he sat with neighbors around an outdoor fire built by the village leader in his backyard. In all, the government sent about 7,000 soldiers and People's Armed Police officers to the earthquake-hit area. By Saturday evening, there were so many rescue workers in the area that the government asked volunteers to stop coming. Li Keqiang, China's prime minister, flew to the area and slept in a tent on Saturday evening in Lushan County. The earthquake shook Sichuan Province at 8 a.m., when people were getting up a little later than usual because schools and universities were closed. \\"We were just getting up and getting dressed in our dormitory when the building shook, and I looked outside from our window and saw a row of houses had collapsed,\\" Xu Yan, 22, a student at the Agricultural University in Ya'an, said in a telephone interview. \\" _ .\\" The Chinese government said early Sunday that the death toll was 174, and about 5,700 people had been injured. The earthquake was also felt in Chengdu, one of China's biggest cities and the capital of Sichuan Province. People described water getting out of home aquariums and things like balls falling to the floor. In the town of Longmen, another hard-hit area near Ya'an,... Question: When did the quake take place in Ya'an? On _ . Options: A: Saturday morning B: Sunday morning C: Saturday night D: Sunday night The answer is:","completion":"A: Saturday morning Step 1: Identify relevant information in the article. The article states that \\"an earthquake which killed 188 people early that morning\\" and that \\"the earthquake shook Sichuan Province at 8 a.m.\\" These two pieces of information are relevant to the question. Step 2: Match the information to the given options. From the information provided, \\"early that morning\\" and \\"8 a.m.\\" suggest that the earthquake happened during the morning. Step 3: Determine the correct option. Both quotes refer to the morning, and since the only morning options are A: Saturday morning and B: Sunday morning, you can rule out C: Saturday night and D: Sunday night. The article clearly states that people spent Saturday night in tents because of the earthquake that happened earlier in the day. Therefore, the answer is A: Saturday morning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The actual dimensions of so-called Langstroth frames differ by region or manufacturer. These modern Langstroth hives have little in common with Rev. L. L. Langstroth's bee hive that was originally patented in 1852 and manufactured until approximately 1920. - Clostridium botulinum is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, anaerobic, spore-forming, motile bacterium with the ability to produce the neurotoxin botulinum. The botulinum toxin can cause a severe flaccid paralytic disease in humans and other animals and is the most potent toxin known to mankind, natural or synthetic, with a lethal dose of 1.32.1 ng/kg in humans. - A honey super is a part of a commercial or other managed ( such as by a hobbyist ) beehive that is used to collect honey . The most common variety is the \`\` Illinois '' or \`\` medium '' super with a depth of 6 inches , in the length and width dimensions of a Langstroth hive . A honey super consists of a box in which 8 -- 10 frames are hung . Western honeybees collect nectar and store the processed nectar in honeycomb , which they build on the frames . When the honeycomb is full , the bees will reduce the moisture content of the honey to 17 - 18 % moisture content before capping the comb with beeswax . Beekeepers will take the full honey supers and extract the honey . Periods when there is an abundant nectar source available and bees are quickly bringing back the nectar , are called a honey flow . During a honey flow , beekeepers may put several honey supers onto a hive so the bees have enough storage space . Honey supers are removed in the fall when the honey is extracted , and before the hive is winterized , but enough honey is left for the bees to consume during Winter . - Nutrition is the science that interprets the interaction of nutrients and other substances in food in relation to maintenance, growth, reproduction, health and disease of an organism. It includes food intake, absorption, assimilation, biosynthesis, catabolism and excretion. - A tablespoon is a large spoon used for eating or serving. In most English-speaking regions, the term now refers to a large spoon used for serving, however, in some regions, including parts of Canada, it is the largest type of spoon used for eating. By extension, the term is used as a measure of volume in cooking. In this capacity, it is most commonly abbreviated \\"tbsp\\" or \\"T,\\" and occasionally referred to as a \\"tablespoonful\\" to distinguish it from the utensil. The unit of measurement varies by region: a United States tablespoon is approximately 14.8 ml, a United Kingdom tablespoon is exactly 15 ml, and an Australian tablespoon is 20 ml. The capacity of the utensil (as opposed to the measurement) is not defined by law or custom and bears no particular relation to the measurement. - A burn is a type of injury to skin, or other tissues, caused by heat, cold, electricity, chemicals, friction, or radiation. Most burns are due to heat from hot liquids, solids, or fire. Females in many areas of the world have a higher risk related to the more frequent use of open cooking fires or unsafe cook stoves. Alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors. Burns can also occur as a result of self harm or violence between people. Burns that affect only the superficial skin layers are known as superficial or first-degree burns. They appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days. When the injury extends into some of the underlying skin layer, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. Blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful. Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur. In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin. Often there is no pain and the burn area is stiff. Healing typically does not occur on its own. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone. The burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part. Burns are generally preventable. Treatment depends on the severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection.... - Beekeeping is the maintenance of honey bee colonies, commonly in hives, by humans. A beekeeper (or apiarist) keeps bees in order to collect their honey and other products that the hive produces (including beeswax, propolis, pollen, and royal jelly), to pollinate crops, or to produce bees for sale to other beekeepers. A location where bees are kept is called an apiary or \\"bee yard\\". - A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity. - Botulism is a rare and potentially fatal illness caused by a toxin, produced by the bacterium \\"Clostridium botulinum\\". The disease begins with weakness, trouble seeing, feeling tired, and trouble speaking. This may then be followed by weakness of the arms, chest muscles, and legs. The disease does not usually affect consciousness or cause a fever. Botulism can be spread several different ways. The bacterial spores which cause it are common in both soil and water. They produce the botulinum toxin when exposed to low oxygen levels and certain temperatures. Foodborne botulism happens when food containing the toxin is eaten. Infant botulism happens when the bacteria develops in the intestines and releases the toxin. This typically only occurs in children less than six months old, as protective mechanisms develop after that time. Wound botulism is found most often among those who inject street drugs. In this situation, spores enter a wound, and in the absence of oxygen, release the toxin. It is not passed directly between people. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding the toxin or bacteria in the person in question. Prevention is primarily by proper food preparation. The toxin, though not the organism, is destroyed by heating it to more than for longer than 5 minutes. Honey can contain the organism, and for this reason, honey should not be fed to children under 12 months. Treatment is with an antitoxin. In those who lose their ability to breathe on their own, mechanical ventilation may be necessary for months. Antibiotics may be used for wound botulism. Death occurs in 5 to 10% of people. Botulism can affect many other animals. The word is from Latin, \\"botulus\\", meaning sausage. Early descriptions of botulism date from at least as far back as 1793 in Germany. - Interaction is a kind of action that occurs as two or more objects have an effect upon one another. The idea of a two-way effect is essential in the concept of interaction, as opposed to a one-way causal effect. A closely related term is interconnectivity, which deals with the interactions of interactions within systems: combinations of many simple interactions can lead to surprising emergent phenomena. \\"Interaction\\" has different tailored meanings in various sciences. Changes can also involve interaction. - In medicine, an adverse effect is an undesired harmful effect resulting from a medication or other intervention such as surgery. - A wound is a type of injury which happens relatively quickly in which skin is torn, cut, or punctured (an \\"open\\" wound), or where blunt force trauma causes a contusion (a \\"closed\\" wound). In pathology, it specifically refers to a sharp injury which damages the dermis of the skin. - Aphids, also known as plant lice and in Britain and the Commonwealth as greenflies, blackflies, or whiteflies (not to be confused with \\"jumping plant lice\\" or true whiteflies), are small sap-sucking insects, and members of the superfamily Aphidoidea. Many species are green but other commonly occurring species may be white and wooly, brown, or black. Aphids are among the most destructive insect pests on cultivated plants in temperate regions. They are capable of extremely rapid increase in numbers by asexual reproduction. The damage they do to plants has made them enemies of farmers and gardeners around the world. From a zoological standpoint they are a highly successful group of organisms. - Honey is a sugary food substance produced and stored by certain social hymenopteran insects. It is produced from the sugary secretions of plants or insects, such as floral nectar or aphid honeydew, through regurgitation, enzymatic activity, and water evaporation. The variety of honey produced by honey bees (the genus \\"Apis\\") is the most well-known, due to its worldwide commercial production and human consumption. Honey gets its sweetness from the monosaccharides fructose and glucose, and has about the same relative sweetness as granulated sugar. It has attractive chemical properties for baking and a distinctive flavor that leads some people to prefer it to sugar and other sweeteners. Most microorganisms do not grow in honey, so sealed honey does not spoil, even after thousands of years. However, honey sometimes contains dormant endospores of the bacterium \\"Clostridium botulinum\\", which can be dangerous to babies, as it may result in botulism. People who have a weakened immune system should not eat honey because of the risk of bacterial or fungal infection. Although some evidence indicates honey may be effective in treating diseases and other medical conditions, such as wounds and burns, the overall evidence for its use in therapy is not conclusive. Providing 64 calories in a typical serving of one tablespoon (15 ml) equivalent to 1272 kj per 100 g, honey has no significant nutritional value. Honey is generally safe, but may have various, potential adverse effects or interactions with excessive consumption, existing disease conditions, or drugs. Honey use and production have a long and varied history as an ancient activity, depicted in Valencia, Spain by a cave painting of humans foraging for honey at least 8,000 years ago. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Flora is the plant life occurring in a particular region or time, generally the naturally occurring or indigenousnative plant life. The corresponding term for animal life is fauna. \\"Flora\\", \\"fauna\\" and other forms of life such as fungi are collectively referred to as biota. Sometimes bacteria and fungi are also referred to as flora, as in the terms gut flora or skin flora. - A honey bee (or honeybee) is any bee member of the genus Apis, primarily distinguished by the production and storage of honey and the construction of perennial, colonial nests from wax. Currently, only seven species of honey bee are recognized, with a total of 44 subspecies, though historically, from six to eleven species have been recognized. The best known honey bee is the Western honey bee which has been domesticated for honey production and crop pollination. Honey bees represent only a small fraction of the roughly 20,000 known species of bees. Some other types of related bees produce and store honey, including the stingless honey bees, but only members of the genus \\"Apis\\" are true honey bees. The study of bees including honey bees is known as melittology. - Nectar is a sugar-rich liquid produced by plants in glands called nectaries, either within the flowers with which it attracts pollinating animals, or by extrafloral nectaries, which provide a nutrient source to animal mutualists, which in turn provide antiherbivore protection. Common nectar-consuming pollinators include mosquitoes, hoverflies, wasps, bees, butterflies and moths, hummingbirds, and bats. Nectar plays an important role in the foraging economics and overall evolution of nectar-eating species; for example, nectar and its properties are responsible for the differential evolution of the African honey bee, \\"A. m. scutellata\\" and the western honey bee. - Fructose, or fruit sugar, is a simple ketonic monosaccharide found in many plants, where it is often bonded to glucose to form the disaccharide sucrose. It is one of the three dietary monosaccharides, along with glucose and galactose, that are absorbed directly into the bloodstream during digestion. Fructose was discovered by French chemist Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut in 1847. The name \\"fructose\\" was coined in 1857 by the English chemist William Miller. Pure, dry fructose is a very sweet, white, odorless, crystalline solid and is the most water-soluble of all the sugars. Fructose is found in honey, tree and vine fruits, flowers, berries, and most root vegetables. What entity does 'honey super' has the relation 'field of work' with?

(Phil Bock/The Sheboygan Press via AP) (Associated Press) NAPLES, Fla. (AP) — It takes about 22 hours to reach Florida by car for a person traveling from Wisconsin. But if you're a cat, the 1,484-mile journey likely takes closer to two months. At least that's how long it took Nadia, the Russian blue, to trek from her home on a snowy December day to sunny Naples this week where animal officials helped find her owners. The Naples Daily News (http://bit.ly/1TB3rJy) reports Cheri Stocker adopted the cat nine months ago in Wisconsin. On Christmas Eve, the cat escaped. A Naples woman found the kitty in North Naples. Workers at an animal shelter found the cat's microchip and, through a pet relocation service, got hold of Stocker's sister, who had been listed as an emergency contact. ___ Information from: Naples (Fla.) Daily News, http://www.naplesnews.com ||||| Nadia waits in a cage at Collier County Domestic Animal Services to be reunited with her owner. The cat somehow travelled to Naples from Wisconsin where she was picked up and traced to her owners this week. (Submitted photo) SHARE By Kristine Gill of the Naples Daily News It takes about 22 hours and five minutes to reach Naples, Florida by car for anyone traveling from Sheboygan, Wisconsin. But if you're a cat, the 1,484-mile journey will probably take you closer to two months. At least that's how long it took Nadia, the Russian blue, to trek from her home on a snowy December day to sunny Naples this week where animal officials helped find her owners. Her mode of transportation? \\"I have no clue,\\" owner Cheri Stocker said by phone Wednesday. Stocker and her husband adopted the cat about nine months ago and renamed her Nadia. On Christmas Eve, she escaped from their home through a door that had been forced open with the wind. \\"We looked and looked everywhere that we could but it was Christmas Eve and it was very windy — she could have been up in a tree hiding under a bush,\\" Stocker said. Days passed and then weeks and the Stockers assumed Nadia had not survived the harsh winter. \\"She doesn't have the coat for it,\\" Stocker said. Then on Monday, Stocker's sister got a phone call. A Naples woman found the gray cat in North Naples on Pebble Shores Drive and had a friend take her in to Collier County Domestic Animal Services. Workers there found the cat's microchip and, through a pet relocation service, got a hold of Stocker's sister who had been listed as an emergency contact. Stocker couldn't believe it. \\"I went to her house to listen to the message,\\" Stocker said. Stocker isn't sure how Nadia could have wandered so far from home, but she has one idea. \\"We do have a couple of businesses around within a few miles,\\" she said. \\"Maybe she got into a pallet and onto a semi.\\" From there, news outlets wrote about the animal and volunteers came forward offering to transport the cat home. \\"I cannot believe the outpouring of people that have called to help,\\" Stocker said. Nadia was scheduled to arrive home Wednesday evening after two women volunteered to fly her back. Until she gets to see her cat again, Stocker said she can only imagine what her pet has been through the past two months. What she does know is Nadia got to soak up some sun in Naples like she was on vacation. \\"I didn't get to take one this year, but she did,\\" Stocker said. ||||| The journey home is almost over for Nadia the cat. She made it from Sheboygan to Naples, Florida when she went missing on Christmas Eve. How she did it, no one knows. But her family traveled to Rockford, Illinois to anxiously wait their reunion. Cheri Stocker, Nadia's owner, has gotten used to waiting and watching and worrying. Nadia went missing Christmas Eve when she escaped out the back door of her Sheboygan home. The family spent weeks searching the neighborhood. Cheri had feared the worst , but still left out a bowl of food every day hoping Nadia would come back. Finally, a call she never expected: Nadia had been found, in Florida. \\"It was unbelievable,\\" Cheri says. But the next problem was - how to get her back? Dozens of people offered to drive Nadia home. But an Allegiant Air worker had a better solution - a flight attendant that regularly flies in and out of the airport in Rockford, Illinois could bring Nadia home. \\"How this was going to all fall together, amazing,\\" says Cheri, shaking her head. Cheri and her husband left their house at 5:30 this morning ready to see Nadia again. As passenger after passenger got off the plane, Cheri got more anxious. Finally she saw the cat carrier. \\"Oh my god,\\" says Cheri. With tears in her eyes she runs up and clutches it. She has Nadia again. \\"I didn't think we would ever see her again so it's a miracle,\\" says Cheri. After seeing Nadia, Cheri ran over to one of the many strangers, now friends, who made the reunion possible. \\"It's just I can't, I can't say thank you enough,\\" Cheri says. She says there were at least a half a dozen people who helped bring Nadia back home, each one asking nothing in return. She says she can never fully repay what has been done for her, so she plans to pay it forward in acts of kindness. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A Russian Blue cat named Nadia, after escaping from her home in Sheboygan, Wisconsin on Christmas Eve, was found two months later and 1,484 miles away in Naples, Florida.

After weeks of searching and assuming Nadia hadn't survived the harsh winter, they received a call from an animal shelter in Naples.

During a time of racial segregation in the United States, courtrooms were often divided into sections for white and colored people.

Atticus, the children's father and the defending attorney for Tom Robinson, did not wish for them to be present in court due to the mature and potentially traumatic nature of the proceedings. Despite his wishes, when there were no available seating on the main floor, the children were invited by Reverend Sykes to watch the ongoing legal proceedings in the colored balcony, where African Americans were relegated due to segregated and discriminatory practices of the era.

Article:The 18-year-old, Harun Causevic, had been held on a preventative detention order but was released on Monday night and then re-arrested. He appeared in court on Tuesday, according to local media. He was one of five teenagers arrested over an alleged plot to carry out an attack during an Anzac memorial event. Two of the teenagers have since been released but two others were charged with conspiracy to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts. Police said in a statement that one of them, Sevdet Besim, had been remanded in custody and would appear in court again on Friday. The other was an 18-year-old who was also charged on weapons offences. Meanwhile, it emerged on Monday that a 14-year-old boy from Blackburn in the UK has also been held over the alleged terror plot in Melbourne. Police said that he had been detained after officers searched some of his electronic devices and found messages to a man in Australia. The messages on devices linked to the boy led to the Melbourne raids, UK police have said. A team of UK officers have now arrived in Australia to help with the joint investigation. On Tuesday, the premier of Victoria, Daniel Andrews, said that a \\"sign of strength and unity\\" was needed in the wake of these incidents. He urged people to attend Anzac Day services later this week. \\"This is not about faith. This is an affront to faith. This sort of conduct has got nothing to do with religious observance at all,\\" Mr Andrews said, according to ABC News. Nearly 200 police officers took part in the Melbourne operation early on Saturday morning. Once of the five teenagers arrested has since complained of mistreatment during the raids. Some of the men's families have also accused the police of using excessive force. Acting Assistant Commissioner Tim Cartwright said that police were investigating the complaints.

It was named after King Lothair II who received this territory after the kingdom of Middle Francia of his father Lothair I was divided among his sons in 855. - The House of Valois-Burgundy, or the Younger House of Burgundy, was a noble French family deriving from the royal House of Valois. It is distinct from the Capetian House of Burgundy, descendants of King Robert II of France, though both houses stem from the Capetian dynasty. They ruled the Duchy of Burgundy from 1363 to 1482 and later came to rule vast lands including Artois, Flanders, Luxembourg, Hainault, the county palatine of Burgundy (Franche-Comté), and other lands through marriage. - The Duke of Brabant was formally the ruler of the Duchy of Brabant since 1183/1184. The title was created by the German Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in favor of Henry I of the House of Reginar, son of Godfrey III of Leuven (who was Duke of Lower Lotharingia at that time). The Duchy of Brabant was a feudal elevation of the since 1085/1086 existing title of Landgrave of Brabant. This was an Imperial fief which was assigned to Count Henry III of Leuven shortly after the death of the preceding Count of Brabant, Count Palatine Herman II of Lotharingia (born 20 September 1085). Although the corresponding county was quite small (limited to the territory between the rivers Senne and Dender) its name was applied to the entire country under control of the Dukes from the 13th century on. In 1190, after the death of Godfrey III, Henry I also became Duke of Lotharingia. Formerly Lower Lotharingia, this title was now practically without territorial authority, but was borne by the later Dukes of Brabant as an honorific title. - The House of Luxembourg was a late medieval European royal family, whose members between 1308 and 1437 ruled as King of the Romans and Holy Roman Emperors as well as Kings of Bohemia (\\"eští králové, König von Böhmen\\") and Hungary.

They were the first dynasty of the County of Hainault and they supplied two Dukes of Lorraine and the Landgraves and later Dukes of Brabant, Dukes of Lothier and Dukes of Limburg. The main branch extinguished in 1355, leaving its duchies to the House of Luxembourg which in turn left them to the House of Valois-Burgundy in 1383.

Answer the following question: Information: - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament. - The International Pentecostal Holiness Church ( IPHC ) or simply Pentecostal Holiness Church ( PHC ) is a Pentecostal Christian denomination founded in 1911 with the merger of two older denominations . Historically centered in the Southeastern United States , particularly the Carolinas and Georgia , the Pentecostal Holiness Church now has an international presence . In 2000 , the church reported a worldwide membership of over one million -- over three million including affiliates . Heavily influenced by two major American revival movements -- the holiness movement of the late 19th century and the Pentecostal revival of the early 20th century -- the church 's theological roots derive from John Wesley 's teachings on sanctification . Several ministers who were raised in the Pentecostal Holiness Church have come to have greater name recognition than the church itself , such as Oral Roberts , an internationally known charismatic evangelist ; Charles Stanley , a former president of the Southern Baptist Convention ; and C.M. Ward , a former Assemblies of God radio preacher . - Apostolic succession is the method whereby the ministry of the Christian Church is held to be derived from the apostles by a continuous succession, which has usually been associated with a claim that the succession is through a series of bishops. This series was seen originally as that of the bishops of a particular see founded by one or more of the apostles. According to historian Justo L. González, apostolic succession is generally understood today as meaning a series of bishops, regardless of see, each consecrated by other bishops, themselves consecrated similarly in a succession going back to the apostles. But, according to documentation produced by the Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue Between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church, the sees (\\"cathedrae\\") play \\"an important role in inserting the bishop into the heart of ecclesial apostolicity\\". - A Christian denomination is a distinct religious body within Christianity, identified by traits such as a name, organisation, leadership and doctrine. Individual bodies, however, may use alternative terms to describe themselves, such as church or sometimes fellowship. Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine; issues such as the nature of Jesus, the authority of apostolic succession, eschatology, and papal primacy may separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices, and historical ties are sometimes known as \\"branches of Christianity\\" or \\"denominational families\\". - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. What object entity has the relation of 'religion' with the subject 'international pentecostal holiness church'?

Movie plot: Cliff Spab (Stephen Dorff) and his friend Joe Dice (Jack Noseworthy) are two slackers who go out one evening to buy some beer in a Los Angeles convenience store. While there, a group of masked and heavily armed terrorists take Cliff, Joe, and three other people hostage. The terrorists, who call themselves S.P.L.T.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: In June 1911 Holst and his Morley College students gave the first performance since the seventeenth century of Purcell's The Fairy-Queen. The full score had been lost soon after Purcell's death in 1695, and had only recently been found. Twenty-eight Morley students copied out the complete vocal and orchestral parts. There were 1,500 pages of music and it took the students almost eighteen months to copy them out in their spare time. A concert performance of the work was given at The Old Vic, preceded by an introductory talk by Vaughan Williams. The Times praised Holst and his forces for \\"a most interesting and artistic performance of this very important work\\".After this success, Holst was disappointed the following year by the lukewarm reception of his choral work The Cloud Messenger. He again went travelling, accepting an invitation from H. Balfour Gardiner to join him and the brothers Clifford and Arnold Bax in Spain. During this holiday Clifford Bax introduced Holst to astrology, an interest that later inspired his suite The Planets. Holst cast his friends' horoscopes for the rest of his life and referred to astrology as his \\"pet vice\\".In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School opened a new music wing, and Holst composed St Paul's Suite for the occasion. The new building contained a sound-proof room, handsomely equipped, where he could work undisturbed. Holst and his family moved to a house in Brook Green, very close to the school. For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities. In 1917 they moved to a house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925. Guess a valid title for it!

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What year was the school founded by the Bull brothers demolished? from the following article ? Before the 1760s, Westgate consisted of only a farm, a coastguard station (built 1791 and still standing in Old Boundary Road) and a few cottages for the crew that surrounded it. These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited its name from the Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide. During the late 1860s, businessmen developed the area into a seaside resort for the upper to middle-classes. A stretch of sea wall, with promenade on top, was constructed around the beaches at St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, and the land divided into plots to be sold for what would become an exclusive development by the sea for wealthy metropolitan families within a gated community, rather than for occasional tourists. The opening of a railway station, in 1871, led to the rapid expansion of the population, which reached 2,738 by 1901. The demands of the increasing population led to the building of the parish churches of St. James in 1872 and St. Saviour in 1884. St. Saviour's was designed by the architect C.N. Beazley. In 1884 it was reported that Essex, on the other side of the Thames Estuary, was hit by a tremor so large that it caused the bells of St. James' Church to ring. In 1884, ownership of most of the resort passed to Coutts Bank, after the previous proprietors had gone bankrupt.Around twenty schools were opened during the late 19th century, although many had only a few pupils or closed within a few years. The largest of the schools were Streete Court School, Wellington House Preparatory School and St Michael's School.Wellington House was established in 1886 by two clergymen, the Bull brothers. It closed in 1970 and was demolished in 1972. Notable old boys included Doctor Who actor Jon Pertwee and...

Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3] I am facing a new situation today: Deep lake presents geothermal activity, while Shallow lake has mixing of saline water with fresh water. Deep lake had more instances of divers having problems because of thermoclines. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which lake has warmer water the bottom? A:","completion":"A: Based on the information provided in the background article and the specific conditions of the two lakes, it can be concluded that Deep lake has warmer water at the bottom. Here's a detailed explanation: In the case of Shallow lake, there is a mixing of saline water with fresh water. According to the background article, when fresh, cold water enters a warmer sea, the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, leading to a temperature rise as the diver descends. However, this situation does not guarantee that the water temperature at the bottom of Shallow lake will be warmer than at the surface, as the temperature change can be overridden by other factors, such as air temperature and sunlight warming the shallower water. At most, the fresh water mixing with saline water can create a thermocline, causing a notable temperature change while descending, but not necessarily a warmer bottom layer. On the other hand, Deep lake exhibits geothermal activity, which can significantly affect the water temperature at deeper levels. The article mentions that in lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water due to the heat coming from the Earth's interior. This geothermal heating often leads to convection currents as the heated bottom water rises and cooler surface water sinks, which can create a warmer temperature zone near the bottom of the lake. This phenomenon would also explain the higher rate of divers experiencing problems with thermoclines in Deep lake when compared to Shallow lake. In conclusion, based on the described circumstances, it is more likely that Deep lake has warmer water at the bottom due to the presence of geothermal activity providing heat from below."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: As shown here, pressure decreases to less than 25% of ground-level atmospheric pressure when we get to an altitude of about six miles. Since this is a common cruising altitude for commercial airplanes, pressurized cabins are needed for the comfort and survival of the passengers. This is because the density of the air decreases along with the decreasing air pressure, so there is less oxygen in a breath of air. You've probably noticed this effect in high-mountain areas, as it often feels harder to breath. I am facing a new situation today: John likes to ride on hot air balloon. Last month he rode on a balloon with his friend Keith. First they were at the ground-level. They called it camp A. Then they rose to the height of three miles. They called it camp B. Eventually, they reached six miles above ground. They called it camp C. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Where the air would be denser, camp A or camp B? Answer:","completion":"The air would be denser at camp A, which is at the ground level. In the background article you read, it explained that air pressure and density decrease as altitude increases. This is because the Earth's atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), along with some other trace gases. As you go higher in altitude, there are fewer particles of these gases due to the force of gravity pulling them towards the Earth's surface. At camp A, which is at ground-level, the air pressure is higher resulting in a higher air density. When John and Keith ascended to camp B, which is three miles in altitude, the air pressure and density would have decreased due to their increased distance from the Earth's surface. This effect continues as they reach camp C, which is six miles above ground, where the pressure drops to less than 25% of ground-level atmospheric pressure. Since air density is directly related to air pressure, the decreasing pressure as altitude increases results in a less dense atmosphere. Therefore, when comparing camp A and camp B, the air would be denser at camp A due to its lower altitude and higher atmospheric pressure. This also correlates with the observation that it is harder to breathe in high-mountain areas, as there is less oxygen in a breath of air at those altitudes, which is a direct consequence of the lower air density."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"To address these questions, I will first define the concepts and then provide the requested information for each of them. Step 1: Define Surface Area Surface area is defined as the measurement of the total area that the surface of an object occupies. It is often used to understand the properties and behavior of an object that has contact with its surrounding environment, such as heat transfer or pressure. Step 2: Describe applications of surface area in real life Some real-life applications of surface area include: 1. Designing heat exchangers or radiators to maximize heat dissipation. 2. Calculating the paint or material necessary to cover a specific object or structure, like a building or a car. 3. Assessing the surface area of a cell, which can impact the cell's ability to absorb nutrients and eliminate waste products. 4. Determining the size and performance of air filters or water filters, as the surface area affects their efficiency in capturing particles or pollutants. 5. Understanding the performance of sports equipment, such as the interaction between a ball and a surface, which depends on their respective surface areas. Step 3: Define Lateral Surface Area The lateral surface area of an object refers specifically to the area of the object's sides, not including the top or bottom. Step 4: Explain how to determine the lateral surface area of a cube and a cuboid For both a cube and a cuboid, the lateral surface area can be determined as follows: Cube: A cube has six equal square faces, with four of them forming the lateral surface area. To find the lateral surface area, calculate the area of one square face and then multiply it by four. For example, if the side of the cube is 's', then the lateral surface area is 4s². Cuboid: A cuboid has six rectangular faces, with four of them forming the lateral surface area. To find the lateral surface area, you need to find the area of each of the four side faces and then add them together. For example, if the sides of the cuboid are 'l', 'w', and 'h', then the lateral surface area is 2lh + 2wh. Step 5: Assess if the two questions in the prompt have the same meaning: The two questions in the prompt do not have the same meaning. The first question asks about the real-life applications of surface area, while the second one asks about determining the lateral surface area of cube and cuboid specifically. The first question is broader in scope than the second question because it covers the general concept of surface area, whereas the second question focuses on the lateral surface area calculation for specific geometric shapes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Diese Situation hat nicht nur schwerwiegende Auswirkungen auf die betroffenen Tier- und Pflanzenarten, sondern auch auf die menschliche Gesellschaft. Die Wälder sind von entscheidender Bedeutung für die Erhaltung von zahlreichen essenziellen Ökosystemdienstleistungen, wie zum Beispiel den Kohlenstoffkreislauf, Wasseraufbereitung und -speicherung, Bodenschutz und -erneuerung, sowie die Bereitstellung von Nahrung, Medizin und Rohstoffen. Eine nachhaltige Nutzung dieser Ressourcen ist nur möglich, wenn wir die biologische Vielfalt, die diese Funktionen untermauert, erhalten und schützen. Um die Zerstörung des Waldes und die damit verbundene Schädigung der Biodiversität effektiv bekämpfen zu können, müssen verschiedene Maßnahmen ergriffen werden. Hierzu zählen unter anderem: 1. Die Schaffung und der Schutz von widerstandsfähigen Schutzgebieten, welche über genügend Raum verfügen, um die Ökosysteme in ihrer natürlichen Dynamik und Diversität zu bewahren. 2. Die Förderung einer nachhaltigen Forstwirtschaft, die den Schutz und die Erhaltung der biologischen Vielfalt zum Ziel hat und sich dabei auf ökologisch angepasste Bewirtschaftungsmethoden stützt. 3. Die Umstellung von landwirtschaftlichen Monokulturen auf agroökologische Systeme, welche die biologische Vielfalt und die Interaktion der verschiedenen Ökosystemdienstleistungen fördern. 4. Die Sensibilisierung der Öffentlichkeit für das Thema Waldschutz und Biodiversität, um das Bewusstsein für die Problematik zu schärfen und gemeinsame Lösungsansätze zu entwickeln. Fazit: Die Zerstörung des Waldes ist ein entscheidendes Thema im Kampf gegen die Plünderung der biologischen Vielfalt. Um die Artenvielfalt und die lebenswichtigen Ökosystemdienstleistungen, die sie ermöglicht, zu erhalten, müssen wir zusammenarbeiten, um Waldgebiete zu schützen und nachhaltige Bewirtschaftungsstrategien umzusetzen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. U.S. President Donald Trump says he is considering tariffs, quotas, and retaliatory taxes on imports of steel and aluminum from countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea. The comments came during a wide-ranging trade discussion Tuesday between Trump and a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House. The president said U.S. steel and aluminum industries are being \\"decimated\\" by the \\"dumping\\" of cheap imports of those materials into U.S. markets. Trump has long threatened what he calls \\"reciprocal\\" trade action to deal with steel, aluminum, and other imports. But he has so far avoided taking any major steps, ostensibly out of fear of hurting the country's strong economic performance since he took office. Several lawmakers on Tuesday urged Trump to be cautious when considering retaliatory trade steps, saying such measures could spark a trade war that leads to higher prices for U.S. producers and consumers. \\"It's very, very much a double-edged sword,\\" Trump conceded. \\"I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry,\\" he added. The Trump administration is currently renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement with South Korea. Trump called the U.S.-South Korea deal \\"very, very bad\\" and \\"horrible.\\" He also said Canada has \\"treated us very, very unfairly.\\" Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department sent a so-called \\"232 report\\" to the White House, examining the national security impacts of steel and aluminum imports, and giving Trump 90 days to impose quotas or tariffs. Under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the president can initiate a probe to determine if imports threaten national security. \\"It's about our economy,\\" Vice President Mike Pence during the meeting. \\"It's about our national security.\\" Trade was a major topic for Trump during the presidential campaign he vowed to impose a 45 percent tax on Chinese imports and a 35 percent tax on Mexican imports. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: After the trade discussion Trump is most likely doing what? Options: A.

Given the question: Europe's deadly outbreak of a rare form of E. coli bacteria has brought new attention to food safety issues. One of the problems when people get sick from food is that the simplest question is often difficult or even impossible to answer. Just what did the people eat that made them sick? Of course, one way to avoid these medical mysteries is to keep dangerous organisms out of the food supply. This is easier said than done, but scientists keep looking for new ways. Scientists in the United States have developed an experimental system that uses a high-tech optical scanner. The system is designed to identify the presence of contaminants like soil or animal waste on fresh produce. These can be sources of E. coli. E. coli bacteria naturally live in the intestines of humans and many animals. Most kinds of E. coli are harmless but some can make people sick. The new scanner can also show damage and imperfections that might make the produce unappealing to shoppers. Scientists designed the system at a Department of Agriculture research center in Beltsville, Maryland. Moon Kim of the Agricultural Research Service led the team. MOON KIM: \\"We were requested, we were asked, to develop a method to detect contamination in produce. So we started with the apple as the model sample.\\" The scanner uses a high-speed camera placed over the conveyer belt that moves the produce along. As the apples move along the belt, the scanner captures images of each piece of fruit. Moon Kim says the team hopes the system will be available before long. MOON KIM: \\"We are targeting for development in commercial plants for the next several years.\\" The scanner can direct a sorting machine to separate the bad apples from the good ones. The system is currently able to show the surface of only half the apple as it speeds by. The inventers hope to improve the process so it can show the whole surface. The high-tech scanner _ . A) can help to sort out different fruits B) make the produce appeal to shoppers C) can only capture images of the whole apple D) can identify the presence of contaminants The answer is:","completion":"D) can identify the presence of contaminants.

Vaccines get stronger over time.;","completion":"Doctors suggest that people get a flu vaccine each year primarily because of the reason 2). Viruses can mutate from year to year. Step-by-step justification: 1. Influenza (flu) viruses constantly evolve and undergo changes in their genetic makeup through a process called antigenic drift. This results in new strains of the virus emerging each year. 2. Due to these genetic changes, the immunity an individual acquired from previous flu infections or vaccinations may not protect them against the current year's strains. 3. Flu vaccines are developed each year by scientists, based on the anticipated circulating strains. They usually include protection against three or four different strains. 4. By getting a flu vaccine each year, individuals can help protect themselves and those around them against the predominant strains circulating during that particular flu season. This can reduce the number of cases, hospitalizations, and even deaths resulting from flu complications.

The process of announcing the election of a new Pope to the world involves several well-established steps and traditions, which are designed to create a sense of anticipation, reverence, and celebration. Firstly, the election of the new Pope takes place within the Sistine Chapel during a papal conclave, a secretive and highly-ritualized event. Only the cardinal electors (cardinals under the age of 80) are allowed to participate in the conclave. They are sequestered within the Vatican until they have chosen a new Pope by secret ballot. Throughout the conclave, all information is carefully guarded, and no form of communication with the outside world is allowed. The only visible indicator of whether a decision has been made comes from the burning of the ballots. After each vote, the ballots are burned in a special stove, creating smoke that rises out of a chimney visible to those gathered in St. Peter's Square and beyond. The color of the smoke signals the outcome of the vote; black smoke (\\"fumata nera\\" in Italian) signifies that a new Pope has not yet been elected, while white smoke (\\"fumata bianca\\") indicates a successful election. When the white smoke rises from the chimney, it is accompanied by the pealing of bells to amplify the joyful news. Following the fumata bianca, the actual announcement is carried out through a traditional proclamatory statement known as the \\"Habemus Papam,\\" or \\"We have a Pope.\\" The statement is made from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, in Vatican City. A senior cardinal, known as the cardinal protodeacon, emerges onto the balcony and presents the news to the world in Latin, beginning with the words \\"Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum; habemus Papam,\\" which translates to \\"I announce to you a great joy; we have a Pope.\\" Next, the cardinal protodeacon reveals the name of the new Pope by sharing the birth name and the chosen Papal name of the elected cardinal. Following this announcement, the new Pope appears on the balcony, dressed in papal vestments, to greet the crowd gathered in St. Peter's Square. He then imparts his first Apostolic Blessing \\"Urbi et Orbi\\" – to the city (of Rome) and to the world. In addition to these traditional methods of announcement, modern communications technology has also played a role in recent years. In 2013, when Pope Francis was elected, the Vatican used social media platforms such as Twitter to share the news almost instantaneously. Similarly, news organizations around the world now provide live broadcasts and online feeds, ensuring that the news of a new Pope reaches people all over the globe within minutes of the announcement. In summary, the election of a new Pope is announced through a combination of time-honored visual signals, such as the white smoke emanating from the Sistine Chapel; auditory cues, like the ringing of bells; traditional proclamations, including the \\"Habemus Papam\\" announcement; and modern technology, which allows for rapid global dissemination of the news."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While some theories suggest that these monumental structures were built as tombs for the ancient kings, others propose functional uses such as astronomical observatories, energy-generating power plants, or even landing pads for extraterrestrial visitors. One of the most unusual and debated theories about the purpose of the Egyptian pyramids was proposed by renowned neurosurgeon and politician, Dr. Ben Carson, who claimed that they served as grain storage facilities. In this article, we delve deeper into this surprising claim, reviewing its context and examining its credibility against historical and archaeological evidence. Background: Dr. Ben Carson gained national and international recognition as a presidential candidate in the 2016 US elections. Known for his exceptional career in the medical field as well as his fervent religious beliefs, Carson made headlines in 2015 when he reiterated a claim he had previously made in a 1998 video footage. According to him, the Egyptian pyramids were built to store grain rather than function as tombs for the pharaohs – an assertion he based on his understanding of the biblical story of Joseph. The Biblical Connection: During an address at Andrews University in 1998, Carson explained that he had derived his theory from the Bible and the story of Joseph. As stated in the Book of Genesis, Joseph was sold into slavery in Egypt, where he eventually gained a high position in the court of the Pharaoh. As the ruler's advisor, Joseph is said to have managed all grain production in the country, storing abundant supplies to counter a predicted famine. Carson surmised that the Egyptian pyramids were the structures built for storing these grains. He further added that the pyramids' solid construction and hermetically sealed chambers would have made them ideal storage facilities to prevent spoilage and keep the grains fresh for long periods. Criticism and Contradictory Evidence: Dr. Carson's claim was met with widespread skepticism and criticism from experts in the fields of Egyptology and archaeology. The primary source of incredulity lies in the fact that there is substantial historical and archaeological evidence to suggest that the pyramids were indeed constructed as tombs for the pharaohs. Firstly, the inscriptions found inside and around the pyramids, known as the Pyramid Texts, explicitly mention the eternal journey of the deceased pharaohs to the afterlife. These inscriptions served a crucial role in ancient Egyptian funerary tradition and rituals, which aimed to ensure the successful transition of the pharaoh's soul to the afterlife. Secondly, the elaborate funerary complexes surrounding the pyramids were built to accommodate the burial of high-ranking officials, the pharaoh's family members, and other important individuals. These complexes were far from mere storage facilities; they reflected the hierarchy and social structure of ancient Egypt. Moreover, the construction methods and materials used for building pyramids would not have been efficient for grain storage. The internal chambers of the pyramids are not numerous enough to hold significant amounts of grain, and their narrow corridors would not have been practical for transporting tons of grain in and out. Additionally, with the enormous labor force and resources required to build such monumental constructions, it is improbable that the ancient Egyptians would have opted to utilize these grand structures for the comparatively mundane purpose of grain storage. Conclusion: The claim made by Dr. Ben Carson that the Egyptian pyramids were built to store grain lacks support from historical and archaeological evidence. While the theory is undeniably intriguing and offers an alternative perspective on these enigmatic structures, it does not hold up to closer examination. As much as the ancient Egyptian pyramids continue to captivate our imagination, their primary function as monumental tombs for the pharaohs and their eternal resting places remains the most plausible and well-documented explanation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

La relación entre las ramas y el tronco es esencial para que se puedan suministrar de manera eficiente el agua y los nutrientes necesarios para su crecimiento. A través del tronco, el árbol bombea agua y minerales desde sus raíces y los distribuye a las ramas y las hojas. Este proceso es esencial para el aprovisionamiento de elementos vitales, como agua y nutrientes. El éxito en la producción de frutos en un árbol depende en gran medida de la conexión entre las ramas y el tronco principal. Un árbol fructificará en abundancia si las ramas están fuertemente unidas a él y reciben adecuadamente el agua y los nutrientes necesarios. Sin embargo, si las ramas están débiles o se rompen del tronco, no podrán recibir eficientemente el agua y los nutrientes, lo que provocará problemas y, en última instancia, una disminución en la producción de frutos. En conclusión, la relación entre las ramas y el tronco de un árbol es crucial para su supervivencia y producción de frutos. Cuando una rama se encuentra firmemente unida al árbol y trabaja en conjunto con él, puede recibir agua y nutrientes y llevar a cabo su función de manera óptima, lo que resulta en una producción abundante de frutos en su temporada adecuada."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: when do bank statements come in the mail?? Answer:","completion":"The frequency of when bank statements come in the mail depends on the specific bank and the preferences set up by the account holder. However, most banks will typically send out statements monthly. Steps: 1. Determine the timeframe most banks use to send statements - The majority of banks distribute statements on a monthly basis. 2. Consider the type of account - For some types of accounts like a checking or saving account, you usually get a statement every month. However, for some other types like investments, you might get a statement every quarter. 3. Keep in mind individual customer settings - Some banks allow customers to customize how often they receive statements, whether it's monthly, quarterly, etc. Some customers may also choose to go paperless and receive their statements electronically. So, in most cases, you can expect your bank statement to come in the mail every month. If you want to know the specific timeline set up for your account, it would be best to contact your bank directly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

(CNN) -- From the Nintendo 3DS's ability to grab titles on demand to the increasing popularity of retail sites like Steam and Direct2Drive.com, downloadable games will be everywhere in 2011. The days when you had to visit your local store, buy a title and insert a disc into your console to play a game are long gone. Thanks to new episodic titles (\\"Back to the Future,\\" \\"Jurassic Park\\"), popular indie PC games (\\"Minecraft,\\" \\"Recettear\\") and a growing range of smartphone apps and console-exclusive downloads, digital game distribution continues to grow. Whether you're playing on your PlayStation 3, Wii, Xbox 360 or mobile handset, here are five new and upcoming titles that exemplify the expanding breadth of what online game downloads have to offer. \\"X-Men Arcade\\" (PlayStation Network/Xbox Live Arcade) Revisit your misspent adolescence with a conversion of the popular side-scrolling 1992 arcade brawler starring Cyclops, Wolverine, Nightcrawler and other comic book favorites -- before they became movie icons. High-definition multiplayer cartoon action for up to six players takes top billing, as you use fists, laser beams and super powers to bludgeon Magneto's crew of villains, including Juggernaut, Pyro and The Blob. \\"Gemini Rue\\" (Wadjet Eye Games) A sci-fi point-and-click adventure set in a dystopian future that's drawn comparison to genre classics like \\"Beneath a Steel Sky,\\" this retro-futuristic, film noir-flavored tale harkens back to PC gaming's early '90s heyday. It's available February 24, and anyone who owned an Amiga or IBM-compatible should appreciate its nostalgic pixel graphics and \\"Blade Runner\\"-style vibe. \\"Full House Poker\\" (Xbox Live Arcade) Arriving on the heels of interactive game show \\"1 vs. 100\\" comes Microsoft's next multiplayer social gaming experiment, which makes online poker tournaments possible for up to 30 players. Texas Hold 'Em showdowns, staffed by avatars, can be played for virtual chips, with hidden surprises -- including new tables, decks and outfits to unlock -- and the ability to compete against professional players. \\"MotoHeroz\\" (WiiWare, RedLynx) Following upon the success of popular speedster \\"Trials HD,\\" developer RedLynx hopes to bridge the gap between side-scrolling platform hoppers and arcade racing with this candy-colored interactive rally for up to four players. Offbeat physics set the stage as you compete on more than 100 levels, with daily competitions, online leader boards and, oddly enough, single-player story options. These should provide a ready excuse to put pedal to the metal. \\"Bionic Commando Rearmed 2\\" (PlayStation Network/Xbox Live Arcade) This game picks up where the last downloadable mix of combat and grappling arm-powered action (and 1988 NES game) left off, adding a jump button, items to equip (love the grenade launcher!) and enhanced graphics. With puzzles to solve and bosses to battle, it should provide old-school fun for anyone who's ever dreamed of playing a disgruntled cyborg.

Amid rumors of Verizon beginning to carry Apple's iPhone4 in 2011, other analysts remained \\"comfortable\\" with the network operator's business. Verizon ( VZ - news - people ), the largest mobile network operator in the U.S. by market share, saw its outlook downgraded by Craig Moffett, analyst for Bernstein Research, who was concerned about \\"future near-term cash-flow pressure.\\" Setting the target price at 25, nearly 25% lower than the market price, Moffett expressed concern that after making cash distributions to Vodafone ( VOD - news - people ), its partner in Verizon Wireless, and paying dividends, the company would be left with \\"a razor-thin margin for error and sharply limited ability to commit to future dividend growth.\\" Moffett emphasizes that he is not predicting a dividend cut, rather they are \\"noting that the market is likely to demand a significantly higher dividend yield to reflect the intrinsic risk associated with a dividend payout ratio in the proximity of 100% of available cash flow.\\" Barclays Capital analyst James Ratcliffe had a different view. According to him, Verizon, with a 55% stake in Verizon Wireless, has access to cash when they need it. \\"I'm very comfortable with the Verizon dividend to shareholders, I would hold Verizon as its underlying business is healthy,\\" he says. And one of the biggies for Verizon is the possible inclusion of the iPhone4 to its network. Ratcliffe explains that they are sure Verizon will carry Apple ( AAPL - news - people )'s smartphone by the Q1 2011.

Jackson) promoting his two brands -- the \\"Booty Sweat\\" energy drink and \\"Bust-A-Nut\\" candy bar -- while performing his hit song, \\"I Love Tha' Pussy.\\" The first trailer shows action star Tugg Speedman's (Ben Stiller) latest film, Scorcher VI: Global Meltdown, a film so much like its five predecessors that even the trailer narrator sounds shaky about it. In another trailer, funnyman Jeff \\"Fatty\\" Portnoy (Jack Black) plays every member of \\"America's favorite obese family\\" in the highly flatulent The Fatties: Fart 2. The final trailer, for a film called Satan's Alley, features Australian \\"five-time Oscar winner\\" Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) and Tobey Maguire (as himself) as two monks who begin an impassioned affair.We are taken, via the narration of John \\"Four Leaf\\" Tayback (Nick Nolte), into a gruesome battle of the Vietnam War. This is actually a scene from Tropic Thunder, a big-budget adaptation of Tayback's wartime memoir. Starring as the central platoon are Speedman, Lazarus, Chino and Portnoy, as well as young character actor Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel). To play the role of Sgt. Lincoln Osiris, an African American, Lazarus has dyed his skin dark and refuses to break character. (\\"I don't drop character 'till I done the DVD commentary.\\") A take of Osiris crying over Tayback's (Speedman's) blown-off hands is ruined when Speedman is unable to cry and Lazarus dribbles uncontrollably into Speedman's face. The ruined take causes great frustration for the film's director, Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan). The chaos is exacerbated when the film's pyrotechnics expert, Cody (Danny McBride), mistakes Cockburn's conniptions for a signal to set off several expensive explosions.Faux Access Hollywood clips reveal that Speedman's career has been on a downward spiral.

Write an article based on this \\"Lick the inside of your wrist. Smell the inside of your wrist where the saliva has dried. Try swabbing the back of your tongue.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Understanding Your Body: The Wrist Lick Test and Back of Tongue Swab Introduction Our body is an amazing and complex system – containing several mechanisms that often go unnoticed. Gaining insights into these bodily functions can provide a deeper understanding of our overall health and well-being. One such lesser-known test to gauge a hidden aspect of your health is the \\"wrist lick test\\" coupled with swabbing the back of your tongue. This simple self-assessment can reveal some interesting information about your personal hygiene. The Wrist Lick Test Step-by-step, here’s how to perform this easy test: 1. Lick the inside of your wrist: Use your own saliva to moisten a small area on the inside of your wrist. This part of your arm is commonly used for self-assessment because it is easily accessible and has a uniform skin surface that prevents interference from sweat or other chemicals. 2. Allow the saliva to dry: Give the saliva a few seconds to dry and evaporate. As saliva mostly consists of water, this step is essential to provide accurate results. In the process of evaporation, volatile compounds present in the saliva are better detected since they dissipate less in air than in a liquid medium. 3. Smell the inside of your wrist: After the saliva has dried, bring your wrist close to your nose and take a whiff. By doing this, you will be able to get a clear idea of how your breath smells. Often, bad breath can go unnoticed, as our nose tends to filter out our own odors. This can result in an unawareness of potential bad breath that others around us may notice. Swabbing the Back of Your Tongue While the wrist lick test helps you understand the smell of your breath, swabbing the back of your tongue provides valuable information on the state of your oral hygiene. To perform a tongue swab: 1. Use a clean finger, spoon, or tongue scraper: Before performing this step, ensure your hands and utensils are clean to prevent introducing any external germs or bacteria into your mouth. 2. Gently swab the back of your tongue: Using your chosen tool, carefully swab the back of your tongue – where most odor-causing bacteria reside. By swabbing the back of your tongue, you can get a glimpse of the current state of your oral hygiene. If there is a white, gray, or yellow coating, this could indicate poor oral hygiene and the presence of bacteria. 3. Evaluate and maintain good oral hygiene: If you notice a strong smell from your tongue swab or wrist lick test, consider re-evaluating your oral health routine. Implementing practices such as regular brushing, flossing, and tongue scraping – coupled with frequent dentist visits – can help maintain optimal oral health. Conclusion The wrist lick test and back of the tongue swab are simple yet effective methods of self-assessing your personal hygiene. By regularly performing these tests, you can actively monitor your oral health and take measures to enhance your overall well-being. Don't be surprised by issues such as bad breath or poor oral health.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? “Showing your work” is usually required on written math tests. Writing out each step when solving a problem is also a way to help you understand each part of the process required. Writing out steps is a good habit to pick up and maintain. Also, when you’re doing practice problems or taking notes, write out each step. You’ll be glad you did when it comes time for applying steps on the test! Give problem sets careful attention, and do more for practice, if you need it. Even when you’ve found the solution to a math problem, you may not be finished. Take the solution and plug it back into the original problem to see if it’s the correct answer. Word problems are applied math, where you’re given a situation and have to find the right way to solve an associated problem. Since you have to both understand the situation and the necessary math concepts, this type of problem can be especially tricky. Read through the entire problem before you begin to solve it. Make sure you understand the situation and what math techniques you’ll need to use. Some problems may have associated graphs, charts, or tables. Make sure to read those carefully, too. Select the numbers you’ll need to use to solve the problem. Keep in mind that some word problems might have unneeded details designed to make you use your understanding of what you need to solve it. After you’ve solved the problem, make sure to check your work steps and see whether your answer makes sense in its size and is in the correct units, etc. Your teacher assigns a certain number of problems for homework, but if you don’t feel like you fully understand, you might need to study more problems. Look for extra practice sets in your textbook or online, and try some of those until you feel more confident. Often times, the answers to all the odd-numbered problems are in the back of the book. Do the odd-numbered problem, check your answer, and, once you're confident you know how to do it, then do the even-numbered problem next to it. If you’re anxious about taking an exam, do one or more practice ones ahead of time. Try to recreate the test environment--keep your study room quiet, and avoid interruptions. Check your work after taking the practice test, and study more if you need it.

As a result, the Alpha Chi Omega sorority has lost its status and faced expulsion from the campus until May 2020 at the earliest, according to the Morning Call. The sorority has been found responsible for hazing and other offenses associated with the December's \\"Road Rally\\" scavenger hunt. Controversial Scavenger Hunt: The scavenger hunt, which the university has termed \\"reprehensible,\\" involved the use of drugs and alcohol, sexual activity, and a range of other activities in violation of Lehigh University policy. The university has stated that although these actions were not explicitly required for affiliation with the sorority, they were still considered a rite of passage and a consistent part of the sorority membership. In a blog post, Lehigh University denounces the event and its impact on the campus and community, saying, \\"This incident was a significant, reprehensible event that the entire chapter was aware of and leadership endorsed.\\" The post goes on to accuse the sorority's leadership of creating a situation in which morally questionable quests occurred both on and off campus. Consequences of the Scandal: As a direct result of the charges, Alpha Chi Omega will be ordered to vacate its sorority house. Lehigh Valley Live reports that by the time the sorority can resume operations on campus, all the current members will have graduated. This will effectively sever the tie between the current members and the tradition of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority at Lehigh University. Appeal Options: Alpha Chi Omega has cooperated with the investigation by submitting scavenger hunt lists. The university has acknowledged the sorority's cooperation and will allow Alpha Chi Omega to appeal the decision. Conclusion: Lehigh University's decision to hold Alpha Chi Omega responsible for hazing and other offenses creates a powerful message on the importance of maintaining the integrity of campus life. The university's stringent approach sends a strong warning to other campus organizations against engaging in activities that may violate the university's policies and core values. While Alpha Chi Omega faces severe consequences, their cooperation with the investigation and the ability to appeal the decision demonstrates the complex and evolving nature of managing campus organizations."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

He was recaptured on Friday. The company behind the shirt, Barabas, quickly advertised the \\"celebrity link\\" on its website. However, it said it did not know how Guzman had got hold of one of its shirts Barabas published the now famous picture of the meeting between Sean Penn and Guzman, who at the time that the image was taken, was on the run from the Mexican authorities after escaping from a maximum-security jail. With the words \\"Most Wanted Shirt\\" emblazoned across it, Barabas posted the photograph next to an image of one of its models sporting the same shirt. On its Facebook page, the company also offered customers the chance to win \\"our Barabas 'El Chapo' shirts\\" if they liked Barabas on Facebook or Instagram. Barabas also posted a screenshot of a video showing Guzman wearing a silk paisley shirt, which the company says is one of its \\"Crazy Paisley\\" models. Both shirts sell for 128 (Â£89). The images first appeared in the Rolling Stone article last Saturday. In the article, Penn recounts how he interviewed the fugitive cartel leader in a remote undisclosed location in Mexico. Penn came in for scathing criticism over the interview both in Mexico and the US, with Republican Marco Rubio calling it \\"grotesque\\". But a Barabas representative said the shirt maker was benefitting from increased sales. \\"This is the shirt! It's the sensation of the moment, the phones haven't stopped ringing and we're making lots of sales and shipping many shirts, and we're expecting more to come,\\" Barabas's Sandra Macia told news agency Efe. Juventino Romero told Efe he had driven for 20 hours to buy the shirts at Los Angeles-based Barabas to resell them at his clothes shop in Washington state. \\"I came for the new shirt that 'El Chapo' was wearing in the interview, people are asking for it,\\" he said. Despite his reputation for being a ruthless cartel leader, whose men have killed thousands of people, \\"El Chapo\\" is seen by some as a folk hero. After his jail break in July, shirts and baseball caps emblazoned with his name became popular and \\"El Chapo\\" masks became a bestseller at Halloween in Mexico. Following his recapture on Friday, Guzman is being held at Altiplano prison in Mexico awaiting extradition to the United States on drugs charges. Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"The article talks about a shirt owned by notorious drug lord Joaquín Guzman, known as \\"El Chapo,\\" that gained significant attention after he was pictured wearing it while meeting with American actor Sean Penn. This happened during an interview conducted by Penn in October, while Guzman was a fugitive. The shirt was manufactured by a company named Barabas, which seized the opportunity to advertise this unexpected celebrity association after the picture was published in Rolling Stone magazine. Barabas, however, acknowledged that they could not explain how Guzman came to possess their shirt. Caught in the media spotlight, the company also used the photo showing Guzman and Penn on their website, boldly labeled it as the \\"Most Wanted Shirt,\\" and displayed it alongside an image of a model wearing the same shirt. They also presented an offer to customers through Facebook for a chance to win their \\"El Chapo\\" shirts. Another image revealed Guzman wearing a silk paisley shirt from Barabas' \\"Crazy Paisley\\" product collection during a video, which was also shared by the company. Both these shirts were priced at 128 (£89). The article also touched upon the controversial interview by Sean Penn, resulting in harsh criticism in Mexico and the U.S., with Republican Marco Rubio calling it \\"grotesque.\\" Regardless, the circumstances served as a promotional success story for Barabas, which reported an increase in sales and continuous demands. One customer who owns a clothing store in Washington state even traveled for 20 hours to Los Angeles to buy the shirts, intending to resell them due to high demand. Despite \\"El Chapo's\\" infamous reputation as a ruthless cartel leader, he surprisingly enjoys a folk hero status amongst some, as merchandise, including shirts and baseball caps adorned with his name, as well as Halloween masks, became popular after his jail escape in July.

What is the title of this article: LaserDiscs potentially had a much longer lifespan than videocassettes. Because the discs were read optically instead of magnetically, no physical contact needs to be made between the player and the disc, except for the player's clamp that holds the disc at its center as it is spun and read. As a result, playback would not wear the information-bearing part of the discs, and properly manufactured LDs would theoretically last beyond one's lifetime. By contrast, a VHS tape held all of its picture and sound information on the tape in a magnetic coating which is in contact with the spinning heads on the head drum, causing progressive wear with each use (though later in VHS's lifespan, engineering improvements allowed tapes to be made and played back without contact). Also, the tape was thin and delicate, and it was easy for a player mechanism, especially on a low quality or malfunctioning model, to mishandle the tape and damage it by creasing it, frilling (stretching) its edges, or even breaking it.","completion":"Title: \\"LaserDiscs: The Superior Lifespan and Durability Compared to Videocassettes\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in...

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person whose belief is shared that Davenport has become too emotionally close to his command? In 1949, former U.S. Army Air Forces officer Harvey Stovall spots a familiar Toby Jug in the window of a London antique shop and learns that it came from Archbury, an airfield where Stovall served during World War II. Convinced that it is the same jug, he buys it and journeys to the derelict airfield. Stovall remembers the events of 1942, when the 918th Bomb Group at Archbury had gained a reputation as the 'hard luck group'. After a particularly disastrous mission, group commander Colonel Keith Davenport appears exhausted and demoralized. His defeatist attitude spreads to other senior leaders of the group, including his Air Exec, Lieutenant Colonel Ben Gately. Ordered to fly another mission the next day, at a dangerously low altitude, Davenport protests to his friend, Brigadier General Frank Savage, the Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations at VIII Bomber Command. Later, Savage reluctantly shares with Major General Pritchard, the commanding general of VIII Bomber Command, his belief that Davenport has become too emotionally close to his men and may no longer be fit to command. That night, Pritchard and Savage visit the group headquarters to investigate the cause of the mission's heavy losses. Pritchard realizes that Savage is right: Davenport has become over-protective and is unwilling to discipline his men even for costly mistakes. Davenport is relieved of command and Savage is asked to take over.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. A reflection paper is somewhat personal in that it includes your subjective feelings and opinions. Instead of revealing everything about yourself, carefully ask yourself if something is appropriate before including it in your paper. If you feel uncomfortable about a personal issue that affects the conclusions you reached, it is wisest not to include personal details about it. If a certain issue is unavoidable but you feel uncomfortable revealing your personal experiences or feelings regarding it, write about the issue in more general terms. Identify the issue itself and indicate concerns you have professionally or academically. A reflection paper is personal and objective, but you should still keep your thoughts organized and sensible. Avoid dragging someone else down in your writing. If a particular person made the experience you are reflecting on difficult, unpleasant, or uncomfortable, you must still maintain a level of detachment as you describe that person's influence. Instead of stating something like, “Bob was such a rude jerk,” say something more along the lines of, “One man was abrupt and spoke harshly, making me feel as though I was not welcome there.” Describe the actions, not the person, and frame those actions within the context of how they influenced your conclusions. A reflection paper is one of the few pieces of academic writing in which you can get away with using the first person pronoun “I.” That said, you should still relate your subjective feelings and opinions using specific evidence to explain them. Avoid slang and always use correct spelling and grammar. Internet abbreviations like “LOL” or “OMG” are fine to use personally among friends and family, but this is still an academic paper, so you need to treat it with the grammatical respect it deserves. Do not treat it as a personal journal entry. Check and double-check your spelling and grammar after you finish your paper. A clear, well-written paper must have clear, well-written sentences. Keep your sentences focused. Avoid squeezing multiple ideas into one sentence. Avoid sentence fragments. Make sure that each sentence has a subject and a verb. Vary your sentence length. Include both simple sentences with a single subject and verb and complex sentences with multiple clauses. Doing so makes your paper sound more conversational and natural, and prevents the writing from becoming too wooden. Transitional phrases shift the argument and introduce specific details. They also allow you to illustrate how one experience or detail directly links to a conclusion or understanding. Common transitional phrases include \\"for example,\\" \\"for instance,\\" \\"as a result,\\" \\"an opposite view is,\\" and \\"a different perspective is.\\" You can incorporate information you learned in the classroom with information addressed by the reading, lecture, or experience. For instance, if reflecting on a piece of literary criticism, you could mention how your beliefs and ideas about the literary theory addressed in the article relate to what your instructor taught you about it or how it applies to prose and poetry read in class. As another example, if reflecting on a new social experience for a sociology class, you could relate that experience to specific ideas or social patterns discussed in class.

A detailed look at each option and the reasons customers might prefer them is provided below: 1. Mall: The mall is a popular choice for customers who want to enjoy the comfort of a controlled indoor environment while having access to numerous shopping, dining, and entertainment options. As a one-stop destination, customers find it easy to spend hours walking around, exploring different brand outlets, catching up with friends, or enjoying a meal at the food court. Malls also usually offer a wide range of options to choose from, making them suitable for people with diverse tastes and interests. 2. Park: Customers who prefer spending time in nature or enjoying the outdoors might head out to a park for a walk. Parks generally provide a peaceful and relaxing environment, with greenery around, providing an escape from the busy city life. Walking in a park can also prove beneficial for health and fitness enthusiasts, as it offers an opportunity to exercise in a pleasant environment and get some fresh air. An added advantage is that parks usually have play areas and open spaces where families can spend time together. 3. Market: Sometimes, customers prefer to walk around a bustling marketplace to immerse themselves in the local culture and enjoy the energy of their surroundings. The market offers an excellent opportunity to shop for fresh produce, experience street food, or maybe even hunt for unique items or souvenirs. The vibrant atmosphere in markets typically allows customers to engage in casual conversations with vendors, which might lead to discovering new products or learning more about the area's history and traditions. 4. Found inRestaurant: While this might be an unusual choice, some restaurants or clusters of eateries might offer customers a pleasant area to stroll around. Dining complexes, for example, could have landscaped walkways, patios, or courtyards that allow customers to leisurely walk around before or after their meal. This option might best suit those who enjoy exploring culinary options while also getting some fresh air and taking in the ambiance of an establishment. 5. Bookstore: Bookstores are another appealing option for customers who love literature, art, and culture. They might choose a bookstore to walk around and explore their favorite authors, wander through sections that pique their curiosity or stumble upon new reads. Many bookstores nowadays also offer places to sit, read, or even have a cup of coffee, making the experience even more enjoyable. This option is particularly attractive during cold or rainy days when customers might want to stay indoors but continue to engage in a leisurely activity.

Q: Abstract: The prognostic value associated with the detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in metastatic breast cancer by the CellSearch technology raise additional issues regarding the biological value of this information. We postulated that a drug-resistance profile of CTCs may predict response to chemotherapy in cancer patients and therefore could be used for patient selection. One hundred 5 patients with diagnosis of carcinoma were enrolled in a prospective trial. CTCs were isolated from peripheral blood, and positive samples were evaluated for the expression of a panel of genes involved in anticancer drugs resistance. The drug-resistance profile was correlated with disease-free survival (DFS; patients in adjuvant setting) and time to progression (TTP; metastatic patients) in a 24-months follow-up. Objective response correlation was a secondary end point. Fifty-one percent of patients were found positive for CTCs while all blood samples from healthy donors were negative. The drug-resistance profile correlates with DFS and TTP (p < 0.001 in both). Sensitivity of the test: able to predict treatment response in 98% of patients. Specificity of the test: 100%; no sample from healthy subject was positive for the presence of CTCs. Positive and negative predictive values were found to be 96.5 and 100%, respectively. We identified a drug-resistance profile of CTCs, which is predictive of response to chemotherapy, independent of tumor type and stage of disease. This approach may represent a first step toward the individualization of chemotherapy in cancer patients..

Given the following context: By the time El Greco arrived in Rome, Michelangelo and Raphael were dead, but their example continued to be paramount, and somewhat overwhelming for young painters. El Greco was determined to make his own mark in Rome defending his personal artistic views, ideas and style. He singled out Correggio and Parmigianino for particular praise, but he did not hesitate to dismiss Michelangelo's Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel; he extended an offer to Pope Pius V to paint over the whole work in accord with the new and stricter Catholic thinking. When he was later asked what he thought about Michelangelo, El Greco replied that \\"he was a good man, but he did not know how to paint\\". And thus we are confronted by a paradox: El Greco is said to have reacted most strongly or even condemned Michelangelo, but found it impossible to withstand his influence. Michelangelo's influence can be seen in later El Greco works such as the Allegory of the Holy League. By painting portraits of Michelangelo, Titian, Clovio and, presumably, Raphael in one of his works (The Purification of the Temple), El Greco not only expressed his gratitude but also advanced the claim to rival these masters. As his own commentaries indicate, El Greco viewed Titian, Michelangelo and Raphael as models to emulate. In his 17th century Chronicles, Giulio Mancini included El Greco among the painters who had initiated, in various ways, a re-evaluation of Michelangelo's teachings.Because of his unconventional artistic beliefs (such as his dismissal of Michelangelo's technique) and personality, El Greco soon acquired enemies in Rome. Architect and writer Pirro Ligorio called him a \\"foolish foreigner\\", and newly discovered archival material reveals a skirmish with Farnese, who obliged the young artist to leave his palace. On 6 July 1572, El Greco officially complained about this event. A few months later, on 18 September 1572, he paid his dues to the Guild of Saint Luke in Rome as a miniature painter.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Home from the Civil War, where he fought for the Union army, John Willoughby now lives in the western town of Kittreck Wells with wife Nora and their 7-year-old son, Petey. An appeal for help from Marshal Russell comes when a band of former Confederate soldiers are seen pulling a robbery in a neighboring town. John, who hates all rebels, agrees to go, against his wife's wishes that all his fighting must end. Meanwhile, the Rebels, Bedloe Mason and his sons Gray, Wesley, Cain and Frank, decide to ride into Kittreck Wells to replenish their dwindling water supply. Bedloe sends Gray, Frank and Wesley into town while he and Cain await their return. Petey Willoughby, who shares his father's dislike of rebels, aims and fires a cap pistol at them. Startled by the sound, Wesley Mason shoots and kills the boy. As the brothers mount their horses and gallop out of town, Gray, not having been witnessing the shooting, hesitates, then catches up to the others. When they reach Bedloe and Cain, Gray, angered by his brother's recklessness, appeals to his father and brothers that Wesley has to go back to face the consequences. Wesley is dead-set against this and the others take his side. Gray rides off alone to learn the fate of the boy, but Wesley ambushes his brother by throwing a knife into his back. After strapping his brother's unconscious body onto his horse, Wesley sets the animal loose. He then returns to camp and reports that Gray refused to listen to reason, but will meet the family at Oak Fork in three days. That night, John finds the wandering horse bearing Gray's body and takes him home. Wesley lies to his father that Gray will meet them in the next town. Gray's horse wanders into town, where John and Nora remove the wounded man from the saddle and take him into their home.

He began working as a session pianist with singer Ethel Waters, who sang his first recorded song as a writer, \\"You Can't Do What My Last Man Did\\" in 1923. He then diversified into songwriting, working with lyricists including Henry Creamer and Andy Razaf. Waters recorded several more J.C. Johnson songs and collaborations, including the first version of \\"Trav'lin All Alone\\", subsequently recorded by dozens of artists including Billie Holiday and Billy Eckstine. By 1928 he had begun working with Fats Waller, often contributing lyrics to Waller's music. His first song with Waller was \\"I'm \\"Goin Huntin\\", written in 1927 and recorded by Louie Armstrong, and together they wrote a Broadway show, Keep Shufflin'. (The preceding information is wrong. It was James P. Johnson who co-wrote \\"Keep Shufflin\\" with Fats Waller. See: James P. and J.C. were often confused for each other, and were friends via Fats Waller. The above illustrates how James P. and J.C. continue to be confused with each other.)About this time, he also reportedly used the pseudonym Harry Burke, who was originally credited as the writer of the song \\"Me and My Gin\\", recorded in 1928 by Bessie Smith and later recorded by many artists under the title \\"Gin House Blues\\" (with the composition later often credited, apparently in error, to Fletcher Henderson). In 1929, he took part as a musician in a collaboration between Italian-American guitarist Eddie Lang and the blues guitarist Lonnie Johnson, together with King Oliver and Hoagy Carmichael, which was given the name \\"Blind Willie Dunn & His Gin Bottle Four\\" in order to disguise the inter-racial nature of the group. Among the many artists in the 20s and 30s who sang and recorded his tunes were Ella Fitzgerald, whose first three recorded songs were co-written by Johnson, Connie Boswell, Mamie Smith, Clarence Williams, and Lonnie Johnson.

Please write a short summary for the following article: National Portrait Gallery Makes Changes Concerning 9/11 to Caption of President Bush's Picture The National Portrait Gallery has taken the unusual step of amending a caption for a portrait of President George W. Bush at the request of a U.S. senator. The caption describes the Bush administration and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In a letter to the gallery, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) objected to the language that said \\"the attacks on September 11, 2001, that led to wars in Afghanistan and Iraq . . .\\" Sanders wrote: \\"When President Bush and Vice President Cheney misled our nation into the war in Iraq, they certainly cited the attacks on September 11, along with the equally specious claim that Iraq possessed vast arsenals of weapons of mass destruction. The notion, however, that 9/11 and Iraq were linked, or that one 'led to' the other, has been widely and authoritatively debunked.\\" Soon after Sept. 11, the Bush administration did suggest there was a link between Iraq and the attacks. Later, the 9/11 commission reported that there was no evidence of a collaborative relationship between al-Qaeda and Iraq. That view was supported by the FBI and Bush later concurred. Martin E. Sullivan, the gallery's director, thought the request was reasonable and ordered that the caption be amended. The new text will be installed today. The new wording eliminates the \\"led to\\" phrase and instead provides a list of events that mark the Bush terms. It now reads \\". . . Bush found his two terms in office instead marked by a series of cataclysmic events: the attacks on September 11, 2001; the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq; the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina; and a financial crisis during his last months in office.\\" The president's portrait and one of Laura Bush were unveiled last month. Sanders, who was told about the caption by a staff member, said yesterday he was satisfied that the museum acted quickly. \\"On one hand, one could say this is a small issue; on the other hand, it is not,\\" Sanders said. \\"People can like George Bush or not. People can support the war in Iraq or not. But we have got to get our history right. George Bush has acknowledged 9/11 did not cause the war in Iraq. That is simply the case. I don't like the rewriting of history.\\" Sullivan, who has been director of the museum since April, explained: \\"The core issue here is not about a political point of view but a clarity of the sentence. In this instance, Senator Sanders called attention to the original label, saying it implied there was a direct causal relationship. We didn't intend to do that, but wanted to list the defining events of the Bush administration.\\" All the captions at the Portrait Gallery are limited to 140 words, whether they describe a president or an opera singer. Occasionally they are changed when sharp-eyed visitors notice a factual or grammatical mistake. The gallery changed the word \\"lynching\\" to \\"murder\\" in the case of one historic portrait. Over the years, exhibitions at the Smithsonian, of which the Portrait Gallery is a part, have drawn criticism from members of Congress. In 2003, a Senate hearing included a testy discussion of the captions in a photography exhibit on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge at the National Museum of Natural History. Smithsonian officials said they had not used the text in the photography book, the basis of the show, because they decided the language -- about the pros and cons of oil drilling -- was political, and stated that they had not caved into political interests. Summary:","completion":"The National Portrait Gallery has amended the caption for a portrait of President George W. Bush at the request of U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who objected to the language connecting the 9/11 attacks to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Can we infer the following? the truth can't be certain","completion":"Based on the statement provided, it can be inferred that the speaker is discussing a legal case or argument and referring to the opinions of both amicus AOL (likely a party providing friend-of-the-court assistance) and the judge. The speaker mentions \\"the retrospectivity cases Ryder and Reynoldsville Casket Company,\\" which the statement refers to as legal precedents or cases that deal with retrospectivity, a term that is used to describe the application of new laws or legal standards to past events or occurrences. In this specific context, the issue of disruption arises when applying new legal rules or interpretations to past situations, potentially undermining the previous understanding of the law or its consequences. The \\"severe disruption exception\\" mentioned in the statement refers to an exception in legal jurisprudence, particularly regarding retrospectivity, which acknowledges that certain situations may be so disruptive that retrospective application of new legal rules is not warranted or appropriate. This could mean that applying a new legal standard or rule to past events might create chaos and confusion, significantly destabilizing established legal structures or settlements, and consequently should be avoided. While the statement mainly focuses on the severe disruption exception and the potential implications of applying retrospectivity, it seems unrelated to the concept of absolute truth or certainty. It is important to remember that in the legal world, various parties present their arguments and perspectives to derive an outcome that is deemed just and reasonable, and the negotiation and weighing of these different arguments often acknowledge and accept that there may not be a single, universally acknowledged truth. In conclusion, the statement primarily revolves around the concept of retrospectivity and the severe disruption exception within a legal context. Although it does not explicitly say that \\"the truth can't be certain,\\" the legal world operates based on the principle that multiple opinions and perspectives are considered to reach a final decision. As such, legal discussions often accept the complexities and uncertainties associated with various interpretations, rather than seeking an absolute truth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Definition: Given a pair of words, deduce the type of relationship between them. The various types of relations are: 'HYPER', 'COORD' and 'RANDOM'. Let's denote the first word by X and the second word by Y. A COORD relationship holds when X and Y belong to the same semantic class. A HYPER relationship applies when X is a specific instance of Y. If niether COORD nor HYPER are applicable then the relationship is RANDOM. Input: X: cut, Y: matter Output:","completion":"To determine the relationship between the given words \\"cut\\" and \\"matter\\", I will follow these steps: Step 1: Understand the words' meanings - Cut: to penetrate with or as if with an edged instrument, or to remove or separate by cutting - Matter: a substance of which a physical object is composed, or a subject under consideration Step 2: Check for COORD relationship A COORD relationship holds when both words belong to the same semantic class. In this case, \\"cut\\" is a verb or action, while \\"matter\\" is a noun or physical substance. These two words don't belong to the same semantic class, so there is no COORD relationship. Step 3: Check for HYPER relationship A HYPER relationship applies when one word is a specific instance of the other. Here, \\"cut\\" and \\"matter\\" have distinct meanings, and neither is a specific instance of the other. Consequently, there's no HYPER relationship between the words.

Answer the following question: This article: White Deer Hole Creek is in a sandstone, limestone, and shale mountain region, entirely in the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians. South and North White Deer Ridge and Bald Eagle Mountain are composed of sedimentary Ordovician rock, while the valley rock is Silurian, with a small Devonian region closer to the river, in the north. The watershed has no deposits of coal, nor natural gas or oil fields. The creek is in a narrow mountain valley with steep slopes in its upper reaches. In its middle and lower reaches it has steep mountain slopes to the south, and a wide valley with rolling hills and gentle slopes to the north. The channel pattern is transitional, with a trellised drainage pattern.From 1961 to 1995, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) operated one stream gauge on White Deer Hole Creek at the Gap Road bridge (upstream of Elimsport), for the uppermost 18.2 square miles (47 km2) of the watershed. The highest yearly peak discharge measured at this site was 4,200 cubic feet (120 m3) per second and the highest yearly peak gauge height was 11.83 feet (3.61 m), both on June 22, 1972, during Hurricane Agnes. The lowest yearly peak discharge in this time period was 135 cubic feet (3.8 m3) per second and the lowest yearly peak gauge height was 4.29 feet (1.31 m), both on November 26, 1986. The USGS also measured discharge at Allenwood, very near the creek's mouth, as part of water quality measurements on seven occasions between 1970 and 1975. The average discharge was 70.4 cubic feet (1.99 m3) per second, and ranged from a high of 111 cubic feet (3.1 m3) per second to a low of 33 cubic feet (0.93 m3) per second. There are no other known stream gauges on the creek. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the location that had a high discharge of 111 cubic feet per second?, what is it ?

Abstract: To determine whether there is a prognostic value in the percentage normal sperm morphologic features in a human in vitro fertilization (IVF) program, the authors conducted a prospective study in women with bilateral tubal damage. Based on the percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa, the patients were divided into four groups: group I, normal morphologic features between 0% and 14%; group II, 15% to 30%; group III, 31% to 45%; and group IV, 46% to 60%. One hundred ninety successful laparoscopic cycles were evaluated. In group I, 104 oocytes were obtained, of which 37% fertilized, but no pregnancy resulted; in group II, 81% of 324 oocytes were fertilized, with a pregnancy rate per embryo transfer (ET) of 22%; in group III, 82% of 309 oocytes were fertilized, with a 31% pregnancy rate; and in group IV, 91% of 69 oocytes were fertilized, with a pregnancy rate of 12%. Probability models indicated that there was a clear threshold in normal sperm morphologic features at 14%, with high fertilization and pregnancy rate in the groups with normal sperm morphologic features greater than 14%.

But in reality his mission is to retrieve diamonds, worth fifty million dollars, from a mine company's vault. Curry's subordinates include his friend Ruffo (Jim Brown) and alcoholic Doctor Wreid (Kenneth More). He also reluctantly recruits ex-Nazi Henlein (Peter Carsten) because he needs his military expertise and leadership skills. The Congolese president provides Curry with the use of a steam train and soldiers. On the way, the train is attacked by a United Nations peacekeeping plane. The mercenaries then pick up Claire (Yvette Mimieux) after they find her house burned down and husband murdered by Simbas. Meanwhile, Henlein, who resents Curry's leadership, begins to cause trouble because the German knows about the diamonds. Things come to a boiling point when he kills two children whom he suspects of being rebel spies. Afterward, Henlein makes romantic advances towards Claire, which Curry interrupts. Curry and Henlein then fight an inconclusive duel which involves a chainsaw. Curry is prepared to kill Henlein, but Ruffo stops him. Further complications arise when the mercenaries reach the town. First, the diamonds are in a time-locked vault delaying the train's departure. Second, Dr Wreid attends a pregnant woman at a mission hospital and refuses to abandon her. Curry reluctantly agrees to let the doctor stay behind. Back in town, Curry waits anxiously for the vault to open. The delay allows the Simbas to catch up and begin attacking the town and station. Finally, the train, loaded with the diamonds and fleeing residents, slowly leaves the station under small arms fire, but a mortar round destroys the coupling between the last two carriages.

Wall - A wall is a solid structure that defines the perimeter of a home and supports the roof and other parts. It is not meant to be used as an exit. Leaving through a wall would require breaking it down or creating an opening which is not a conventional or recommended way of leaving a house. D. Wall - The same explanation as for option B applies here, as it's simply not a feasible or sensible way to exit a home. E. Building - A building refers to the entire structure comprising the home, which could also include other homes or spaces such as apartments or commercial establishments. Leaving a home through the building would mean exiting through the main entrance of the entire structure rather than your specific residence. While this might be applicable in some cases, it is not the most appropriate answer when considering leaving a home in a general sense. Therefore, considering the aforementioned explanations for each choice, the best answer is C. front door. A front door is a dedicated entry and exit point for a home that is both safe and easily accessible. It is a common and conventional means through which people leave their houses daily. Utilizing the front door allows for a quick and secure departure while also maintaining the structural integrity of the home."},{"prompt":"Question: This article: In writing Young Modern, Johns tried to make the music sound very simple, despite a complex musical structure. The lyrics were written after the music was created, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning \\"Straight Lines\\". Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but \\"still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements\\". He said that much of the band's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.Gillies notes that Silverchair will often \\"run the risk of losing fans\\" with their work, and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in Diorama and Young Modern. However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact \\"that we haven't been pigeonholed, and people really don't know what to expect\\" as one of the attractive elements of the band. Despite the ups and downs of success at a young age, Gillies says the band \\"appreciate what we've achieved and what we've got\\" in their careers. The band have received six APRA Awards with Johns winning three songwriting awards at the 2008 ceremony. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the band John's suggested could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future?, what is it ?
