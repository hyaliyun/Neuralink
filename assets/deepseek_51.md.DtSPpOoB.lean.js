You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: From birth to death, the word kick has been given an important part in expressing human experience. The proud and happy mother feels the first signs of life kicking inside her body. And that same life------many years later------ comes to its end in a widely-used expression, to kick the bucket( ) . The expression to kick the bucket is almost 200 years old. One belief is that it started when an English stableman killed himself by hanging while standing on a bucket. He put a rope around his neck and tied it to a beam in the ceiling, and then kicked the bucket away from under him. Another old expression that comes from England is to kick over the traces. Traces were the chains that held at horse or mule to a wagon or plow. Sometimes, an animal refused to obey and kicked over the traces. Kick around is an expression that is heard often in American English. A person who is kicked around is someone who is treated badly. Usually he is not really being kicked by somebody's foot. He is just not being treated with the respect that all of us want. A person who has kicked around for most of his life is someone who has spent his life moving from place to place. In this case, kicking around means moving often from one place to another. Kick around has another meaning when you use it with the word idea. When you kick around an idea, you are giving that idea some thought. There is no physical action when you kick a person upstairs, although the pain can be as strong .You kick a person upstairs by removing him from an important job and giving him a job that sounds more important, but really is not. Still another meaning of the word kick is to free oneself of a bad habit, such as smoking cigarettes. Health campaigns urge smokers to kick the habit. Question: How many different kinds of meanings are talked about on;'kick around' in the text? Answer: Answer:","completion":"The text discusses three different meanings of the phrase \\"kick around.\\" The first meaning refers to a person being treated poorly or without respect, but not physically being kicked.

The film opens in a narrative (Tony Jay) which introduces us to deep space where merchant ships sail on solar winds transporting valuable cargo. However, their journeys are not without danger as one of them is attacked by a small pirate ship commanded by the notorious Captain Nathaniel Flint, a pirate who vanished without a trace after each heist and was rumored to have stashed his loot on the mysterious Treasure Planet. The image of Flint's alien face is soon seen to be a holographic image in the storybook of young Jim Hawkins (Austin Majors), a three year-old boy who is completely immersed in the story. His mother, Sarah (Laurie Metcalf), comes into Jim's room to put him to bed, playfully tackling him, but Jim continues to read his book, even under the covers. Twelve years later and Jim has grown into a strong teenager, taking thrills from solar surfing (windsurfing on a solar-powered rocket board), his favorite pastime. Unfortunately, the aloof Jim takes his board through a restricted construction zone and is quickly apprehended by authorities.Meanwhile, back home at the Benbow Inn, Sarah tirelessly serves customers including the frequent dog-like Delbert Dopplar (David Hyde Pierce), an astrophysicist and friend of the family. He asks how Jim has been doing just as Jim is brought home, flanked by two robotic police officers. They explain that if Jim performs any further transgressions he will be locked away in juvenile hall. Later that night, while Jim listens from the roof, Sarah confides in Delbert that, ever since his father left, Jim hasn't been the same. Despite being smart, he fails in school and acts distant. At that moment, Jim notices a spaceship fall from the sky and crash at the end of the Benbow docking platform. He runs out in time to help the injured pilot, an old, snaky creature named Billy Bones (Patrick McGoohan). Jim assists him back to the inn as it begins to rain and make it through the front door before Billy collapses. Before Sarah and Delbert can do anything, Billy gives Jim a golden sphere and tells him to 'beware the cyborg' before expiring. Shortly after, the inn is raided by a gang of pirates and Sarah, Jim, and Delbert barely escape before the inn is burned to the ground. They seek refuge at Delbert's home where Jim discovers the minute mechanics of the sphere and activates it to reveal a holographic map of the galaxy. They discover that the map holds the key to finding Treasure Planet. Eager to make his mother proud and help rebuild the inn, Jim proposes to go find the Planet with Delbert's help, who is more than excited at the prospect of charting an expedition of discovery. Sarah is against the plan at first, but Delbert assures her that it may just be the right thing to help Jim sail straight.Delbert commissions a ship and a crew out of Belfast, the 'harbor' of which resembles the size and shape of a crescent moon. He and Jim depart for the RLS Legacy where they greet the stony first mate, Mr. Arrow (Roscoe Lee Browne), before meeting the stern and cat-like Captain Amelia (Emma Thompson). The crew is a motley but seemingly obedient bunch and, as the ship sets sail, Jim is sent down to work in the galley for John Silver (Brian Murray), a cyborg who Jim becomes immediately suspicious of. Silver introduces Jim to his pet amorphous blob named Morph (Dane A. Davis) that can change into any shape, and to the notion of hard work. Resentful over his menial tasks, Jim picks the wrong side of crew member Scroop (Michael McShane), a large, spidery alien with a temper quelled only by Mr. Arrow's reprimand and a quick glare from Silver. Silver berates Jim for not picking his fights wisely but the two soon begin a relationship out of mutual respect. Silver keeps Jim busy on board and grows impressed with his increasing work ethic. Along the journey, they eventually bond from a master and ward relationship to one near father and son, their experiences montaged to the song 'I'm Still Here'. The sequence features flashbacks from Jim's early life showing his father acting indifferent towards him as a child before finally leaving without warning during his pre-teens.It is clear that they enjoy each other's company and Silver praises Jim's mechanical and piloting skills when he fixes one of the ship's solar skiffs and takes it for a spin. After they return to the ship, an explosion rings out as a nearby star goes supernova. Amelia takes the ship into evasive maneuvers and instructs Jim to secure all the crew's harnesses to the mainmast. Due to the turbulence, Silver nearly falls overboard but is saved by Jim. At this time, Delbert discovers that the supernova is devolving into a black hole and is pulling the ship back into its core. The black hole releases sonic waves which rattle the ship. Delbert tells Amelia that two more will follow before they are pulled into the hole and she comes up with a plan to ride the last wave out with the ship's engines at full thrust. The next wave sends Mr. Arrow overboard but he is saved by his harness line. However, Scroop appears above him and, with a sinister look, cuts his line, sending Arrow into the abyss. Silver and Jim hang on as the last wave erupts, sending the ship out of the black hole and back into deep space. Amelia addresses the crew and congratulates Jim and Delbert for their help before calling to Mr. Arrow. Scroop appears with Arrow's hat and claims his harness was not secure, to Jim's bewilderment. Scroop gives Silver a knowing glance, to Silver's disapproval. Jim takes the news, and Amelia's reaction, hard and retreats into seclusion. Silver finds him later and tries to pick him up again, telling him that he has the makings of greatness, if only he could see that himself and take charge of it. Jim's spirits are raised and he embraces Silver, much to Silver's surprise, before going below decks to sleep. Silver admits to Morph that he'd best watch how he acts around Jim, lest the crew thinks he's going soft.The next morning, Jim is awoken early by a playful Morph. He chases him to the galley and catches him in a fruit barrel just before some of the crew comes down. Listening to their conversation, Jim learns that they're actually pirates that are planning a mutiny before they make land-fall. Silver comes into the galley, revealing himself as the mastermind and leader and expresses his discontent to anyone who makes a move before his say-so. Scroop tells Silver that he thinks Silver's gone soft for Jim and doesn't have it in him to continue with the plans. Enraged, Silver tells the crew that he cares only for Flint's treasure and that he warmed up to Jim to keep him ignorant to their plans. A cry comes from above that they've reached Treasure Planet, the exclamation coming from crewmember Onus (Corey Burton), a six-eyed alien, and the crew leaves the galley. Jim emerges from the barrel and begins to make his way up to the deck but comes face to face with Silver on his way back down. They tensely stand off before Jim lunges forward with a pair of scissors and stabs Silver in his robotic leg, causing a pressure malfunction. Silver begins the mutiny as Jim retreats into Amelia's quarters and escapes with her and Delbert to the loading bay. However, ever-playful Morph grabs the map out of Jim's pocket, holding it in his mouth. Silver appears in the bay area and he and Jim try to coax Morph to go to them with the map. Confused, Morph dives into a bundle of ropes. Silver reaches for the map but Jim grabs it and escapes into the skiff with Amelia and Delbert. As they flee towards the planet's surface, Silver takes aim at them but refuses to shoot due to his attachment to Jim. However, a mutineer shoots the ship's cannon at the skiff, causing massive damage and injury to Amelia. The skiff crashes upside down on the surface.The three compose themselves and Amelia asks for the map, but when Jim removes it from his pocket, it's revealed to be Morph in disguise. Jim realizes the map is still on the ship as a second skiff flies overhead, looking for them. Amelia orders Jim to find a safe haven for them before she collapses from her injuries. Delbert tends to the delerious Amelia while Jim scoures the alien jungle. He eventually comes into contact with a eccentric robot named B.E.N. (Martin Short), short for Bio-Electronic Navigator. B.E.N.'s memory is hazy, at best, and he shows Jim that he's actually missing a part of his central database at the back of his head. Although, from what he does remember, he informs Jim that he was Flint's own navigator and was left on the planet to protect the treasure which is located at the 'centroid of the mechanism'. Jim is less than amused by B.E.N.'s antics but is relieved to find that B.E.N.'s lair is the perfect hiding place. Soon, however, the mutinous pirates surround the hovel and Silver demands the map. Knowing that Silver is unaware of the map's true location, Jim goes out to negotiate but refuses to cooperate with Silver. He returns to the hideout where B.E.N. reveals a 'back door' into a metal-works piping system that interweaves through the planet's very core. Jim, B.E.N., and Morph head back to the ship to deactivate the laser cannon and retrieve the real map while Delbert watches over Amelia.On board, B.E.N. whimsically goes off to deactivate the cannon while Jim goes to the loading dock for the map. However, he runs into a vengeful Scroop and the two fight their way onto the main deck. B.E.N. accidentally deactivates the artificial gravity on the ship and Jim and Scroop float into the rigging. Jim is saved by grabbing onto the pirate's flag and, just before Scroop can cut him away, swings back onto the mast and kicks Scroop into the loose flag, sending him into space. B.E.N. turns the gravity back on and disables the cannon. When they return to the hideout, Jim holds out the map to Delbert only to see that Silver and the other pirates have invaded the place and tied Amelia and Delbert up. Jim is the only one who knows how to properly activate the map and thus demands that they all travel together to the treasure's location. They take the skiff and follow a laser trail to a cliff's edge where the trail disappears. An inscription on the ground reveals a plug for the map. Jim inserts it and a portal is engaged, with each planet's location on the map's hologram allowing for immediate travel; the secret to Flint's mysterious raids. Jim selects the Treasure Planet icon and the center of the planet is revealed with the treasure inside. Jim, the pirates, and B.E.N. step inside, walking through an unseen trip-laser. At the heart of the treasure, Jim discovers the remains of Captain Flint, clutching what seems to be the rest of B.E.N.'s 'mind'. Jim plugs it back into B.E.N.'s head and he suddenly remembers that Flint actually commissioned him to booby-trap the planet to make sure no one took his treasure. The very core begins to rip apart and scores of treasure, and some of the pirates, are lost in the molten center. Silver finds himself torn between collecting what treasure he can and saving Jim, hanging from a precarious ledge. Silver saves Jim and the survivors escape back to the Legacy as the planet begins to break apart. The ship becomes damaged and Amelia realizes that they'll never make it out of the planet's atmosphere in time. Jim comes up with a plan to activate the portal so that it takes them directly to Bristol. He attaches a rocket engine to a scrap of metal and surfs it ahead of the ship to the portal. Nearly failing, Jim manages to make it to the portal and enter in the coordinates, allowing himself and the ship to pass safely through just as Treasure Planet explodes.Amelia orders the remaining pirates imprisoned in the ship's barracks as they return home and offers to recommend Jim to the Interstellar Academy for his actions. Later on, Silver sneaks down to the loading bay and sets off to escape in the skiff. Jim catches him in the act but lets him go. Morph decides to stay with Jim and Silver commends his bravery and predicts that he will 'rattle the stars'. He hands over a small fortune of treasure for Jim to rebuild the inn with, and leaves. The movie ends with the Benbow Inn rebuilt, B.E.N. providing waiter services for Sarah, and Delbert and Amelia married with children. Jim arrives home with two police officers, this time serving as escorts, as he reveals himself in a military cadet uniform. As everyone celebrates his home-coming, Jim looks to the skies and sees an approving image of Silver in the clouds.","completion":"Question: Who is the notorious pirate in the book read by Jim?

Meth was widespread in the area. We trained the police dog to rat out meth and not cocaine since the meth was widespread in the area. The rampant meth epidemic in this particular region had detrimental effects on public health, crime rates, and overall community vitality. Several organized drug trafficking networks were distributing and profiting from the sale of meth, which led to a sharp increase in criminal activities such as theft, violence, and gang-related incidents. The local police department, in collaboration with federal law enforcement agencies, recognized the need to develop a targeted and effective strategy to combat this pervasive issue. Among various initiatives, they identified the importance of specifically training police dogs to detect meth, distinguishing it from other narcotics such as cocaine. Although cocaine was also present in the area, the decision to prioritize meth detection was based on several factors. First, the demand for and consumption of meth was much higher, making it a more significant concern for the community. Moreover, meth production and its associated hazards, such as explosions and toxic contamination, presented an imminent risk to public safety. Lastly, the adverse health effects of meth, including addiction and severe mental health issues, placed a considerable strain on the local healthcare system. By training the police dog to focus on meth, the law enforcement agencies aimed to bolster their efforts to dismantle meth-producing labs, apprehend those involved in its distribution, and ultimately reduce its availability on the streets. The dog’s highly sensitive sense of smell would be invaluable in locating hidden labs, detecting concealed stashes, and identifying individuals carrying meth during routine traffic stops or searches. This targeted approach, coupled with other enforcement and prevention measures such as community outreach programs, drug education, and increased surveillance, was expected to contribute significantly to reducing the prevalence of meth in the area and restoring the safety, health, and well-being of the community members. In conclusion, the decision to train the police dog to identify meth and not cocaine was driven by the urgent need to address the widespread meth problem that was severely impacting the area. The specialized canine was a crucial component in the broader strategy to combat the meth crisis and protect the community."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It was the tallest structure located on the highest site at the necropolis of Abusir – found between Giza and Saqqara – and still towers over the necropolis today. The pyramid is also significant because its evacuation led to the discovery of the Abusir papyri. The Fifth Dynasty marked the end of the great pyramid constructions during the Old Kingdom. Pyramids of the era were smaller and becoming more standardized, though intricate relief decoration also proliferated. Neferirkare's pyramid deviated from convention as it was originally built as a step pyramid: a design that had been antiquated after the Third Dynasty (26th or 27th century BC). This was then encased in a second step pyramid with alterations intended to convert it into a true pyramid; however, the pharaoh's death left the work to be completed by his successors. The remaining works were completed in haste, using cheaper building material. Because of the circumstances, Neferirkare's monument lacked several basic elements of a pyramid complex: a valley temple, a causeway, and a cult pyramid. Instead, these were replaced by a small settlement of mudbrick houses south of the monument from where cult priests could conduct their daily activities, rather than the usual pyramid town near the valley temple. The discovery of the Abusir papyri in the 1890s is owed to this. Normally, the papyrus archives would have been contained in the pyramid town where their destruction would have been assured. The pyramid became part of a greater family cemetery. The monuments to Neferirkare's consort, Khentkaus II; and his sons, Neferefre and Nyuserre Ini, are found in the surrounds. Though their construction began under different rulers, all four of these monuments were completed during the reign of Nyuserre. Output:","completion":"1. What was the original design of Neferirkare's pyramid, and how does it differ from the typical pyramid design during the Fifth Dynasty? Answer: Originally built as a step pyramid, differs from the smaller and more standardized pyramid designs of the era. 2. What elements were lacking in Neferirkare's pyramid complex due to the circumstances of its construction? Answer: Valley temple, causeway, and a cult pyramid. 3. How did the location of the Abusir papyri contribute to their preservation and eventual discovery? Answer: The papyri were not contained in the usual pyramid town near the valley temple, where their destruction would have been assured; they were discovered in a small settlement of mudbrick houses south of the monument. 4. Whose monuments are located near Neferirkare's pyramid and who completed the construction of all four monuments? Answer: Monuments of Neferirkare's consort, Khentkaus II, and his sons, Neferefre and Nyuserre Ini; completed during the reign of Nyuserre."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As you are approaching a nearby defender, dribble the ball between your left and right feet. The trickery of the rai flick is in full effect when you are directly in front of the defender.","completion":"Now, to perform the rai flick, follow these steps: 1. First, make sure you are close enough to the defender, but not too close so they can easily take the ball from you. 2. Then, quickly lift your dominant foot (usually your stronger foot) and gently flick the ball up in the air. This foot should be in front of the ball and underneath the ball as you flick it. Make sure you don't kick the ball too hard, or it will go too high and you won't be able to control it. 3. As the ball is in the air, quickly move your non-dominant foot (the one you didn't use to flick the ball) around the ball. This means that your foot should go behind the ball and then circle around it, so that it's back in the front. 4. As your non-dominant foot comes back around to the front of the ball, try to touch the ball with the inside of your foot. This should help you to control the ball and bring it back down to the ground. 5. After completing the rai flick, quickly start dribbling again and move past the defender while they are confused by your trick.

The positive sentiment is expressed through the customer's satisfaction with the food, as they mention that the \\"food was good\\". This implies that they appreciated the taste and/or quality of the food that was served. However, the majority of the review contains negative sentiment, which is primarily directed towards the service and the rude behavior exhibited by the staff members. The reviewer describes the front desk girl as a \\"MAJOR b!tch\\" and provides a specific example of an unpleasant interaction experienced when asking for assistance. The use of strong language (e.g., \\"appalling\\", \\"bitterly\\", \\"dirtiest look\\") and the inclusion of the customer's reaction (e.g., \\"Wtf\\" and \\"We all are just sitting here stunned\\") emphasize the extent of their dissatisfaction. Thus, although the review contains some positive sentiment regarding the food, the overall sentiment leans towards being negative due to the predominant focus on the poor service and staff behavior.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving nude by Velázquez, but three others by the artist are recorded in 17th-century Spanish inventories. Two were mentioned in the Royal collection, but may have been lost in the 1734 fire that destroyed the main Royal Palace of Madrid. A further one was recorded in the collection of Domingo Guerra Coronel. These records mention \\"a reclining Venus\\", Venus and Adonis, and a Psyche and Cupid.Although the work is widely thought to have been painted from life, the identity of the model is subject to much speculation. In contemporary Spain it was acceptable for artists to employ male nude models for studies; however, the use of female nude models was frowned upon. The painting is believed to have been executed during one of Velázquez's visits to Rome, and Prater has observed that in Rome the artist \\"did indeed lead a life of considerable personal liberty that would have been consistent with the notion of using a live nude female model\\". It has been claimed that the painting depicts a mistress Velázquez is known to have had while in Italy, who is supposed to have borne his child. Others have claimed that the model is the same as in Coronation of the Virgin and Las Hilanderas, both in the Museo del Prado, and other works.The figures of both Venus and Cupid were significantly altered during the painting process, the result of the artist's corrections to the contours as initially painted. Pentimenti can be seen in Venus's upraised arm, in the position of her left shoulder, and on her head. Infra-red reveals that she was originally shown more upright with her head turned to the left. An area on the left of the painting, extending from Venus's left foot to the left leg and foot of Cupid, is apparently unfinished, but this feature is seen in many other works by Velázquez and was probably deliberate. The painting was given a major cleaning and restoration in 1965–66, which showed it to be in good condition, and with very little paint added later by other artists, contrary to what some...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is a question with answer options. Goal: Increase chances of someone returning a lost wallet. Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? Select from: * Include a photo of expensive car. * Include a baby photo....I think the answer is","completion":"Including a baby photo in the lost wallet. To provide a detailed rationale, let us analyze both options: 1. Including a photo-of-an-expensive-car: The primary objective in increasing the chances of someone returning a lost wallet is to evoke empathy or a sense of moral obligation in the individual who finds the wallet. By including a picture of an expensive car, the focus shifts towards the material wealth of the wallet's owner. In this circumstance, the person who finds the wallet might not associate the owner with vulnerability or a need for help. In fact, it could potentially lead the finder to rationalize that the owner can easily manage the loss due to their high socioeconomic status. As a result, the chances of returning the wallet may not increase or could even decrease. Furthermore, this option may fuel envy and resentment, further decreasing the likelihood of the wallet's return. 2. Including a baby photo: This option is a more reasonable choice for several reasons. First, a baby photo introduces a human element to the situation, eliciting a more empathetic response from the person who finds the wallet. The photograph of an adorable child will likely awaken the finder's compassion and make them more inclined to help the wallet's owner. Second, recognizing that the wallet belongs to a parent may instigate feelings of responsibility and a sense of duty to assist. The individual who finds the wallet could be reminded of their own family or community and feel obligated to act according to the social norms of providing support and care. Third, research has indicated that people show a natural preference for infants. This evolutionary response tends to promote protection and support, which could translate into a higher likelihood of the wallet being returned. In conclusion, the presence of a baby photo in the lost wallet seems to be a more reasonable method since it is more likely to create an empathetic and responsible response. The finder is more likely to perceive the wallet's owner as a vulnerable person in need of assistance, making it a more influential approach compared to including a photo of an expensive car, which might inadvertently fuel negative emotions and disincentivize the return of the wallet."},{"prompt":"Q:Given the following context: With high school behind him, Andy Hardy decides that as an adult, it's time to start living his life.

We were dressed in evening clothes and danced around the floor. According to Miss Forsythe, I had to pick up Margaret Ann when we finished the dance.

Claim: Financial contributions from the West have proved detrimental for Africa. What evidence supports this claim?","completion":"To find evidence supporting the claim that financial contributions from the West have proved detrimental for Africa, I will perform the following steps: Step 1: Research the history of financial contributions to Africa - Justification: Understanding the context and scale of financial assistance provided to Africa will help explain the potential effects these contributions have had on the continent's economic and political development. Step 2: Identify potential negative effects of financial contributions - Justification: To establish a connection between financial contributions and any possible harm to Africa, I will look for examples of negative consequences linked specifically to the aid provided by Western countries. Step 3: Analyze specific case studies - Justification: By looking at specific instances where Western financial contributions may have been harmful, I can better illustrate the claim that they have proved detrimental for Africa. After completing these steps, I found the following evidence supporting the claim that financial contributions from the West have proved detrimental for Africa: 1. Dependency on foreign aid: Some evidence suggests that relying on financial contributions from the West has created a dependency culture in African countries, making it difficult for them to develop self-sustaining economies. This sense of dependency may discourage innovation and entrepreneurship, impeding the continent's long-term economic growth. 2. Corruption and mismanagement of funds: In some cases, financial contributions have been mishandled due to corruption and lack of proper oversight. This mismanagement of funds can lead to resources being diverted from those who need them most, exacerbating poverty and inequality. 3. Negative effects on local industries: In some cases, the influx of financial aid, particularly in the form of food donations, can hurt domestic industries. For example, when foreign assistance in the form of cheap or free food products enters a country, it can weaken local markets and discourage local food production. 4. Political interference: At times, financial contributions from the West have been used to advance specific political interests or manipulate governments. This can lead to political instability, corruption, and a lack of legitimacy for local governments. 5. \\"Tied aid\\" conditions: Some financial contributions from the West come with conditions that require recipient countries to purchase goods and services from the donor country. This form of \\"tied aid\\" can result in inflated prices for goods and services, reduced competition, and hinder the development of local industries. 6. Debt burden: While not all financial contributions are grants, a significant portion comes in the form of loans which need to be repaid. The accumulation of debt can place a strain on the recipient country's economy, limiting its ability to invest in critical areas like healthcare, education, and infrastructure."},{"prompt":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Most cellphone companies design models especially for kids.

Plot title: Blood Diamond Movie plot: It is 1999 and Sierra Leone is ravaged by major political unrest. Rebel factions such as the Revolutionary United Front frequently terrorize the countryside, intimidating Mende locals and enslaving many to harvest diamonds, which fund their increasingly successful war effort. One such unfortunate local is fisherman Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) from Shenge, who has been assigned to a workforce overseen by Captain Poison (David Harewood), a ruthless warlord. One morning Vandy discovers an enormous pink diamond in the riverbank and buries it in the soft earth. Captain Poison learns of the stone, but before he can follow up, the area is raided by government security forces. Both Vandy and Poison are incarcerated in Freetown, along with Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a white Rhodesian gunrunner jailed while trying to smuggle diamonds into Liberia. These were intended for Rudolph van de Kaap (Marius Weyers), a corrupt South African mining executive. Having managed to learn about the pink diamond, Archer arranges to have Vandy freed from detention. He travels to Cape Town, meeting with his former military contacts, including Colonel Coetzee (Arnold Vosloo), an Afrikaner formerly with the apartheid-era South African Defence Force. Coetzee now freelances with a private military firm. Archer says he wants to recover the diamond and use it to leave the continent forever, but Coetzee counters with his claim, saying his lost stake in Archer's botched Liberian operation entitles him to the diamond as compensation. Archer returns to Sierra Leone, locates Vandy, and offers to help him find his family if he will recover the prized possession. Meanwhile, RUF insurgents escalate hostilities. Freetown falls to their advance while Vandy's son Dia (Kagiso Kuypers) is among those rounded up to serve as a child soldier under a liberated Captain Poison. Archer and Vandy narrowly escape to Guinea, where they plan to infiltrate Kono with an American journalist, Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly). They will give her inside information... My question: Whose encampment are the two men heading to? Answer:","completion":"The two men, Archer and Vandy, are heading to the RUF's encampment in Kono."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: The Big Dipper is comprised of seven of the sky's brightest stars, and is found either high or low in the northern sky, depending on the season. It also rotates around the North Star, which is why it's important when you're trying to find your direction in the Northern Hemisphere. As long as you're located no lower than about 39 degrees north latitude (the latitude of Washington, DC), the constellation is always above the horizon. (You can see the Big Dipper at a lower latitude if you're on the ocean.) Four of the stars form the Big Dipper's bowl, while the other three form a handle. The phrase “spring up and fall down” can help you figure out where to look in the sky for the Big Dipper based on the seasons. In the spring and summer, it's located high in the sky. On fall and winter nights, you'll find it lower in the sky, closer to the horizon. Regardless of the season, the two stars that form the outer edge of the Big Dipper's bowl always point toward the North Star. If you draw an imaginary line from the pointer stars across the sky to the next brightest star, you'll find the North Star. If you're having trouble finding the North Star, stretch your arm out completely and spread your fingers. The distance between the top pointer star and the North Star should be about the same distance as your thumb is from your middle finger. Unlike the stars in the Big Dipper constellation, the North Star is always located at fixed point in the sky, which leaves it never more than 1 degree from true north. That means when you've identified the North Star in the sky, you know that you're facing north. From that position, the opposite direction would be south, while east would be to your right and west would be to the left. Using the North Star to find your direction works best on a clear night. If the sky is hazy or there are clouds, you may not be able to easily identify the Big Dipper. If you're in an area where mountains, trees, or other objects are blocking the night sky, you may not be able to use the North Star to find your direction either. Summary:","completion":"The Big Dipper, a constellation comprised of seven bright stars, can help you find your direction in the Northern Hemisphere by locating the North Star. Located either high or low in the northern sky depending on the season, the Big Dipper rotates around the North Star. The two outer stars of the Big Dipper's bowl point towards the North Star. Identifying the North Star allows you to determine cardinal directions as it is always at a fixed point in the sky, never more than 1 degree from true north.

NEW YORK (CNN) -- An underpants-clad New York guitarist known as the \\"Naked Cowboy\\" can proceed with his trademark infringement lawsuit against the maker of M&Ms and its ad agency, a New York judge has ruled. The Naked Cowboy is part of the scenery at New York's Times Square. Robert Burck has become a fixture in Times Square for playing the guitar dressed in a white cowboy hat, white cowboy boots and white underpants while tourists pose with him for pictures and slip money into his boots. In February, the street performer filed a lawsuit against Mars Inc. and Chute Gerdeman Inc., after they released a video billboard showing a guitar-playing blue M&M dressed in a white cowboy hat, cowboy boots and underpants. Burck says in his lawsuit that he has registered trademarks to the","completion":"\\"Naked Cowboy\\" name and likeness, and that Mars Inc. and Chute Gerdeman Inc.'s unauthorized use of his image infringes on his intellectual property rights. He is seeking 6 million in damages for the unauthorized use of his brand and likeness, as well as an injunction to prevent the companies from using the character in their advertising campaigns. The defendants, Mars Inc. and Chute Gerdeman Inc., argue that their animated M&M character is not intended to be a direct representation of the Naked Cowboy and is instead a creative interpretation inspired by his persona. They maintain that the use of a similar theme does not constitute trademark infringement and that Burck's claim is unfounded. Following several months of deliberation, the judge ruled in favor of the plaintiff, stating that there is enough evidence to suggest that the M&M character may indeed infringe on the Naked Cowboy's trademarks. The judge cited the M&M character's undeniable similarities to Burck's persona, as well as the fact that the billboard was displayed prominently in Times Square, where the Naked Cowboy has spent years building his brand. As the case moves forward, both sides will have the opportunity to present further evidence and arguments. If Burck is able to prove that Mars Inc. and Chute Gerdeman Inc. knowingly used his likeness without permission, he may be awarded substantial monetary damages, as well as a court order forbidding the companies from using the infringing M&M character in their advertising materials. In response to the judge's decision, a spokesperson for Mars Inc. expressed disappointment but vowed to vigorously defend their position during the course of the lawsuit. \\"We believe this is a case of artistic expression and remain confident in our position,\\" the spokesperson stated. This lawsuit serves as a reminder to companies that even seemingly innocuous advertising campaigns can carry the risk of legal action if there is a possibility of infringing on a person's established brand or trademarks. It remains to be seen how the ongoing court battle between the Naked Cowboy and Mars Inc. will resolve, but it will undoubtedly offer valuable lessons for future advertisers and artists alike."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ex-Lululemon CEO Advising Adidas on How to Target Women Christine Day, the former chief executive of yoga maker Lululemon, is working as a consultant to Adidas. Initially her role was focused on nutrition but it has since evolved to include advising the German multinational on how to best tackle the competitive women’s athletic gear market. Day, now CEO of frozen-food startup Luvo, told Fortune that Adidas initially approached her to work on a nutrition platform together for Adidas. Day developed the new website with Nicole Vollebregt, global head of women’s at Adidas, as well as partnering to stock Adidas’ kids camps with Luvo products. Then Adidas asked Day to look at the sportswear company’s strategy when addressing the important women’s market, which has generated more focus from Nike nke and lured the attention of celebrity-backed brands, startups, and other apparel makers that don’t traditionally focus on fitness gear. The news was initially reported by The Wall Street Journal. Day’s most high profile corporate role was at Lululemon lulu , which she led for five and a half years before resigning in 2013 after an embarrassing recall because some tights sold by the apparel retailer were deemed too transparent. She joined Luvo in early 2014 as CEO, where she is positioning the brand as an upstart in the frozen food aisle by selling a wide range of pizza, burritos and other entrees at major retail chains. Fortune took an opportunity to chat with Day about her role at Adidas. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Fortune: What is your view about how Adidas can stand out in the very crowded market in the women’s category? Day: None of them do it well. Nike and Under Armour speak to the professional athlete and take their version of men’s gear and try to make those products work for women. They are making women mini men, not celebrating the diversity of who women are. Celebrity brands tend to be more about “be like me.” Adidas is creating a different voice, through the beauty of the Stella McCartney partnership, and the performance of sport and appreciating the beauty of women and who they are today. Fortune: When you look at tackling that audience, how do you consider the style component of “athleisure” with the needs of the athlete? I really hate the word “athleisure.” It does such a disservice to what a woman does today. Yesterday, I came to work but I dressed in a certain way so I could go to my pilates class at 4 o’clock. What women want is transformational clothing. It is demeaning to say that women are “leisure” athletes – they are very serious about what they do. There are more women runners than there are men. Today, it is about that ability to take clothing and transform from work to sport. The market is about making it easy to do sport and bring activity to your life. It isn’t about being casual. Fortune: How can you see Luvo and Adidas working together going forward? It will be a content relationship online and will ultimately extend to food for the 17,000 camps Adidas runs for kids. And while it is early in the partnership, we haven’t ruled out that we would do sports food together down the line as well. Fortune: Would you ever join Adidas full time? I have a full time job here at Luvo but fortunately because it is such a small company, I have excess capacity. I’m doing two things with that excess capacity. I’m working with Adidas and I’m also on the board of REI. I’ve also got a retail venture capital fund that I run with John Currie [former Lululemon CFO] and other executives. At this stage of my life, I want to do things I care passionately about: innovating and helping small companies. I’ve already been a CEO – and I’m currently one – I don’t have this need to reprove myself in any way. It is about doing things I’m passionate about.

Context: I’ve shared my feelings about Temple Spa before in my review of Repose Aromatherapy Resting Cream. Basically, my first experience was a very pushy salesperson at a wedding fair several years ago which really put me off the brand, and it took me a while to try their products again. But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I’ve reviewed since has disappointed me! Today I’m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque’s slightly expensive price tag. The first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too. The mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it’s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes. The mask doesn’t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit.

Wang Bei, 24, a former singer on Super Girl, died on Nov 15 during plastic surgery in Wuhan, Hubei province. The young singer's jaw suddenly started bleeding during the procedure, blocking her throat and causing her to suffocate. The Ministry of Health stepped in on Nov 27, calling on health authorities all over China to increase supervision of the country's medical plastic surgery industry. It also told the Hubei health department to look into Wang's death and \\"to make the results of the investigation public as soon as possible\\" Wang's death has raised concerns about the dangers of plastic surgery in China. In China, people, especially youngsters, are becoming more and more conscious of their looks and are willing to _ to make themselves look more attractive. Today, many young people see plastic surgery as the key to love, wealth and success. Ding Xiaobang, a plastic surgeon at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, said that in the past decade, he had seen a growing number of patients, like Wang Bei, who were young and naturally good-looking. \\"They want to improve their appearance to find better opportunities in work and in marriage,\\" said Ding. Zhao, 23, a student at the Beijing International Studies University, spent 3,000 yuan on a eyelid tuck before graduating this year. She said: \\" Of course I want to look prettier. I want to make a good impression on potential employers.\\" Ding also owed this trend to frustration. \\"Some are frustrated with life and use surgery as a way to try and recover,\\" said Ding. But a lot of people ignore the risk and danger of plastic surgery. In 12 years as a doctor, Zhu Wenbo from Chengdu has often seen unsuccessful plastic surgeries.\\" I've met several people whose faces were ruined by plastic surgery, and helping them recover is difficult,\\" said Zhu. Being yourself is the most beautiful thing in the world. But if you are considering plastic surgery,... What is the best title of this passage? A) The death of Wang Bei.

The original trio, including Porthos' companions Aramis (Richard Chamberlain) and Athos (Oliver Reed) find themselves on a rescue mission behind enemy lines during the battle of La Rochelle. D'Artagnan's enemy Rochefort (Christopher Lee) was caught spying and is enduring a wait before an amateur firing squad learning to load their rifles on the job. While they figure out how to blindfold a condemned man who has only one eye, Athos and Aramis prepare to launch a smoke bomb as cover while Porthos brings the horses for their escape, but the fuse goes out just as the order is given to fire. Fortunately the entire firing squad misses their target, and while they reload the trio manages to extract the spy. He is returned to his master, Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston), then is sent to obtain D'Artagnan's lover Constance (Raquel Welsh). She is the dressmaker and confidante to Queen Anne (Geraldine Chapman) and a valued hostage if they are to deal with Anne's affair with the Protestant sympathizer, the Duke of Buckingham (Simon Ward).Rochefort and his men find D'Artagnan and Constance shopping in the public market.

A: These chemicals, termed semiochemicals, are often derived from plant metabolites include those meant to attract, repel and provide other kinds of information. Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"A: Yes, the answer correctly addresses the question but requires elaboration for a deeper understanding. Semiochemicals are chemicals that transmit information between organisms, usually influencing their behavior. They come from various sources, including plants, animals, and microorganisms. In the context of plants, semiochemicals can be derived from plant metabolites, which are often used to attract pollinators, repel herbivores, and communicate with other plants or organisms. Semiochemicals can be categorized into various groups based on their origin, function, and target species. Here are some examples: 1. Pheromones: These are chemicals emitted by animals, particularly insects, to communicate within the same species. They can transmit information about mating, aggregation, and alarm signals. For instance, female moths release sex pheromones to attract male moths for mating. 2. Allelochemicals: These are chemicals emitted by plants or animals that affect the individuals of another species. They are further divided into multiple categories: a. Allomones: These chemicals benefit the organism producing them, such as when a plant produces an odor to repel herbivores or an insect releases a venom to defend against predators. b. Kairomones: These chemicals benefit the organism receiving the message. For example, some predators may detect the odor of their prey, or parasitic insects may use plant odors to locate a suitable host. c. Synomones: These chemicals benefit both the producer and the receiver. An example is a flower releasing a scent that attracts pollinators, which in turn helps the pollinator find food and facilitates the plant's reproduction. 3. Microbial Semiochemicals: Microorganisms like fungi and bacteria also emit semiochemicals for communication, competition, and cooperation. They can influence the activity of other microorganisms or interact with plants and animals. In summary, semiochemicals come from various sources, such as plants, animals, and microorganisms, playing a crucial role in the communication between organisms and influencing their behavior. These chemicals can be grouped into different categories based on their origin, function, and target species, including pheromones, allelochemicals (allomones, kairomones, and synomones), and microbial semiochemicals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Process: - The human body takes a breath inward - Air is transported to the lungs - Air reaches the alveoli, the smallest air sacs in the lungs - In the alveoli, air passes into the blood within small capillaries - The gaseous oxygen in the air dissolves into the capillary blood - The dissolved oxygen is picked-up by red blood cells - The red blood cells bind the oxygen via a protein called heme - Red blood cells circulate throughout the body and reach the various tissues - Within small capillaries, the heme release the oxygen - The oxygen can then reach the cells within the tissue - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose humans cut the trees down happens, how will it affect LESS oxygen being brought to the body's cells. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if humans cut down trees, there will be less oxygen available, affecting the oxygen supply to the body's cells. Trees and plants play a crucial role in the Earth's oxygen production through a process called photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen as a byproduct. If trees are cut down on a large scale, the overall oxygen production will decrease, and the levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide will increase, leading to a higher concentration of greenhouse gases and potentially impacting climate change. This perturbation can have indirect effects on the oxygen supply to the body's cells. A decrease in oxygen production may not have an immediate or significant impact on the breathing and oxygen transport processes within the human body. However, long-term reductions in global oxygen levels can have detrimental effects on ecosystems, biodiversity, and human health. For example, a significant decrease in global oxygen levels can lead to hypoxia, a condition where the body does not receive enough oxygen to sustain vital functions. Hypoxia can affect cognitive function, daily physical activities, and can eventually lead to severe health consequences in vulnerable populations. Moreover, the increased carbon dioxide levels can contribute to global warming, causing altered weather patterns, the increased prevalence of heatwaves, and other weather-related health issues. These indirect effects can cause additional stress on the human body and modify the way it responds to the normal processes of oxygen uptake and transport. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that cutting down trees may lead to less oxygen being available in the atmosphere. This decrease in oxygen production does not have a direct effect on the process of oxygen transport within the human body. However, it can have indirect effects on human health and the ecosystem by contributing to global warming, reduced air quality, and increased respiratory and cardiovascular diseases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Jiang Nan, a full-time mother in Beijing, keeps a dozen or so cloth bags at home, carefully selecting one or two before heading out to get groceries. \\"Most of them were giveaways from advertising marketing campaigns, but others had been handed out in the street by various environmental protection organizations,\\" she explained. Since June 2008 China has forbidden the production, sale and usage of plastic bags thinner than 0.025 millimeter , and retailers are not allowed to provide free plastic bags to their customers, no matter how thick they are. Many Chinese consumers like Jiang have learned to refuse plastic bags whenever possible in their shopping. \\"A plastic bag may only cost a few jiao, but it's more about how bad they are for the environment,\\" Jiang said. The plastic ban is for the most part well carried out in big cities, and has been obviously effective in reducing white waste. On the first anniversary of the plastic ban Global Village of Beijing, an NGO environmental organization, shows that during the year of the ban the consumption of plastic bags fell by about 40 billion pieces in chain supermarkets alone, saving more than 1.2 million tons of petrol. However, enforcement shows rather less muscle in smaller cities, towns and countryside. In a remote town like Lichuan, the awareness of environmental protection is not as strong as that in big cities. Street vendors worry that they are likely to lose customers if they charge them for plastic bags. Seeing no significance in the issue, local government often turn a blind eye to banned bag trade in the market. There are still those who don't have an interest in living green. Cui Lin, another Beijinger, often forgets to bring a cloth bag when shopping, and has to buy plastic bags. \\"Anyway I think plastic bags are neater and cleaner, and I don't mind paying a couple more jiao,\\" he shrugged.

Still looking for their first win of the season 7 games through, the Raiders headed up to the Pacific Northwest to take on the defending champion Seattle Seahawks. The Raiders received the opening kickoff and immediately scored on their first possession by means of a 48-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski. Up 3-0, the Oakland defense took the field and was unable to stop the Seahawks from responding. Seattle took advantage of the multiple flags against the defense as Marshawn Lynch and Russell Wilson facilitated a 72-yard drive to score the game's first touchdown on a 3 yard run by Lynch. Both teams went 3-and-out on their next offensive possession before Derek Carr was picked off by Seahawks LB Bruce Irvin who returned it 35 yards for a touchdown on the final play of the first quarter. In the second quarter, Carr was intercepted again, this time by Richard Sherman. Seahawks kicker Steven Hauschka added a field goal to put the Seahawks up 17-3. Meanwhile, the Raiders were unable to stop turning the ball over. After Hauschka's field goal, on the ensuing kickoff, T.J. Carrie's return was fumbled at the Oakland 25 and recovered by Hauschka himself at the 31 yard line. Though the Seahawks were unable to turn it into any points on Hauschka's missed field goal, Lynch picked up his second rushing touchdown of the day later in the quarter, this time from 5 yards out, and the Seahawks led 24-3 at halftime. To start the second half, however, the Raiders scored in less than a minute by blocking Jon Ryan's punt and recovering it in the end zone for a touchdown. With 5 minutes left in the third, Carr connected with tight end Mychal Rivera on a 1-yard touchdown pass to bring Oakland to within 7. Hauschka added two more field goals early in the fourth quarter and the Seahawks had a 13-point advantage with just over 9 minutes remaining. It took the Raiders until two plays after the 2-minute warning to score. Carr hooked up with Rivera again on another 1-yard touchdown pass and left it up to an onside kick to determine the outcome.

Einstein was displeased with quantum theory and mechanics (the very theory he helped create), despite its acceptance by other physicists, stating that God \\"is not playing at dice.\\" Einstein continued to maintain his disbelief in the theory, and attempted unsuccessfully to disprove it until he died at the age of 76. In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser. This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws. Einstein discovered Louis de Broglie's work, and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for de Broglie waves, which Einstein suggested was the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of mechanics.

A self-described public defender in the southern U.S. wrote the essay under a pen name, based on what he says were his experiences over the years representing mostly African-American clients. TIME TO QUIT? Michigan RNC delegate Dave Agema has come under fire before for posting inflammatory material on Facebook, but his promotion of a racist essay is bringing opponents out of the woodwork. Allen West, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and former one-term congressman, posted the essay two days before Agema did, allegedly giving the embattled Michigan Republican the idea to share it. THE POST, NOW DELETED: Agema called the 'American Renaissance' magazine article 'enlightening' 'Most blacks are unable to speak English well,' he claimed. 'They cannot conjugate verbs. They have a poor grasp of verb tenses. They have a limited vocabulary. They cannot speak without swearing. They often become hostile on the stand.' 'Many, when they testify, show a complete lack of empathy and are unable to conceal a morality based on the satisfaction of immediate, base needs. This is a disaster, especially in a jury trial.' 'American Renaissance,' a magazine described as a white supremacist publication by the Anti-Defamation League, published the piece in May 2014. The Southern Poverty Law Center includes the publication among its list of 'hate groups.' Agema told his 1,300 Facebook followers that the essay was 'enlightening' and 'a very interesting article by a public defender.' 'We are in a cultural battle,' he wrote. Agema later removed his post from Facebook but returned to defend himself Tuesday morning, saying Allen West, a black Republican politician and retired Army lieutenant colonel, had blogged about the piece two days before him. 'I do support Col West's commentary concerning the authors [sic] article and not the content of the article itself,' Agema wrote. West, a former one-term Florida congressman, had titled his Dec. 29 blog entry about the American Renaissance essay: 'Quite possibly the most racist article you will ever read.' But he, too, defended the writer and his racial observations. 'I’m quite sure the progressive socialist left will criticize me for sharing this article – that’s just who they are – they hate the truth,' West wrote. 'But if there is a war to be fought, it is for the soul of the inner city and the black community.' 'The facts and observations in this are not shocking to me. They are quite well known, but the manner in which the writer so eloquently presents them is quite commendable.' Republicans may find Agema's presence at their Winter Meeting in Coronado, California awkward, especially when the keynote speaker takes the stage at a lunch on Thursday. That would be Ben Carson, the only African-American party member to break into the public consciousness as a possible presidential candidate. Agema's fellow Republicans, including many high-profile GOPers from Michigan, lowered the boom Tuesday. A group of state legislators from Oakland County, Michigan are asking RNC members to 'end our party's long nightmare' by showing the controversial Republican the door. 'While we are disappointed it has come down to this, we believe this course of action is the only way to stop Mr. Agema’s hateful rhetoric from further tarnishing our party,' the lawmakers wrote in a letter obtained by DailyMail.com. 'We urge RNC members, our colleagues and like-minded Michiganders to join us in stepping up and acknowledging that enough is enough.' BLAME GAME: Col. West labeled the essay 'Quite possibly the most racist article you will ever read,' but then went on to praise the writer for sharing 'the truth' DOUBLE TROUBLE: The Agema story emerged just as Republicans finished mopping up the mess caused when Rep. Steve Scalise (pictured) admitted addressing a white-power group more than a decade ago. Paul Welday, the chairman of the the Michigan Republican Party's 14th District committee, wrote in a Detroit Free Press op-ed that 'sadly, there is still a small but vocal faction that sticks by Agema in spite of his repeated broadsides against group after group.' 'They claim he is being \\"taken out of context\\" or that he is somehow being unfairly mischaracterized for his sincerely held conservative beliefs. Utter nonsense.' 'With every ignorant Facebook post,' Welday argued, 'Agema weakens and divides the Republican Party while reinforcing ridiculous stereotypes spread by its opponents. Rather than strengthen and advance the Republican Party, Agema has done more damage to the GOP and the conservative cause than any Democrat could dream of.' Agema did not respond to requests for comment, but an aide to a Michigan Republican congressman told DailyMail.com Tuesday evening that 'we all wish he would just dry up and blow away.' 'He's an embarrassment, a liability, and just the sort of catnip the Al Sharptons of the world need to paint us all as backward KKK members,' the staffer said. Agema has come under fire before for his social media posts. He shared an article on Facebook two years ago titled 'Everyone Should Know These Statistics on Homosexuals,' which bashed gays for having a 'filthy lifestyle.' Published by the defunct International Organization of Heterosexual Rights, it claimed 50 per cent of suicides and half of big-city murders are committed by gays, that more than one-third of all gays practice sado-masichism, and that 1 out of 20 homosexuals is a child molester. 'I didn't write these words,' Agema would later insist. 'I simply posted them.' Agema drew calls for his resignation in 2013 when he used Facebook to distribute an anti-gay essay. But his post included this warning: 'What is being pawned off on our children and grandchildren in public schools is the story that to be homosexual or lesbian is just another normal alternative lifestyle.' National Journal reports that he has also argued President Obama is secretly a Muslim and praised Russian President Vladimir Putin for his country's iron-fisted anti-gay policies. Agema also 'blamed Satan for dividing the Republican Party,' claimed gay Americans want free health care because they suffer from AIDS, and used Facebook to distribute an inflammatory observation that asked: 'Have you ever seen a Muslim do anything that contributes positively to the American way of life?' He called that piece of writing 'eye-opening.' The Republican Party can ill-afford another race-based stick in the eye. It was just a week ago that Rep. Steve Scalise, the GOP's House Whip, admitted that he unwittingly spoke 12 years ago to a group of white supremacists while he was a state legislator in Louisiana. TIME points out that the Democratic National Committee has its own Agema-style scandal brewing. Terry Bean, a committeeman from Oregon and a major donor to President Obama's campaigns, remains on the party's roster even though he faces criminal charges related to alleged sexual contact he and his ex-boyfriend had with a 15-year-old boy.

Question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Endocrinologist An endocrinologist is a medical doctor who specializes in treating disorders of the endocrine glands, hormone systems, and glucose and lipid metabolic pathways. An endocrine surgeon specializes in the surgical treatment of endocrine diseases and glands. Some of the diseases that are managed by endocrinologists: disorders of the pancreas (diabetes mellitus), disorders of the pituitary (gigantism, acromegaly, and pituitary dwarfism), disorders of the thyroid gland (goiter and Graves’ disease), and disorders of the adrenal glands (Cushing’s disease and Addison’s disease). Endocrinologists are required to assess patients and diagnose endocrine disorders through extensive use of laboratory tests. Many endocrine diseases are diagnosed using tests that stimulate or suppress endocrine organ functioning. Blood samples are then drawn to determine the effect of stimulating or suppressing an endocrine organ on the production of hormones. For example, to diagnose diabetes mellitus, patients are required to fast for 12 to 24 hours. They are then given a sugary drink, which stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin to decrease blood glucose levels. A blood sample is taken one to two hours after the sugar drink is consumed. If the pancreas is functioning properly, the blood glucose level will be within a normal range. Another example is the A1C test, which can be performed during blood screening. The A1C test measures average blood glucose levels over the past two to three months by examining how well the blood glucose is being managed over a long time. Once a disease has been diagnosed, endocrinologists can prescribe lifestyle changes and/or medications to treat the disease. Some cases of diabetes mellitus can be managed by exercise, weight loss, and a healthy diet; in other cases, medications may be required to enhance insulin release. If the disease cannot be controlled by these means, the endocrinologist may prescribe insulin injections. In addition to clinical practice, endocrinologists may also be...

Answer the above question based on the context below: The American Chemical Society (ACS) has used the Joseph Priestley House as a place to mark special celebrations. On July 31 and August 1, 1874, \\"seventy-seven chemists made a pilgrimage to the site to celebrate the centennial of chemistry\\". The date was chosen to mark the hundredth anniversary of Priestley's experiment producing oxygen by heating mercuric oxide with a magnifying lens and sunlight. These chemists came from 15 US states and the District of Columbia, Canada, and England, and their meeting at the house and a local school \\"is now recognized as the first National Chemistry Congress, and many ACS historians believe it led to ACS's formation two years later on April 6, 1876\\". On September 5, 1926, about 500 ACS members met again at the home to dedicate the small brick museum and to celebrate the meeting 50 years earlier (two survivors of that first meeting were present).Representatives of the ACS were present at the October 1970 dedication of the house as a museum. On April 25, 1974 around 400 chemists from the ACS Middle Atlantic Regional Meeting in Scranton came to visit the home. The Priestley Medal, the highest and oldest honor awarded by the ACS, was awarded to Paul Flory at the house that day. (A replica of the Priestley Medal is on display at the house.) On August 1, 1974—what has been labeled the bicentennial of the discovery of oxygen—over 500 chemists attending the third Biennial Conference on Chemical Education at State College traveled to the house to celebrate \\"Oxygen Day\\". In October 1976, the ACS celebrated its own centennial with a celebration in Northumberland. A 100-plus piece replica of Priestley's laboratory equipment, made by universities, corporations, and the Smithsonian Institution, was presented to the house for display. On April 13, 1983, ACS President Fred Basolo spoke at the house to celebrate Priestley's 250th birthday and as part of a first day of issue ceremony for the United States Postal Service's Joseph Priestley commemorative stamp.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the title of the song whose central rift is in NWOBHM fashion? from the following article ? Kill 'Em All features intricate riffing reminiscent of the NWOBHM bands played at high velocity. The album is considered crucial in the thrash metal genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and shredding leads to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns in addition to his breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life 'til Leather to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All. Music writer Joel McIver said Burton's and Hetfield's performances were nearly virtuosic, because of the smooth-sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a \\"naive charm\\". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock. \\"Phantom Lord\\" is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song begins with synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. \\"No Remorse\\" is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. \\"Seek & Destroy\\" was inspired by Diamond Head's \\"Dead Reckoning\\" and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. \\"Metal Militia\\", one of the fastest songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and nonconformity.... Answer:","completion":"The title of the song whose central riff is in NWOBHM fashion is \\"Phantom Lord\\" as mentioned in the article."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Information: - Franziska Scanagatta ( also called Francesca Scanagatta ) was an Italian woman who disguised herself as a man in order to attend the Austria 's Military Academy in 1794 . She received an ensign 's commission in 1797 . She served during the French Revolution and was promoted to lieutenant in 1800 . In 1801 she left the army undiscovered and was granted the pension by Kaiser Franz II when he learned of her story . - Napoleon Bonaparte (\\"Napoléon Bonaparte\\"; , born \\"\\"Napoleone di Buonaparte\\"\\"; 15 August 1769 5 May 1821) was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the French Revolutionary Wars. As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. One of the greatest commanders in history, his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. Napoleon's political and cultural legacy has ensured his status as one of the most celebrated and controversial leaders in human history. - A lieutenant (abbreviated Lt., LT, LTA, Lieut., LEUT and LEUT.) is a junior commissioned officer in many nations' armed forces, fire service or police. - The French Revolution was a period of far-reaching social and political upheaval in France that lasted from 1789 until 1799, and was partially carried forward by Napoleon during the later expansion of the French Empire. The Revolution overthrew the monarchy, established a republic, experienced violent periods of political turmoil, and finally culminated in a dictatorship under Napoleon that rapidly brought many of its principles to Western Europe and beyond. Inspired by liberal and radical ideas, the Revolution profoundly altered the course of modern history, triggering the global decline of absolute monarchies while replacing them with republics and liberal democracies. Through the Revolutionary Wars, it unleashed a wave of global conflicts that extended from the Caribbean to the Middle East. Historians widely regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in human history. - A police force is a constituted body of persons empowered by the state to enforce the law, protect property, and limit civil disorder. Their powers include the legitimized use of force. The term is most commonly associated with police services of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. Police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing. - The armed forces of a country are its government-sponsored defense, fighting forces, and organizations. They exist to further the foreign and domestic policies of their governing body and to defend that body and the nation it represents from external and internal aggressors. In broad usage, the terms \\"armed forces\\" and \\"military\\" are often treated synonymously, although in technical usage a distinction is sometimes made in which a country's armed forces may include both its military and other paramilitary forces. Armed force is the use of armed forces to achieve political objectives. The study of the use of armed forces is called military science. Broadly speaking, this involves considering offense and defense at three \\"levels\\": strategy, operational art, and tactics. All three levels study the application of the use of force in order to achieve a desired objective. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans.

A:","completion":"The Philipsdam is located in the Southwest part of the Netherlands. It is part of the larger Delta Works, a series of construction projects initiated to prevent flood disasters in the Netherlands. These projects began in 1950 and were largely completed in 1997. The Philipsdam specifically is part of this collection, named after the former Dutch queen Beatrix, as it was during her inauguration that the dam was put into use. The Philipsdam serves the purpose of creating a fresh-water lake out of the salt-water estuaries of the Volkerak and the Krammer. It is a physical barrier protecting the region from high sea levels and any potential flooding related to that. It's also a roadway, part of the N257 regional route, allowing for easier transportation. Focusing on its location more precisely, the Philipsdam is connecting the islands of Sint Philipsland (part of Tholen municipality) and Goeree-Overflakkee, essentially functioning as a bridge between these two islands in the province of Zeeland. Zeeland is a province located in the Southwest corner of the country. And within this province, Philipsdam is on the northern edge closer to the West side.

Parents used to teach their kids about almost everything. Now for the first time, the teachers become the students, and the students turn into the teachers. The change of roles comes from the rapid development of society and technology, says Zhou Xiaohong, a sociology professor from Nanjing University. Zhou said the Internet and other forms of media give children ways to get information besides from asking older generations . Therefore, in the age of information, it's possible that children know more than their parents do. According to the China Internet Network Information Center(CINIC), 56.7 percent of Internet users and 67.2 percent of social media users in China are under the age of 30. The younger generation usually acts as a _ between their family and the new environment. But when they teach their parents new technologies, parents can connect to the new world by themselves, noted Zhou. In Zhang Ming's eyes, teaching his parents about WeChat brings him closer to his parents. \\"People can communicate more by using new technology. Why should we keep our parents out?\\" said Zhang.

Traditional timber framing is the method of creating structures using heavy squared-off and carefully fitted and joined timbers with joints secured by large wooden pegs (larger versions of the mortise and tenon joints in furniture). It is commonplace in wooden buildings from the 19th century and earlier. The method comes from making things out of logs and tree trunks without modern high tech saws to cut lumber from the starting material stock. Using axes, adzes, and draw knives, hand-powered auger drill bits (brace and bit), and laborious woodworking, artisans or farmers could gradually assemble a building capable of bearing heavy weight without excessive use of interior space given over to vertical support posts. Since this building method has been used for thousands of years in many parts of the world, many styles of historic framing have developed.

Mandela was \\"comfortable\\" and in \\"a satisfactory condition\\" Saturday, said the South African president, who referred to the medical event only as \\"a planned procedure.\\" The 93-year-old likely will be discharged within the next two days, a Mandela relative told CNN. Considered the founding father of South Africa's democracy, Mandela became an international figure when he endured 27 years in prison for fighting racial segregation. He was freed in 1990, and three years later, he and then-South African President F.W. de Klerk won the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1994, Mandela was elected president, serving only one term as he had promised. On Saturday, President Jacob Zuma said Mandela was being treated for a \\"longstanding abdominal complaint.\\" The president referred to Mandela by his affectionate clan name Madiba. \\"Madiba is fine and fully conscious and the doctors are satisfied with his condition, which they say is consistent with his age,\\" Zuma said in a statement Saturday afternoon. \\"He was in good health before admission in hospital but doctors felt the complaint needed a thorough investigation. He underwent a diagnostic procedure as part of his ongoing medical management. We are happy that he is not in any danger and thank the doctors for their hard work and professionalism,\\" Zuma said. A government official assured the public that Mandela's hospital stay was not an emergency. \\"People need not panic. This was planned ... Mandela has had abdominal pains for sometime,\\" said Keith Khoza, a spokesman for the ruling African National Congress. Officials and family declined to name the hospital where the former president is undergoing treatment. Mandela last appeared in public in the closing ceremonies of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. He was hospitalized last year for treatment of an acute respiratory infection, and continued to receive treatment at home after doctors discharged him. Despite his rare appearances, Mandela retains his popularity and is considered a hero of democracy here. He spent 27 years in prison after being convicted of sabotage and attempts to overthrow the former apartheid regime. In a life fighting the racism of apartheid he went from being considered a terrorist to jailed freedom fighter to nation builder to elder statesman respected in the world's capitals. Clint Eastwood's 2009 film \\"Invictus,\\" starring Morgan Freeman as Mandela, dramatizes Mandela's nation-healing presidency in the 1990s. Mandela relocated to his childhood town of Qunu last year, but moved back to his Johannesburg home earlier this year. At the time, Zuma said the move was because the home in his boyhood town was undergoing maintenance. Members of the public can send messages to Mandela through President Zuma to president@po.gov.za, officials said. CNN's Nadia Bilchik, Faith Karimi and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.

Where do strings go on a guitar?","completion":"To analyze these questions, let me break them down and answer each part separately. Question 1a: What does 12-54, 12-60 mean in a guitar string? Question 1b: Are those numbers used for measuring the string's thickness? Answer 1a & 1b: 12-54 and 12-60 refer to the sets of guitar strings and their gauges (thicknesses). In these sets, the numbers indicate the thickness of the strings in thousandths of an inch. For instance, 12-54 means that the guitar string set includes strings ranging from 0.012 inches (the thinnest string) to 0.054 inches (the thickest string) in thickness. Similarly, 12-60 refers to a guitar string set with strings ranging from 0.012 inches to 0.060 inches in thickness. So, both the parts of Question 1 are related and focus on the meaning and purpose of the numbers representing guitar string thickness. Question 2: Where do strings go on a guitar? Answer 2: This question is entirely different and focuses on the placement of guitar strings on a guitar. The strings on a guitar are affixed from the guitar bridge (located on the guitar's body) to the tuning pegs (located on the headstock). They stretch over the soundhole (on an acoustic guitar) or pickups (on an electric guitar) and across the fretboard.

Summarize: Young guppies, also known as \\"fry\\", require special feeding separate from the adults, and should be separated for their safety as well.Prepare a 5 gallon (20 L) tank with care, making sure it has everything necessary for the guppies' survival. As with any aquarium, running a fishless cycle is an excellent way to prepare the tank before you introduce any fish. Purchase a breeding net or mesh from a fish store that divides the tank into two sections. The newly hatched guppies will be able to swim through the holes of the net and escape the mother fish, which may try to eat them. If you don't want to purchase a net or are not sure if the net you have has the right sized holes, you may protect the fry by planting several aquarium plants for them to hide in. Females have a dark spot on their abdomen, also called a gravid spot, which becomes much darker once her internal eggs have been fertilized. The eggs will grow inside her for 21–30 days, and her abdomen will become larger and darker as this happens. Transfer the female back to the main tank as soon as you notice she has given birth, so she does not compete with the fry for food or attempt to eat her young. If you are breeding guppies to sell or to produce specific traits, move the male and female you wish to breed into the tank before the female is pregnant. Return the male to the main tank once you notice the darker gravid spot. Note that female guppies can store sperm for months, so a fish you purchased as an adult may be fertilizing her eggs with a male not present in your tank for the first several litters. Guppy fry have tiny mouths and high protein requirements, so they must be fed separately from the adults. Have their special food ready to go before the fry are born, and include both protein sources and vegetable matter. High quality protein can be supplied in the form of baby brine shrimp (not adult), microworms, finely chopped beef heart, and/or a mash of egg yolk and water. Vegetable matter can be used in smaller quantities, and can take the form of infusoria (microscopic organisms that color pond water green), fresh and finely chopped dark green lettuce, or small pieces of boiled spinach. Do not to feed them adult brine shrimp until they have grown into juveniles; if the shrimp remains untouched it is too big for the fry to eat. Growing fry have greater energy needs than adult guppies as well as smaller stomachs, so feed them tiny amounts of food about 6 times daily. If the water grows dirty or cloudy despite frequent water changes, reduce the amount of food and make sure it is small enough for them to eat. Once your fry have been born, you may wish to change 10% or less of the water every couple days, instead of doing a larger and more stressful water change every week or two. Young fish are especially vulnerable to water changes, and the high frequency of feeding can cause waste to build up in the tank quickly. After about 2 months, the fry should be considerably larger and will only need to be fed 3–4 times a day. After about 4–5 months, they can be switched to an adult diet and fed 1–2 times a day. You may choose to alter the diet slowly to increase the odds of the fry accepting flakes, gradually replacing other parts of the diet with flake food. Different varieties and individuals will grow at different rates, however, and you should not move the fry into a tank with adult fish until they are close to the same size. You may be able to switch to larger food such as adult brine shrimp earlier if your guppies are growing at a good rate. Keep feeding the juveniles high quality food, however, and watch them to make sure they eat the new food.","completion":"In summary, to take care of young guppy fry, it's crucial to set up a separate 5-gallon tank, complete with a mesh divider, and a proper environment before introducing the fry. Guppy fry require isolation from adult fish to ensure their safety, as adult guppies may consume them. Monitor the female guppy's abdomen for a darker gravid spot indicating the presence of fertilized eggs, and return the male guppy to the main tank upon spotting this. Once the female has given birth, separate her from the fry as well. Feeding the guppy fry requires specialized high-protein diet in small portions, around 6 times a day. Baby brine shrimp, microworms, finely chopped beef heart, and a mixture of egg yolk and water serve as excellent protein sources. Smaller quantities of vegetable matter, like infusoria, finely chopped dark green lettuce, or boiled spinach, can also be included. Avoid feeding adult brine shrimp until the fry grow into juveniles. To maintain water quality, conduct frequent, small water changes, as young fry are highly vulnerable to fluctuating water conditions. As they grow into juveniles after two months, reduce feeding to 3–4 times a day. After 4–5 months, slowly-wean them off the special diet, introducing adult flakes, and alter feeding frequency to once or twice daily. Prioritize high-quality food even during the transition, and monitor the fry's consumption, ensuring that they adapt well to the new diet. Do not introduce the fry to adult fish until they reach a similar size, and adjust their diet accordingly. Remember that growth rates differ among individuals, so adjust the dietary needs according to each guppy's progress."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Однако процесс модернизации остановился, когда протекционистское давление со стороны Ланкашира и тяжелое финансовое положение империи заставили Британию отказаться от свободной торговли и политики невмешательства. В то же самое время вестернизация явилась одной из причин подъема национально-освободительного движения. Translate to English","completion":"However, the modernization process came to a halt when protectionist pressure from Lancashire and the dire financial situation of the empire forced Britain to abandon free trade and non-interventionist policy. At the same time, Westernization was one of the reasons for the rise of the national liberation movement. The process of modernization, which was initially fueled by the desire to adapt to the rapid advancements in technology and industry, faced significant challenges due to external and internal factors in the British Empire. The protectionist pressures from Lancashire, an industrial region in the northwest of England, played a key role in impeding the progress of modernization. Industries and manufacturers in Lancashire, which was known primarily for its cotton textiles, felt threatened by the increasing competition and advancements made by other parts of the empire and rival countries. Consequently, they advocated for protectionist policies to safeguard their interests and ensure their continued growth and relevance. Simultaneously, the British Empire faced increasing financial difficulties that were exacerbated by costly military campaigns and maintaining control over vast territories. These expenses strained the empire's resources and budget, leading to the abandonment of free trade and non-interventionist policies. Adopting protectionist measures was seen as a way to stabilize the economy, protect domestic industries, and generate further revenue through tariffs and trade regulations. During this same period, Westernization or the adoption of Western ideas, values, and practices had a significant impact on the rise of national liberation movements across various parts of the empire. People in these territories perceived Westernization as both a threat to traditional cultural identity and an opportunity to advance their social, economic, and political goals. The influence of Western ideas, such as democracy, individualism, and nationalism, inspired the local populations to strive for self-determination and resist colonial rule. In many instances, the heavy-handed policies of the British Empire led to resentment, resistance, and eventually, calls for independence. These national liberation movements were often driven by local elites and intelligentsia who embraced and adapted Western ideals to their societies and used them as a tool to rally support and challenge colonial rule. In response to these threats, the empire engaged in a series of negotiations, concessions, and sometimes violent repression in order to maintain control and quell dissent. In summary, the process of modernization in the British Empire faced significant challenges arising from protectionist pressures, financial difficulties, and the rise of national liberation movements. The abandonment of free trade and non-interventionist policies, coupled with the influence of Westernization, played critical roles in shaping the historical trajectory of the empire and its relationships with its various territories."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He was a mountain man (fur trapper), wilderness guide, Indian agent, and U.S. Army officer. Carson became a frontier legend in his own lifetime via biographies and news articles. Exaggerated versions of his exploits were the subject of dime novels. In August 1826, against his mother's wishes, Kit ran away from his apprenticeship. He went west with a caravan of fur trappers, tending their livestock. They made their trek over the Santa Fe Trail to Santa Fe, the capital of Santa Fe de Nuevo Mexico, reaching their destination in November 1826. Kit settled in Taos. Carson lived with Mathew Kinkead, a trapper and explorer who had served with Carson's older brothers during the War of 1812. Carson was mentored by Kinkead in learning the skills of a trapper, while learning the necessary languages for trade. Eventually he became fluent in Spanish and several Indian languages. Workman put an advertisement in a local newspaper back in Missouri. He wrote that he would give a one cent reward to anyone who brought the boy back to Franklin. No one claimed the reward. It was a bit of a joke, but Carson was free. The advertisement featured the first printed description of Carson: \\"Christopher Carson, a boy about 16 years old, small of his age, but thick set; light hair, ran away from the subscriber, living in Franklin, Howard county, Missouri, to whom he had been bound to learn the saddler's trade.\\" Between 1827 and 1829, Carson worked as cook, translator, and wagon driver in the southwest. He also worked at a copper mine near the Gila River in southwestern New Mexico. In later life, Carson never mentioned any women from his youth. There are only three specific women mentioned in his writing: Josefa Jaramillo, his third and last wife; a comrade's mother in Washington, DC; and Mrs. Ann White, a victim of Indian atrocities.

There's a relatively simple formula to help you determine where your fat-burning zone falls. It's not 100% accurate, but will give you a relatively reliable range to aim for.","completion":"First, you need to figure out your maximum heart rate (MHR), which is the highest number of beats per minute (BPM) your heart is capable of achieving during exercise. To calculate this, simply subtract your age from 220 (MHR = 220 - age). For instance, if you're 30 years old, your estimated MHR would be 190 BPM (220 - 30 = 190). Now that you know your MHR, you can determine your fat-burning zone, which is typically between 60% and 70% of your MHR. To find the lower end of your fat-burning zone, multiply your MHR by 0.6 (lower fat-burning threshold = MHR x 0.6). For example, if your MHR is 190 BPM, your lower fat burning threshold would be 114 BPM (190 x 0.6 = 114). Next, to find the upper end of your fat-burning zone, multiply your MHR by 0.7 (upper fat-burning threshold = MHR x 0.7). In our example, with an MHR of 190 BPM, your upper fat-burning threshold would be 133 BPM (190 x 0.7 = 133). It's important to note that these calculations are approximate and may not be precise for everyone. Factors such as fitness level, genetics, and individual heart rate variability can all influence your unique fat-burning zone. To get the most accurate results, consider using a heart rate monitor during exercise, which will help you maintain your heart rate within your fat-burning range. You can also use perceived exertion to estimate your fat-burning zone, which entails rating your level of exertion on a scale from 1 (very easy) to 10 (maximum effort). Staying within the fat-burning zone generally corresponds to reaching about a 4 or 5 on this perceived exertion scale. Once you successfully identify your fat-burning zone, plan workouts that keep your heart rate within this range for an extended period. Focus on activities you enjoy, such as walking, jogging, cycling, or swimming, which are effective ways to burn fat at a moderate intensity. Keep in mind that while exercising within your fat-burning zone can help optimize fat loss, incorporating high-intensity exercise and strength training into your routine can further enhance your results. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) and resistance training not only burn calories during the workout but also increase your metabolism and promote muscle growth, both of which contribute to a greater total calorie expenditure throughout the day. In conclusion, determining your fat-burning zone by calculating your MHR and using the 60% to 70% range as a guideline can help you optimize fat loss during your workouts. Additionally, utilizing a heart rate monitor and incorporating a variety of exercise modalities, including high-intensity and resistance training, will further enhance your fat loss efforts and overall fitness level."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I don't know why I thought it was a holiday movie though, because it really was a nursery rhyme romp. However considering when this movie was made, and the budget they likely used, it's almost amazing they did such a good job. I forgot the point, but the two foolish large men saved the day, won the girl (for the good guy) and all was well. It probably looks like the film quality of other things from that era, it's not particularly cleaned up but certainly it's tolerable cinematic viewing. It might be a nice introduction to youngsters to Laurel and Hardy, and they'll certainly get a kick out of the nursery rhyme parts.

Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","completion":"This review depicts the product in a generally flattering light. The reviewer starts by explaining how they came across the movie and acknowledges its probable low budget and older production date.

With each of these drawings, there would be a limited number of winners and a much larger number of losers, as the lottery system is designed to generate revenue through ticket sales while distributing a portion of those funds as prizes to a smaller group of winners. Furthermore, the paragraph states that the New York Lottery is part of the New York State Gaming Commission and provides revenue for public education. This implies that the lottery generates revenue, which can only happen if there are more losers than winners because the majority of the funds generated by ticket sales are allocated to public education. In conclusion, based on the established nature of lotteries and the information provided about the New York Lottery's history and purpose, it is safe to say that the statement \\"The New York Lottery has had losers\\" is true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? How can I store unused cables that I need to keep?","completion":"Organizing and storing unused cables that you need to keep can be a task requiring a bit of structuring and management. However, by following a step-by-step approach and engaging in regular maintenance, you can keep that cord chaos under control. Below is a comprehensive guide to help you achieve this goal. 1. **Gather Your Materials**: In order to organize your cables efficiently, you'll need: - Assorted cable ties or Velcro strips - Label maker or masking tape and a permanent marker for labeling - Cable management box, desk cable organizer or simple box/basket - Articulate or bunjee cord to suspend and manage cables - Old toilet paper or paper towel rolls (optional) 2. **Identify and Sort**: Begin by unplugging and unraveling all your loose cables. Identify and sort them by cable type – charging cables, audio-video cables, ethernet cables, etc. 3. **Inspect**: Check each cable for damage. If a cable is frayed, broken or no longer works, dispose of it. You only want to keep cables that are in good working order. 4. **Label**: Using a label maker or simply tape and a marker, mark each cable with its corresponding device. This way, you won’t have to guess which cable belongs to which device in the future. 5. **Secure and Bundle**: Using cable ties or Velcro strips (which are preferred as they are reusable), loosely band together cables that belong to the same device or are of the same kind. Make sure not to fasten the tie too tight as it can damage the cable. 6. **Storage**: For larger cables or cables used less frequently, roll them up neatly and store them in a box or basket where they are out of sight but easily accessible. For smaller more commonly used cables, empty toilet paper or paper towel rolls serve as a great DIY solution. Simply wrap up the cable and slip it inside the roll. The rolls prevent cords from tangling and make them easy to view and access in a box. 7. **Use a Cable Management Box or Desk Organizer**: For the cables of the devices that remain on your desk, a cable management box or a desk cable management tray can help. These keep loose cables off the floor and prevent them from tangling around each other. 8. **Distance Ongoing and Unused Cables**: It's useful to keep your unused cables separate from your daily driver cables which go to your computer, TV, etc. Otherwise, you might wind up needing to pull out the whole box, end up with a tangled mess, and be forced to start from square one. 9. **Regular Maintenance**: Every few months, take some time to go through your cables, eliminating any that you don't use and untangling or reorganizing any that have become jumbled. By following these steps, your cables will not only be more organized, they'll also be easier to access and less likely to become damaged. Always remember the key to cable management is regular maintenance and a system that works for your personal needs.

In turn, according to Kozinski's analysis, the contemporary rule of binding precedent became possible in the U.S. in the nineteenth century only after the creation of a clear court hierarchy (under the Judiciary Acts), and the beginning of regular verbatim publication of U.S. appellate decisions by West Publishing. The rule gradually developed, case-by-case, as an extension of the judiciary's public policy of effective judicial administration (that is, in order to efficiently exercise the judicial power). The rule of precedent is generally justified today as a matter of public policy, first, as a matter of fundamental fairness, and second, because in the absence of case law, it would be completely unworkable for every minor issue in every legal case to be briefed, argued, and decided from first principles (such as relevant statutes, constitutional provisions, and underlying public policies), which in turn would create hopeless inefficiency, instability, and unpredictability, and thereby undermine the rule of law. What made binding precedent a possibility?","completion":"Binding precedent became a possibility in the U.S. in the nineteenth century due to two main factors: 1. The creation of a clear court hierarchy under the Judiciary Acts: This provided a structure for the courts, establishing which courts have authority over others and ensuring that lower courts follow the decisions made by higher courts. 2. The beginning of regular verbatim publication of U.S. appellate decisions by West Publishing: This made the court decisions easily accessible, allowing judges and lawyers to reference past decisions more easily and consistently, enabling them to establish a common understanding of the law. These factors, in combination with the judiciary's public policy of effective judicial administration, enabled the gradual development of the rule of binding precedent, case-by-case."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Musial was born in Donora, Pennsylvania, the fifth of the six children (four girls and two boys) of Lukasz and Mary (Lancos) Musial (, MOO-show). His mother was of Carpatho-Rusyn descent and his father was a Polish immigrant who chose the name Stanislaw Franciszek for his first son, though his father always referred to Musial using the Polish nickname Stasiu, pronounced \\"Stashu\\". Musial frequently played baseball with his brother Ed and other friends during his childhood, and considered Lefty Grove his favorite ballplayer. Musial also had the benefit of learning about baseball from his neighbor Joe Barbao, a former minor league pitcher. Context: Musial's rookie year with Williamson in 1938 was a period of adjustment both on and off the field. He began gaining more in-depth knowledge about baseball strategy while posting a 6-6 win-loss record and a 4.66 earned run average (ERA), to go along with a .258 batting average. Off the field, he experienced feelings of homesickness while learning to live comfortably and independently on his 65-per-month salary. Musial finished his high school education before returning to Williamson in spring 1939. That season his numbers improved to a 9-2 record, a 4.30 ERA, and a .352 batting average. Musial spent the 1940 season with the Cardinals' other Class D team, the Daytona Beach Islanders, where he developed a lifelong friendship with manager Dickie Kerr. His pitching skills improved under the guidance of Kerr, who also recognized his hitting talent, playing him in the outfield between pitching starts. On May 25, 1940, Musial married fellow Donora resident, Lillian \\"Lil\\" Labash, in Daytona Beach, and the couple's first child followed in August. During late August, Musial suffered a shoulder injury while playing in the outfield, and later made an early exit as the starting pitcher in a 12-5 playoff game loss. For a while Musial considered leaving baseball entirely, complaining that he could not afford to support himself and his wife on the 16 a week pay. Kerr talked him out of it, and even took the Musials into his own home to relieve the financial burden. To repay the debt Musial bought Kerr a 20,000 home in Houston in 1958. In 113 games in 1940 he hit .311, while compiling an 18-5 pitching record that included 176 strikeouts and 145 walks. Musial was assigned to the Class AA Columbus Red Birds to begin 1941, though manager, Burt Shotton, and Musial himself quickly realized that the previous year's injury had considerably weakened his arm. He was reassigned to the Class C Springfield Cardinals as a full-time outfielder, and he later credited manager Ollie Vanek for displaying confidence in his hitting ability. During 87 games with Springfield, Musial hit a league-leading .379 before being promoted to the Rochester Red Wings of the International League. He was noted for his unique batting stance, a crouch in which his back was seemingly square to the pitcher. This stance was later described by pitcher Ted Lyons as \\"a kid peeking around the corner to see if the cops were coming\\". According to a 1950 description by author Tom Meany, \\"The bent knees and the crouch give him the appearance of a coiled spring, although most pitchers think of him as a coiled rattlesnake.\\" Musial continued to play well in Rochester--in one three-game stretch, he had 11 hits. He was called up to the Cardinals for the last two weeks of the 1941 season. Question: what other intresting tthing is the artice Answer:","completion":"In the article, we learn about Stan Musial's life and his journey to becoming a professional baseball player. Some interesting things include: 1. Musial's family background: His mother had Carpatho-Rusyn descent and his father was a Polish immigrant. They had six children, with Stan being the fifth one. 2. Childhood interest in baseball: Stan often played baseball with his brother and friends during his childhood, looking up to his favorite player, Lefty Grove. 3. Early struggles in his career: Musial faced challenges during his rookie year, like adjusting to his life away from home and learning baseball strategy. 4. Friendship with manager Dickie Kerr: While playing for the Daytona Beach Islanders, Musial formed a strong bond with his manager, who later helped him during challenging times. 5. Marriage and family life: Musial married Lillian \\"Lil\\" Labash, who he knew from his childhood, and they had their first child together in 1940. 6. Overcoming a shoulder injury: In 1940, Musial experienced a significant shoulder injury that almost led him to quit baseball.

Rest easy, your computer is more likely to be damaged by a virus picked up from the Internet than by being turned off and on too much. They are also energyefficient: such efficiency has reached the point where most computers place themselves in sleep mode if they remain idle for a certain period of time. So your computer will likely slip into sleep mode anyway, even if you leave it on overnight. Sleep mode itself, once a pretty unreliable option--you never knew if you would be able to wake your computer without having to reboot it--has been vastly improved with newer operating systems. If you want your computer to consume as little energy as possible when not in use, shut it down. If you want it to consume zero energy, you're going to have to unplug (......) it. Your computer can be in only three states: on, sleep or off--each of which draws some level of electric current. A computer that is \\"on\\" will either be actively processing information or sitting idle, depending on whether the user is typing a document, reading an email or has stepped away briefly. The amount of wattage drawn when the computer is on varies greatly depending on whether it is a laptop or a desktop computer. The latter uses more energy because desktop power supplies are less efficient and require a separate and often larger, powerhungry monitor. It also varies based on the type of work being done: complex calculations requiring intensive processing are more powerhungry, whereas writing or Web browsing consumes far less electricity.

What most naturally follows? One person in particular comes down the slope holding a child in front of them before finally letting them go. the young child","completion":"begins to glide independently on their skis, gaining confidence in their ability to balance and control their movements. A sense of joy and excitement emanates from the young child as they continue to ski down the slope, their eyes wide with wonder and a beaming smile plastered across their face. The parent, watching intently from behind, feels a mix of pride for their child's accomplishment and slight apprehension for their safety. As the young child continues to ski, they grow more comfortable and skillful with each passing moment. They start experimenting with different ski techniques, learning to transition from a snowplough (also known as a wedge) to parallel skiing. Little by little, as they gain more confidence, they begin to take on steeper and more challenging slopes. Meanwhile, the parent skis close behind, providing both guidance and encouragement to the child. Laughs and cheers of support echo across the snow-covered mountainside as the pair make their way down the slopes together. Other skiers and snowboarders passing by can't help but smile as they witness this heartwarming scene between parent and child. During their breaks, the parent takes time to explain essential skiing tips and techniques to the child, ensuring their understanding of safety precautions and how to control their descent on the slopes. The young child listens intently, occasionally interrupting with questions that display their eagerness to learn and improve. As the day progresses, the bond between parent and child becomes palpable, strengthened by their shared passion for skiing and newfound trust in one another's abilities. Together, they explore different parts of the ski resort, navigating through powdery snow-covered paths and weaving in and out of tree-lined trails. They create lasting memories to cherish, immortalized in photos and short video clips captured during their adventure. By the end of the day, the young child can undoubtedly call themselves a skier. Exhausted but fulfilled, both parent and child return to the ski lodge with stories of triumphs and minor mishaps to share with family and friends. As they recount their adventures, it becomes clear that the most significant victory of all is the time spent together and the bond that has formed between them. In the years that follow, the parent and child continue their skiing journey, exploring new destinations and challenging slopes. Skiing transforms from a casual pastime into a passion that both individuals share, creating a unique connection that transcends their day-to-day lives. From this initial experience on the slopes, the child learns valuable life lessons in perseverance, resilience, and the importance of overcoming challenges. As they mature and grow older, these qualities, forged during those early days skiing with their parent, will undoubtedly shape them into a more well-rounded and accomplished person. In this rather wholesome, moving scene, the act of skiing becomes not just a recreational activity, but a special bond between parent and child. This experience serves as a meaningful reminder of the invaluable power of shared interests and the lasting impact they can have on one's life and relationships."},{"prompt":"A friend asked me to answer this question: Who is the writer that was healed by a tohunga?, using the article: White Lies is a story about the nature of identity: those who deny it and those who strive to protect it.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose mother died early in his life? James Barton Longacre was born on a farm in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, on August 11, 1794. His mother Sarah (Barton) Longacre died early in his life; his father, Peter Longacre, was the descendant of early Swedish settlers of North America. When Peter Longacre remarried, his son found the home life intolerable, and James Longacre left home at the age of 12, seeking work in the nearby city of Philadelphia. He apprenticed himself at a bookstore; the owner, John E. Watson, took the boy into his family. Over the following years, Longacre worked in the bookstore, but Watson realized that the boy's skill was in portraiture. Watson granted Longacre a release from his apprenticeship in 1813 so that he could follow an artistic muse, but the two remained close, and Watson would often sell Longacre's works.Longacre became apprenticed to George Murray, principal in the engraving firm Murray, Draper, Fairman & Co. at 47 Sansom Street in Philadelphia. This business derived from the firm established by the Philadelphia Mint's first chief engraver, Robert Scot. Longacre remained at the Murray firm until 1819; his major work there was portraits of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and John Hancock which were placed on a facsimile of the Declaration of Independence by publisher John Binns; the work cost Binns a total of 9,000 (equal to 147,307 today). Also employed at the Murray firm from 1816 was the man who would be Longacre's predecessor as chief engraver, Christian Gobrecht. Longacre's work at the company gave him a good reputation as an engraver skilled in rendering other artists' paintings as a printed engraving, and in 1819, he set up his own business at 230 Pine Street in Philadelphia.Longacre's first important commission were plates for S.F. Bradford's Encyclopedia in 1820; an engraving of General Andrew Jackson by Longacre based on a portrait by Thomas Sully achieved wide sales.

I am one disappointed buffet-loving foodie. :-| We finally had a chance to try out Bacchanal while we were in Vegas for the Olympia this year. We had a group of 6 for dinner here about 90 min before they were closing. Let me just cut to the chase on why I don't ever plan on Bacchanal-ing again: 1. The wait for this place is somewhat confusing. You walk up to this lady that gives you a ticket and she tells you, \\"15 min for your group.\\" So we're thinking, \\"Wow! Only 15 min to get seated? Awesome!\\" WRONG-O! It's about 15 min to get in a line to then pay and get in the longer line to get seated. Boo! Don't tease us like that lady! 2. They seated us wayyyyy in the back, like literally having to trek it out to even get to the food. There were plenty of tables closer to the buffet area that needed to be cleaned off. Seemed like they were understaffed. 3. Food. Blah! Yep, I said it. Everything seemed too salty and not much effort put into cooking it. Only thing I really enjoyed were the snow crab legs and their sweet potato tater tots (which were probably frozen to begin with). 4. Pricey. Yes, it's a Vegas buffet, I know. But the quality of the food is not up to par to have it priced \\"Vegas style\\". Here's one plus that actually solidifies why my review is staying the way it is: Our waiter was hilarious. He had jokes up the culo. We also were really upfront with him and told him the food wasn't all that. So..he also let us in on a little tidbit. Apparently, the old food court at Caesar's that closed down had chefs over there that held seniority. So those crappy food court chefs quite possibly booted out the stellar chefs that first started out here at Bacchanal and that is why the food is crapola today.

Simplify the equation by combining like terms: -350 + 375 = 25 So, the equation becomes: 0 = 5*p + 25 3. To isolate the p term, subtract 25 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 25 = 5*p + 25 - 25 This simplifies to: -25 = 5*p 4. Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 5 to solve for p: -25 / 5 = 5*p / 5 This gives us: p = -5 So the solution to the equation 0 = 5*p - 350 + 375 is p = -5."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"The bombing failed to demoralise the British into surrender or significantly damage the war economy.

Information: - Shanghai Baby is a semi-autobiographical novel written by Chinese author Wei Hui. It was originally published in China in 1999. The English translation was published in 2001. - Early life and teen years. Born only three years after the founding of the People's Republic of China, as the son of a school teacher, Jia Yanchun (), Jia had an early role model for his later decision to become a writer. Due to a shortage of qualified teachers in Shaanxi at the time, however, Jia's father was often away from home and so he spent much of his early childhood with his mother, Zhou Xiao'e (). With the advent of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, Jia Yanchun was accused of being a counter-revolutionary and he spent the next ten years in a labor camp. Three years later, with the closing of all schools in China following the excesses of the Red Guards, Jia was dispatched with his classmates to build reservoirs in the countryside. - Chinese culture is one of the world's oldest cultures, tracing back to thousands of years ago. The area in which the culture is dominant covers a large geographical region in eastern Asia with customs and traditions varying greatly between provinces, cities, and even towns as well. Important components of Chinese culture include ceramics, architecture, music, literature, martial arts, cuisine, visual arts, philosophy and religion. - Mian Mian (born August 28, 1970 in Shanghai) is a Chinese Post 70s Generation writer. She writes on China's once-taboo topics and she is a promoter of Shanghai's local music. Her publications have earned her the reputation as China's literary wild child. - Zhou Weihui (born Ningbo, 1973) is a Chinese Post 70s Generation writer, living and working in Shanghai and New York City. Her novel \\"Shanghai Baby\\" () (1999) was banned in the People's Republic of China as \\"decadent\\". Her latest novel \\"Marrying Buddha\\" () (2005) was censored, modified and published in China under a modified title. She is often associated with Mian Mian, another slightly older member of the \\"New Generation\\". - The Cultural Revolution, formally the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, was a sociopolitical movement that took place in China from 1966 until 1976. Set into motion by Mao Zedong, then Chairman of the Communist Party of China, its stated goal was to preserve 'true' Communist ideology in the country by purging remnants of capitalist and traditional elements from Chinese society, and to re-impose Maoist thought as the dominant ideology within the Party. The Revolution marked the return of Mao Zedong to a position of power after the Great Leap Forward. The movement paralyzed China politically and negatively affected the country's economy and society to a significant degree. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - Shaanxi, formerly romanized as Shensi, is a province of the People's Republic of China.

Pause as app does fancy graphics. Cut to car interior. Shot of dash, showing Ford logo on steering wheel. It’s bright blue - are they not normally grey or more subtle?

Objective: To describe the clinical, laboratorial, and radiological characteristics of adenovirus pneumonia and detect the type and diversity of human adenoviruses that caused acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in Beijing. Study design: An etiological study of adult community-acquired pneumonia was carried out prospectively at Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital. A total of 18 cases with laboratory-confirmed adenovirus infections in 487 cases with CAP were observed clinically. The viral type and phylogenetic analysis were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: Patients with adenovirus pneumonia typically reported flu-like symptoms.

He is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), whose husband, Walter, is the chairman of the English department and thus Grady's boss. Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending - the book runs to over two and a half thousand pages and is still far from finished. He spends his free time smoking marijuana.His students include James Leer (Tobey Maguire) and Hannah Green (Katie Holmes). Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers. Hannah, who rents a room in Tripp's large house, is attracted to Tripp, but he does not reciprocate. James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing fiction more than he first lets on.During a party at the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is pregnant with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when he finds it attacking Grady. James also steals a very valuable piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal.

On one hand, the reviewer acknowledges the positive aspects of the product by stating that it is good, suggesting that the user might have found certain features and functionalities to be helpful and efficient. This indicates that there are certain aspects of the product that the reviewer enjoys and appreciates, conveying a sense of positive sentiment. However, the reviewer also highlights a few issues they have encountered, particularly regarding issues with connectivity, and specifically compares it to a wired mouse, stating that it is not as good in that regard. This suggests that the reviewer has experienced some frustration with the product's performance, as they feel it is lacking when compared to other, more reliable options. This is a clear indication of negative sentiment. Additionally, the use of the phrase \\"it works okay\\" implies that the product does function, but may not live up to the user's expectations. The term \\"okay\\" is generally considered less than ideal - it lies somewhere between satisfactory and unsatisfactory. This further underscores the mixed sentiment in the review, as it does not explicitly state that the product is either good or bad, but rather that it falls somewhere in between. In conclusion, the product review for the Microsoft Wireless Notebook Presenter Mouse 8000 conveys both positive and negative sentiment. The reviewer found some aspects of the product to be good, but also outlined issues with connectivity, ultimately settling on the idea that the product functions \\"okay.\\" This suggests that, while the product may not have entirely met the user's expectations, they do not wholly disregard it as a subpar option.

Title: Orca Movie plot: Captain Nolan (Richard Harris) is an Irish Canadian who catches marine animals to pay off the mortgage of his boat, and returns to Ireland. Nolan's crew is looking for a great white shark for a local aquarium, but a scientist named Ken (Robert Carradine) is targeted by the shark. An orca comes and kills the shark, saving Ken. This switches Nolan's target to the orca. While Nolan is on the journey with his crew, he tries to capture what he believes to be a bull orca, but mistakenly harpoons a pregnant female. Nolan and his crew get the orca on board, where she subsequently miscarries. The captain hoses the dead fetus overboard as the male orca looks on screaming. Seeking release of his near-dead mate, the male orca tries to sink the ship. One of Nolan's crew members, Novak (Keenan Wynn), cuts the female off the ship, but the male leaps up and drags him into the sea, too. The following day, the orca pushes his now dead mate onto shore. Alan Swain (Scott Walker) berates Nolan on his actions after finding the dead whale. Nolan denies responsibility, but Swain and the villagers eventually find out his involvement. The villagers insist that he kill the orca, as his presence is causing the fish vital to the village's economy to migrate. The orca then terrorises the village by sinking fishing boats in broad daylight and then breaking fuel lines, thus destroying the village's fuel reserves. Dr. Rachel Bedford (Charlotte Rampling), a colleague of Ken and a whale expert, shows him how similar whales are to humans and tells Nolan that, \\"If he [the orca] is like a human, what he wants isn't necessarily what he should have.\\" Nolan confesses to Bedford that he empathises with the whale, as his own wife and unborn child had previously been killed in a car crash caused by a drunk driver. Nolan promises Bedford not to fight the whale, but the orca attacks his sea-front house, containing an injured crew member of Nolan's, Annie (Bo Derek) within it.

Translate to English English:","completion":"Fine dust and diesel exhaust fumes are also known for their effects on the human respiratory system. Fine particles and diesel exhaust fumes are small particles of air pollution that can come from various sources including cars, trucks, buses, and certain industrial processes. They are extremely tiny, often less than one-seventh the width of a human hair, which makes them easy to inhale and cause harm to human health. When inhaled, these particles can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream. This can lead to serious health problems, particularly in relation to the respiratory system. The most common problems associated with inhaling fine particles and diesel exhaust fumes include aggravated asthma, decreased lung function, and development or worsening of chronic bronchitis. Some studies have also linked exposure to these fine particles with premature death in people with heart or lung disease. Diesel exhaust, in particular, contains more than 40 toxic air contaminants, including many known or suspected cancer-causing substances, such as benzene, arsenic, and formaldehyde. These particles can become lodged in the lungs, where they can cause damage over time. Furthermore, repeated exposure to fine dust and diesel exhaust can lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a long-term illness that makes it harder to breathe over time. It's also worth noting that diesel exhaust fumes can contribute to ground-level ozone, a key component of smog, and climate change. It's also important to point out that the effects of this pollution aren't limited to just physical health. There's growing evidence to suggest that fine particle pollution can also impact mental health, leading to increased rates of depression, anxiety, and other mental health disorders. Therefore, the impact of fine dust and diesel exhaust fumes on human health, particularly the respiratory system, is significant and multifaceted. It is important to continue researching and monitoring these effects, as well as implementing policies and practices to reduce air pollution levels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: If you could travel back in time and ask Napoleon what he remembered as a good year, how might he respond? Context: Hoping to extend the Continental System, Napoleon invaded Iberia and declared his brother Joseph the King of Spain in 1808. The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted with British support. The Peninsular War lasted six years, noted for its brutal guerrilla warfare, and culminated in an Allied victory. Fighting also erupted in Central Europe, as the Austrians launched another attack against the French in 1809. Napoleon defeated them at the Battle of Wagram, dissolving the Fifth Coalition formed against France. By 1811, Napoleon ruled over 70 million people across an empire that had domination in Europe, which had not witnessed this level of political consolidation since the days of the Roman Empire. He maintained his strategic status through a series of alliances and family appointments. He created a new aristocracy in France while allowing the return of nobles who had been forced into exile by the Revolution.

A NASA satellite called QuikSCAT has discovered highways of wind over the Earth's oceans.Scientists believe these invisible roads may explain why many nonflowering plants,such as mosses and lichens ,grow where they do. The satellite is able to send microwaves from space to the surface of the ocean.The pattern of signals that come back shows which way the winds are blowing. Using this _ , the scientists studied a group of islands in the southern hemisphere ,near Antarctica.Winds tend to blow anticlockwise in this region,but there are lots of local differences. When the researchers compared these local patterns to botanical data,they found that the wind had an important effect on where species of mosses,lichens,and other nonflowering plants grow. For example,Bouvet Island and Heard Island,share 30 percent of their moss species,29 percent of liverworts ,and 32 percent of lichens-even though they are 4,430 kilometers apart.In contrast,Gough Island and Bouvet Island,separated by just 1,860 kilometers of sea,share only 16 percent of mosses and 17 percent of liverworts.They have no lichens in common.

How could being someones taxi for the day while they run errands be good for the world? - gain - supplies - helpful - help people - add to The best answer is The answer to this question is:","completion":"Being someone's taxi for the day while they run errands can be good for the world in several ways. It not only provides essential support and assistance to the individual, but also benefits the environment and the community at large. Here are some of the key advantages: 1. Environmental benefits - By offering to chauffeur someone around, you are essentially carpooling, which reduces the number of vehicles on the road. This decreases the amount of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, contributing to a cleaner environment. Furthermore, less traffic congestion improves overall air quality and reduces fuel consumption, promoting sustainability. 2. Supporting local businesses - By assisting someone with their errands, you are indirectly supporting local businesses and contributing to the local economy. As the person completes their tasks, they are likely engaging with shops, service providers, and other establishments, generating economic activity and employment opportunities in the community. 3. Building connections - Helping someone with their daily tasks strengthens your relationship with that person and fosters a sense of community and bonding. This increased social interaction can lead to a more cohesive and supportive environment, making the world a better and more empathetic place. 4. Alleviating stress - Running errands can be time-consuming, and it's not uncommon for individuals to feel overwhelmed. By acting as their personal taxi for the day, you are easing the burden on that person, allowing them to complete their tasks more efficiently and reducing stress induced by a hectic schedule. With a more positive mental state, they might be more inclined to engage with others and contribute to the betterment of the world. 5. Promoting mobility and accessibility - Offering a taxi service to someone, especially if they are elderly, disabled, or otherwise unable to drive themselves, enables them to access essential services and maintain an independent lifestyle. Facilitating this level of mobility and accessibility promotes inclusivity and ensures they can participate in daily activities and enjoy a better quality of life. In conclusion, being someone's taxi while they run errands can indeed make a positive impact on the world. From environmental and economic benefits to fostering stronger relationships and promoting accessibility, this small act of kindness has the potential to create a domino effect of positivity and goodwill, ultimately contributing to a better world for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another. Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines that it provides. You solve the task and show how you used the guidelines to solve the task. Detailed Instructions: In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"Okay, little buddy! These are two different questions asking about separate things. Let me explain: 1. The first question is about a font called Monaco, made by Apple. It's a style for letters, numbers, and symbols on the computer. The question asks if it's possible to use this font on a Windows computer. Sadly, because it's an Apple font, it's not available for Windows by default. But don't worry, there are other similar fonts that can be used on Windows! 2. The second question is about a specific version of the Windows operating system called \\"Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005\\". It's a program that runs the computer, and this version has special features for watching TV, movies, and other media. The question asks how to download this specific version. However, because it's an old version, finding a download might be difficult- like finding a toy from a long time ago. Usually, it's better to use a newer version that will work better and have more goodies! So, these two questions are asking about different things: one is about a font, and the other is about a version of the Windows operating system.

Welcome to Ghana: Exotic wildlife, historic castles and a golden coast Ghana, the jewel of West Africa Ghana, the jewel of West Africa Ghana: the jewel of West Africa Ghana: the jewel of West Africa Ghana: the jewel of West Africa Ghana: the jewel of West Africa Ghana: the jewel of West Africa (CNN) -- Upon arrival at Kotoka International airport in Ghana's capital city Accra, you are immediately greeted by a sign that says \\"Akwaaba,\\" which means \\"Welcome\\" -- and this is exactly how you will feel when visiting this beautiful West African country. A success story of African development, democracy and stability, Ghana is a nation made up of people that are as warm as its climate. Rich in history, culture and natural beauty, it's the perfect introduction to Africa if you are a first-time traveler to the continent, or a great alternative for those who have exhausted the Safari circuit, and crave a different African experience. There is something for everyone in Ghana, ranging from nature trails and UNESCO World Heritage sites to bustling markets, tranquil beaches and vibrant nightlife. There are 15 national parks and reserves across the country. A must see is Kakum National Park, in the central region. The area is covered with stunning tropical rainforest and rare animals, and a long series of hanging bridges known as the Canopy Walkway. Not for the faint hearted, the walkway is located at the forest canopy level, and is secured by a series of nets and wires for safety. The walkway provides tourists with a spectacular vantage point of the beautiful surroundings. Another great place to visit is Ghana's largest wildlife refuge, Mole National Park. The park is located in northwest Ghana, and the park's entrance is reached through the nearby town of Larabanga. It is home to over 93 mammal species, with large mammals including elephants, hippos, buffalo, and warthogs. The park is considered a primary African preserve for numerous antelope species; olive baboons, black-and-white colobus monkeys and the green vervet are among the monkey species resident there. Slender-snouted and dwarf crocodiles are among the 33 known species of reptiles that call this breathtaking park home.

Built by the Portuguese in 1482, Elmina Castle is the oldest remaining slave castle in Africa. It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it has become a pilgrimage site, drawing thousands of visitors from around the world -- in particular African-Americans and Caribbean people seeking to connect with their heritage. The town of Elmina surrounding the castle is a vibrant, robust fishing community with an incredible amount of energy and color. If you don't want to venture far from the capital, there is a lot to do right in Accra. For beach bums, Labadi beach is perfect for soaking up the African sun, and being entertained while you do it. Drumming, cultural dancing and music can all be seen and heard on holidays and during the weekend. Tourists can also visit local cultural attractions such as Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Park, W.E.B Dubois Center or head to the Arts Center, where a multitude of stalls sell crafts from all around the country. After a day of relaxing at the beach or visiting the cultural sites, visitors can head to the upscale area of Osu, in central Accra, to sample the nightlife. Locally referred to as the \\"West End,\\" Osu boasts an impressive number of local and international restaurants offering a range of cuisines. There are also several options for club hoppers and lounge goers. One of the latest additions to nightlife in Accra is Republic Bar and Grill. With indoor and outdoor seating the bar has a retro vibe, and celebrates Ghanaian food, music, culture and art. Republic has a wonderful list of drinks, ranging from cold local beers, to exotic cocktails and herbal teas made with fresh ingredients. The bar also serves a wonderful menu of finger foods including fried yam/cassava, kelewele (fried plantain seasoned with delicious spices) and chicken wings seasoned with local spices.

According to Wright's autobiography, his mother declared when she was expecting that her first child would grow up to build beautiful buildings. She decorated his nursery with engravings of English cathedrals torn from a periodical to encourage the infant's ambition. In 1870 the family moved to Weymouth, Massachusetts, where William ministered to a small congregation. In 1876, Anna visited the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia where she saw an exhibit of educational blocks created by Friedrich Wilhelm August Frobel. The blocks, known as Froebel Gifts, were the foundation of his innovative kindergarten curriculum. Anna, a trained teacher, was excited by the program and bought a set with which young Wright spent much time playing. The blocks in the set were geometrically shaped and could be assembled in various combinations to form three-dimensional compositions. In his autobiography, Wright described the influence of these exercises on his approach to design: \\"For several years I sat at the little Kindergarten table-top... and played... with the cube, the sphere and the triangle--these smooth wooden maple blocks... All are in my fingers to this day... \\" Many of Wright's buildings are notable for their geometrical clarity. The Wright family struggled financially in Weymouth and returned to Spring Green, Wisconsin, where the supportive Lloyd Jones clan could help William find employment. They settled in Madison, where William taught music lessons and served as the secretary to the newly formed Unitarian society. Although William was a distant parent, he shared his love of music, especially the works of Johann Sebastian Bach, with his children. Soon after Wright turned 14, his parents separated. Anna had been unhappy for some time with William's inability to provide for his family and asked him to leave. The divorce was finalized in 1885 after William sued Anna for lack of physical affection. William left Wisconsin after the divorce and Wright claimed he never saw his father again.

A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose Hand wash all glassware happens, how will it affect waste time and fuel heating the water. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if the user decides to hand wash all glassware, it may affect the time spent on dishwashing and fuel consumption for heating the water. To analyze the impact of this alteration, let's consider the action step by step and compare the original process with the perturbed one. Original Process: 1. Open the dishwasher 2. Slide out the bottom rack 3. Take a dirty plate 4. Rinse the plate 5. Place the dish in the rack 6. Repeat steps 3-5, leaving enough space for water to reach all items 7. Fill the soap cup 8. Turn on the dishwasher Perturbed Process (with hand washing of glassware): 1. Hand wash all glassware 2. Open the dishwasher 3. Slide out the bottom rack 4. Take a dirty non-glass item (e.g., plate) 5. Rinse the item 6. Place the item in the rack 7. Repeat steps 4-6, leaving enough space for water to reach all items 8. Fill the soap cup 9. Turn on the dishwasher With the perturbation, some changes occur: 1. Time spent on dishwashing: In the original process, all dishes, including glassware, are loaded into the dishwasher, which runs for a predetermined amount of time. In the perturbed process, the user spends additional time hand washing glassware before using the dishwasher for other dishes. This extra time spent on washing glassware will increase the overall time required for dishwashing, as the user is adding a manual task to the existing automated process. 2. Fuel consumption for heating the water: In the original process, the dishwasher uses energy to heat water for cleaning all dishes. In the perturbed process, since the glassware is washed separately, it requires manual heating of water for handwashing. This additional energy consumption would depend on the method used for heating the water and the amount of glassware being washed. If a large quantity of glassware needs washing, it may result in higher fuel consumption compared to using the dishwasher alone. 3. Direct and indirect effects on the process: The perturbation has a direct effect on the dishwashing process as it changes the sequence of actions, adding an extra step dedicated to hand washing glassware. This alteration can lead to an increase in total dishwashing time and potential change in energy consumption for heating water. The perturbation could also have indirect effects on the process by altering the efficiency of the dishwasher. Since the glassware is removed from the dishwasher load, the overall number of items that the dishwasher has to clean decreases, which can lead to better distribution of water and detergent, increasing the cleaning efficiency for the remaining non-glass items. Moreover, the chances of breakage or scratching of delicate glassware might be reduced as they are hand washed, which can increase the longevity of the glassware. In conclusion, the perturbation of hand washing all glassware results in both direct and indirect effects on the overall dishwashing process. It increases the time spent on dishwashing and could add to the energy consumption for heating water to wash the glassware. On the other hand, it may also lead to better cleaning efficiency for non-glass items due to a decreased load in the dishwasher and reduce the chances of damage to delicate glassware."},{"prompt":"Given the following context: Chance (voiced by Michael J.

What begins as a simple fascination with her beauty soon spirals into an obsessive quest to discover the name and true identity of this mesmerizing dancer. However, Lucille proves to be quite the enigma, as she remains especially reserved and intensely private. Alongside his loyal friend and confidante, Phillippe (played by Gaspard Ulliel), Jacques embarks on an enthralling journey to uncover the truth behind the elusive Lucille. As he delves deeper into her world, tasking himself with unveiling her secrets, he faces unexpected obstacles, twisted paths, and morally complex decisions that force him to question his own motives and desires. In parallel to Jacques' investigation, Lucille battles her own internal turmoil, experiencing a whirlwind of powerful emotions as she confronts her shadowy past and navigates through her turbulent relationships with the club's patrons and employees. Unbeknownst to Jacques, Lucille is a survivor of a traumatic past, and anonymity is her only refuge from a dangerous world she desperately wants to leave behind. Throughout the film, the lives of Jacques and Lucille slowly intertwine, leading to power struggles, shared secrets, and ultimately, an intense romantic yet tragic connection. This dramatic mystery unfolds in an intricate dance of desire, passion, danger, and revelation – as Jacques struggles to balance the pursuit of his own dreams and the longing for Lucille's truth while also attempting to preserve the fragile world she's built for herself. As the story reaches its climax, Jacques ultimately discovers Lucille's true identity and learns the gravity of her past, forever changing the trajectory of both of their lives. The film closes on an emotional note, with the fate of their relationship hanging in the air, leaving audiences to ponder the question: Can love triumph over darkness, or will the enigma of Lucille remain forever unsolved?"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Denver serves as the capital city of the state of Colorado and is also the most populous city within the state. Established in 1858 as a gold mining town during the Pike's Peak Gold Rush, Denver has grown significantly over the years and is now a major metropolitan area in the United States. Denver County, one of the 64 counties in Colorado, was formed on November 1, 1861, and it originally constituted the entire area of the Territory of Colorado. In 1902, due to the rapid expansion of the city, the county was consolidated with the City and County of Denver, making it a dual-purpose jurisdiction governed by the same municipal government. The City and County of Denver covers an area of approximately 153 square miles (397 square kilometers) and has a population of over 700,000 people. It is situated in the South Platte River Valley, east of the Rocky Mountains, and is part of the Front Range Urban Corridor. Denver has a diverse economy and is well-known for its thriving arts and cultural scene, beautiful parks, and outdoor recreational activities.

A contraction will feel like a tightening of muscles in your abdominal area, especially near your baby. However, a contraction is not always a sign of preterm labor, as you can have false contractions called braxton hicks contractions. Possible answers: a). They are often accompanied by a burning sensation in your abdomen. False contractions are often mistaken for heavy labor.; b). Go to the doctor if you are experiencing a false labor. Distinguish between molar contractions and normal contractions.; c). Braxton hicks contractions are generally less severe than regular contractions. Though braxton hicks can be painful sometimes, actual contractions are usually accompanied by more pain and are more regularly spaced.; d). Therefore, some early postpartum labor experts think that certain types of contractions are preterm labor. If you suspect a contraction is preterm labor, you should take your baby to the nearest nurse line.;","completion":"c). Braxton hicks contractions are generally less severe than regular contractions.

Hypothesis: The rivalry could have why the interiors and decorations were so simple. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"No, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. In fact, the hypothesis seems to contradict the premise. Let's take a closer look at what the premise and hypothesis say and analyze the relationship between them. Premise: The elaborate interiors and decorations are attributed to rivalry between neighboring villages. The premise here suggests that the interiors and decorations of certain buildings or spaces are incredibly intricate and detailed. The reason provided for this elaborate design is rivalry between neighboring villages. This could mean that the village residents are trying to demonstrate their skill, artistic talents, wealth, or some other aspect that they take pride in through the beauty and intricacy of their interiors and decorations. As a result, each village strives to outdo the others, which leads to even more elaborate designs. Hypothesis: The rivalry could have why the interiors and decorations were so simple. The hypothesis, on the other hand, proposes that the village rivalry led to the simplicity of the interiors and decorations. This seems to directly contradict the original premise, as the premise states that the rivalry caused the interiors and decorations to be elaborate, not simple. In conclusion, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise and, in fact, contradicts it. Instead, an entailed hypothesis based on the premise could be something along the lines of, \\"Due to the rivalry between neighboring villages, we can expect to find even more elaborate interiors and decorations as each village strives to outshine the others.\\" In this case, the hypothesis would support the premise and be considered entailed by it."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It comes as a group of MPs have urged the government to take \\"urgent action\\" to recover more money for treating foreign patients. A Public Accounts Committee report says the system for recouping costs from overseas patients is \\"chaotic\\". The case of the Nigerian woman is thought to be one of the NHS's biggest unpaid bills for an overseas patient. The woman, who is included in the BBC One programme Hospital, was due to give birth in the US, where she has family, but had been turned away for not having the right hospital paperwork. She was taken ill on her flight home to Nigeria and ended up in St Mary's A&E, which covers Heathrow after her flight stopped over at the airport. Priscilla was three months away from her due date. She gave birth to one baby who died and she and her three children were all placed in intensive care. Another of her children died on Saturday and her two surviving children remain in intensive care which costs £20,000 a week per child. Priscilla was released from hospital after six weeks and is being supported by a charity as she has no family in the UK and admits she has no ability to pay the bill. The NHS Imperial College Trust which includes St Mary's spent £4m on overseas patients last year and managed to recoup £1.6m. Treatment given in A&E departments is free to all, however, once you are admitted, even as an emergency, overseas visitors are chargeable. In October, it was revealed the government was expected to fall short of its target of recovering £500m a year from overseas visitors and the Department of Health \\"refined\\" its target for 2017-18 to £346m. Chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee Meg Hillier attacked the government's \\"failure to get a grip\\" as \\"simply unacceptable\\". The Department of Health said it would be announcing \\"further steps very shortly to recover up to £500m a year\\". Ms Hillier, MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch, said the NHS was missing out on \\"vital funds\\". \\"The public rightly expects the government to enforce the rules, and more can and should be done to recover money,\\" she said. The report calls on the Department of Health to publish an action plan by June, \\"setting out specific actions, milestones and performance measures for increasing the amount recovered from overseas visitors\\". Responding to the PAC report, a Department of Health official said: \\"This government was the first to put measures in place to make sure the NHS recoups money from people who are not eligible for free care. \\"Some hospitals are already doing great work, and the amount of income identified has more than trebled in three years, to £289m. \\"However, there is more to be done to make sure that if people are not eligible for free care, they pay for it. \\"We will be announcing further steps very shortly to recover up to £500m a year by the middle of this Parliament.\\" Hospital trusts in England are legally obliged to check whether patients are eligible for free non-emergency NHS treatment and to recover any costs. The report identifies the biggest challenge to recovering costs as the lack of a single easy way to prove whether patients are entitled to healthcare. The committee notes that while some trusts are now requiring patients to prove their identity by showing passports and utility bills, these documents do not demonstrate entitlement to free NHS care. Some patients, such as refugees and those applying for asylum, are exempt from charges. The report says the Department of Health should build on existing systems, such as the NHS number and electronic patient record. There are currently large variations between trusts in the amounts they charge and the debts they recover from overseas patients. The committee says that trusts' performances should be shared and there should be intervention if a trust is falling short. And while GP appointments are free to everyone, the report says GPs could do more to help and the government should give clear guidelines on what is expected of them. Dr Mark Porter council chairman for the British Medical Association, said: \\"It is important that those accessing NHS service are eligible to do so and that we recover the costs for treating overseas visitors. \\"The systems to do this need to be practical, economic and efficient and must not jeopardise access to healthcare for those who need it. \\"Any charging systems should not prevent sick and vulnerable patients receiving necessary care, otherwise there may be serious consequences for their health and that of the public in general.\\" This article was about:","completion":"A woman from Nigeria named Priscilla got very sick on an airplane trip back to her country.

Determine the sentiment: I've never found Charley Chase very funny, even though his on-screen character sometimes reminds me of John Cleese, whom I find VERY funny. (Charley Chase also reminds me of gowky Hen Broon from Scotland's 'Sunday Post' comics page.) In Chase's best films, I tend to admire his professionalism rather than laughing at him. I'll give Chase credit that his very best films -- such as 'Mighty Like a Moose' and 'His Wooden Wedding' -- have inspired a fandom who are fiercely loyal to him ... but I'm positive that even the most die-hard Chase fan will agree that the very early and very crude 'Married to Order' just isn't funny at all.

I was intrigued that the brand name is mentioned in the dialogue titles: is this an early example of product-placement?

Now an American study has found that memory starts to fail when we are young adults. People younger than thirty years of age usually do not know that they are starting to forget information. But scientists from the University of Michigan say the loss of memory has usually already started. Researchers say people do not observe this slow reduction in mental ability until the loss affects their everyday activities. Denise Park led the new study. She directs the Centre for Aging and Cognition at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. Her team studied more than 350 men and women between the ages of twenty and ninety years. The study identified people in their middle twenties with memory problems. She says young adults do not know they are forgetting things because their brains have more information than they need. But she says that people in their twenties and thirties are losing memory at the same rate as people in their sixties and seventies. Ms. Park says people between the ages of sixty and seventy may note the decrease in their mental abilities. They begin to observe that they are having more trouble remembering and learning new information. The study found that older adults are more likely to remember false information as being true. For example, they remembered false medical claims as being true. Younger people remembered hearing the information. But they were more likely to remember that it was false. Ms. Park is now using modern imaging equipment to study what happens in the brains of people of different ages. She is studying what parts of the brain older adults use for different activities compared to younger adults. Ms. Park says mental performance is a direct result of brain activity and brain structure. She says keeping the brain active is important. She hopes future studies will identify ways to improve the operation of our aging minds. It can be inferred from what Denis Park says that _ . A) mental performance can be improved B) mental ability is determined entirely by brain structure C) people of different ages use different parts of the brain for memorizing D) different parts of the brain are responsible for different mental activities The answer to this question is:","completion":"A) mental performance can be improved. Denise Park, who led the study, suggests that mental performance is a direct result of brain activity and brain structure. She also emphasizes the importance of keeping the brain active and hopes future studies will identify ways to improve the operation of our aging minds. This implies that mental performance can be improved by maintaining brain activity and investigating methods to enhance the functioning of our minds as we age."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Lester Willis Young (August 27, 1909 - March 15, 1959), nicknamed \\"Pres\\" or \\"Prez\\", was an American jazz tenor saxophonist and occasional clarinetist. Coming to prominence while a member of Count Basie's orchestra, Young was one of the most influential players on his instrument. In contrast to many of his hard-driving peers, Young played with a relaxed, cool tone and used sophisticated harmonies, using what one critic called \\"a free-floating style, wheeling and diving like a gull, banking with low, funky riffs that pleased dancers and listeners alike\\". Known for his hip, introverted style, he invented or popularized much of the hipster jargon which came to be associated with the music. Context: In 1933 Young settled in Kansas City, where after playing briefly in several bands, he rose to prominence with Count Basie. His playing in the Basie band was characterized by a relaxed style which contrasted sharply with the more forceful approach of Coleman Hawkins, the dominant tenor sax player of the day. One of Young's key influences was Frank Trumbauer, who came to prominence in the 1920s with Paul Whiteman and played the C-melody saxophone (between the alto and tenor in pitch). Young left the Basie band to replace Hawkins in Fletcher Henderson's orchestra. He soon left Henderson to play in the Andy Kirk band (for six months) before returning to Basie. While with Basie, Young made small-group recordings for Milt Gabler's Commodore Records, The Kansas City Sessions. Although they were recorded in New York (in 1938, with a reunion in 1944), they are named after the group, the Kansas City Seven, and comprised Buck Clayton, Dicky Wells, Basie, Young, Freddie Green, Rodney Richardson, and Jo Jones. Young played clarinet as well as tenor in these sessions. Young is described as playing the clarinet in a \\"liquid, nervous style.\\" As well as the Kansas City Sessions, his clarinet work from 1938-39 is documented on recordings with Basie, Billie Holiday, Basie small groups, and the organist Glenn Hardman. Billie and Lester met at a Harlem jam session in the early 30s and worked together in the Count Basie band and in nightclubs on New York's 52nd St. At one point Lester moved into the apartment Billie shared with her mother, Sadie Fagan. Holiday always insisted their relationship was strictly platonic. She gave Lester the nickname \\"Prez\\" after President Franklin Roosevelt, the \\"greatest man around\\" in Billie's mind. Playing on her name, he would call her \\"Lady Day.\\" Their famously empathetic classic recordings with Teddy Wilson date from this era. After Young's clarinet was stolen in 1939, he abandoned the instrument until about 1957. That year Norman Granz gave him one and urged him to play it (with far different results at that stage in Young's life--see below). Question: did he become successful? Answer:","completion":"Yes, Lester Young, also known as \\"Pres\\" or \\"Prez\\", became successful. He was an important jazz tenor saxophonist and clarinetist who gained popularity when he joined Count Basie's orchestra. His unique, relaxed playing style made him one of the most influential musicians on his instrument. He played with famous bands and made classic recordings with artists like Billie Holiday. People really enjoyed listening and dancing to his music, which helped him become successful."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice. and the situation: Albert is a scientist who travels the planet looking for new species to discover and analyze.

Worth a total of US 600 million, the paintings ate by French Impressionist masters, including Monet, Cezanne, Renoir and Degas. As an art style, Impressionism was developed inFranceduring the late 19thand early 20thcenturies. Their work was a fresh and original way of painting. It seems that the artists painted a scene after just a quick look at it. Often painting outside, rather than in a studio, the artists observed nature more directly and tried to capture individual moments in time especially the changing light of the sun. They avoided black and earth color1s and as a result their work is often very bright and can also look like that it is shining. When they first appeared, the artists were criticized for not finishing their paintings and for being lazy. Critics said the Impressionists were satisfied with just a few inexact brushstrokes instead of completing a real painting. It was an art critic who first used the term \\"Impressionist\\" in a review of Monet's work \\"Impression, Sunrise\\"(1873) to satirize his loose, inexact manner of painting. \\"Everyone discusses my art and pretends to understand, as if it were necessary to understand, when it is simply necessary to love,\\" said Monet.

It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol. Now, I have a new situation: John is a doctor with the local hospital. Earlier today, he was seeing two patients, patient A and patient B. John found out that patient A had more LDL, but patient B had more HDL. He now needs to determine correct treatment for them.

Focus on the most likely aspect of a ball a child would describe: While rolling down the street (E) does describe a possible action of a ball, it is not specific to the shape or material of a ball. A young child might use rubber (A) to describe the ball's material, but they are more likely to first address the shape of the ball. 4. Choose the most straightforward descriptive term: Between rubber (A) and round (D), round (D) is a more common and easier-to-understand word that directly describes the shape of a ball.

Background: An optimal decision is a decision that leads to at least as good a known or expected outcome as all other available decision options. It is an important concept in decision theory. In order to compare the different decision outcomes, one commonly assigns a utility value to each of them. If there is uncertainty as to what the outcome will be, then under the von Neumann–Morgenstern axioms the optimal decision maximizes the expected utility (a probability–weighted average of utility over all possible outcomes of a decision). Paragraph: John and Keith are playing a decision making game. They have three decisions to make decision A, decision B, and decision C. Decision A and decision B have certain outcome, but decision C's outcome is uncertain. John would apply optimal decision making process while Keith would rather rely on his hunches. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In respect to decision C, would Keith's strategy most likely maximize or not maximize the expected utility? A:","completion":"Given the paragraph above, Keith's strategy of relying on his hunches for decision C would most likely not maximize the expected utility. This is because the optimal decision-making process, as applied by John, involves evaluating and comparing the utility of each available option, including those with uncertain outcomes, to identify the best possible choice. The optimal decision-making approach is based on the von Neumann-Morgenstern axioms, which prioritize maximizing expected utility by taking into account the probability-weighted average of utility across all potential outcomes. In other words, it is a systematic and mathematical analysis of the possible outcomes and their respective utilities. On the other hand, Keith's reliance on hunches lacks this analytical framework and probability-based weighting, making it less likely to identify the decision that will maximize expected utility. In the case of decision C, with its uncertain outcome, Keith's reliance on intuition or gut feeling may overlook critical information and probabilities, leading to suboptimal decision-making. While hunches can sometimes be accurate, they do not provide a consistent nor comprehensive approach to problem-solving compared to evidence-based and analytically driven decision-making processes like the optimal decision-making approach. In conclusion, Keith's hunch-driven strategy for decision C is less likely to maximize expected utility when compared to the optimal decision-making process, as it lacks the systematic analysis and probability-based considerations that are essential for making effective and informed choices in complex and uncertain situations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Identify the disciples: I know that the disciples were the followers of Jesus Christ. There were 12 main disciples, who were also called apostles, consistently mentioned in the New Testament of the Bible. 2. Research martyrdom: Martyrdom typically refers to an individual willingly suffering death or persecution for their religious beliefs or principles. In the context of the disciples, I’m looking for the first disciple who was killed due to their belief in Jesus and their work in spreading Christianity. 3. Investigate the fates of the disciples: By looking at historical writings, I can gather information on the lives of the disciples following the death and resurrection of Jesus. After researching the lives of the 12 disciples, I found that Stephen is often considered the first martyr in Christian tradition, but he was not one of the 12 main disciples. Among the twelve, St. James the Greater, one of the original apostles of Jesus, was the first to be martyred. His martyrdom is recorded in the Bible in Acts 12:1-2, when King Herod Agrippa I ordered his execution by the sword around 44 AD."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, if we wanted a more detailed response, we could delve deeper into each of these and discuss them individually: 1. Belém Cultural Centre (Lisbon): This multi-disciplinary venue was inaugurated in 1992 and since then has served as a focal point for the promotion of cultural exchange between Portuguese and international artists, thinkers, and public figures. The Centre offers a diverse program which includes music, dance, theater, cinema, visual arts, and more. It also houses the Berardo Collection Museum, a significant modern and contemporary art collection. 2. Serralves Foundation (Porto): This renowned cultural institution is perhaps most famous for its Contemporary Art Museum, designed by architect Álvaro Siza Vieira. It also encompasses the Serralves Villa, a unique example of Art Deco architecture, and the Serralves Park, a verdant 18-hectare area that serves as the backdrop for numerous performances and installations. The Foundation holds annually a multitude of exhibitions, educational activities, concerts, and seminars. 3. Casa da Música (Porto): The House of Music, as its name translates, is an important concert venue for music ranging from classical to contemporary genres. It was commissioned as part of Porto's project for European Culture Capital in 2001 and designed by award-winning architect, Rem Koolhaas. This space hosts a wide array of musical events such as concerts, recitals, and workshops organized by three orchestras that are based there - the Symphony Orchestra, the Remix Ensemble, and the Baroque Orchestra. Other new public cultural facilities across Portugal include: 4. Municipal Libraries: There are more than 250 municipal library networks spread across Portugal, offering residents and visitors alike access to books, periodicals, and digital media collections. Libraries such as the Almeida Garrett Library in Porto or the Palácio Galveias Library in Lisbon also regularly host various cultural activities including presentations, workshops, and conferences. 5. Concert Halls: In line with efforts to decentralize cultural offerings, several concert halls have been established or renovated in different municipalities. These facilities typically serve multiple purposes, hosting a variety of performances including orchestral concerts, theatrical shows, ballet, and more. 6. Museums and Art Galleries: There is also an impressive range of museums across the country that offer insight into Portugal's history, arts, and culture. This includes the Gulbenkian Museum in Lisbon, which showcases a broad array of ancient and modern art, and the National Museum Soares dos Reis in Porto, dedicated to Portuguese fine arts and decorative arts from the 19th and 20th centuries.

Would \\"The primary producers of triticale are Poland , Germany , France , Belarus and Australia .\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","completion":"No, the provided answer, \\"The primary producers of triticale are Poland, Germany, France, Belarus, and Australia,\\" does not directly address the question of when to plant triticale. However, I can provide a detailed and long answer to help answer the question more effectively. Triticale is a hybrid grain resulting from a cross between wheat (Triticum) and rye (Secale). It combines the nutritional and yield advantages of wheat with the hardiness and disease resistance of rye, making it an attractive option for agricultural production in various climate conditions. The planting time for triticale varies depending on the growing region and the specific variety that you wish to plant. In general, there are two main varieties of triticale: winter triticale and spring triticale. Each type has its own optimal planting time, which is influenced by the regional climate and agronomic factors. Here is a general guideline for planting triticale: 1. Winter Triticale: This variety is more cold-tolerant and is often planted in the fall. It requires a vernalization period, which is a period of cold temperatures (32-50°F or 0-10°C) to trigger flowering. In regions with mild winters (such as parts of Europe or the southern United States), winter triticale can be sown from mid-September to mid-November. In colder regions (such as the northern United States or Canada), planting may need to occur earlier, typically between late August and early October, to allow the seedlings to develop strong root systems before the harsh winter conditions set in. Winter triticale then overwinters and resumes growth in the spring, with harvest taking place in the summer. 2. Spring Triticale: This variety does not require vernalization and can be planted in the spring as the soil temperatures begin to warm up. Ideal planting time is usually between late March and early May, following the last expected frost date. Spring triticale has a shorter growing season and can be harvested in late summer or early fall. It's essential to consider your region's climate and the specific needs of the triticale variety you've chosen when selecting the appropriate planting time. Factors such as soil temperature, day length, and moisture levels can all affect the germination and growth of triticale. Additionally, consulting local agricultural extension services or other expert resources can provide tailored advice to help you determine the optimal planting dates for your specific location."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the union that included many states such as Nabha, Faridkot, and Malerkotla? ? The bulk of the larger states, and some groups of small states, were integrated through a different, four-step process. The first step in this process was to convince groups of large states to combine to form a \\"princely union\\" through the execution by their rulers of Covenants of Merger. Under the Covenants of Merger, all rulers lost their ruling powers, save one who became the Rajpramukh of the new union. The other rulers were associated with two bodies—the council of rulers, whose members were the rulers of salute states, and a presidium, one or more of whose members were elected by the rulers of non-salute states, with the rest elected by the council. The Rajpramukh and his deputy Uprajpramukh were chosen by the council from among the members of the presidium. The Covenants made provision for the creation of a constituent assembly for the new union which would be charged with framing its constitution. In return for agreeing to the extinction of their states as discrete entities, the rulers were given a privy purse and guarantees similar to those provided under the Merger Agreements.Through this process, Patel obtained the unification of 222 states in the Kathiawar peninsula of his native Gujarat into the princely union of Saurashtra in January 1948, with six more states joining the union the following year. Madhya Bharat emerged on 28 May 1948 from a union of Gwalior, Indore and eighteen smaller states. In Punjab, the Patiala and East Punjab States Union was formed on 15 July 1948 from Patiala, Kapurthala, Jind, Nabha, Faridkot, Malerkotla, Nalargarh, and Kalsia. The United State of Rajasthan was formed as the result of a series of mergers, the last of which was completed on 15 May 1949. Travancore and Cochin were merged in the middle of 1949 to form the princely union of Travancore-Cochin. The only princely states which signed neither Covenants of Merger nor Merger Agreements were Kashmir, Mysore and Hyderabad.

To make a great resume, just like making a sandwich, you need to put the right ingredients. Let's break it down like we're talking about a sandwich: 1. Bread: Start with your name and contact information at the top of the page. That's like the bread to hold everything together. 2. Cheese: Next, add a summary or objective that explains what kind of job you want (accounts executive) and why you'd be good at it. It's like cheese in our sandwich that gives it some flavor. 3. Veggies: After that, list your education (school name and degree) and any courses or skills related to the job, like how you can count fast or use special computer programs. This is like veggies making our sandwich more interesting. 4. Meat: Now, we have the most important part of our sandwich - the meat! Write down any work experience or internships you had, even if it's not related to accounting, and show how they make you a great fit for the job. 5. Condiments: Sprinkle some achievements, awards, or volunteering you did on top of your sandwich. This is like adding ketchup or mayonnaise to make it taste even better. 6. Last bread slice: Finally, make sure your resume looks clean, with no mistakes, and is easy to read. That's like putting the last slice of bread on top, so our sandwich looks neat and tasty! Question 2: My dad keeps yelling at my mom and it makes me really upset. How can I help her? When you see your mommy is sad because daddy is yelling, you can think of it like a cloudy day and you want to be the sunshine. You can try these things: 1. Hug: Give mom a big hug, sometimes that can make her feel better, just like a warm blanket on a cold day. 2. Talk: Ask mom if she wants to talk about why she's sad. Sometimes talking to someone can help, like how a friend can share an umbrella in the rain. 3. Help: Offer to help mom with chores or anything she needs, like a little hero helping people in need. 4. Tell a grown-up: If the yelling keeps happening a lot and it's scaring you, talk to another grown-up you trust, like a teacher, aunt, or grandparent, so they can help too. Now, let's compare these questions, just like we compare two different fruits: No, those questions are not the same. The first question is about making a good resume for a job, like making a sandwich with the right ingredients. The second question is about helping your mom when your dad yells, like being the sunshine on a cloudy day. These questions are different topics and need different answers, just like how apples and oranges are different fruits with different tastes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I can use this background: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: What is Maurice's profession? Movie plot title: Venus Movie plot: The plot concerns Maurice Russell, an elderly actor who finds himself increasingly attracted to his friend Ian's grand-niece Jessie while simultaneously finding himself in deteriorating health due to prostate cancer. Maurice's friend describes the grand-niece as a trouble maker and a nuisance, but Maurice discovers that Jessie warms up to him when he starts interacting with her. He takes her to the National Gallery in London to view his favourite painting, the Rokeby Venus, by the Spanish artist Diego VelÃ¡zquez. Jessie had expressed interest in modelling (Maurice initially mis-hears this as \\"yodelling\\") and Maurice arranges for Jessie to model nude for an art class. As a result of Jessie posing for the art class, and inspired by his favourite painting, Maurice decides to give Jessie the nickname \\"Venus\\". Maurice and Jessie develop a passive/aggressive relationship over the course of the film. Maurice is forward in terms of his attraction towards Jessie while Jessie occasionally indulges his whims to a limited extent, such as touching her hand and smelling her neck, but also retracts the indulgences when she feels that he has gone too far. The plot of the film revolves around the evolving friendship or relationship between the two characters. For Maurice, this appears to be the last attempt at something approaching a love life, as his prostate operation has left him impotent. For Jessie, it is less clear what she sees in Maurice. During the course of the film we see her do everything from exploiting him (trying to get him to buy her presents, trying to use his flat to have sex with a boy), taking care of him, flirting with him, and rejecting him sexually to engaging with him as a friend. During the course of the film we learn that she has been rejected by her mother and great-uncle for her promiscuous life style; it is implied that she is drawn to Maurice because he does not judge her as harshly as her family members have. The plot comes to a head when Jessie becomes involved with a boy. The two young lovers...

More formally, rationalism is defined as a methodology or a theory \\"in which the criterion of the truth is not sensory but intellectual and deductive\\". - A capital market is a financial market in which long-term debt or equity-backed securities are bought and sold. Capital markets are defined as markets in which money is provided for periods longer than a year. Capital markets channel the wealth of savers to those who can put it to long-term productive use, such as companies or governments making long-term investments. Financial regulators, such as the Bank of England (BoE) or the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), oversee the capital markets in their jurisdictions to protect investors against fraud, among other duties. - Medicine (British English ; American English ) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. The word \\"medicine\\" is derived from Latin \\"medicus\\", meaning \\"a physician\\". Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others. - The University of Siena (abbreviation: UNISI) in Siena, Tuscany is one of the oldest and first publicly funded universities in Italy. Originally called \\"Studium Senese\\", the institution was founded in 1240. It had around 20,000 students in 2006, nearly half of Siena's total population of around 54,000. Today, the University of Siena is best known for its Schools of Law and Medicine. - Latium is the region of central western Italy in which the city of Rome was founded and grew to be the capital city of the Roman Empire. Latium was originally a small triangle of fertile, volcanic soil on which resided the tribe of the Latins or Latians. It was located on the left bank (east and south) of the Tiber river, extending northward to the Anio river (a left-bank tributary of the Tiber) and southeastward to the Pomptina Palus (Pontine Marshes, now the Pontine Fields) as far south as the Circeian promontory. The right bank of the Tiber was occupied by the Etruscan city of Veii, and the other borders were occupied by Italic tribes. Subsequently, Rome defeated Veii and then its Italic neighbors, expanding Latium to the Apennine Mountains in the northeast and to the opposite end of the marsh in the southeast. The modern descendant, the Italian \\"Regione\\" of Lazio, also called \\"Latium\\" in Latin, and occasionally in modern English, is somewhat larger still, but not as much as double the original Latium. - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. - Marxism is a method of socioeconomic analysis that analyzes class relations and societal conflict using a materialist interpretation of historical development and a dialectical view of social transformation. It originates from the mid-to-late 19th century works of German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. - Kantian ethics refers to a deontological ethical theory ascribed to the German philosopher Immanuel Kant. The theory, developed as a result of Enlightenment rationalism, is based on the view that the only intrinsically good thing is a good will; an action can only be good if its maximthe principle behind itis duty to the moral law. Central to Kant's construction of the moral law is the categorical imperative, which acts on all people, regardless of their interests or desires. Kant formulated the categorical imperative in various ways. His principle of universalizability requires that, for an action to be permissible, it must be possible to apply it to all people without a contradiction occurring. His formulation of humanity as an end in itself requires that humans are never treated merely as a means to an end, but always also as ends in themselves. The formulation of autonomy concludes that rational agents are bound to the moral law by their own will, while Kant's concept of the Kingdom of Ends requires that people act as if the principles of their actions establish a law for a hypothetical kingdom. Kant also distinguished between perfect and imperfect duties. A perfect duty, such as the duty not to lie, always holds true; an imperfect duty, such as the duty to give to charity, can be made flexible and applied in particular time and place. - Vatican City , officially Vatican City State or the State of Vatican City, is a walled enclave within the city of Rome. With an area of approximately 44 hectares (110 acres), and a population of 842, it is the smallest State in the world by both area and population, but formally it is not sovereign, sovereignty being held by the Holy See, the only entity of public international law that has diplomatic relations with almost every country in the world. - Friedrich Engels (or 28 November 1820 5 August 1895) was a German philosopher, social scientist, journalist, and businessman. He founded Marxist theory together with Karl Marx. In 1845, he published \\"The Condition of the Working Class in England\\", based on personal observations and research in Manchester. - Karl Marx (5 May 1818 14 March 1883) was a German-born scientist, philosopher, economist, sociologist, journalist, and revolutionary socialist. Born in Trier to a middle-class family, he later studied political economy and Hegelian philosophy. As an adult, Marx became stateless and spent much of his life in London, England, where he continued to develop his thought in collaboration with German thinker Friedrich Engels and published various works, the most well-known being the 1848 pamphlet \\"The Communist Manifesto\\". His work has since influenced subsequent intellectual, economic, and political history. - Capitalism is an economic system based on private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit. Characteristics central to capitalism include private property, capital accumulation, wage labor, voluntary exchange, a price system, and competitive markets. In a capitalist market economy, decision-making and investment is determined by the owners of the factors of production in financial and capital markets, and prices and the distribution of goods are mainly determined by competition in the market. - Economic determinism is a theory that economic relationships (such as being an owner or capitalist, or being a worker or proletarian) are the foundation upon which all other social and political arrangements in society are based. The theory stresses that societies are divided into competing economic classes whose relative political power is determined by the nature of the economic system. In the version associated with Karl Marx, the emphasis is on the proletariat who are considered to be locked in a class struggle with the capitalist class, which will eventually end with the revolutionary overthrow of the capitalist system and the gradual development of socialism. Marxist thinkers have dismissed plain and unilateral economic determinism as a form of \\"vulgar Marxism\\", or \\"economism\\", nowhere included in Marx's works. - Economism is reduction of all social facts to economic dimensions. The term is often used to criticize economics as an ideology, in which supply and demand are the only important factors in decisions, and outstrip or permit ignoring all other factors. It is believed to be a side effect of neoclassical economics and blind faith in an \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"laissez-faire\\" means of making decisions, extended far beyond controlled and regulated markets, and used to make political and military decisions. Conventional ethics would play no role in decisions under pure economism, except insofar as supply would be withheld, demand curtailed, by moral choices of individuals. Thus, critics of economism insist on political and other cultural dimensions in society. - Law is a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - Determinism is the philosophical position that for every event there exist conditions that could cause no other event. \\"There are many determinisms, depending on what pre-conditions are considered to be determinative of an event or action.\\" Deterministic theories throughout the history of philosophy have sprung from diverse and sometimes overlapping motives and considerations. Some forms of determinism can be empirically tested with ideas from physics and the philosophy of physics. The opposite of determinism is some kind of indeterminism (otherwise called \\"nondeterminism\\"). Determinism is often contrasted with free will. - Competition is, in general, a contest or rivalry between two or more organisms, animals, individuals, economic groups or social groups, etc., for territory, a niche, for resources, goods, for mates, for prestige, recognition, for awards, for group or social status, or for leadership and profit. It arises whenever at least two parties strive for a goal which cannot be shared, where one's gain is the other's loss (a zero-sum game). - The concept of universalizability was set out by the 18th-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant as part of his work \\"Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals\\". It is part of the first formulation of his categorical imperative, which states that the only morally acceptable maxims of our actions are those that could rationally be willed to be universal law. - A market economy is an economic system where decisions regarding investment, production, and distribution are based on the interplay of supply and demand, which determines the prices of goods and services. The major defining characteristic of a market economy is that investment decisions, or the allocation of producer good, are primarily made through capital and financial markets. This is contrasted with a planned economy, where investment and production decisions are embodied in an integrated plan of production established by a state or other organizational body that controls the factors of production. - A revolution (from the Latin \\"revolutio\\", \\"a turn around\\") is a fundamental change in political power or organizational structures that takes place in a relatively short period of time when the population rises up in revolt against the current authorities. Aristotle described two types of political revolution: Revolutions have occurred through human history and vary widely in terms of methods, duration, and motivating ideology. Their results include major changes in culture, economy, and socio-political institutions. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Ernesto Screpanti ( born 1948 , Rome ) is a professor of Political Economy at the University of Siena . He worked on the \`\` rethinking Marxism '' research programme , in the attempt to update Marxist analysis by bringing it in line with the reality of contemporary capitalism , on the one hand , and to liberate Marxism from any residue of Hegelian metaphysics , Kantian ethics and economic determinism , on the other .

USA TODAY Harland Rose was named after Colonel Harland Sanders in a contest offered by KFC (Photo: Credit: KFC) KFC offered parents college tuition money to name their child after Colonel Sanders and someone actually did it. We were half expecting a small white suit, tiny bow tie and miniature black-rimmed glasses — but to be honest, the baby who won the Harland Sanders naming contest looks super cute in her satin hair bow and floral dress. Yes, this baby Harland is a girl. Let's back it up and see how we got here. KFC had a problem. The name of their founder isn't popular these days and is sort of dying out. In fact, the last time Harland cracked the top 1,000 names for American baby boys was about 70 years ago. According to BabyCenter.com, it dropped to 5,477 in 2018. In an attempt to boost the sagging popularity of the name, Kentucky Fried Chicken offered a challenge in August: Be the first family to have a child on the Colonel's birthday (Sept. 9), and then name that baby Harland to receive 11,000 toward college tuition.

Options: A. get tired B. lose weight C. aerobic activity D. fatigue E. drink water","completion":"The question does not provide specific details about what the ultimate goal of the exercise is, so we need to apply common sense and consider common reasons people are told to do exercises by trainers. Our options here are: A. Get tired B. Lose weight C. Aerobic activity D. Fatigue E. Drink water Let's examine each option: Option A (Get tired) and D (Fatigue) may seem plausible at first because physical exercise often leads to exhaustion. However, a professional trainer wouldn't advise someone to exercise until they're excessively tired or fatigued because overworking can lead to negative impact on the person's health such as injuries and health degradation. Option C (Aerobic Activity) is not a valid answer because it doesn't make much sense in the context of the sentence. It's not clear how one would \\"do until aerobic activity.\\" although it's possible for exercise to involve aerobic activity, the phrase doesn't fit the “until he…” format of the question. Option E (Drink water) is not a valid answer either. Drinking water is a part of maintaining hydration during exercise, but it's not typically a goal or endpoint of exercise. Usually, it's necessary to drink water during a workout and not exclusively at the end. This leaves us with Option B (Lose weight). This is a common reason people undertake supervised exercise, and it stands to reason that a trainer might tell a client to keep doing a particular exercise until they achieve their weight loss goals. Therefore, applying common sense and considering typical fitness contexts, \\"until he lose weight\\" is the option most in line with common sense to answer the given question.

Наследие дроу Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"The phrase \\"Наследие дроу\\" is in Russian and translates to \\"The Drow's Legacy\\" in English. Here is a detailed explanation of the phrase and its significance: The Drow are a fantasy race, commonly found in the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game. They are often referred to as \\"Dark Elves\\" and are characterized by their dark skin, white hair, and exceptional abilities in both magic and combat. The Drow inhabit the subterranean world of the Underdark, a realm of vast caverns, tunnels, and underground cities. The Drow's Legacy relates to the cultural, societal, and historical aspects that define this race and their influence on the world they inhabit. The legacy spans various aspects including their religious beliefs, political structure, and relations with other races. Religious Beliefs: Drow society is predominantly matriarchal and centers around the worship of the evil goddess Lolth, also known as the Spider Queen. Lolth is portrayed as a cruel and capricious deity, and her teachings shape much of Drow culture and society. Political Structure: The Drow's political system is composed of numerous noble families, which constantly strive for power and influence through treachery, violence, and politics. Each city in the Underdark is ruled by a council of Matrons or the most powerful noble houses. Relations with Other Races: Due to their evil nature and the harsh environment they live in, the Drow have a tumultuous relationship with other races in the Dungeons & Dragons world. They are generally distrusted and feared by surface-dwelling races like Humans, Elves, and Dwarves. Additionally, the Drow's society often clashes with other Underdark races, including Mind Flayers, Duergar (Gray Dwarves), and Svirfneblin (Deep Gnomes). Legacy and Culture: The Drow are skilled in various arts, including arcane magic, swordsmanship, and poison-making. Their advanced knowledge and abilities contribute to their cultural significance in the world. As part of their dark aesthetic, they value art and architecture that showcase their cruel and menacing nature. Drow cities are often intricately designed with an ominous ambiance to represent their connection to Lolth and their ruthless society. The Drow's Legacy, therefore, refers to the sum of these various aspects and how they shape the race and its interaction with the world. It embodies the distinct set of beliefs, customs, and characteristics that define the Drow as a powerful and feared race within the realms of fantasy literature and games."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Later that night, Mary dreams that the Nutcracker – called N.C. – comes to life and takes her on a wondrous journey. They discover that the Nazi-like Rat King has usurped the Nutcracker's kingdom. When Mary and N.C. go to the top of the Christmas tree, they meet a fairy and, as she begins to sing, N.C. looks at his hand, as it begins to turn human. Worried about this he runs into the sleigh, but leaves his human hand revealed, and Mary sees this. Mary, seeing this, goes to N.C. and rubs his hand as we see that he is in fact a human crying with tears of joy that he is human again. The snow fairy begins to sing and toys appear and begin to ice skate around the tree. N.C. takes Mary to the top to show her his city. The two come up with a plan to shut down the smoke factory. Suddenly N.C. is starting to turn back in to a doll. Then the tree is shaking and Mary falls off, only to awake to being in her room. Mary tries to tell her parents about it but they think she is not telling the truth.

Similarly, 256 turns into -256 when it crosses to the right side. So, we get: u = 263 - 256 Now comes the fun part: subtraction! What is 263 - 256? It's 7! So, we have: u = 7 And that's the answer, 'u' is 7."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

In this article, I’ll address a real mainstay of modern medicine: laboratory tests that require drawing blood. This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself. In this article, I’m going to list and briefly explain the blood tests that are most commonly used, for the primary medical care of older...

The National Association of College Stores reported more than five billion dollars in sales of textbooks and course materials. The association spokesman Charles Schmidt says electronic textbooks now just make up 2%~3% of sales. But he says that is expected to reach 10%~15% by 2012. Online versions are now available for many of the most popular college textbooks. An etextbook can cost half the price of a new print textbook. But students usually lose access to them after the end of the term. And the books cannot be placed on more than one device ,so they are not easy to share. So what do students think of etextbooks?Administrators at Northwest Missouri State University wanted to find it out. Earlier this year they tested them with 500 students in 20 classes. The university is unusual. It provides laptop computers for all 7,000 of its fulltime students. It does not require students to buy their textbooks either. They rent them to save money. The school aims to save even more by moving to etextbooks. The students in the survey reported that downloading the books from the Internet was easy. They liked the idea of carrying lighter backpacks. And 56% said they were better able to find information. But most found that using etextbooks did not change their study habits. And 60% felt they read more when they were reading on paper. In all,almost half the students said they still liked physical textbooks better. But the survey found that cost could be a big influence.55% said they would choose etextbooks if using them meant their textbook rental fee would not increase. Roger Von Holzen heads the Center for Information Technology in Education at Northwest Missouri State University. He tells us that administrators are disappointed with the etextbooks now available because the majority are not interactive . He thinks growth will come when more digital books include video,activities,games and other ways to interact with the information.... Question: Etextbooks are not better than paper books in that _ .

In addition, students usually lose access to the ebooks after the end of the term. While etextbooks have advantages like being more affordable and lighter to carry, these limitations make them less convenient for sharing compared to physical textbooks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There are many well-known risk factors for death -- high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, and Christmas. Yes, Christmas. Several studies show you have a greater chance of dying on Christmas, the day after Christmas or New Year's Day than any other single day of the year. This is true for people who die of natural causes, which account for 93% of all deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control. It's also true, researchers say, for people who die of the five most common diseases: circulatory problems, respiratory diseases, endocrine/nutritional/metabolic problems, digestive diseases and cancer. There's a spike in deaths for all age groups on those days with one exception -- children. David P. Phillips who was the lead author on a couple of these studies, noticed this trend when studying U.S. death certificates. Specifically, Phillips, a professor in the sociology department at UC San Diego, and his team looked at the number of people who died in emergency settings and those who were considered dead on arrival between 1979 and 2004. They found a spike in deaths on those three days. An earlier Phillips study from 2004 found a similar trend, specifically in cardiac deaths. A more recent 2013 study in Britain found patients admitted to hospitals as emergencies on public holidays are significantly more likely to die than those admitted on other days of the week -- including weekends. Scientists still can't explain this phenomenon, although there are plenty of popular theories. Andrew Meacham is the obituary writer at the Tampa Bay Times and president of the Society of Professional Obituary Writers. Over the years he has noticed his workload pick up over the holidays. \\"We are always getting a slew of obits this time of year,\\" Meacham said. \\"I noticed this happened pretty regularly so I did call around to funeral directors to see if they believed there was an uptick too.\\" He wondered if stress or sadness had something to do with it. \\"I've written many stories about a spouse or a partner dying and then you see the remaining partner die within hour or days or weeks or months. To me there seems to be a correlation between body and mind here.\\" Phillips and his team looked at the number of deaths among the Alzheimer's population, theorizing they may be less aware of the holidays and the stress it can trigger. If stress were solely to blame, he figured, their deaths wouldn't spike on Christmas or New Year's. But sure enough, he found cardiac deaths were slightly higher at the holidays when Alzheimer's was listed as a secondary cause of death. More people do die in winter months than in any other season, so Phillips looked to see if there were more deaths in the states that experience colder temperatures. That wasn't the case, either. The cardiac mortality peak is slightly smaller in the states that border Canada, compared to states that border the Gulf of Mexico, he found. What about festive eating or drinking? Phillips' team found deaths were still up for people who were in inpatient treatment -- whose diet and alcohol consumption was strictly regulated. In fact, those who died with substance abuse listed as a secondary cause of death saw a smaller holiday peak than those who died from cardiac diseases alone. Despite popular belief, the suicide rate doesn't spike at the holidays. In fact, the suicide rate in December is at its lowest -- it peaks in spring and fall. The homicide rate also goes down for the holidays. Phillips thinks the true reason that Christmas and New Year's are a risk factor for death may actually have much more to do with access to care. People who aren't feeling well may be putting off a trip to the hospital so they can stay with their family to celebrate Christmas or New Year's, he said. Holiday staffing at the hospital may also be to blame, he said, citing statistics from Level 1 trauma centers. \\"For those deaths, the spike was even sharper,\\" Phillips said. \\"Those are the cases where seconds make a difference and you may see a real difference between the response of a junior and senior member of staff.\\" He said he hopes his research could help hospitals and patients plan accordingly. If the worst does happen, resources are available. For instance, Stephanie Kohler, family services coordinator at the nonprofit Lory's Place in St. Joseph, Michigan, said she and her staff are prepared to help families find a healthy way to deal with grief over the loss of a loved one. \\"We want to make sure we are ready for any phone calls to make sure people are all right in their grief,\\" Kohler said. \\"The holidays definitely are a harder time of year for people when this happens, especially since they are such a time steeped in tradition and family.\\" If you know someone who loses a loved one over the holiday, Kohler said be sure to be extra sensitive to their emotions. \\"Everything can feel upside down for people. There are emotional landmines everywhere, so don't try to force anything,\\" Kohler said. \\"You don't need to fill the air with words. Tell them you are ready to listen. That can be more powerful than you know.\\" Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The article discusses an observed trend of increased deaths during Christmas, the day after Christmas, and New Year's Day. The lead author of several studies on this spike in deaths is David P. Phillips, a professor in the sociology department at UC San Diego. These studies reveal a rise in deaths occurring in emergency settings during these holidays, particularly in the five most common disease groups, though the trend is not observed among children. Although the exact cause remains unknown, various factors have been investigated, such as stress, environmental conditions, and diet. Phillips suggests that the spike in deaths may be largely driven by restricted access to healthcare during the holidays, as people delay seeking treatment and hospitals may be understaffed. The article emphasizes the importance of being emotionally supportive to those who lose loved ones during this time, as the holiday season can exacerbate grief."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the background: All of these animal behaviors are important. They help the animals get food for energy, make sure their young survive, or ensure that they, themselves, survive. Behaviors that help animals or their young survive, increase the animals’ fitness. Animals with higher fitness have a better chance of passing their genes on to the next generation. If genes control behaviors that increase fitness, the behaviors become more common in the species. This occurs through the process of evolution by natural selection. and the situation: David is a biologist. He was in the African savanna to study different species. Especially, he was interested in two species, rhinos and impalas. He noticed that in response to constant human encroachment of wildlife habitats, impalas have acquired some behaviors that help them and their young.

A: A:","completion":"A crow that becomes used to a scarecrow and lands on it is an example of habituation. Habituation is a process of learning in which an organism gradually reduces its response to a repeated or unchanging stimulus over time. In this case, the crows initially perceived the scarecrow as a threat since it resembled a human figure. However, after repeated exposure to the scarecrow and realizing that it poses no danger, the crows became less responsive and less afraid of it. Over time, they learned to ignore the scarecrow and adapted their behavior, ultimately allowing them to land on it without fear.

Please answer the following question: What happens to kids when visiting museums of old dinosaur bones? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - crowding - retrospection - amazement - being bored - excited Answer:","completion":"Amazement When children visit museums that house old dinosaur bones, they often experience a strong sense of amazement and wonder. This reaction is particularly understandable given the sheer size and age of the dinosaur fossils on display. For many young people, this may be their first encounter with such ancient and fascinating creatures, making the experience all the more memorable and captivating. There are a variety of reasons why children are particularly amazed by old dinosaur bones and related exhibits in museums: 1. Imagination: Children possess vivid imaginations, and seeing dinosaur fossils can easily ignite their curiosity and transport them to a prehistoric world filled with intriguing animals. This imaginative journey can inspire kids to learn more about dinosaurs, paleontology, and other scientific disciplines. 2. Size: Many dinosaur species were incredibly large, dwarfing most modern-day animals. Encountering a massive dinosaur skeleton can understandably evoke a sense of awe and fascination in kids, as they try to grasp just how enormous these creatures once were. 3. Mystery: The fact that dinosaurs roamed the Earth millions of years ago, long before humans appeared on the scene, adds an element of mystique to these ancient beasts. Children are drawn to the mystery surrounding dinosaurs and their lives, making it all the more exciting when they get to see fossils of these creatures up close. 4. Connection to Popular Culture: Movies, TV shows, toys, and books about dinosaurs have popularly captured the attention of children across generations. When visiting museums displaying dinosaur bones, kids can make connections between the fossils they see before them and the fictionalized portrayals of these creatures in popular culture. This can further fuel their amazement and excitement. 5. Interactive Exhibits: Many museums now offer interactive exhibits that help bring the prehistoric world to life for kids. These exhibits may include computer simulations, animatronic displays, and replica dinosaur skin that children can touch and examine. These engaging elements can greatly enhance kids' sense of amazement when visiting museums of old dinosaur bones. In conclusion, the most suitable answer to the question of what happens to kids when visiting museums of old dinosaur bones is that they often experience a sense of amazement. This is due to their imaginations, the size and mystery of the creatures, connections to popular culture, and the interactive exhibits that many museums offer. While some children may occasionally feel bored or crowded during these visits, the majority find the exploration of the prehistoric world to be an awe-inspiring and memorable experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Francis \\"Frank\\" Hague, born in Jersey City, was the fourth of eight children to John D. and Margaret Hague (nee Fagen), immigrants from County Cavan, Ireland. He was raised in Jersey City's Second ward, an area known as The Horseshoe due to its shape which wrapped around a railroad loop. The ward was created when the Republican-controlled legislature gerrymandered a district within Jersey City in 1871 to concentrate and isolate Democratic, and mostly Catholic, votes. By age 14, Hague was expelled from school prior to completing the sixth grade for poor attendance and unacceptable behavior. Hague's use of voter fraud is the stuff of legend. In 1937, for instance, Jersey City had 160,050 registered voters, but only 147,000 people who were at least 21 years old--the legal voting age. In 1932, Governor Moore appointed a lawyer named Thomas J. Brogan, who had served as Hague's personal attorney in corruption hearings, to an associate Justice seat on the state's Supreme Court. Less than a year later Brogan was named as Chief Justice. In at least two instances of alleged voting fraud in the 1930s (Ferguson v. Brogan, 112 N.J.L. 471; Clee v. Moore, 119 N.J.L. 215; In re Clee, 119 N.J.L. 310), Brogan's court issued extraordinary rulings in favor of the Democratic machine, in one case asserting that the district superintendent of elections had no authority to open ballot boxes, and in another case ruling that the boxes could be opened, but no one had the right to look inside. Brogan also assigned himself to the Hudson County jurisdiction, thereby controlling the local grand jury process and squelching other election fraud cases. Although Hague, like other political bosses of the time, was not above outright fraud at the polls, the keys to Hague's success were his matchless organizational skills and demand for complete loyalty from his subordinates. His command over the Democratic voters of Hudson County, a densely populated urban area in a state that was still mostly rural, made him a man to reckon with among state Democrats and Republicans alike. He was a close friend of Al Smith, the New York governor who would become the first Irish-American presidential candidate in 1928. In addition, Hague's support of Roosevelt for President was rewarded with a steady stream of perks that sustained Hague's organization throughout the Depression.","completion":"This text is about Francis \\"Frank\\" Hague, a political figure from Jersey City."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Of approximately 100 million native speakers of German in the world, roughly 80 million consider themselves Germans.[citation needed] There are an additional 80 million people of German ancestry mainly in the United States, Brazil (mainly in the South Region of the country), Argentina, Canada, South Africa, the post-Soviet states (mainly in Russia and Kazakhstan), and France, each accounting for at least 1 million.[note 2] Thus, the total number of Germans lies somewhere between 100 and more than 150 million, depending on the criteria applied (native speakers, single-ancestry ethnic Germans, partial German ancestry, etc.). Conflict between the Germanic tribes and the forces of Rome under Julius Caesar forced major Germanic tribes to retreat to the east bank of the Rhine. Roman emperor Augustus in 12 BC ordered the conquest of the Germans, but the catastrophic Roman defeat at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest resulted in the Roman Empire abandoning its plans to completely conquer Germany. Germanic peoples in Roman territory were culturally Romanized, and although much of Germany remained free of direct Roman rule, Rome deeply influenced the development of German society, especially the adoption of Christianity by the Germans who obtained it from the Romans. In Roman-held territories with Germanic populations, the Germanic and Roman peoples intermarried, and Roman, Germanic, and Christian traditions intermingled. The adoption of Christianity would later become a major influence in the development of a common German identity. 1. Who did the Germanic tribe fight? 2. Who was their leader? 3.

For these animals, being able to communicate is essential. Communicating increases the ability of group members to cooperate and avoid conflict. Communication may help animals work together to find food and defend themselves from predators. It also helps them find mates and care for their offspring. In addition, communication helps adult animals teach the next generation learned behaviors. Therefore, communication generally improves the chances of animals surviving and reproducing. Paragraph: Manny and Dean were two classmates. They had to prepare for a school project so they decided to learn about animals. Manny studied animal communication, while Dean studied animal feeding patterns and nutrition. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which student learned more about animals that live in social groups? The answer is:","completion":"Manny learned more about animals that live in social groups. This is because he studied animal communication, which is essential for animals living in social groups. Communication among these animals allows them to cooperate and avoid conflict.

Consequently, communication enhances the chances of survival and reproduction for animals living in social groups. On the other hand, Dean studied animal feeding patterns and nutrition. While this information is important and interesting, it does not specifically focus on animals living in social groups. Animal feeding patterns and nutrition can be applicable to both solitary and social animals, and may not necessarily provide insights into the unique behavioral and survival dynamics present among animals living in social groups.

Cook the garlic in the oil until it's golden. Remove the garlic from the pan, and use or store it.\\"","completion":"Title: Golden Garlic Goodness: Transforming Ordinary Cloves into Flavorful Enhancements Introduction: Garlic, a beloved ingredient found in various recipes, has virtually unparalleled potential to transform a dish from ordinary to extraordinary. This humble yet potent bulb, native to central Asia and northeastern Iran, is now enjoyed worldwide for both its health benefits and exceptional flavors. In this article, we will uncover the process of \\"smashing and peeling garlic cloves\\" and share a delightful way to prepare them in a golden, aromatic, and delicious form that can elevate any meal. The Process: Smash and Peel the Garlic Cloves 1. Choose the right tools: Before you begin, gather the necessary tools for this process. You'll need a cutting board, a wide-blade knife (such as a chef's knife), and a bowl for the peeled cloves. 2. Smash the cloves: Place a single garlic clove on your cutting board. Lay the flat side of your knife on top of the clove, applying slight pressure to hold it in place. Using the heel of your hand, press down firmly on the blade, smashing the clove. This not only loosens the garlic skin but also releases its flavorful oils. 3. Peel the cloves: After smashing the clove, the skin should easily peel away. Discard the skin, and place the smashed garlic in a separate bowl. Repeat the process with all the remaining cloves. Cooking the Garlic to Golden Perfection 1. Gather ingredients: Aside from your smashed and peeled garlic cloves, you'll need some olive oil—a healthy oil that enhances the flavors of your garlic. A high-quality extra-virgin olive oil would be ideal. Also, be sure to have a skillet, a slotted spoon, and your chosen storage or serving dish ready. 2. Heat the olive oil: Place the skillet on your stovetop and set to a medium-low heat. Allow the oil to heat up, but not to the point where it starts smoking. This step is essential since you want to cook the garlic slowly and gently to avoid burning it, which can introduce a bitter taste. 3. Cook the garlic: Once the oil is heated, carefully add your smashed and peeled garlic cloves to the skillet. Stir them occasionally to ensure even cooking. Remember to maintain the medium-low heat setting so that the garlic simmers gently in the olive oil. 4. Monitor color and texture: The key to perfectly cooked golden garlic cloves is essential to keep an eye on their color and texture. Watch as the cloves slowly take on a golden hue, which may take around 10-15 minutes. When the garlic approaches a perfect golden-brown color, remove it from the skillet immediately. 5. Remove the garlic: Using a slotted spoon, carefully remove the golden-brown garlic cloves from the skillet, allowing excess oil to drip back into the pan. Place the garlic on a paper towel to remove any residual oil while it cools. 6. Use or store the garlic: From here, you can serve the garlic immediately, incorporating it into a dish to add a rich, savory flavor. Alternatively, store the cooled cloves in an airtight container in the refrigerator for later use. Conclusion: By mastering the art of smashing, peeling, and cooking garlic cloves, you can bring the enticing fragrance and flavor of golden garlic to a wide range of dishes. Impress your family and friends with your culinary skills, and enjoy the rich taste of golden-brown garlic cloves as you enhance your meals with nature's very own gift to the gastronomic world. A seemingly simple task, this technique can elevate your home cooking experience to new heights of deliciousness."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

French: \\"Empêcher les remontées capillaires en isolant la forme du support ou du mortier de pose des couches sous jacentes, en interposant un film plastique imperméable relevé au pourtour du dallage.\\" English: \\"Prevent capillary rise by isolating the shape of the support or the laying mortar from the underlying layers, by interposing a waterproof plastic film raised around the perimeter of the slab.\\" Here's the step-by-step breakdown of my translation as well as justifications: 1. \\"Empêcher les remontées capillaires\\" is translated as \\"Prevent capillary rise\\". 'Empêcher' translates to 'prevent' in English. 'Les remontées capillaires' is a specific term in building and construction and translates to 'capillary rise'. 2. \\"en isolant la forme du support ou du mortier de pose\\" is translated as \\"by isolating the shape of the support or the laying mortar\\". 'Isolant' translates to 'isolating', 'la forme' to 'the shape', 'du support' to 'of the support', 'ou' to 'or', 'du mortier de pose' to 'of the laying mortar'. 3. \\"des couches sous jacentes\\" is translated as \\"from the underlying layers\\". 'Couches' translates to 'layers' and 'sous jacentes' to 'underlying'. 4. \\"en interposant un film plastique imperméable relevé au pourtour du dallage\\" is translated as \\"by interposing a waterproof plastic film raised around the perimeter of the slab\\". 'Interposant' translates to 'interposing', 'un film plastique imperméable' to 'a waterproof plastic film', 'relevé au pourtour' to 'raised around' and 'du dallage' to 'the slab'. When trying to achieve an accurate translation, it's important to not only translate each word, but to ensure that the overall sentence makes sense and maintains the same tone and meaning as the original. For technical terms, it's important to ensure that the equivalent term is used in the target language. Context is also very important in providing an accurate translation as some words can have different meanings depending on their context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After the 1998 embassy bombings, the U.S. government tried to develop a clearer picture of Bin Laden's finances. A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (August 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) is a comedian of a satirical talk show who is able to tap into people's frustrations with the sharply divided, special interest-driven political climate. Specifically, he makes fun of the American two-party system. During his warm-up act, an audience member suggests that he run for president. At first, Dobbs laughs off the idea, but following a popular groundswell of support, later announces on the air that he will stand as a candidate. Through his efforts, he gets on the ballot in 13 states and participates in one of the national debates with the Democratic incumbent, President Kellogg, and Republican U.S. Senator Mills. A parallel plot follows Eleanor Green (Laura Linney), who works at a voting machine company in California called Delacroy. According to a television commercial in the movie, the entire United States will be using Delacroy voting machines for the Presidential election. Shortly before the elections, Eleanor notices that the voting system does not work correctly and alerts the head of the company, James Hemmings (Rick Roberts) via e-mail. Initially, Dobbs approaches the campaign seriously â perhaps too seriously, to the chagrin of his staff, especially his manager Jack Menken (Christopher Walken). That turns around the night of the presidential debates, when, fed up with the other candidates' posturing, Dobbs shifts back into comedian mode, managing to keep the audience laughing and make serious points simultaneously. From then on, he resumes his showman persona, thoroughly shaking up the political landscape. Dobbs surges in polls after the debates, but remains a distant third to Kellogg and Mills. Election Day arrives, and polls show Dobbs at 17% with Kellogg and Mills tied in the 40s. Early returns show Kellogg beating Mills everywhere. Eleanor says...

A:","completion":"To examine the perturbation hypothesis, let's go over the steps in the process and evaluate the potential impact of stored seeds on the process and the production of more vegetables. 1. Get some seeds - If seeds are stored, availability and access to seeds can be quicker, allowing for a larger variety of vegetables in a shorter amount of time. 2. Pick a spot to plant them - The stored seeds would not necessarily have a direct impact on choosing the planting location. However, users may have a wider range of seeds to choose from, prompting them to select spots ideal for the preferred vegetable type. 3. Dig a hole in the dirt - The stored seeds would not have a direct impact on this step. 4. Put the seed in the hole - The stored seeds could be in better condition, leading to a higher germination rate and potentially more successful plants. 5.

Title: The Nutty Professor Movie plot: At Wellman College, thousands of hamsters overrun the campus, due to the massively obese, yet loving and kind-hearted, professor Sherman Klump, who accidentally releases them. Meanwhile, Sherman has created an experimental formula that reconstructs the DNA of an obese person in a way that allows them to lose weight more easily. After class, Sherman meets and instantly falls in love with Carla Purty, a chemistry graduate student who is a big fan of his work. After dinner with his obese, impolite family, Sherman asks Carla out on a date, which she accepts, much to Sherman's surprise. The date begins well with Carla showing admiration for Sherman's work, but the club's obnoxious comic Reggie Warrington publicly humiliates him about his weight. Sherman becomes depressed and has a nightmare in which he becomes a rampaging giant and wrecks the city with a single fart that is ignited to cause an explosion. He tests his serum on himself and loses 300 pounds in seconds. Overwhelmed by his thinness, he goes out and buys copious amounts of normal-sized clothing to celebrate, and a 47,000 Viper sports car on his faculty expense account. To conceal his true identity, Sherman adopts a fake name, \\"Buddy Love\\", and invites Carla out on a date at the same club again (while the serum begins to wear off). Reggie is present again and Buddy takes revenge and heckles him mercilessly. Sherman's \\"Buddy\\" persona starts to develop an independent personality due to the heightened testosterone levels of the transformation, causing him to be overly assertive and confident. Klump's assistant Jason witnesses Buddy fleeing the scene after he is identified as the person who left Klump's credit card on the bar. Jason follows Buddy and witnesses the transformation back into Klump. The next morning, Dean Richmond has set up a meeting with wealthy Harlan Hartley at The Ritz to have Sherman explain the serum in the hopes of gaining Hartley's 10 million donation to the science department.

Their primary motivation stems from their belief that these stolen items should be returned to the individuals or nations they were originally taken from. Peter's gang consists of talented individuals from different walks of life. The team includes a talented hacker named Amy, an expert in forging documents and skilled lock picker named Alex, a seasoned martial artist named Diana, and a surprisingly swift driver named Tom. One fateful day, mysterious art collector Jean-Paul approaches Peter offering an immense sum of money and a thrilling challenge: to recover the legendary \\"Siren's Lament,\\" a mythical golden harp said to have the power to grant whoever stole it the ability to manipulate the world around them. The harp is hidden in an impenetrable fortress on a remote island, protected by a high-tech security system. Believing in the harp's power and lured by the challenge, Peter and his gang set out on their most daring heist yet, unaware that Jean-Paul is part of a secret organization known as the Syndicate, which hunts for ancient artifacts to use for their own nefarious purposes. Through a series of intricate and suspense-filled missions, the gang successfully infiltrates the fortress, outwits the security system, and recovers the Siren's Lament. However, during the escape, they are ambushed by the Syndicate, and a fierce battle ensues. Amidst the chaos, Peter sacrifices himself to save his team by diverting the Syndicate agents' attention, allowing the rest of his gang to flee to safety. Horrified by Peter's death, the team vows revenge against Jean-Paul and the Syndicate. As the team returns to Triton, driven by the memory of their fallen leader, they reveal Jean-Paul's ulterior motives to the world and expose the Syndicate's corrupt operations. They dedicate their lives to continuing Peter's legacy, recovering stolen artifacts, and dismantling the Syndicate once and for all. \\"Shadow of Regret\\" is a thrilling tale of sacrifice, redemption, and the pursuit of justice. It showcases the resilience of human spirit and friends coming together to right the wrongs of the past in the face of tragedy. The death of Peter during the escape adds a bittersweet element to the overall story as the surviving members avenge their leader, unite against a common enemy, and embark on a race against time to prevent the Syndicate from seizing control over the world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I can use this background: The quantity of small plastic fragments floating in the north-east Pacific Ocean increased a hundredfold between 1972 and 2012.Marine pollution is a generic term for the harmful entry into the ocean of chemicals or particles. The main culprits are those using the rivers for disposing of their waste. The rivers then empty into the ocean, often also bringing chemicals used as fertilizers in agriculture. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals in the water leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, also known as marine litter, is human-created waste that has ended up floating in a lake, sea, ocean, or waterway. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.In addition, the Pacific Ocean has served as the crash site of satellites, including Mars 96, Fobos-Grunt, and Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite. Now, I have a new situation: Ecuador and Panama both had beautiful rivers flowing into the Pacific ocean. Ecuador uses their river to dispose of their waste while Panama is very eco-friendly and doesn't do that. Answer this question please: Which country causes more dead zones in the ocean?","completion":"To answer the question, let's analyze the situation step-by-step: 1. Ecuador uses their river to dispose of their waste. This means that chemicals, particles, and human-created waste are entering the river, which ultimately flows into the Pacific Ocean. This leads to marine pollution and can cause hypoxia, creating dead zones. 2. Panama has a beautiful river flowing into the Pacific Ocean as well, but they are eco-friendly and do not use the river to dispose of their waste. This means that their river is likely contributing less pollution and fewer chemicals to the ocean. 3. The main cause of dead zones in the ocean, as mentioned in the background information, is the excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals in the water. Ecuador, by using the river to dispose of their waste and likely releasing more chemicals into the ocean, has a higher potential to cause dead zones. Based on this analysis and the provided information, it can be concluded that Ecuador is likely causing more dead zones in the ocean than Panama due to their practice of disposing of waste in the river that ultimately flows into the Pacific Ocean."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The southern state of Alabama is the center of the U.S. political universe this week as voters on Tuesday choose a senator to replace Jeff Sessions, who left the Senate to become attorney general. The race pits controversial Republican Roy Moore, who is battling sexual harassment allegations, against Democrat Doug Jones, a former prosecutor. The outcome of the race could have national implications for both political parties and for President Donald Trump. Moore has denied several allegations of sexual misconduct when he was in his 30s involving women who were teenagers at the time, including one who was 14. \\"I do not know them. I had no encounter with them. I never molested anyone,\\" Moore said in a televised interview Sunday with the Voice of Alabama Politics. Jones says the accusations make Moore unfit to serve in the Senate. \\"It is crystal clear that these women are telling the truth and Roy Moore is not!\\" Jones said. Trump recorded a get-out-the-vote phone message for Moore and spoke on his behalf at a rally in neighboring Florida on Friday. \\"And we want jobs, jobs, jobs. So get out and vote for Roy Moore.

Trump held off on endorsing Moore for several weeks in the wake of the sexual misconduct allegations, but now says electing Moore is a priority for him. \\"We certainly don't want to have a liberal Democrat who is controlled by Nancy Pelosi and controlled by Chuck Schumer.

However, the men find the diamonds have already been stolen by someone else (Drake). Drake is a sort of modern-day Robin Hood. He donates the proceeds of his latest robbery to fund the stalled construction of the \\"New Social Institute\\". He even writes a book, \\"Crackerjack\\": The true story of my exploits., which becomes a bestseller. Everybody is reading it, including the people at Scotland Yard and Baroness Von Haltz, and wondering if it is fact or fiction. The baroness tells her maid Annie that certain passages somehow remind her of Drake, who broke her heart. By coincidence, she is residing in the same hotel as Drake. He goes to see her, but she does not forgive him for leaving her without a word in Berlin. He explains that he was forced to leave suddenly, but she is not mollified. Meanwhile, Drake instructs Burdge, his secretary, to send a cheque for £10,000 to the Buckingham Hospital for a new wing, even though Burdge informs him he is overdrawn at the bank. Drake tells him that the wealthy Mrs. Humbold's pearls will provide ample funds. The Humbolds are hosting a masquerade ball that night, and the baroness will be there. At the ball, part of the entertainment is a group called the \\"Four Gangsters\\", who have been tied up and replaced by a gang of real gangsters, the same thieves from the aeroplane caper. Sculpie, their leader, kills an unarmed man who foolishly tries to resist. Afterward, however, Sculpie is furious to learn that the pearls he took from Mrs. Humbold are fakes. Once again, Drake has the real ones., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"Whose pearls does the man who saves the police superintendent plan to steal?\\" is Mrs. Humbold's pearls."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Some music ensembles consist solely of instruments, such as the jazz quartet or the orchestra. Some music ensembles consist solely of singers, such as choirs and doo wop groups. In both popular music and classical music, there are ensembles in which both instrumentalists and singers perform, such as the rock band or the Baroque chamber group for basso continuo (harpsichord and cello) and one or more singers. In classical music, trios or quartets either blend the sounds of musical instrument families (such as piano, strings, and wind instruments) or group together instruments from the same instrument family, such as string ensembles (e.g., string quartet) or wind ensembles (e.g., wind quintet). Some ensembles blend the sounds of a variety of instrument families, such as the orchestra, which uses a string section, brass instruments, woodwinds and percussion instruments, or the concert band, which uses brass, woodwinds and percussion. - Ishmael Wadada Leo Smith (born December 18, 1941) is an American trumpeter and composer, working primarily in the fields of avant-garde jazz and free improvisation.

A person who plays a clarinet is called a \\"clarinetist\\" (sometimes spelled \\"clarinettist\\"). - Chico Freeman (born Earl Lavon Freeman Jr.; July 17, 1949) is a modern jazz tenor saxophonist and trumpeter and son of jazz saxophonist Von Freeman. He began recording as lead musician in 1976 with \\"Morning Prayer\\", won the New York Jazz Award in 1979 and earned the Stereo Review Record of the Year in 1981 for his album \\"The Outside Within\\". - A pianist is an individual musician who plays the piano. Most forms of Western music can make use of the piano. Consequently, pianists have a wide variety of repertoire and styles to choose from, including traditionally classical music, Jazz, blues and all sorts of popular music, including rock music. Most pianists can, to a certain extent, play other keyboard-related instruments such as the synthesizer, harpsichord, celesta and the organ and keyboard. Perhaps the greatest pianist of all time was Franz Liszt, whose piano mastery was described by Anton Rubinstein: \\"In comparison with Liszt, all other pianists are children\\". - Illinois is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1818. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics. - The Penguin Guide to Jazz is a reference work containing an encyclopedic directory of jazz recordings on CD which are currently available in Europe or the United States. The first nine editions were compiled by Richard Cook and Brian Morton, two well known chroniclers of jazz resident in the United Kingdom. - Thelonious Sphere Monk (October 10, 1917 February 17, 1982) was an American jazz pianist and composer.

Monk is the second most-recorded jazz composer after Duke Ellington, which is particularly remarkable as Ellington composed more than 1,000 pieces, whereas Monk wrote about 70. - African-American music is an umbrella term covering a diverse range of musics and musical genres largely developed by African Americans. Their origins are in musical forms that arose out of the historical condition of slavery that characterized the lives of African Americans prior to the American Civil War. - Henry Threadgill (born February 15, 1944) is a Pulitzer Prize-winning American composer, saxophonist, and flautist, who came to prominence in the 1970s leading ensembles with unusual instrumentation and often incorporating non-jazz genres. - Improvisation is broad term referring to the process of devising an atypical method of solving a problem due to lack of time or resources. In a technical context, this can mean adapting a device for some use other than that which it was designed for, or building a device from unusual components in an ad-hoc fashion. Improvisation, within the context of performing arts, is a very spontaneous performance without specific or scripted preparation. The skills of improvisation can apply to many different faculties, across all artistic, scientific, physical, cognitive, academic, and non-academic disciplines. - Ragtime also spelled rag-time or rag time is a musical genre that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \\"ragged\\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called \\"LA Pas Ma LA\\" and it was released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term \\"ragtime\\". The term is actually derived from his hometown \\"Shake Rag\\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns. - John William Coltrane, also known as \\"Trane\\" (September 23, 1926 July 17, 1967), was an American jazz saxophonist and composer. Working in the bebop and hard bop idioms early in his career, Coltrane helped pioneer the use of modes in jazz and was later at the forefront of free jazz. He led at least fifty recording sessions during his career, and appeared as a sideman on many albums by other musicians, including trumpeter Miles Davis and pianist Thelonious Monk. - Roscoe Mitchell (born August 3, 1940 in Chicago, Illinois) is an American composer, jazz instrumentalist, and educator, known for being \\"a technically superb if idiosyncratic saxophonist.\\" \\"The Penguin Guide to Jazz\\" described him as \\"one of the key figures\\" in avant-garde jazz; All About Jazz states that he has been \\"at the forefront of modern music\\" for the past 35 years. Critic John Pareles in \\"The New York Times\\" has mentioned that Mitchell \\"qualifies as an iconoclast.\\" In addition to his own work as a bandleader, Mitchell is known for cofounding the Art Ensemble of Chicago and the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM). - The saxophone (also referred to as the sax) is a family of woodwind instruments. Saxophones are usually made of brass and played with a single-reed mouthpiece similar to that of the clarinet. The saxophone family was invented by the Belgian instrument maker Adolphe Sax in 1840. Adolphe Sax wanted to create a group or series of instruments that would be the most powerful and vocal of the woodwinds, and the most adaptive of the brass instruments, that would fill the vacant middle ground between the two sections. He patented the saxophone on June 28, 1846, in two groups of seven instruments each. Each series consisted of instruments of various sizes in alternating transposition. The series pitched in B and E, designed for military bands, have proved extremely popular and most saxophones encountered today are from this series. Instruments from the so-called \\"orchestral\\" series, pitched in C and F, never gained a foothold, and the B and E instruments have now replaced the C and F instruments when the saxophone is used in an orchestra. - Muhal Richard Abrams (born September 19, 1930, in Chicago, Illinois) is an American educator, administrator, composer, arranger, clarinetist, cellist, and jazz pianist in the free jazz medium. - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America. With over 2.7 million residents, it is the most populous city in the state of Illinois and the Midwestern United States, and the county seat of Cook County. The Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland, has nearly 10 million people and is the third-largest in the U.S. - Jack DeJohnette (born August 9, 1942) is an American jazz drummer, pianist, and composer. - Lester Bowie (October 11, 1941 November 8, 1999) was an American jazz trumpet player and composer. He was a member of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians and cofounded the Art Ensemble of Chicago. - The avant-garde (from French, \\"advance guard\\" or \\"vanguard\\", literally \\"fore-guard\\") are people or works that are experimental, radical, or unorthodox, with respect to art, culture, and society. It may be characterized by nontraditional, aesthetic innovation and initial unacceptability, and it may offer a critique of the relationship between producer and consumer. - The Moers Festival is an international jazz festival in Moers, Germany, happening yearly every Whitsun. - The Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) is a non-profit organization, founded in Chicago, Illinois, United States, by pianist/composer Muhal Richard Abrams, pianist Jodie Christian, drummer Steve McCall, and composer Phil Cohran. Early members included Henry Threadgill, Anthony Braxton, Jack DeJohnette, Wadada Leo Smith, Leroy Jenkins, Amina Claudine Myers, Adegoke Steve Colson, Chico Freeman, George Lewis and the Art Ensemble of Chicago: Lester Bowie, Roscoe Mitchell, Joseph Jarman, Famoudou Don Moye, and Malachi Favors. The AACM is devoted \\"to nurturing, performing, and recording serious, original music,\\" according to its charter. It supports and encourages jazz performers, composers and educators. While founded in the Jazz tradition, the groups outreach and influence has, according to Larry Blumenfeld, \\"touched nearly all corners of modern music.\\" - A trumpet is a musical instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles. The trumpet group contains the instruments with the highest register in the brass family. Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signaling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to at least 1500 BC; they began to be used as musical instruments only in the late-14th or early 15th century. Trumpets are used in art music styles, for instance in orchestras, concert bands, and jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music. They are played by blowing air through almost-closed lips (called the player's embouchure), producing a \\"buzzing\\" sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument. Since the late 15th century they have primarily been constructed of brass tubing, usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape. - Kelan Phil Cohran (born in Oxford, Mississippi on May 8, 1927) is a jazz musician. He is known most for his trumpet contributions in the Sun Ra Arkestra in Chicago during 1959-1961 and for his involvement in the foundation of the AACM. - New Orleans (or ) is a major United States port and the largest city and metropolitan area in the state of Louisiana. The population of the city was 343,829 as of the 2010 U.S. Census. The New Orleans metropolitan area (New OrleansMetairieKenner Metropolitan Statistical Area) had a population of 1,167,764 in 2010 and was the 46th largest in the United States. The New OrleansMetairieBogalusa Combined Statistical Area, a larger trading area, had a 2010 population of 1,452,502. - Free jazz is an approach to jazz music that was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s as musicians attempted to alter, extend, or break down jazz convention, often by discarding fixed chord changes or tempos. Though the music of free jazz composers varied widely, a common feature was dissatisfaction with the limitations of bebop, hard bop, and modal jazz that had developed in the 1940s and 1950s. Often described as avant-garde, free jazz has also been described as an attempt to return jazz to its primitive, often religious, roots and emphasis on collective improvisation. - A rhythm section (also called a backup band) is a group of musicians within a music ensemble or band who provide the underlying rhythm and pulse of the accompaniment, providing a rhythmic reference and \\"beat\\" for the rest of the band. Many of the rhythm section instruments, such as keyboard instruments and guitars, are also used to play the chord progression upon which the song is based. The bass instrument (either double bass or electric bass, or another low-register instrument, such as synth bass, depending on the group and its style of music) plays the low-pitched bassline that supports the chord progression, typically by emphasizing the roots of the chords (and to a lesser degree the fifths and thirds of the chords). - Joseph Jarman (born September 14, 1937 in Pine Bluff, Arkansas), is a jazz musician, composer, and Shinshu Buddhist priest. He was one of the first members of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians and a member of the Art Ensemble of Chicago. - A big band is a type of musical ensemble associated with playing jazz music and which became popular during the Swing Era from the early 1930s until the late 1940s. Big Bands evolved with the times and continue to today. A big band typically consists of approximately 12 to 25 musicians and contains saxophones, trumpets, trombones, and a rhythm section. The terms jazz band, jazz ensemble, stage band, jazz orchestra, and dance band are also used to refer to this type of ensemble. This does not, however, mean that each one of these names is technically correct for naming a \\"big band\\" specifically. - Eric Allan Dolphy, Jr. (June 20, 1928 June 29, 1964) was an American jazz alto saxophonist, flautist, and bass clarinetist. On a few occasions, he also played the clarinet and piccolo. Dolphy was one of several multi-instrumentalists to gain prominence in the 1960s. He was one of the first important bass clarinet soloists in jazz, extended the vocabulary and boundaries of the alto saxophone, and was among the earliest significant jazz flute soloists. - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Miles Dewey Davis III (May 26, 1926September 28, 1991) was an American jazz trumpeter, bandleader, and composer. He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and 20th century music. With his ever-changing directions in music, Davis was at the forefront of a number of major stylistic developments in jazz over his five-decade career. - The piccolo (Italian for \\"small\\", but named \\"ottavino\\" in Italy) is a half-size flute, and a member of the woodwind family of musical instruments. The modern piccolo has most of the same fingerings as its larger sibling, the standard transverse flute, but the sound it produces is an octave higher than written. This gave rise to the name \\"ottavino\\" (Italian for \\"little octave\\"), the name by which the instrument is referred to in the scores of Italian composers. Piccolos are now only manufactured in the key of C ; however, they were once also available in D. It was for this D piccolo that John Philip Sousa wrote the famous solo in the final repeat of the closing section (trio) of his march \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\". - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Whitsun (also Whitsunday, Whit Sunday or Whit) is the name used in Britain and Ireland, and among Anglicans throughout the world, for the Christian festival of Pentecost, the seventh Sunday after Easter, which commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Christ's disciples (Acts of the Apostles chapter 2). In England it took on some characteristics of Beltane, which originated from the pagan celebration of Summer's Day, the beginning of the summer half-year, in Europe. Whitsuntide, the week following Whitsunday, was one of three vacation weeks for the medieval villein; on most manors he was free from service on the lord's demesne this week, which marked a pause in the agricultural year. Whit Monday, the day after Whitsun, remained a holiday in the UK until 1978 when the movable holiday was replaced with the fixed Spring Bank Holiday in late May. Whit was the occasion for varied forms of celebration. In the North West of England, church and chapel parades called Whit Walks still take place at this time (sometimes on Whit Friday, the Friday after Whitsun). Typically, the parades include brass bands and choirs; girls attending are dressed in white. Traditionally, Whit fairs (sometimes called Whitsun ales) took place. Other customs such as Morris dancing were associated with Whitsun, although in most cases they have been transferred to the Spring bank holiday. Whaddon, Cambridgeshire has its own Whitsun tradition of singing a unique song around the village before and on Whit Sunday itself.

The controversy surrounding Dr. Martin's book stems from the detailed, on-the-ground revelations and criticisms regarding the United Kingdom's forces and strategy in Afghanistan. As one who immersed himself in the Afghan culture and communicated directly with key players involved in the conflict, Martin's perspective is both rare and valuable, offering readers a rare glimpse into the realities of war, strategy, and diplomacy. In a time where the Afghan conflict remains a critical political and military issue, it is surprising to many that the Ministry of Defence chose to pull its support from the work. The decision to distance itself from Martin's book may raise questions about the institution's priority towards transparency and information sharing. Intriguingly, it may also inadvertently draw more public attention to the very book it sought to suppress. The fact that Dr. Mike Martin felt 'forced to resign' from the Army following the severe institutional backlash over his book is cause for concern, at least for some. It prompts a discourse around the limitations of information exchange imposed upon soldiers, and whether these restrictions serve the larger purpose of national security or merely obscure central truths from the public eye. Beyond the controversial nature of its contents, Martin's book has attracted the attention of a retired British general, who expressed his deep appreciation for the work. This high-ranking endorsement echoes the profound impact and value that this revealing, and perhaps controversial, book could have had on the handling of the conflict. With an insider's perspective on the Afghan situation and unique fluency in Pushtu, Martin's book could have provided operational insights and strategic guidance for commanders overseeing the Afghan conflict. In conclusion, Dr. Mike Martin's controversial book has sparked debate, not just because of its content and withdrawn support from the Ministry of Defence, but also due to the consequences the author faced as a result of its publication. The contribution and perspective brought about by Martin's work should not be discounted, as broader questions emerge surrounding the policies and motives behind the suppression of crucial insights into war and the lives of those directly and indirectly affected by conflict. As the discourse around the book and its implications unfold, one can only hope this will spark a further examination into the transparency and information exchange within military institutions and society at large."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:I can use this background: The balls used in squash are small rubber balls that can differ in terms of diameter, weight and softness. These features determine the speed and bouncing amplitude of the ball, with softer balls being generally slower than the harder balls. The temperature of the ball also affects the amount of bounce: the warmer the ball, the more it bounces.[3] Because cold squash balls have little bounce, the squash balls are hit multiple times at the beginning of a game to warm them up. It also means that a game becomes gradually faster as it advances and that softer balls may be too slow to be used in colder climates.[4] Now, I have a new situation: Thomas and Joseph, two experienced squash players, are having a disagreement about which types of squash balls they should use in their match. Both have different preferences for the type of ball used. Joseph prefers a ball that bounces less and travels more slowly. Thomas, on the other hand, prefers a ball that travels more quickly and bounces more. Answer this question please: Which player enjoys the speed of game less as it progresses? A:","completion":"Joseph is the player who enjoys the speed of the game less as it progresses. Since Joseph prefers a ball that bounces less and travels more slowly, he might find the game becomes too fast for his liking when the ball warms up and bounces more. On the other hand, Thomas prefers a ball that travels more quickly and bounces more, so he would likely enjoy the increasing speed of the game as the squash ball gets warmer and bouncier."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: At the end of the Proterozoic, the supercontinent Pannotia had broken apart into the smaller continents Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia and Gondwana. During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416–359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana. I am facing a new situation today: Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets. Given that these planets have no names, the explorers decide to name them after themselves. The planet of Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift. Many of the continents on the planet are currently breaking apart and moving. Timon, however, has been a stable planet with no continental moving for quite awhile now. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Is the volcanic crust on Sarahn or Timon hotter? Answer:","completion":"The volcanic crust on Sarahn is likely hotter. Since many of the continents on Sarahn are currently breaking apart and moving, more oceanic crust is being formed by volcanic activity. As mentioned in the background article, young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust. This would suggest that the volcanic crust on Sarahn would be hotter compared to Timon, which has been a stable planet with no continental moving for quite some time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: (Updated: FBI identifies man involved in deadly incident at NSA security gate) The overnight tryst began in Baltimore, with three men, two dressed as women. It continued at a motel on U.S. 1, and when one of the men woke up Monday morning, his two cross-dressing companions, and his Ford Escape, were gone. The dark-colored Escape was headed south on the Baltimore-Washington Parkway. Its driver, in what authorities believe could have been a mistake, took a restricted exit leading to a security post at the sprawling campus of the National Security Agency at Fort Meade, Md. An NSA statement said the driver ignored police commands to stop and instead accelerated toward a police vehicle as at least one officer opened fire. The stolen SUV crashed into the cruiser. One man died at the scene, and the other was taken to a hospital for treatment. An NSA officer also was injured, though officials did not say how. What had first appeared to be an attempt to breach security at the listening post that eavesdrops on communications throughout the world now appears to be a wrong turn by two men who police believe had robbed their companion of his vehicle and perhaps didn’t stop because there were drugs inside. 1 of 8 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × 1 person fatally shot after car rams gate at NSA View Photos Officers at the agency’s headquarters in Maryland fired on the two people in the vehicle. At least one other person was injured in the incident, which officials said does not appear to be an act of terrorism. Caption Officers at the agency’s headquarters in Maryland fired on the two people in the vehicle. At least one other person was injured. March 30, 2015 Officers are seen at the gate to Fort Meade in Maryland. Authorities released no details of what happened, but law officials said police officers with the National Security Agency shot at the two people in the vehicle. One of them was killed, the officials said. WJLA-TV via AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. A spokeswoman for the Baltimore office of the FBI, Amy J. Thoreson, said early in the investigation that authorities “do not believe [the incident] is related to terrorism.” A law enforcement official said: “This was not a deliberate attempt to breach the security of NSA. This was not a planned attack.” Police have not released the identities of the people involved, or the conditions of the man who survived the incident and the injured NSA officer. The NSA statement did not say whether either person in the car was struck by gunfire or was injured as a result of the crash. Details about how the incident began were pieced together with information from several law enforcement officials and others familiar with the case, who spoke on the condition they not be named in order to discuss a pending case. A Howard County police spokeswoman confirmed that the men involved stayed at a Jessup motel and that the owner of the SUV called police Monday morning to report it stolen. Police officials said late Monday afternoon that they were still trying to piece together the sequence of events and locations. One official said it appears that the owner of the SUV picked up the other two men in Baltimore, though the official said detectives had not confirmed that account entirely. The police officials said the three men checked into the motel room and stayed the night. Mary Phelan, a spokeswoman for the Howard police, confirmed that the SUV stolen from the motel was the vehicle that ended up at the NSA checkpoint. Officials said they are trying to sort through the vehicle owner’s statement; it was unclear whether the person injured in the incident could be interviewed at the hospital. The encounter at the NSA occurred shortly before 9 a.m., when the vehicle entered the NSA complex in Anne Arundel County and “failed to obey an NSA police officer’s routine instructions for safely exiting the secure campus.” The statement said security barriers were raised. One official said the vehicle struck a security officer and the security barrier. The NSA statement said that the “vehicle accelerated toward an NSA police vehicle blocking the road” and that police “fired at the vehicle.” It then crashed into the police vehicle. Local television cameras showed two vehicles that were damaged near a gate at the military base. Dozens of news media people descended on the NSA campus Monday morning eager for details, but when they arrived, the journalists and their news trucks were corralled to a parking lot blocks away from NSA headquarters with no view of the scene. A line of cameras sat on a hill facing away from the NSA building into the evening because NSA officials told the media they could not take video or photos of the campus. News helicopters buzzed overhead most of the day. Crews from the FBI’s evidence response team were processing the scene, and agents were interviewing witnesses. Deputy White House press secretary Eric Schultz said President Obama was briefed on the incident. Fort Meade has about 11,000 military personnel and an additional 29,000 civilian employees, according to its Web site. The facility sits near Odenton and Laurel and is the third-largest employer in Maryland. It houses other federal agencies in addition to the NSA, including the Defense Information School, the U.S. Army Cyber Command and various military intelligence offices. A parkway sign that points to the exit says “NSA” and below, in black letters on a white background, says, “Restricted Entrance.” Monday’s shooting comes after other incidents in which authorities said people either accidentally or intentionally tried to breach security at area government buildings. This month, a Beltsville man was arrested in a string of shootings at public buildings around suburban Maryland, including one shooting at an NSA building just east of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway. A former prison guard was arrested and named a suspect in the shootings and has told investigators that he was “hearing voices” that told him to fire the shots. In September, a man with a knife was able to jump a fence, get past the U.S. Secret Service and enter an unlocked door of the White House before he was caught. That incident and others prompted a review of security procedures as well as staff changes at the top of the agency. And in October 2013, a woman with her 1-year-old daughter in her car rammed a gate outside the White House, then sped to the U.S. Capitol, where police twice opened fire on her car. She was killed after getting past a security barrier on the Capitol grounds. Her family has said she suffered from mental issues and panicked when she saw police with guns and had not meant to breach the security barriers. Lynh Bui, Dana Hedgpeth and Jennifer Jenkins contributed to this report. ||||| A Maryland State Police cruiser sits at a blocked southbound entrance on the Baltimore-Washington Parkway that accesses the National Security Agency, Monday, March 30, 2015, in Fort Meade, Md. A spokeswoman... (Associated Press) Authorities aren't saying yet why two men dressed as women tried to enter the National Security Agency's campus at Fort Meade, Maryland without permission shortly before 9 a.m. Monday. But the NSA has issued a statement providing a point by point description of what happened next. NSA Spokesman Jonathan Freed said in a statement that an agency officer gave the driver \\"routine instructions for safely exiting the secure campus,\\" but the driver disobeyed them, so barriers were deployed. Freed says the driver then accelerated toward an NSA Police vehicle blocking the road, and that police fired at them when the driver refused to stop, crashing into the police vehicle. One person inside the unauthorized vehicle died at the scene of causes that were not immediately determined. The other was hospitalized, as was one police officer. The NSA statement does not mention anyone other than NSA police firing a weapon. ___ 2:15 p.m. The National Security Agency says one of its officers fired on a car whose driver refused to obey instructions for safely exiting a restricted area. An NSA statement says two people were in the vehicle that attempted to make an unauthorized entry to the agency's campus at Fort Meade, Maryland. The agency says \\"the driver then failed to obey an NSA Police officer's routine instructions for safely exiting the secure campus. The vehicle failed to stop and barriers were deployed.\\" The agency says the unauthorized vehicle then accelerated toward an NSA Police vehicle blocking the road, and police fired at them when the driver refused to stop, crashing into the police vehicle. The agency says one person inside the unauthorized vehicle died at the scene, while the other was taken to a local hospital with injuries. One police officer also was injured and hospitalized. ___ 1:20 p.m. Fort Meade's commander says one person was killed and another injured when they tried to drive a vehicle into the National Security Agency portion of the installation without authorization. A statement from Col. Brian Foley says NSA personnel prevented the two from gaining access to the campus of intelligence agencies. Foley also says that the shooting is contained and under investigation. He says \\"the residents, service members and civilian employees at the installation are safe\\" and that Fort Meade will \\"continue to remain vigilant at all of our access control points.\\" ___ 1 p.m. The FBI is taking the lead investigating a deadly firefight outside Fort Meade, one of the most secure locations near the nation's capital. The fortified campus includes the National Security Agency, the Defense Information systems Agency and the U.S. Cyber Command. The post is the largest single employer in Maryland, with offices for about 11,000 military personnel and 29,000 civilian employees. One man was killed and another critically injured after officials said they tried to ram their SUV through a gate that serves as the entrance to the NSA just off the scenic Baltimore-Washington Parkway. Aerial video of the crime scene showed emergency workers loading an injured man in uniform into an ambulance. Two senior government officials told The Associated Press that one of the men in the dark, unmarked SUV was killed. ___ 12:45 p.m. FBI agents from Baltimore are investigating a firefight Monday morning outside a gate at the National Security Agency, where two men dressed as women apparently tried to force their sport utility vehicle past security. The shooting happened outside the NSA's campus in Fort Meade, Maryland, just off Interstate 295 in Anne Arundel County. FBI spokeswoman Amy Thoreson says an \\"Evidence Response Team\\" is processing the crime scene and that FBI agents are interviewing witnesses. The FBI will then work with federal prosecutors in Maryland to see if charges are warranted. ___ 12:40 p.m. Another building on the NSA campus was damaged by gunfire earlier this month. Authorities captured a man March 3 who they believe fired that night on the NSA site, as well as earlier at several nearby places and two moving vehicles. The suspect in that case, Hong Young, told police he heard voices directing him to fire on one of the occupied vehicles. ___ 12:20 p.m. A senior defense department official says the two men who tried to ram their sport utility vehicle through a gate at the National Security Agency were dressed as women. The official says Defense Secretary Ash Carter has been briefed on the situation, which is being investigated by the FBI. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the case is still developing. FBI spokeswoman Amy J. Thoreson says the scene is contained and that it does not appear to be linked to terrorism. Authorities say at least one of the men in the car has died. ___ Noon Aerial images of the scene at a National Security Agency gate at Fort Meade shows that a white SUV marked \\"NSA Police\\" is damaged, with its front end crumpled and the hood up. The other damaged vehicle is a dark, unmarked sport utility vehicle. ___ 11:50 a.m. The FBI says the shooting at the NSA gate is not believed to be related to terrorism. FBI spokeswoman Amy J. Thoreson said in an email Monday that the shooting scene is contained. She says the agency is working with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Maryland to determine if federal charges are warranted. Thoreson also says FBI agents are doing interviews with witnesses. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Two men dressed as women attempted to enter the National Security Agency's campus at Fort Meade, Maryland, without permission.

Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

Movie title: Contraband Context: Luca Di Angelo (Fabio Testi) is a smuggler, one member of an organized team trafficking cigarettes and booze up and down the coast off Naples, Italy. After a run-in with the police in which the smugglers manage to get away by faking a boat explosion resulting in the police motorboats responding to the false emergency allowing the smugglers to get away, Luca and his brother Mickey suspect Scherino (Ferdinand Murolo), the head of a rival gang of smugglers, of passing on their actives. Lucia and Mickey take their accusations to their boss Perlante (Saverio Marconi) a sleazy playboy withy numerous Mafia connections, who agrees to look into it. After a nighttime fire at Mickey's racing stables kills a valued racehorse, he and Luca drive over to inspect the damage. But on the way, they are stopped at a fake police roadblock where the assasins dressed as policemen trick Mickey into getting out of the car and machine-gun him to death over and over again (think Sonny Corlone's death scene in 'The Godfather'), while Luca barely escapes injury by hiding on the floor of the car.Afterwards, Perlante suggests that Luca leave town for a few days, but he refuses. After his brother's funeral, conducted on the gang's speedboats in the Bay of Naples, with the police surveying them, Luca vows revenge. Despite his wife Adele's (Ivana Monti) pleas, Luca goes after the prime suspect: Scherino. That night, Luca breaks into Scherino's house, but gets spotted and severely beaten up by Scherino's henchmen. However, Scherino spares Luca's life and instead has him thrown out of the house. He tells Luca that he's got it all wrong: he had no part in Mickey's killing.After Luca recovers from his injuries thanks to a local doctor named Charlie (Giordano Falzoni) who treats injuries for large bribes of cash, Luca meets with an informant who gives him a tip to who ordered the hit on Mickey.

Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Contraband,\\" Perlante, played by Saverio Marconi, is a significant character who acts as the boss of the main character, Luca Di Angelo, and his brother Mickey. Perlante is depicted as a sleazy playboy with many connections to the Mafia, who runs a smuggling operation trafficking cigarettes and alcohol along the coast off Naples, Italy. When Luca and Mickey have suspicions about Scherino, a rival gang leader, they bring their concerns to Perlante, who agrees to look into the matter. Perlante also makes key decisions that influence the plot of the movie. For instance, he suggests that Luca leave town for a few days following an assassination attempt where Mickey is killed. However, when Luca refuses to leave and seeks revenge instead, Perlante doesn't stop him. So, Perlante's role in the movie is crucial as he helms the smuggling operation Luca and Mickey are part of and actively engages in the events following Mickey's death, contributing to the twists and turns in the story."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump says he may veto a 1.3 trillion spending bill because it does not offer protections for young undocumented immigrants who arrived as children and does not fully fund the border wall. In a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \\"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\\" Previously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding. The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year. The measure fulfills Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi touted the agreement in a letter to her Democratic colleagues, saying negotiators \\"fought for and achieved drastic reductions to the Trump/GOP plan,\\" including much less funding for the wall than Trump requested and a limit on the number of immigrants that can be...

When Richard II was crowned in 1377, he led a procession from the Tower to Westminster Abbey. This tradition began in at least the early 14th century and lasted until 1660. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 the Tower of London was besieged with the King inside. When Richard rode out to meet with Wat Tyler, the rebel leader, a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, took refuge in St John's Chapel, hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary. However, he was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill. Six years later there was again civil unrest, and Richard spent Christmas in the security of the Tower rather than Windsor as was more usual. When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, Richard was imprisoned in the White Tower. He abdicated and was replaced on the throne by Bolingbroke, who became King Henry IV. In the 15th century, there was little building work at the Tower of London, yet the castle still remained important as a place of refuge. When supporters of the late Richard II attempted a coup, Henry IV found safety in the Tower of London. During this period, the castle also held many distinguished prisoners. The heir to the Scottish throne, later King James I of Scotland, was kidnapped while journeying to France in 1406 and held in the Tower. The reign of Henry V (1413–1422) renewed England's fortune in the Hundred Years' War against France. As a result of Henry's victories, such as the Battle of Agincourt, many high-status prisoners were held in the Tower of London until they were ransomed.Much of the latter half of the 15th century was occupied by the Wars of the Roses between the claimants to the throne, the houses of Lancaster and York. The castle was once again besieged in 1460, this time by a Yorkist force. The Tower was damaged by artillery fire but only surrendered when Henry VI was captured at the Battle of Northampton. With the help of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick (nicknamed \\"the Kingmaker\\")...

Answer:","completion":"To formulate a comprehensive answer to which genus of plants has a larger range, Fritillaria or Teucrium, we will first examine each genus, discuss their distribution and habitat, and then provide a comparison between their ranges. Fritillaria: Fritillaria is a genus of bulbous perennial plants in the family Liliaceae, consisting of about 130-140 species. These plants are primarily native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with some species extending into subarctic regions. Some commonly known species include the Crown Imperial (Fritillaria imperialis), Snake's Head Fritillary (Fritillaria meleagris), and the Bellflower Fritillary (Fritillaria camschatcensis). Fritillaria species are mainly found in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, deciduous and coniferous forests, and alpine regions. The distribution of Fritillaria species spans across Europe, the Mediterranean, Central and Western Asia, the Caucasus, the Middle East, and North America. In North America, Fritillaria species can be found in the Pacific Northwest, California, the Rocky Mountains, and parts of Mexico. Teucrium: Teucrium is a genus of perennial plants in the family Lamiaceae, commonly known as Germanders. There are about 260-300 species of Teucrium, and they can be found in diverse forms such as shrubs, herbs, and subshrubs. Teucrium species are known for their aromatic properties and have a longstanding history of medicinal uses. In terms of distribution, Teucrium species can be found in a wide variety of habitats, ranging from alpine meadows to deserts, coastal regions, and open woodlands. The genus is predominantly native to the Mediterranean region, but it also widely extends to Central and Western Asia, Northern Africa, the Canary Islands, and even some parts of Europe, including the British Isles. Some well-known species in the Teucrium genus include Teucrium chamaedrys (Wall Germander) and Teucrium canadense (American Germander). Comparison of Distribution and Habitats: Comparing the geographical ranges of the Fritillaria and Teucrium genera, it becomes apparent that Teucrium has a more extensive distribution. While the Fritillaria genus has notable presence across the Northern Hemisphere, particularly focusing on temperate to subarctic regions, its range does not extend to cover Northern Africa, the Canary Islands, or areas beyond the Mediterranean and Middle East. On the other hand, the Teucrium genus has a much broader distribution, covering not only the Mediterranean region but also Western Asia, Northern Africa, and even the Canary Islands. Their versatility in adapting to a wide range of habitats gives them a more expansive presence across the globe. Conclusion: Based on the comparison of their respective geographical ranges and habitats, it can be concluded that the Teucrium genus has a larger range than the Fritillaria genus. While both genera boast an impressive number of species, it is the adaptability and widespread presence of Teucrium that grants it a more extensive global distribution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Maria had always dreamt of having her very own pool in her spacious and beautiful garden. It was the perfect spot for a family get-together, outdoor parties, and cooling off in the scorching summer months. However, Maria was unsure of where to begin when it came to building a pool. She had no experience in construction or design and didn't know the first thing about choosing the right materials, size, or shape for her garden. Laura, on the other hand, had proven herself a resourceful and skilled problem-solver. She had a background in architecture and had successfully designed and built several home remodeling projects for friends and family. Maria knew that Laura's expertise and creativity would be invaluable in helping her bring her dream pool to life. After discussing the idea with Laura, the two friends agreed to work together to create the perfect pool for Maria's garden. They started by gathering ideas and inspiration from various sources, such as magazines, websites, and social media. Maria was particularly drawn to infinity pools and natural-looking, lagoon-inspired designs with cascading water features. Laura helped Maria visualize how different designs would fit in the garden, factoring in elements like existing trees and plants as well as the slope of the land. She also educated Maria on various pool materials, such as tile, concrete, and fiberglass, as well as filtration systems and the importance of proper water chemistry. Once they had settled on a design concept, Laura guided Maria through the process of obtaining the necessary permits and approvals from their local government. She also helped Maria create a budget and timeline for the project that considered the cost of materials, labor, and equipment rentals. As construction began, Laura took on the role of project supervisor, working closely with Maria to make sure every aspect of the pool build was executed flawlessly. She kept track of the crew's progress and ensured they had access to the right tools and materials. They encountered a few minor setbacks along the way, such as discovering a network of tree roots beneath the proposed pool site. However, with Laura's guidance and knowledge, they were able to overcome these obstacles and find solutions that kept the project on track. Throughout the building process, Maria learned a great deal from Laura about pool construction, maintenance, and design. Her knowledge grew exponentially, and she gained a new appreciation for the intricacies involved in building and maintaining a pool. After weeks of hard work, the pool was finally completed. Maria was overjoyed with the results - it was even more beautiful than she had imagined. The infinity edge seemed to melt seamlessly into the landscape, creating an inviting oasis that beckoned for a refreshing dip. The water features added a soothing ambiance, and the lush, tropical plants surrounding the pool gave it a serene, spa-like atmosphere. Maria was incredibly grateful to Laura for her guidance, expertise, and friendship during the entire pool building process. Without Laura's help, Maria's dream of having a stunning pool in her garden would have remained just that - a dream. Their collaboration taught them both the value of teamwork and how much they could accomplish when they combined their unique skills and knowledge. In the following years, Maria's pool became the centerpiece of countless gatherings, parties, and family events. The beautiful garden oasis was a testament to the power of teamwork, persistence, and, most importantly, friendship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Susan Magdalane Boyle (born 1 April 1961) is a Scottish singer who came to international attention when she appeared as a contestant on the TV programme Britain's Got Talent on 11 April 2009, singing \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" from Les Miserables. Her first album, I Dreamed a Dream, was released in November 2009 and became the UK's best-selling debut album of all time, beating the previous record held by Spirit by Leona Lewis. I Dreamed a Dream set a record for biggest first week sales by a debut album, according to the Official Chart Company in the United Kingdom. Boyle took singing lessons from vocal coach Fred O'Neil. She attended Edinburgh Acting School and took part in the Edinburgh Fringe. She also long participated in her parish church's pilgrimages to the Knock Shrine, County Mayo, Ireland, and sang there at the Marian basilica. In 1995, she auditioned for Michael Barrymore's My Kind of People. In 1999, Boyle submitted a track for a charity CD to commemorate the Millennium produced at a West Lothian school. Only 1,000 copies of the CD, Music for a Millennium Celebration, Sounds of West Lothian, were pressed. An early review by Amber McNaught in the West Lothian Herald & Post said Boyle's rendition of \\"Cry Me a River\\" was \\"heartbreaking\\" and \\"had been on repeat in my CD player ever since I got this CD...\\" The recording found its way onto the internet following her first televised appearance and the New York Post said it showed that Boyle was \\"not a one-trick pony.\\" Hello! said the recording \\"cement[ed] her status\\" as a singing star. In 1998, Boyle recorded three tracks--\\"Cry Me A River\\", \\"Killing Me Softly\\", and \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\"--at Heartbeat Studio, Midlothian. She used all her savings to pay for a professionally cut demo, copies of which she later sent to record companies, radio talent competitions, local and national TV. The demo consisted of her versions of \\"Cry Me a River\\" and \\"Killing Me Softly with His Song\\"; the songs were uploaded to the Internet after her BGT audition. After Boyle won several local singing competitions, her mother urged her to enter Britain's Got Talent and take the risk of singing in front of an audience larger than her parish church. Former coach O'Neil said Boyle abandoned an audition for The X Factor because she believed people were being chosen for their looks. She almost abandoned her plan to enter Britain's Got Talent believing she was too old, but O'Neil persuaded her to audition nevertheless. Boyle said that she was motivated to seek a musical career to pay tribute to her mother. Her performance on the show was the first time she had sung in public since her mother died. In August 2008, Boyle applied for an audition for the third series of Britain's Got Talent (as contestant number 43212) and was accepted after a preliminary audition in Glasgow. When Boyle first appeared on Britain's Got Talent at the city's Clyde Auditorium, she said that she aspired to become a professional singer \\"as successful as Elaine Paige\\". Boyle sang \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" from Les Miserables in the first round, which was watched by over 10 million viewers when it aired on 11 April 2009. Programme judge Amanda Holden remarked upon the audience's initially cynical attitude, and the subsequent \\"biggest wake-up call ever\\" upon hearing her performance. Boyle was \\"absolutely gobsmacked\\" by the strength of the reaction to her appearance. Afterwards, Paige expressed interest in singing a duet with Boyle, and called her \\"a role model for everyone who has a dream\\". Boyle's rendition of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" was credited with causing a surge in ticket sales in the Vancouver production of Les Miserables. Cameron Mackintosh, the producer of the musical, also praised the performance, as \\"heart-touching, thrilling and uplifting\\". Boyle was one of 40 acts that were put through to the semi-finals. She appeared last on the first semi-final on 24 May 2009, performing \\"Memory\\" from the musical Cats. In the public vote, she was the act to receive the highest number of votes to go through to the final. She was the clear favourite to win the final, but ended up in second place to dance troupe Diversity; the UK TV audience was a record of 17.3 million viewers. The Press Complaints Commission (PCC) became concerned by press reports about Boyle's erratic behaviour and speculation about her mental condition and wrote to remind editors about clause 3 (privacy) of their code of press conduct. The day after the final, Boyle was admitted to The Priory, a private psychiatric clinic in London, Talkback Thames explained, \\"Following Saturday night's show, Susan is exhausted and emotionally drained.\\" Her stay in hospital attracted widespread attention, with Prime Minister Gordon Brown wishing her well. Cowell offered to waive Boyle's contractual obligation to take part in the BGT tour. Her family said \\"she's been battered non-stop for the last seven weeks and it has taken its toll [...but...] her dream is very much alive,\\" as she had been invited to the Independence Day celebrations at the White House. Boyle left the clinic three days after her admission and said she would participate in the BGT tour. Despite health concerns, she appeared in 20 of the 24 dates of the tour, and was well received in cities including Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Dublin, Sheffield, Coventry, and Birmingham. The Belfast Telegraph stated that \\"Despite reports of crumbling under the pressure..., she exuded a confidence resembling that of a veteran who has been performing for years\\". Boyle's first album, I Dreamed a Dream, was released on 23 November 2009. The album includes covers of \\"Wild Horses\\" and \\"You'll See\\" as well as \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\", and \\"Cry Me a River\\". In Britain, Boyle's debut album was recognised as the fastest selling UK debut album of all time selling 411,820 copies, beating the previous fastest selling debut of all time, Spirit by Leona Lewis. I Dreamed a Dream also outsold the rest of the top 5 albums combined in its first week. In the US, the album sold 701,000 copies in its first week, the best opening week for a debut artist in over a decade. It topped the Billboard chart for six straight weeks and although it narrowly failed to become the best-selling album of 2009, with sales of 3,104,000 compared to 3,217,000 for Taylor Swift's Fearless, it was one of only two albums to sell over 3 million copies in the US, and was also the top selling \\"physical\\" album of 2009, with only 86,000 of its sales coming from digital downloads. This has in turn garnered more media attention, as mentioned by People magazine. In Italy, it was the first album of the month in the Italian No. 1 Account by a non-Italian artist ever. In only a week, it sold more than 2 million copies worldwide, becoming the fastest selling global female debut album. On 13 December 2009 she appeared in her own television special \\"I Dreamed a Dream: the Susan Boyle Story\\", featuring a duet with Elaine Paige. It got ratings of 10 million viewers in the United Kingdom and in America was the TV Guide Network's highest rated television special in its history. In November 2009 it was reported that Boyle's rendition of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" would be the theme song of the anime movie Eagle Talon The Movie 3 which was later released in Japan on 16 January 2010. Boyle performed for Pope Benedict XVI on his tour of Britain in 2010. In May 2010, Boyle was voted by Time magazine as the seventh most influential person in the world.

Here is a news article: Photo purportedly shows pilot and navigator on a dock in the Marshall Islands in 1937 – under Japanese rule at the time – but some experts remain unconvinced A newly unearthed picture from the US national archives has given new credence to a popular theory about the disappearance of pioneering aviator Amelia Earhart. Some experts say the image shows the pilot, her navigator Fred Noonan and her airplane in the Marshall Islands in 1937, when the archipelago was occupied by Japan – proving that she died in Japanese custody, rather than during a crash landing in the Pacific. “When you pull out, and when you see the analysis that’s been done, I think it leaves no doubt to the viewers that that’s Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan,” Shawn Henry told NBC News. Henry is the former executive assistant director for the FBI and an NBC News analyst. Rare footage surfaces of Amelia Earhart shortly before she vanished Read more Kent Gibson, a forensic analyst who specializes in facial recognition, told the History Channel that it was “very likely” the individuals pictured are Earhart and Noonan, in a programme on the Earhart mystery scheduled to air this Sunday. Not everyone is so convinced, however. “There is such an appetite for anything related to Amelia Earhart that even something this ridiculous will get everybody talking about it,” said Ric Gillespie, author of Finding Amelia and the executive director of the The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (Tighar). “This is just a picture of a wharf at Jaluit [in the Marshall Islands], with a bunch of people,” Gillespie said. “It’s just silly. And this is coming from a guy who has spent the last 28 years doing genuine research into the Earhart disappearance and led 11 expeditions into the South Pacific.” The picture was discovered by retired federal agent Les Kinney, who scoured the national archives for records that may have been overlooked in the now 80-year-old mystery of Earhart’s last flight. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Earhart and Noonan, with a map of the Pacific that shows the planned route of their last flight. Photograph: Bettmann archive It was 2 July 1937, toward the end of her history-making flight around the world, when the nearly 40-year-old Earhart vanished somewhere over the Pacific Ocean. The crash has long been blamed on poor weather conditions and a technical failure with the plane’s radio system. Most historians believe that Earhart ran out of fuel, crashed into the Pacific Ocean and sunk to the ocean’s darkest depths. But since no trace of Earhart, Noonan or her Lockheed Electra airplane have ever been confirmed, alternate theories have abounded for decades. This past November, another forensic breakthrough supported an alternate theory that Earhart may have died a castaway on an island in modern-day Kiribati. Gillespie is an exponent of this account and believes there is copious evidence to support it, including the timing of radio transmissions received after the plane was no longer airborne, the location of human remains on the then uninhabited island, and items he and his team have recovered – including a popular US women’s moisturizer, a zipper from a jacket and a makeup case. “We found the site, we’ve done three excavations there and we’re finding artifacts that speak of an American woman of the 1930s,” Gillespie said. Solving the mystery of how aviator Amelia Earhart disappeared Read more The Marshall Island theory, which the photograph is alleged to support, has been around since at least the 1960s and fueled by accounts from Marshall Islanders who claimed they saw the aircraft land and saw Earhart and Noonan in Japanese custody. Kinney found the most recent photograph stamped with official Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) markings reading “Marshall Islands, Jaluit Atoll, Jaluit Island, Jaluit Harbor”. The photograph has been credited to a US spy. In the photo, a ship can be seen towing a barge with an airplane on the back, and on a nearby dock what appears to be a woman with a short haircut can be seen sitting, facing away from the camera. Gillespie notes, for what it’s worth, that the woman’s hair is far too long to be that of Earhart, of whom pictures exist from just a few days earlier. “It wasn’t that long [a period of time] and hair doesn’t grow that fast,” Gillespie said. Also visible is the face of a man who several experts told the History Channel is Noonan. The picture “clearly indicates that Earhart was captured by the Japanese”, Kinney said in History’s investigation. Japanese officials have stated on more than one occasion that they have no records of Earhart or Noonan ever having been in their custody, but many of the nation’s records did not survive the second world war. • This article was amended on 13 July 2017. An earlier version said Amelia Earhart was 40 years old when she vanished. This has been corrected to say nearly 40. ||||| CLOSE A recently-discovered photograph is turning the mystery surrounding Amelia Earhart’s 1937 disappearance on its head, leading a handful of experts to believe the celebrated aviator and women’s rights role model actually survived her final flight. Time Amelia Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, in front of their twin-engine Lockheed Electra in Los Angeles at the end of May 1937. (Photo: AP) WOODLAND PARK, N.J. — As the 80th anniversary of Amelia Earhart's disappearance was marked Sunday, a new theory surfaced as to what happened to her as she attempted to become the first woman to circumnavigate the globe. Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, disappeared over the Pacific Ocean on July 2, 1937. Many believed she ran out of gas and crashed into the water. A new documentary on the History Channel claims that a photograph found deep within the National Archives shows the famed lost pilot and Noonan captured by the Japanese on the Marshall Islands. More: New photo may prove Amelia Earhart was captured by the Japanese More: This is why the mystery of Amelia Earhart endures 80 years later One of the many theories over the years about what happened to Earhart was that she returned to the United States and was a housewife in New Jersey. In the 1970s, a book called Amelia Earhart Lives by Joe Klass was published, claiming that Irene Bolam, a woman living in Monroe Township, N.J., in Middlesex County, was the lost pilot. Someone saw Bolam at a garden party in New York's Long Island and thought her to be Earhart, said Richard Gillespie, founder and executive director of The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery. Bolam denied she was the female aviator, but Klass' book claimed that Earhart returned to the United States after World War II to live a different life as a New Jersey housewife. Bolam, who bore a slight resemblance to Earhart, also was a pilot. “If that's Amelia Earhart, where are the soldiers? No one is carrying a gun, no one is restricting their activity.” Richard Gillespie, executive director of The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery Bolam sued Klass and McGraw-Hill after the book was published and received a settlement of an unknown amount. The publisher pulled the books from the shelves. \\"People will believe anything,\\" said Gillespie. The new History Channel documentary premiering Sunday claims the unearthed photograph depicts Earhart and Noonan on a dock while their Lockheed Electra 10E is towed by a boat and that the two were captured by the Japanese military and held until their deaths. Gillespie called the theory an \\"absolute myth\\" and \\"ridiculous.\\" \\"It's a person who might be a white woman in the distance sitting on the edge of a dock and a guy that looks like a white guy so it has to be them,\\" Gillespie said. \\"It's ridiculous.\\" More: Bone-sniffing dogs will search for Amelia Earhart's remains on remote island More: Did Amelia Earhart die as a castaway? 3 theories and evidence Gillespie pointed out that the hair of the person sitting on the dock is too long to be Earhart's and that there are no Japanese soldiers surrounding her and her navigator. \\"If that's Amelia Earhart, where are the soldiers? No one is carrying a gun, no one is restricting their activity,\\" Gillespie said, adding it is hard to believe that Earhart was captured by the Japanese and the United States knew about it. \\"Think about how many people would have to keep that secret for years.\\" The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery has made several expeditions to Nikumaroro, which was formerly known as Gardner Island, in the Pacific where Gillespie believes he has found evidence that Earhart and Noonan crashed there and became castaways. The group is currently wrapping up an expedition on Nikumaroro to find human remains with National Geographic and forensic cadaver dogs. CLOSE Amelia Earhart vanished during the last leg of her flight around the world nearly 80 years ago. But researchers now believe they have a way to figure out what happened to her. Josh King has the story (@abridgetoland). Buzz60 Gillespie said the theory that the two perished on the island is the original theory. It makes perfect sense to him that Earhart perished on the island, noting that Nikumaroro was along the same navigation line as their original destination and that distress calls from Earhart's plane were transmitting from that area for six days after her disappearance. More: New evidence could prove that Amelia Earhart died as a castaway Gillespie said it took the Navy a week to reach the island to search for Earhart and by that time, the plane had been washed off the reef, slipping into the waves below. They thought the distress calls were a hoax and surmised that the plane crashed into the ocean, he said. Three years after Earhart disappeared, the British established a colony on the island and discovered the partial skeleton of a castaway. Part of a woman's shoe was found as well as a sextant, used for navigation, Gillespie said. \\"We've examined it archaeologically and we are finding artifacts that speak to an American woman in the 1930s,\\" Gillespie said. \\"We are trying to find any surviving human remains to get DNA.\\" The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery also is searching for the remains of Earhart's plane, which Gillespie maintains are located in an area of steep coral reef that makes searching difficult.

The new rules extend existing anti-smoking regulations to more places, including fitness centers, cultural relic sites, offices, meeting rooms, dining halls, toilets and lifts. Restaurants, Internet cafes, parks, and waiting halls at airports, railway stations and coach stations are required to set up smoking areas. Hotels will have to offer smoke-free rooms or floors, but the regulations do not specify a proportion. However, some restaurant owners have complained that it would be difficult to have a separate smoking room as required by the new regulations. \\"We plan to issue specific rules to solve this problem as soon as possible,\\" Rao Yingsheng, vice-director of the Beijing Committee for Patriotic Public Health Campaign, was quoted by the Beijing News as saying Thursday. He said small restaurants without a separate room should set aside at least 70 percent of their area for non-smokers. He also said customers and restaurant owners would be asked for their thoughts on the new rule. Local authorities dispatched about 100,000 inspectors to make sure the ban was being enforced Thursday.

Context: By early 1799, the French Directory had become impatient with stalling tactics employed by Austria. The uprising in Naples raised further alarms, and recent gains in Switzerland suggested the timing was fortuitous to venture on another campaign in northern Italy and southwestern Germany. At the beginning of 1800, the armies of France and Austria faced each other across the Rhine. Feldzeugmeister Pál Kray led approximately 120,000 troops. In addition to his Austrian regulars, his force included 12,000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria, 6,000 troops from the Duchy of Württemberg, 5,000 soldiers of low quality from the Archbishopric of Mainz, and 7,000 militiamen from the County of Tyrol. Of these, 25,000 men were deployed east of Lake Constance to protect the Vorarlberg. Kray posted his main body of 95,000 soldiers in the L-shaped angle where the Rhine changes direction from a westward flow along the northern border of Switzerland to a northward flow along the eastern border of France. Unwisely, Kray set up his main magazine at Stockach, near the northwestern end of Lake Constance, only a day's march from French-held Switzerland. Question: How many of Feldzeugmeister Pál Kray's troops were not deployed east of Lake Constance to protect the Vorarlberg? Answer:","completion":"To find the number of troops not deployed east of Lake Constance to protect the Vorarlberg, we need to subtract the number of troops deployed there from the total number of troops in Feldzeugmeister Pál Kray's army. Total troops: 120,000 Troops deployed east of Lake Constance: 25,000 120,000 (total troops) - 25,000 (troops deployed east of Lake Constance) = 95,000 troops 95,000 of Feldzeugmeister Pál Kray's troops were not deployed east of Lake Constance to protect the Vorarlberg."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Adam, a medical student, is lured to a cabin far from civilization where he volunteers to be repeatedly killed and reanimated by Dr. Franklin Vick, through use of a mysterious serum. While \\"Subject Two\\" as he is initially successful, he begins to experience violent seizures and excruciating pain, begging Vick to kill him or committing suicide several times. Adam eventually gains complete immortality and near instantaneous regeneration, but as a consequence he loses the very sense of being alive; he can no longer feel things (including pain) and no longer can have emotions. His eyes turn snow white, and, to compensate for the gradual loss of his sense of self, he becomes violent and depressed, going so far as to kill a hunter that accidentally shoots him rather than risk him exposing the project. Eventually the student leaves Vick, only to become a walking ghost doomed to walk the earth for eternity. After returning home, \\"Vick\\" finds the real Dr. Franklin Vick, and it is revealed that the doctor for the course of the entire movie was his assistant, Subject One. Thinking that he had accidentally killed Dr. Vick, Subject One assumed his identity to continue the work, but finds that the serum was initially perfect, and it was only his tampering that gradually changed Adam. Dr. Vick scolds him before strangling him in a similar fashion to Adam, and thus begins the experiment cycle over again. It carries several obvious homages to Frankenstein but explores more the emotional effects of death and pseudo-life. Answer:","completion":"In the given context, Adam, the medical student turned \\"Subject Two,\\" is the one who kills a hunter. The story revolves around the development of a mysterious serum by Dr. Franklin Vick, which grants immortality and regeneration to its subjects. Adam, who volunteers to be a test subject for the serum, gains immortality and the power of rapid regeneration. However, this gift comes at a cost - he loses his sense of self, emotions, and the ability to feel anything, including pain. To compensate for the loss of his human traits, Adam becomes more violent and starts exhibiting depressive tendencies. It is during one of these violent outbursts that he kills a hunter who accidentally shoots him. Adam kills the hunter, despite knowing better, to prevent word of Dr. Vick's secret project from spreading and to protect the experiments that were being conducted. The story further reveals that the person Adam believed to be Dr. Vick was actually his assistant, Subject One. Subject One had assumed Dr. Vick's identity after thinking that he had accidentally killed the doctor, and attempted to continue the development of the serum. However, his tampering with the serum is what caused Adam's adverse reactions, such as loss of emotions and sensations. Ultimately, the real Dr. Franklin Vick reappears and kills Subject One in a manner similar to how Adam killed the hunter, signifying the restart of the experiment cycle. The narrative carries strong allusions to Frankenstein, as it delves into the emotional effects of constantly facing death and living in a pseudo-life, exploring the consequences of immortality and playing God."},{"prompt":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? When it comes to bigger holes that cannot be mended with a single seam, your best bet is to look into getting a patch-- an extra piece of fabric you can integrate into your jeans to cover the hole. You can find patches at a local arts and crafts or clothing specialty outlet. Buy a patch that matches the colour of your jeans as closely as possible. You'll want to get a patch that's slightly bigger than the hole you're covering; that way, you'll have some extra room to make errors. While denim patches are the safest bet if you're looking to really repair your jeans, you can take the damage as an opportunity to stylize your jeans with brightly coloured or flannel patches. Adding a patch that will clearly stand out from the rest of the clothing will give it a down-to-earth flair. While denim (or 'masked' alterations) are best sewn in on the inside of the jeans, patching different fabrics to the outside of your jeans will make them more prominent and eye-catching. If you're feeling thrifty, you can harvest your own patches from jeans you don't use anymore. If you have a bigger hole that will require a patch, you should still cut off the frayed edges. Even if it sounds like you are consciously losing material, the frayed edges won't be any help in mending it, so it's best to get rid of them, leaving a clean hole. Take some scissors and cut excess threads around the hole. By the end, there shouldn't be any threads significantly sticking out. With patches in particular, it's recommended you turn your jeans inside out while you're patching them. That way, the most visible seams won't be externally visible. It'll also give you a bit of extra room to make sewing mistakes. It's typically better to sew a denim patch in from the inside. This will make the patch look less evident, as well as cover up the most visible stitch lines. Once you've got your jeans turned inside out, take a sewing needle and thread and sew the patch. Try to keep your sewing as close as possible; you want to integrate the fabric into your jeans as closely as closely as possible. Ironing your jeans following a patch is significantly more important than ironing a small tear. This will help even out and seal the patch. Summary:","completion":"This article suggests using a matching or stylized patch slightly larger than the hole to effectively repair and potentially add flair to jeans with bigger holes, advising to sew the patch on the inside for a cleaner look and to iron after patching for an even and sealed finish."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible A: woods, forest, bicycle spokes, home, grass Why is \\"grass\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"Grass\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons. Firstly, it's essential to analyze the context of the question, which refers to using a stick to swat at something growing in a field. Among the possible options, grass is the most relevant and reasonable choice, and here's why: 1. Relevance to the field environment: Grass is a common plant that typically grows in fields, making it a suitable object to swat with a stick. In contrast, woods and forests aren't individual elements in a field, but rather large areas full of trees. Bicycle spokes, on the other hand, are parts of bicycles and have nothing to do with fields or plants. Lastly, a home is an architectural structure, not a growing entity found in a field. 2. Feasibility of swatting: Grass is a flexible and slender plant, making it easy to swat with a stick. The act of swatting typically involves striking or sweeping through something lightweight and flexible. Woods, forests, bicycle spokes, and homes are not suitable candidates for swatting with a stick, either due to their significant size, structural rigidity, or irrelevance to the context. 3. Common human experiences: Many people have experienced walking through a field, playing with a stick, and swatting at things. It's a familiar and relatable activity for most people. Grass is abundant, accessible, and a natural target for such a playful action. Swatting at woods, forests, bicycle spokes, or a home doesn't align with usual human behaviors, making grass the most common-sense choice. 4. Harmlessness: Swatting at grass with a stick is generally considered a harmless activity. It doesn't pose any significant threat to the environment, people, or property. Conversely, attempting to swat woods, forests, bicycle spokes, or homes could damage them or potentially harm someone in the process. 5. Cultural references: In popular culture and throughout history, people are often depicted engaging in simple, playful activities outdoors, such as swatting at grass, plants, or insects with a stick. This familiarity further supports grass as the answer that aligns with human common sense. In conclusion, \\"grass\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense because it is relevant, feasible, relatable, harmless, and a common cultural reference. The other options - woods, forest, bicycle spokes, and home - don't fit the context, criteria, or logic of the question, making grass the most sensible choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What were the full name of the person who was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater? is inside the article: The Chicxulub crater (; Mayan: [tʃʼikʃuluɓ]) is an impact crater buried underneath the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. Its center is located near the town of Chicxulub, after which the crater is named. It was formed by a large asteroid or comet about 11 to 81 kilometres (6.8 to 50.3 miles) in diameter, the Chicxulub impactor, striking the Earth. The date of the impact coincides precisely with the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–Pg boundary), slightly less than 66 million years ago, and a widely accepted theory is that worldwide climate disruption from the event was the cause of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, a mass extinction in which 75% of plant and animal species on Earth became extinct, including all non-avian dinosaurs. The crater is estimated to be 150 kilometres (93 miles) in diameter and 20 km (12 mi) in depth, well into the continental crust of the region of about 10–30 km (6.2–18.6 mi) depth. It is the second largest confirmed impact structure on Earth and the only one whose peak ring is intact and directly accessible for scientific research.The crater was discovered by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who had been looking for petroleum in the Yucatán during the late 1970s. Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search. Later, through contact with Alan Hildebrand in 1990, Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature. Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz, a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas. In 2016, a scientific drilling project drilled deep into the peak ring of the impact crater, hundreds of meters below the current sea floor, to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself. The discoveries were widely seen as confirming current theories related to both the crater impact and its effects., can you guess it ?

Because it was the only work available in the area. Thanks for the A2A Josh: Tough one to reduce to just a single incident but I’ll try. I grew up in North Central Indiana, about 50 miles south of South Bend. It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70’s and 80’s. My family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses. My dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between. It was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed. As I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway. Some people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools. I remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether. I don’t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn’t do a good job. Later in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing. I still remember hating shoveling snow. But I’m forever grateful that I did it. According to the above context, answer the following question. Why did the author's mother make him shovel the snow from the homes of the elderly? Answer:","completion":"1). To provide them with some relief from the snow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer this question: what book in the bible comes after john??","completion":"The book that comes after the Gospel of John in the Bible is the Acts of the Apostles, commonly referred to as \\"Acts.\\" This book is the fifth book in the New Testament and serves as a continuation of the four Gospels – Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Written by Luke, the physician and companion of the Apostle Paul, Acts details the history of the early Christian Church and the spread of the Gospel message throughout the Roman Empire. The book of Acts commences with Jesus' ascension into heaven, followed by the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles during the feast of Pentecost. This event empowers the apostles to preach the Gospel, perform miracles, and establish the early Christian Church. The Acts of the Apostles can be broadly divided into two sections: 1. The early church in Jerusalem (Acts 1-7): This section revolves around the ministry of Peter, John, and other apostles. It describes the growth of the Jerusalem church and the apostles' encounters with opposition from Jewish leaders. Luke also narrates the story of Stephen, the first Christian martyr whose powerful speech before the Sanhedrin incites his stoning to death. 2. Expansion of the Church and Paul's missionary journeys (Acts 8-28): The second half of Acts follows the conversion and mission trips of the Apostle Paul. A former persecutor of Christians named Saul, Paul encounters Jesus on the road to Damascus and is converted, receiving a commission to carry the Gospel to the Gentiles. The book details three main missionary journeys of Paul, where he spreads the message of Christianity across regions in the Mediterranean, establishes churches, and faces adversities such as imprisonment and shipwrecks. Towards the end of the book, Paul is arrested in Jerusalem and sent to Rome for trial. The Acts of the Apostles concludes with Paul under house arrest in Rome, preaching freely to the public. Overall, the book of Acts offers a historical account of the early Christian Church's formation, growth, and expansion, highlighting the key events, ministries, and characters that shaped the movement. It is considered an essential bridge between the Gospels and the subsequent epistles, as it shows how the teachings of Jesus were transformed into an organized religion that continued to grow despite persecutions and challenges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is For Ruskin, the aesthetic was of overriding significance. a good answer to this question?","completion":"While \\"For Ruskin, the aesthetic was of overriding significance\\" is a reasonable starting point to answer the question, a more detailed and long answer would provide a more comprehensive analysis of John Ruskin's beliefs and his significant contributions to architecture. John Ruskin, one of the most prominent Victorian art critics of the 19th century, was indeed greatly concerned with the aesthetic aspect of architecture. However, his perspective was far more extensive than just the aesthetic. Ruskin had a deep appreciation for building craftsmanship, truthful representation in materials, the environment, and the moral impact of architecture on society. In fact, he strongly believed in the integration of all these aspects to create beautiful, functional, and meaningful buildings. Ruskin championed the Gothic Revival style in Britain, which was a throwback to medieval Gothic architecture and posed a stark contrast to the contemporary neoclassical style. In his influential book \\"The Seven Lamps of Architecture,\\" Ruskin laid out his philosophy of architectural design. The seven lamps he refers to are the principles of architecture, which are: 1. Sacrifice: Ruskin believed that the best architecture stems from a devotion to creating something of the highest quality, requiring hard work, dedication, and sometimes, personal sacrifice. 2. Truth: According to Ruskin, architecture should honestly represent the materials and methods used for construction. Deceptive practices, like using stucco to mimic stone, were frowned upon. 3. Power: Ruskin saw architectural power in the effective use of structural components and spatial organization, which he believed had the capacity to evoke emotional and intellectual responses from the beholders. 4. Beauty: While Ruskin appreciated the aesthetic aspect of architecture, he also argued that beauty should come naturally from the combination of the principles his theory embraced. Intricate ornamentation and skilled craftsmanship played significant roles in achieving this beauty. 5. Life: Ruskin believed that the natural world, including living organisms, should inspire architectural forms, creating what he saw as a connection between human life and its surroundings. 6. Memory: He thought that buildings should represent the historical context in which they were created, displaying and conserving the architectural heritage of a particular region or society. 7. Obedience: Finally, Ruskin insisted that architects should adhere to certain constraints, such as the traditions of their discipline, the requirements of the users, and the natural conditions of the site. All in all, for John Ruskin, the aesthetic aspect was undeniably important, yet the significance he placed on architecture involved a cohesive combination of craftsmanship, truth, functionality, environment, and moral impact on society. Ruskin's architectural philosophy strongly influenced Victorian Britain, as well as many generations of architects around the world."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Two magazines recently listed the best cities to live in.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Income inequality has squeezed the middle class out of the majority After more than four decades of economic realignment and creeping inequality, the U.S. middle class is no longer the nation’s majority. The number of households that are middle class is now matched by those that are either upper or lower income, according to a report released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center. The nation has arrived at this tipping point in part because more Americans are moving up the income ladder. In 1971, just 14 percent of Americans were in the upper income tier, which Pew defined as more than double the nation’s median income. Now, 21 percent of American households are in that upper earning category -- at least 126,000 a year for a three-person household. But at the same time, many Americans are falling behind, helping to deplete the middle. In 1971, a quarter of American households fell into the bottom earning tier, which Pew defined as less than two-thirds of the nation’s median income. By 2015, 29 percent of American households fell into that category, which for a three-person household meant they earned 42,000 a year or less. Overall, the share of Americans living in middle-class households has declined from 61 percent in 1971 to 50 percent. The hollowing out of the middle class has been a source of consternation among many economists, politicians and the public at large. They say as Americans move toward the economic extremes it is harder to find common ground, and a common sense of what it means to be an American. But others say a shrinking middle class--however that group is defined--is not problematic by itself. “I don’t think it is anything we should be worried about,” said Scott Winship, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning Manhattan Institute. “More important than how many people are in certain income ranges, is whether people are moving up.” The decline of the middle class has been accompanied by growing inequality, as a growing share of the nation’s income has been captured by those at the top. Nearly half of the nation’s aggregate income went to upper-income households in 2014, the report said, up from 29 percent in 2014. Meanwhile, those in the middle earned 43 percent of the nation’s income in 2014, down from 62 percent in 1970. That trend has only accelerated since the turn of the century. Median income for middle income families declined 4 percent between 2000 and 2014, and their median wealth, decimated by the Great Recession, cratered by 28 percent between 2001 and 2013, the report said. [The American middle class is worse off compared to others around the world] The slimming of the middle class has come even as Americans of all income levels have grown more prosperous, Pew found. Middle class families have seen their income grow by 34 percent in inflation-adjusted dollars since 1970, while lower-income Americans have experienced income growth of 28 percent. Still, that growth is not nearly as strong as the 47 percent income growth experienced by upper-income households in that time period. The changing economic fortunes of American households has been most dramatic at the far ends of the income spectrum, Pew found. The share of households earning more than three times the median income--188,000 a year for a family of three in 2014 dollars--is now 9 percent, up from just 4 percent in 1971. At the bottom, one in five households earned less than half the overall median income--31,000 a year in 2014--up from 16 percent in 1971. The report also found that older Americans, married couples and black Americans have made more economic gains than others in recent decades. Between 1971 and 2015, for example, the share of black Americans in the upper income tier more than doubled to 12 percent. Meanwhile, some 17 percent of adults aged 65 and older are in the upper income tier, Pew said, up from just 7 percent in 1971. Despite that progress, African Americans and the elderly still remain more likely than other Americans to be lower income, and less likely to be higher-income. One marker of relative prosperity in recent decades has been educational achievement. While the economic status of Americans with bachelor’s degrees changed little from 1971 to 2015, those who did not graduate from college fell down the income ladder. That shift was magnified by evolving social trends, which saw marriage in decline overall, but especially for those with fewer educational credentials. Married adults have moved up the income ladder over the past four decades, while those who are unmarried slipped backwards, the report said.

Fletcher is a national economics correspondent, writing about unemployment, state and municipal debt, the evolving job market and the auto industry. Summary:","completion":"A new report from the Pew Research Center reveals that after more than four decades of creeping inequality, the US middle class is no longer the country’s majority, with the number of households now matched by those that are either upper or lower income. It is partly due to more Americans moving up the income ladder. In 1971, only 14% were in the upper income tier, now 21% of American households earn at least 126,000 a year for a three person household. However, more American households are also falling into the lower income category, 29% by 2015 from 25% in 1971. The study also shows that educational achievement in recent decades has proven to be a marker of relative prosperity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of an owl being in a silent environment can have an effect on its hunting process. In a silent environment, the owl's highly sensitive hearing can be even more effective in locating prey that cannot be seen. This can potentially increase the owl's chances of detecting and capturing prey while hunting at night. However, it is also worth noting that the silent environment could make the prey more alert to any sounds, so the owl must continue to rely on its silent flying techniques to successfully hunt."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Overall, blasu00e9 atmosphere (kinda tacky really - red, orange and yellow color palate, which Arizona pulls off better than anyone, but not in this space - it looked like a converted ball room from the early 1990's) and terribly unimpressive hostess. Can't say anything for the food, the initial disappointment with the atmosphere and service was enough for us to decide not to waste our money on a subpar experience (which it would have been regardless of how good the food was). We arrived here after having had a negative drinks and appetizer experience at Sol Mexican Concina (which was recommended to us by Allan, a Westin concierge when we said we were looking for a place with local flare and high-end service like The Mission in Old Town - oh goodness could they not have been further from the mark). This was also recommended, so we tried it next. The menu looked okay so we decided to give it a try, the hostess tried to insist on having us sit in the small lounge area, but we wanted a more elegant dining experience since it was my birthday, so we asked to be seated in the main dining area. She just looked at us confused, literally twirling a strand of her hair with both hands (i wish I had gotten a photo of this - it would have been down right comical how ditzy she was acting if I weren't hungry and frustrated with the Westin's poor track record with recommendations so far). Ultimately she did seat us in the main dining area, but along a back wall away from everything and everyone EXCEPT* another couple whose booth was situated so that they were staring right at us (so awkward). There was plenty of other seating in the restaurant but we already felt like we were being difficult so we didn't want to bother them by asking to be seated anywhere else. Our waiter came over and told us about the specials that evening, and we had to laugh because their special was the exact same as the special at Sol Mexican Cocina (skirt steak), which both servers pushed pretty hard. I'm guessing it must have been on sale in the area or something? This was when we decided we'd be happier with a movie, a bottle of wine and tapas in our villa - it was sad because we really wanted to have a nice dinner out, but the remorse would have been much greater had we settled for either of the two sad recommendations we received from Allan, the Westin concierge. pick from the following.

Upon her discharge, she has no memory of the event but frequently suffers related nightmares. While packing, Anna is startled by a disturbing, talkative patient from the room across the hall. Shortly after, she leaves with her father, Steven (David Strathairn), a writer who has dedicated his latest book to Anna and her sister. At home, Anna reunites with her sister, Alex (Arielle Kebbel), with whom she is very close. The sisters stand against Steven's girlfriend Rachel (Elizabeth Banks), who had been their mother's live-in nurse. Alex criticizes Steven for sleeping with Rachel while the girls' mother was still alive and sick in bed but he does not respond. Anna describes to Alex how scenes from her dreams have started happening while she is awake. The sisters become convinced that the hallucinations are messages from their mother, telling them that she was murdered by Rachel. Anna catches up with her old boyfriend, Matt (Jesse Moss), who tells her that he saw what happened the night of the fire. They secretly plan to meet that night, but Matt fails to show up and Anna returns home. In her room, Anna awakens to find him climbing into her window, saying that she needs to know the truth and that he had a warning from her mother. They kiss but then Anna notices Matt's body suddenly warping and his back breaking. Anna flees from the room in fear but when she opens the door, he is gone. The next morning, Matt's dead body is pulled out of the water, his back broken just the way Anna saw it. The police assume he fell and drowned.

A:","completion":"To cut out the inner part of the plates, follow these step-by-step instructions: Materials and tools you will need: 1. Plate (the one you want to cut) 2. Marker pen 3. Masking tape or painter's tape 4. Glass cutting tool or Dremel rotary tool with a diamond cutting wheel attachment 5. Safety goggles 6. Gloves 7. Towel or protective cloth 8. Bowl with water 9. Fine-grit sandpaper or sanding block Instructions: Step 1: Prepare your workspace Choose a flat, stable work surface with adequate lighting. It's essential to have a clutter-free area for safety and better maneuvering while cutting. Place a towel or protective cloth over your work surface to protect the plate and absorb vibrations created during cutting. Step 2: Marking the cutting line Using your marker pen, draw a circle or the desired shape on the inner part of the plate. This will be your guideline for cutting. Be as precise as possible to achieve the best results. Step 3: Apply masking tape Place masking tape or painter's tape around the marked line, leaving a small gap between the marker line and the tape. This helps prevent the plate from chipping during the cutting process. Step 4: Safety measures Put on your safety goggles and gloves to protect your eyes and hands while cutting the glass plate. Step 5: Cutting the plate If using a glass cutting tool, score along the marked line on the plate using firm pressure. The scored line should be continuous and clean. If using a Dremel rotary tool with a diamond cutting wheel attachment, gently cut along the marked line using steady, even pressure. Step 6: Breaking the plate To separate the inner part that you've cut, hold the plate over a bowl filled with water. Firmly press down on the scored line or cut line with your thumbs while slightly bending the plate. The inner part should come out, falling into the bowl of water. Note that this method may take a few tries, but be gentle as applying too much pressure can crack the entire plate. Step 7: Sanding the edges Use fine-grit sandpaper or a sanding block to smooth the cut edges of the plate. Be sure to sand both the inner and outer edges to avoid sharp edges and achieve a neat finish. Step 8: Clean up Rinse the plate with water to remove any dust or debris and dry it with a clean cloth. Your plate with the inner part cut out is now ready for use or display. Remember that this process requires patience and practice. If you're not confident about cutting the plate yourself, it's always best to consult a professional to prevent injury or damage to the plate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If The OPEN sign is not pretty, but it provides the information you need., can we conclude that \\"The OPEN sign was designed by a friend of mine.\\"?","completion":"Based on the statement \\"The OPEN sign is not pretty, but it provides the information you need,\\" we cannot directly conclude that \\"The OPEN sign was designed by a friend of mine.\\" These two statements are unrelated, and one does not necessarily lead to the other. To explore this further, let's break down the two statements and examine their differences. 1. \\"The OPEN sign is not pretty, but it provides the information you need.\\" This statement describes the appearance and functionality of an OPEN sign. The sign might not have a visually appealing design or any attention to aesthetics, but it serves its primary purpose, which is to convey the information that a place is open for business. The primary focus of this statement is on the appearance and purpose of the OPEN sign. 2. \\"The OPEN sign was designed by a friend of mine.\\" This statement reveals the origin of the sign's design and tells us who designed the sign. However, it does not provide any further information about the appearance, functionality, or effectiveness of the sign. The focus of this statement is on the relationship between the speaker and the sign's designer. Although one could argue that knowing the designer of the OPEN sign might help in understanding the reasoning behind the sign's appearance and functionality, we cannot draw a direct connection between the two statements. It is possible that the friend who designed the sign is an experienced designer who chose to prioritize functionality over aesthetics, or maybe the friend is an amateur designer who does not have the skills to create a more attractive sign. In either case, knowing who designed the sign does not alter the fact that the OPEN sign serves its intended purpose despite its appearance. In conclusion, the claim that \\"The OPEN sign was designed by a friend of mine\\" cannot be directly inferred from the statement \\"The OPEN sign is not pretty, but it provides the information you need.\\" These two pieces of information address different aspects of the sign (its design and functionality) and do not necessarily have a cause-and-effect relationship. To make any conclusions about the relationship between these two statements, additional context and information would be required."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Since Southern Democrat Jimmy Carter's comfortable victory in the state in 1976, the state had consistently leaned Republican in presidential elections until Democrat Barack Obama narrowly won the state in 2008. In the 1990s, Democrat Bill Clinton came within a point of winning the state in 1992 and also only narrowly lost the state in 1996. In the early 2000s, Republican George W. Bush easily won the state by over 12 points, but by 2008, demographic shifts, population growth, and increased liberalization in heavily populated areas such as the Research Triangle, Charlotte, Greensboro, Winston-Salem, Fayetteville, and Asheville, propelled Barack Obama to victory in North Carolina, the first Democrat to win the state since 1976. In 2012, North Carolina was again considered a competitive swing state, with the Democrats even holding their 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte. However, Republican Mitt Romney ultimately eked out a 2-point win in North Carolina, the only 2012 swing state that Obama lost, and one of only two states (along with Indiana) to flip from Obama in 2008 to the GOP in 2012.

(Associated Press) FILE - In this May 30, 2013 file photo provided by the Murnaghan family, Sarah Murnaghan, left, lies in her hospital bed next to adopted sister Ella on the 100th day of her stay in Children's Hospital... (Associated Press) The ruling from U.S. District Judge Michael Baylson involves 11-year-old Javier Acosta of the Bronx, who has cystic fibrosis. His mother filed a lawsuit Thursday that says he will die soon unless he gets a lung transplant. The decision comes a day after a national organ transplant network complied with Baylson's unusual order to place a dying 10-year-old girl on the list. Children under 12 are currently matched with pediatric donors, which are rare, or wait at the end of the adult list. Medical ethicists question the judge's intervention. But lawyer Stephen Harvey, who represents both families, fears that Javier and Sarah will die while the issue is reviewed. ||||| Pepper Hamilton LLP Javier Acosta, 11, is the second child allowed to be considered for an adult transplant list in Pennsylvania. A woman whose son died of cystic fibrosis in 2009 successfully sued on Thursday to get his younger brother, now 11, on the adult waiting list for a lung transplant. It's the second lawsuit of its kind filed in the past two days on behalf of a child waiting for a set of lungs, and the lawyer representing both families says to expect more. The suits have forced an emergency meeting of the board overseeing organ transplants. Court documents show that the mother of Javier Acosta filed suit on Thursday, after a judge forced Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to order the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, or OPTN, to make an exception for 10-year-old Sarah Murnaghan of Pennsylvania this week. “Javier is severely ill and if he does not receive a donated set of lungs very soon he will die,” the document filed by his mother, Milagros Martinez, reads. “Without one he will most likely die before his 12th birthday in August.” Like Sarah, Javier has cystic fibrosis -- an inherited genetic disease that can wreck a patient's lungs. The suit isn’t surprising, says bioethicist Arthur Caplan, who had predicted a flood of lawsuits as desperate parents see a way to help their dying children. \\"This is absolutely what I feared, that we would get a flood of families saying 'I want to get my child fixed up',\\" says Caplan, director of the division of medical ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center and a frequent NBC News contributor. \\"It’s 100 percent understandable. It’s also the reason that we try to have a system rather than a competition about who can have the most publicity or what a judge might think is the best use of organs.\\" On Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Michael Baylson issued a temporary restraining order directing Sebelius to suspend existing organ allocation rules after a frantic campaign by her mother scored headlines and widespread national sympathy. The lawsuits are a result of the complicated, two-tier rules that OPTN uses to try to allocate scarce organs in the fairest and most effective way. Adult organs go to patients in greatest need, divided by region to ensure that people who need organs get them quickly. But there are fewer organs available for children under 12, who are usually smaller than adults and cannot always use adult-sized organs. This means children usually wait longer for transplants. The existing lung allocation system was approved in 2005, replacing a first-come, first-served system. Under the new plan, deaths on the waiting list decreased by 40 percent, transplant experts say. Melissa Hatch of Philadelphia-based law firm Pepper Hamilton LLP represents both Sarah and Javier and says that may be true for adults, but more children died after the rules were changed. \\"They are not trying to jump the line,\\" Hatch said in a telephone interview. \\"What the under-12 rule did was two things. If you are a child under 12 you are not on the adult waiting list unless your doctor says you can be. Javier's and Sarah's doctors say both children ... can take an adult lung.\\" But under the rules, Hatch says, children put on the adult adult waiting list go to the back of the adult line. Hatch denies there would be a flood of lawsuits. \\"We estimate there are 16 children in the whole United States who are being hurt by this rule,\\" she says. She believes these children are in a unique position that's been overlooked by OPTN. The complaint on behalf of Javier says he has been on the waiting list since 2010. His brother, Jovan, died when he was 11, also waiting for a transplant, for lungs ravaged by cystic fibrosis, the complaint says. “Federal law requires equitable allocation of donated organs, but under the policies currently in effect, that requirement is not satisfied for children under 12, including Javier Acosta,” it says. “The pool of lungs donated from adults is more than 50 times larger than the pool of lungs donated from children,” it adds. “Javier’s doctors have decided that transplantation of a set of lungs from an adult is appropriate in his case.” Javier Acosta lives in New York but is being treated at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, according to the complaint. OPTN data shows that 222 people are on the list for a lung transplant in organ allocation Region 2, which covers Delaware, Washington, D.C., Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. Six children younger than 10 are on the list, and eight children aged 11 to 17 are on the list. Caplan says there are good reasons for OPTN's system. \\"The whole point of having rules is to avoid special pleading,\\" he said. \\"I also worry that this may not be the end of those appeals. Other people might say 'I am not being treated fairly. I want a judge to push me to the top of the list.'\\" Dr. John Roberts, president of the OPTN board of directors, says he's called a meeting for next week to review the guidelines. \\"In response to your request in your letter of May 31, 2013 requesting the OPTN to review OPTN lung allocation policy as soon as possible, and understanding the time-sensitive nature of this review, I have scheduled a meeting of the OPTN Executive Committee on Monday, June 10th,\\" he wrote Sebelius. \\"If the available data suggest that a change to the lung allocation policy is warranted, the Executive Committee would be able to approve an interim policy change and expedited plan for implementation at that time. In addition to any action the Executive Committee may take on Monday, the OPTN will continue our thorough review of the pediatric lung allocation policy.\\" Steve Harvey of Pepper Hamilton and stresses that the court orders are only temporary while the OPTN considers the rules. \\"We understand that the OPTN formed a committee to review the policy that discriminates against children under 12 in the system for allocating lungs. We think the OPTN should not apply the rule to children while it reviews the matter because of the compelling argument that the policy is wrong and the risk that some children will die in the meantime,\\" Harvey said in a statement. \\"The orders granted this week have given Sarah and Javier hope. But Sarah and Javier are not alone,\\" Harvey added. \\"Doctors need donated organs in order to give new life to patients, and organ scarcity is a major problem in our country. We hope that Sarah and Javier’s stories will remind us all to become organ donors and, if we face the tragedy of the loss of a loved one, consider a directed donation of their organs.\\" According to OPTN, 75,688 people are actively waiting for organ transplants, and 6,891 transplants have been done so far this year. Organs have been donated from 3,412 people this year -- far short of what is needed.

Here are possible answers to this question: - home - pet shop - lap - dog pound - alley I believe the correct choice is \\"lap\\", here's why: A:","completion":"The correct choice could actually be any of the given options depending on the specific situation or context in which the tabby cat finds itself. Let's discuss each possibility in detail to understand why each of them might be correct: 1. Home: The most common and ideal place for a tabby cat or any domestic cat would be in its owner's home. Many people keep cats as pets, and they provide them with a safe and comfortable environment where they can thrive. A tabby cat might be found laying on a couch, a bed, or any other cozy spot in the home. Cats generally love warmth and will often seek out comfortable and warm places to rest in their homes. 2. Pet Shop: A pet shop is another place where one might find a tabby cat laying. Pet shops often sell various types of animals, including cats. If a tabby cat is awaiting adoption or is being displayed for potential buyers, it may settle down in a comfortable spot within the shop or its enclosure. While it's not the most ideal environment for a cat as compared to a loving home, tabby cats can still be found laying in pet shops. 3. Lap: A tabby cat might indeed be found laying on someone's lap. Cats are known for their affectionate nature and seeking warmth and comfort from their owners. It's not uncommon for cats to curl up on their owners' laps, seeking physical closeness, warmth, and attention. This intimate gesture is common among domestic cats, so finding a tabby cat laying on a lap is very plausible and can be considered as an interaction that strengthens the bond between the cat and its owner. 4. Dog Pound: While it's not the most pleasant place for a cat, some tabby cats might unfortunately end up in a dog pound or an animal shelter. These facilities take care of stray and abandoned animals, and this may include cats. Some tabby cats might be found laying in a cage or resting area within these facilities while waiting to be adopted by a loving family. These places have dedicated staff who strive to provide the best care possible for the animals, but it is important to remember that cats and other animals should not be left in shelters, pounds or on the streets when possible. 5. Alley: As for the final option, alley, this is another location where a tabby cat might be found laying. In cases where the cat is a stray or has been abandoned, it may seek shelter and rest in alleys or other secluded urban spaces. A cat's instinct for survival will drive it to find hidden and secure places away from potential dangers. It is not ideal for any cat to be wandering the streets, but sadly, this can be a reality for some tabby cats. These cats may rest in alleyways until they can find a safer and more permanent home. In conclusion, while it is true that a tabby cat might be found laying on someone's lap, this is not the only correct answer to the question. The context of the situation and the specifics surrounding the cat would determine which of these options would be the most accurate answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"Second, economic theory predicts that some incentives matter more than others, and the data confirm the Executions prevent murders, but convictions prevent even more murders.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Incentives have varying degrees of effectiveness.\\"?","completion":"If the premise \\"Second, economic theory predicts that some incentives matter more than others, and the data confirm the Executions prevent murders, but convictions prevent even more murders\\" is true, it provides evidence that supports the hypothesis \\"Incentives have varying degrees of effectiveness.\\" Let's delve deeper into how this premise relates to the hypothesis and what it tells us about the effectiveness of incentives. First, it is important to understand the central elements of the premise: 1. Economic theory predicts that some incentives matter more than others. 2. The data confirms the differences in the effectiveness of incentives. 3. Executions prevent murders (one type of incentive). 4. Convictions prevent even more murders (another type of incentive). The premise highlights the idea that not all incentives are equally effective in achieving their objectives. In this specific case, both executions and convictions are considered incentives within the criminal justice system designed to prevent or reduce the incidence of murders. However, the premise suggests that convictions are a more effective deterrent for potential murderers than the threat of executions. To relate this premise to the hypothesis \\"Incentives have varying degrees of effectiveness,\\" let's break down the hypothesis into its key components: 1. Incentives are tools used to encourage or discourage specific behaviors. 2. The effectiveness of these incentives is not uniform; instead, they vary in their ability to influence behavior. By comparing the elements of the premise and the hypothesis, we can see a clear connection. The premise offers an example (convictions and executions) of incentives having varying degrees of effectiveness. It suggests that, in accordance with economic theory, different incentives can encourage or discourage certain behaviors to varying extents. This observation is further supported by empirical data that confirms convictions as a more potent deterrent for murders than executions. Therefore, if the premise under consideration is true, it provides insight and evidence supporting the hypothesis that incentives have varying degrees of effectiveness. By demonstrating that some incentives (in this case, convictions) can exert a more significant influence on behavior than others (executions), we can piece together a more nuanced understanding of the role incentives play in shaping individual actions and societal outcomes. It is crucial to recognize these differences in effectiveness when designing policy interventions and creating incentives that can most effectively deter undesirable behavior while promoting desirable ones."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(June 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) An unnamed gunslinger referred to as The Lady enters the Old West town of Redemption circa 1881, where she enters a single elimination gunfighting contest held by Redemption's ruthless mayor and former outlaw John Herod. While there she meets Cort, a former Herod henchman turned preacher whom Herod has captured and forced to enter the contest. During her first night in town, The Lady saves Cort's life by shooting the rope Herod's men had hanged Cort from. She also meets \\"The Kid\\", a brash young man who runs the general store and who hopes to impress Herod. The Kid believes Herod is his father and that he can earn his father's respect by entering and winning the contest. In the first round of duels The Kid defeats a Swedish quick-draw champion while Herod kills a braggart named Ace Hanlon, who had taken credit for some of Herod's own accomplishments. The Lady defeats an enemy she had previously left shackled to a wagon. Cort, who has renounced violence and doesn't have a weapon, is taken to the general store. Herod buys Cort a gun and decrees that Cort (an exceptionally skilled gunfighter) can only have one bullet at a time so that he doesn't shoot his way out of town. Despite telling everyone he wouldn't fight, Cort winds up drawing his gun and winning his first round fight. During a rainstorm Herod meets with Clay Cantrell, a professional gunfighter hired by the townspeople to kill Herod. Before they duel, Herod changes the rules and proclaims that all contests are now to the death. After killing Cantrell, Herod angrily addresses the townspeople and informs them that he will continue to raise his taxes on them until they understand that he is in charge of everything.

Information: - The Commodore PET (Personal Electronic Transactor) is a line of home/personal computers produced starting in 1977 by Commodore International. A top-seller in the Canadian and United States educational markets, it was Commodore's first full-featured computer, and formed the basis for their entire 8-bit product line, including the Commodore 64. The first model, which was named the PET 2001, was the third personal computer ever made available to retail consumers, after the Apple II and TRS-80. - The Commodore 64, also known as the C64, C-64, C= 64, or occasionally CBM 64 or VIC-64 in Sweden, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. It is listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units. Volume production started in early 1982, marketing in August for . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its of RAM. It had superior sound and graphical specifications compared to other earlier systems such as the Apple II and Atari 800, with multi-color sprites and a more advanced sound processor. - Commodore International (or Commodore International Limited) was a North American home computer and electronics manufacturer. Commodore International (CI), along with its subsidiary Commodore Business Machines (CBM), participated in the development of the homepersonal computer industry in the 1970s and 1980s. The company developed and marketed one of the world's best-selling desktop computers, the Commodore 64 (1982) and released its Amiga computer line in July 1985. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - A 16-bit register can store 2 different values. The signed range of integer values that can be stored in 16 bits is -32,768 (-1 × 2) through 32,767 (2 - 1); the unsigned range is 0 through 65,535 (2 - 1). Since 2 is 65,536, a processor with 16-bit memory addresses can directly access 64 KiB of byte-addressable memory. - A player character or playable character (PC) is a fictional character in a role-playing or video game whose actions are directly controlled by a player of the game rather than the rules of the game. The characters that are not controlled by a player are called non-player characters (NPCs). The actions of non-player characters are typically handled by the game itself in video games, or according to rules followed by a gamemaster refereeing tabletop role-playing games. The player character functions as a fictional, alternate body for the player controlling it. - The VIC-20 (Germany: VC-20; Japan: VIC-1001) is an 8-bit home computer that was sold by Commodore Business Machines. The VIC-20 was announced in 1980, roughly three years after Commodore's first personal computer, the PET. The VIC-20 was the first computer of any description to sell one million units. - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s. - Better Dead Than Alien is a shoot ' em up game similar to Space Invaders published in 1988 for 16 - bit main platforms and Commodore 64 by Electra in its first release . The player takes control of hero Brad Zoom 's ship in his quest to save civilization from aliens . The game is full of humor and the intro screen is in magazine style . - Shoot 'em up (also known as shmup or STG) is a subgenre of the shooter genre of video games. In a shoot 'em up, the player character engages in a lone assault, often in a spacecraft or aircraft, shooting large numbers of enemies while dodging their attacks. There is no consensus as to which design elements compose a shoot 'em up. Some restrict the definition to games featuring spacecraft and certain types of character movement; others allow a broader definition including characters on foot and a variety of perspectives. Shoot 'em ups call for fast reactions and for the player to memorize levels and enemy attack patterns. \\"Bullet hell\\" games feature overwhelming numbers of enemy projectiles. - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a .

Did someone email you a AAS file and you're not sure how to open it? Maybe you have found a AAS file on your computer and wondering what it's for? Windows might tell you that you can't open it, or in the worst case, you might encounter a AAS file related error message. Make this lower case.","completion":"Did someone email you an aas file and you're not sure how to open it? Maybe you have found an aas file on your computer and wondering what it's for? Windows might tell you that you can't open it, or in the worst case, you might encounter an aas file related error message. Before we begin, let's first understand what an AAS file is. An AAS file is specifically an Authenticated Attribute System file, which is associated with digital signatures, security certificates, and cryptographic functions. These files play a significant role in ensuring the integrity and security of online activities, such as secure browsing, encrypted communications, and verifying the legitimacy of digital documents. However, since you have an AAS file that you need to open or understand its purpose, let's explore different approaches to handle these files: 1. Verify if the AAS file is not corrupted: Sometimes, you might encounter issues with opening an AAS file if it's partially downloaded, or there was an interruption during a file transfer. Make sure that the file you've received is complete and intact by asking the sender to re-send it or by verifying its size and contents. 2. Use the appropriate program: Microsoft Windows may not natively support opening AAS files, so you will need a compatible software to open or view them. Some programs that can handle AAS files are: - OpenSSL: A widely-used software library for applications requiring secure communication over computer networks. OpenSSL can be used for performing operations on AAS files, such as decryption, encryption, and code signing. - Adobe Acrobat: A PDF reader that can also work with security certificates, digital signatures, and related file formats like AAS. 3. Install the required software or plugins for your browser: If the AAS file corresponds to a security certificate or digital signature used on the web, you may need to install the appropriate software or plugin for your browser. For example, you may need specific plugins if you are using Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox to access the website employing the AAS file. 4. Reach out to the sender or owner of the AAS file: If you are unsure of the purpose of the AAS file you have received or found on your computer, it's always a good idea to get in touch with the person who sent it or the individual responsible for that file. They can provide you with any necessary information or guidance on how to read or use the file. 5. Seek assistance from a professional: If you are still having trouble with the AAS file, consider seeking help from a professional familiar with digital certificates, cryptography, or information security. They can analyze the file and give you a better understanding of its contents and purpose. In conclusion, opening and understanding an AAS file requires specific software or applications that deal with digital signatures and security certificates. Ensure that you follow the appropriate steps to open the file, and if needed, reach out to professionals or the file sender for assistance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the fold of loose skin called hanging from the throat or neck of an animal or bird????","completion":"The fold of loose skin hanging from the throat or neck of an animal or bird is called a \\"dewlap.\\" It is an external anatomical structure that consists of a flap of skin and, in some cases, also contains underlying soft connective tissue and fat deposits. The dewlap is commonly associated with certain animals and birds and serves various purposes, depending on the species. Among birds, the most well-known possessors of a dewlap are turkeys and certain poultry species like chickens and ducks. In turkeys, male birds called toms have a much larger and more pronounced dewlap than females. During courtship displays, the dewlap becomes engorged with blood, and its size and color can become more pronounced, assisting the male in attracting a mate. In mammals, some of the more recognizable animals known to have dewlaps include cattle, antelopes, and the American elk. The dewlap can be found in both males and females of these species, although it is typically larger and more developed in males. Many ungulates, such as giraffes, possess a dewlap as well, with its size varying among different species. One of the primary functions of a dewlap in animals is thermoregulation – meaning it helps the animal regulate its body temperature. The loose skin increases the surface area, allowing the blood vessels near the skin to dissipate heat more effectively, providing a cooling effect for the animal. In some species, the dewlap serves other purposes, such as a visual cue for communication. For example, in lizards like the Anolis genus, the dewlap is brightly colored and can be extended to signal other members of the same species. Such signals are commonly related to territorial disputes or courting rituals. A particularly large and conspicuous dewlap in male animals can indicate good health and strength, which may deter potential rivals or attract potential mates. Another potential function of the dewlap in mammals is related to fat storage. Some researchers have suggested that the dewlap acts as a reservoir of fat deposits, which would make it an energy reserve that can be used during times of food scarcity. In conclusion, a dewlap is a fold of loose skin found predominantly in the throat or neck region of some animals and birds, including cattle, antelopes, elk, giraffes, turkeys, and certain lizard species. Depending on the species, the dewlap can serve various purposes such as thermoregulation, communication, or energy storage."},{"prompt":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Cleveland has won the distinction of being the worst city in the United States, according to a new survey.

Both sentences do share a similar theme: that a skier is falling into the snow. This implies an action taking place in a specific setting – a skier in the act of falling on a snow-covered slope. Therefore, they share a common language structure, and the event they describe is largely the same. However, the extra detail provided in the second sentence – that the skier is falling \\"face first\\" – slightly changes the meaning from the first sentence. This information adds a specific direction to the skier's fall and potentially implies a greater sense of danger or urgency, thus it brings additional meaning not present in the first sentence. In a nutshell, while they both align on the central idea of a skier falling into the snow, the descriptive complexity in the second sentence adds an element not covered by the first. Therefore, while they are very similar, they do not entirely \\"mean the same thing\\". This is why a rating of 4, rather than a perfect 5, seems more suitable to identify this level of similarity.

Aceasta a fost și o dovadă clară a faptului că țările din regiunea balcanică au întâmpinat un set destul de complex de probleme și situații care au avut un impact semnificativ asupra stabilității și securității întregului continent. În acest context, colaborarea dintre statele din această parte a lumii a devenit primordială pentru atingerea obiectivelor comune și rezolvarea problemelor cu care se confruntă. În acest articol, Orest Erzeni, un comentator bine-cunoscut pentru Southeast European Times, prezintă o analiză detaliată a situației politice și economice din Albania și dezvoltarea relațiilor sale cu țările vecine și instituțiile internaționale. Erzeni discută în principal despre progresele înregistrate în domeniul drepturilor omului, în lupta împotriva crimei organizate și în integrarea europeană a Albaniei. Autorul subliniază faptul că statul albanez a întreprins numeroase reforme în vederea îmbunătățirii economiei locale și atingerii unor standarde europene adecvate. Printre acestea, putem enumera liberalizarea pieței, privatizarea întreprinderilor de stat și investițiile în infrastructură. De asemenea, autorul menționează importanța colaborării regionale pentru stabilizarea economiei și promovarea unei conviețuiri pașnice și în condiții de siguranță. În acest sens, Erzeni ridică problema corupției care continuă să existe în climatul albanez și care afectează în mod semnificativ dezvoltarea durabilă a țării. El afirmă că, în pofida măsurilor luate de autorități în domeniul luptei împotriva corupției, fenomenul continuă să existe la nivel înalt și să provoace daune economiei naționale. Pentru a face față acestei situații, autorul insistă asupra necesității adoptării unor politici riguroase și a unui angajament serios din partea instituțiilor statului. Erzeni subliniază, de asemenea, slăbiciunile sistemului judiciar din Albania, dar consideră că progresele realizate în ultimii ani sunt de natură să ofere speranță pentru un viitor mai bun. În opinia sa, cooperarea cu statele vecine și instituțiile internaționale este esențială pentru ca Albania să se integreze cu succes în Uniunea Europeană și să devină un veritabil punct de referință pentru regiune. În încheiere, Orest Erzeni remarcă faptul că există în continuare numeroase provocări cu care Albania și regiunea balcanică se confruntă. Totuși, el rămâne optimist în privința parcursului european al acestora și consideră că, datorită colaborării și eforturilor comune, aceste țări vor reuși să transforme această parte a continentului într-un spațiu caracterizat prin stabilitate, prosperitate și pace."},{"prompt":"Question: Greg was studying Bohr's model. He found it helpful to categorize different scenarios in the model. First, he labeled electron with higher energy as cat A, and electron with lower energy as cat B. Then he labeled electron that gained energy as cat C, and election that lost energy as cat D. Which electron would be closer to the nucleus, cat A or cat B? Hint: As a young man, Bohr worked in Rutherford’s lab in England. Because Rutherford’s model was weak on the position of the electrons, Bohr focused on them. He hypothesized that electrons can move around the nucleus only at fixed distances from the nucleus based on the amount of energy they have. He called these fixed distances energy levels, or electron shells. He thought of them as concentric spheres, with the nucleus at the center of each sphere. In other words, the shells consisted of sphere within sphere within sphere. Furthermore, electrons with less energy would be found at lower energy levels, closer to the nucleus. Those with more energy would be found at higher energy levels, farther from the nucleus. Bohr also hypothesized that if an electron absorbed just the right amount of energy, it would jump to the next higher energy level. Conversely, if it lost the same amount of energy, it would jump back to its original energy level. However, an electron could never exist in between two energy levels.

Options are: 1). no 2). yes","completion":"2). yes Both questions inquire about how the procurement function or officer can add value to a company or organization. Although one question specifically focuses on the procurement officer's role, while the other focuses on the procurement function as a whole, the essence of both questions is the same. A procurement officer plays a crucial role in adding value to a company through the following ways: 1. Cost Savings and Efficiencies: Procurement officers can identify opportunities to reduce costs by negotiating favorable contract terms with suppliers, leveraging economies of scale through bulk purchasing, and constantly analyzing market trends to identify opportunities for reduced pricing or innovative products. 2. Supplier Relationship Management: Building and maintaining strong relationships with key suppliers is essential for continuous improvement and ensuring that supplier performance meets or exceeds expectations. Procurement officers play a pivotal role in facilitating effective communication, addressing potential issues, and fostering collaboration with suppliers in order to achieve mutual benefits. 3. Risk Management: Procurement officers are responsible for identifying and mitigating potential risks associated with the supply chain. This includes analyzing political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental (PESTLE) factors that can impact supply, as well as monitoring suppliers' financial stability, ethical behavior, and compliance with industry regulations. 4. Sustainable and Ethical Procurement: Companies increasingly recognize the importance of incorporating sustainability and ethical practices into procurement processes. The procurement officer supports this by establishing guidelines and criteria for selecting suppliers that adhere to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. This not only helps the company maintain a positive reputation, but also aligns its operations with socially responsible values. 5. Innovation: Procurement officers can add value to a company by encouraging and promoting the adoption of innovative products, services, and processes within the organization. By actively seeking out innovations from suppliers, procurement officers can contribute to the ongoing improvement and competitiveness of the company. 6. Process Improvements: A continuous improvement mindset should be adopted in the procurement function. The procurement officer can spearhead the streamlining and optimization of procurement processes, reducing bottlenecks, and facilitating communication between various stakeholders across the organization. By regularly reviewing and refining procurement processes, the officer can ensure the function is agile, efficient, and able to add value to the organization. 7. Internal Collaboration: The procurement officer can also work closely with other business functions, such as finance, operations, and marketing, to ensure alignment of procurement strategies with overall company objectives. This collaboration can help identify potential areas for cost savings, operational efficiencies, and value creation across the organization. In summary, the procurement officer, as well as the procurement function, can add significant value to a company by focusing on cost savings, supplier relationship management, risk management, sustainable and ethical procurement, innovation, process improvements, and internal collaboration. By consistently striving to optimize and enhance procurement activities, companies can achieve better outcomes, foster growth, and improve their overall competitiveness within the market."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This created a tense and uncomfortable situation, as Christopher felt that his concerns and needs were being disregarded by William. He found himself feeling both frustrated and helpless in this predicament, as his attempts to establish boundaries with William appeared to have fallen on deaf ears. Finding himself at a loss for what to do next, Christopher decided to take a step back and analyze the situation more closely. He realized that simply telling William to stop was not an effective method of communication in this specific circumstance. As such, he started to research different conflict resolution strategies and communication techniques in an effort to find a more constructive way of addressing the issue at hand. Christopher came across a technique called assertive communication, which emphasizes expressing one's thoughts, feelings, and needs directly and respectfully. He thought this approach might be more effective in resolving the conflict with William and decided to give it a try. The next time the issue arose between them, Christopher chose to engage in a more assertive form of communication with William. He calmly but confidently stated his feelings regarding the issue and explained how it was impacting him and their relationship. He also provided clear expectations of what he needed from William in order to feel respected and comfortable moving forward. To Christopher's relief, this approach seemed to resonate more strongly with William, who appeared to listen more attentively and offer a more thoughtful response. They discussed the matter openly and honestly, with both individuals expressing their perspectives and working collaboratively to find a resolution that would meet both of their needs. Following this exchange, it became evident that the previous incidents were not a result of malicious intent on William's part, but rather a lack of understanding and awareness of how his actions were impacting Christopher. With this newfound knowledge, they were able to come to an agreement and develop a plan of action to prevent the recurrence of the issue in the future. Christopher’s efforts to adopt a new communication style and engage in open dialogue with William allowed them to confront this issue in a healthier and more productive manner. As a result, their relationship improved, mutual understanding deepened, and they could move forward with a renewed sense of trust and respect for one another’s needs and boundaries. This also served as a valuable learning experience for both of them, highlighting the importance of effective communication and the potential for personal growth when faced with conflict."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If I tell you that Translating organelles are involved in making proteins, and ask you the question \\"translating organelles are involved in doing what with proteins\\", is the correct answer \\"recycling\\"?","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"recycling\\". The term \\"translating organelles\\" refers to the cellular structures that are involved in the synthesis or production of proteins from the genetic information stored in the DNA. The process by which proteins are synthesized, or built, is known as translation. In the context of cellular biology, \\"translating organelles\\" primarily refers to the ribosomes. Ribosomes are the cellular structures responsible for translating the genetic code, carried by messenger RNA (mRNA), into amino acid sequences which ultimately form proteins. The process of protein synthesis (translation) can be briefly summarized as follows: 1. Transcription: The genetic information present in a specific gene within DNA is transcribed into a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule. 2. Processing: The newly-formed mRNA is processed by splicing and the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail. This helps in stabilizing the mRNA and assisting its transport to the cytoplasm. 3. Translation initiation: In the cytoplasm, the mRNA associates with ribosomes, which are the \\"translating organelles\\". The ribosome recognizes and binds the start codon (usually an AUG) on the mRNA, initiating translation. 4. Elongation: The ribosome reads the mRNA codons, which are groups of three mRNA nucleotides specifying an amino acid. Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, with the matching three-nucleotide anti-codon sequence, bring in the corresponding amino acid. The amino acid chain is elongated as the ribosome continues reading the mRNA codons. 5. Termination: When a stop codon is read by the ribosome, the translation process comes to an end, and the finished protein is released. In contrast, \\"recycling\\" is generally used in reference to processes in which cellular organelles or proteins are broken down, either to be reused or to be cleared away from the cell. For example, a structure called the proteasome is responsible for recycling proteins that are either damaged or no longer needed by the cell, thus maintaining cellular protein homeostasis. In summary, \\"translating organelles\\" are involved in the process of synthesizing, or making, proteins from genetic information stored in DNA, rather than recycling proteins."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The transportation of dyed fabric from Denmark to a making-up enterprise in Poland, involving a distance of 1,000 km, is a process that likely involves coordination between various parties. These may include fabric manufacturers, dyeing facilities, and operators of making-up enterprises, as well as freight carriers and logistics providers. The primary goal of this process is to efficiently and safely transport the fabric to its destination for further processing or manufacturing. From an environmental perspective, the use of lorry transport has some known effects on the ecosystem, mainly derived from the emission of greenhouse gases, such as CO2, due to the consumption of fossil fuels. Consequently, efforts to minimize the overall environmental impact of such transportation should be considered, including the use of alternative, more sustainable modes of transport or cleaner technologies for cargo vehicles. Additionally, enhancing supply chain efficiency by implementing an optimization strategy could lead to reduced travel distances or transportations requirements, ultimately contributing to lower overall emissions. In conclusion, it is essential to ensure that the dyed fabric is transported efficiently, safely, and sustainably from the point of origin in Denmark to the making-up enterprise in Poland. By considering the potential environmental impacts and exploring ways to minimize them, the entire transportation process can be improved, ultimately leading to a more sustainable, eco-friendly, and cost-effective supply chain for all parties involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Next question: where did the confederacy surrender to the union?","completion":"The surrender of the Confederate Army to the Union Army, effectively ending the American Civil War, took place at multiple locations between April and June 1865. It was not a single event, but rather a series of surrenders by various Confederate forces under different commanders. Here are some of the key surrenders that signaled the end of the Confederacy: 1. Surrender of Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Court House (April 9, 1865): Perhaps the most well-known surrender came from General Robert E. Lee, the commander of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. After a series of battles and a long retreat, Lee decided that further resistance would only cause more suffering and loss of life for his troops. On April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered his army to Union General Ulysses S. Grant at the village of Appomattox Court House in Virginia. The terms of surrender were generous, allowing Confederate soldiers to keep their horses and mules for their work on the farms, as well as their sidearms. 2. Surrender of Joseph E. Johnston at Bennett Place (April 26, 1865): About two weeks after Lee's surrender, Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston, who commanded the largest remaining Confederate force, met with Union General William T. Sherman at a farmhouse known as Bennett Place (or Bennett Farm) near Durham, North Carolina. Johnston's surrender encompassed more than 89,000 soldiers from various southern states, making it the largest surrender of the Civil War. 3. Surrender of Richard Taylor in Citronelle, Alabama (May 4, 1865): After the major surrenders in Virginia and North Carolina, Confederate forces still remained active in the Deep South. One of these forces was led by Lieutenant General Richard Taylor, son of former U.S. President Zachary Taylor. His command included parts of Alabama, Mississippi, and eastern Louisiana. On May 4, Taylor surrendered his forces to Union General Edward Canby at Citronelle, Alabama. 4. Surrender of Edmund Kirby Smith at Galveston, Texas (May 26, 1865, and June 2, 1865): The last major Confederate force to surrender was that of General Edmund Kirby Smith, who commanded the Trans-Mississippi Department, an area that included Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas, as well as Indian Territory. With his headquarters in Shreveport, Louisiana, Kirby Smith soon realized the Confederacy's cause was lost when he received news of Lee and Johnston's surrenders. Though he initially tried to continue the fight, his subordinates refused to do so. Kirby Smith officially accepted the surrender terms that Union General Canby provided on May 26, 1865. The formal surrender ceremony took place later, on June 2, 1865, in Galveston, Texas. While these are the most notable surrenders, there were other smaller surrenders and disbandments of Confederate forces throughout the South during this time. With these surrenders, effective resistance from the Confederacy came to an end, leading to the eventual reunification of the United States."},{"prompt":"I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was attending school in Knutsford by 1818? from the following article ? Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in Knutsford, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe. His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire. At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher. Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford. Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study. At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836. During his time abroad he travelled in Germany and southern France, studying Romanesque and early Gothic architecture. He had intended to travel further into northern France, but his tour was curtailed in Paris owing to \\"fatigue and illness\\".... The answer is:","completion":"Edmund.

Article: Human beings have a natural desire to explore the unknown. People with a strong interest in space like to say it is the last place left to explore. But scientists are warning that space exploration for long periods is not going to be easy. They say the human body is not designed to stay in space over an extended period. The New York Times recently published a report about scientists who are preparing astronauts for a trip to the Moon. The newspaper said the scientists want to make sure that their crews return home in good health. But there are many problems to be solved before people are ready for long trips to the Moon, an asteroid or even the planet Mars. Humans developed on a planet with a surface that is more than 70 percent water. Our bodies are also about 70 percent water. When there is no gravity that water moves up toward the head, raising pressure in the skull. Arms and legs grow weaker at what is called zero gravity because they no longer need to push against the force of gravity. Five years ago, astronauts who spent weeks in space reported a change in their eyesight. These astronauts were members of the crew on the International Space Station. Research showed a change in the shape of their eyes. Normally-round eyeballs had become flat during time in space. The research also showed that the right eye was affected more than the left, and that men were more affected than women. Scientists could not find an explanation for the differences. Bone loss was one of the problems first reported by astronauts returning to Earth after longer stays in space. So scientists designed exercise machines to use on the space station. Tests showed that the exercise equipment helped space travelers keep their bones almost as strong as when they left Earth. There are other health issues for astronauts who spend a long time in space. They may have problems eating and sleeping. But the biggest health issue is exposure to radiation. On Earth, human beings are protected by the atmosphere and the planet's magnetic field. In...

A social worker named Mullins (Milton Selzer) has Ellie temporarily housed in a hospital, but Ellie wants to leave and go in search of her estranged father, whom she has never met. Mullins refuses, since Ellie is still a minor and technically a ward of the state, and Mullins says if she leaves, he will have to report it to the sheriff.

By John Greechan and Stephen Mcgowan Ronny Deila's former right-hand man has revealed how the new Celtic boss had talked himself into an instant promotion - moving from potential Parkhead backroom boy to No 1 contender for the top job. Lifting the lid on a process that saw the relatively unknown Stromsgodset manager handed control of the Champions League hopefuls, David Nielsen said his close friend and confidant would have been willing to work under a more high-profile head coach like Roy Keane. But Nielsen, former assistant and now interim successor to Deila, insisted that Celtic majority shareholder Dermot Desmond and chief executive Peter Lawwell had been completely won over in the space of a single interview - so much so that they put all their faith in a 38-year-old who has never worked outside of Norway. ‘He said: “You know we’re going to end up on the touchline against each other going for the OPTIONS: - Celtic”. - Champions League”. - David Nielsen”. - Deila”. - Dermot Desmond”. - John Collins”. - John Greechan”. - Nielsen”. - Norway”. - Parkhead”. - Peter Lawwell”. - Ronny Deila”. - Roy Keane”. - Stephen Mcgowan”. - Stromsgodset”.","completion":"Celtic job one day, David,” Ronny Deila told me. And when that day came, it was clear that his ambition and vision had paid off. Dermot Desmond and Peter Lawwell had seen something special in him, something that set him apart from other candidates like Roy Keane. And so, with their full support, Ronny Deila stepped up to take on the challenge of leading Celtic in their quest for success both domestically and in the Champions League. It's a testament to his determination and drive that he managed to transform a potential backroom role into the top job at Parkhead, and now he's ready to show everyone what he's capable of.’ Step 1: Identify the incomplete sentence and the context it needs: In this case, the passage is talking about Ronny Deila's journey to becoming Celtic's top role and eventually competing against his friend, David Nielsen. Step 2: Choose an option that fits the context and completes the sentence: The best option here is \\"- Champions League”. This option complements the ongoing discussion about Deila's journey to a head coach position, and it also sets up a competitive stage where Deila and Nielsen will eventually face off as adversaries.

In this statement, the speaker is addressing the involvement of certain individuals in discussing two specific proposals, numbered 29 and 30. They are highlighting the importance of both proposals and emphasizing that proposal 30 holds significant relevance. Regarding the 'social clause', this term typically refers to provisions in agreements (e.g. trade, environmental or labor) which are designed to protect and promote social rights, welfare, and standards. These clauses aim to address concerns related to working conditions, income inequality, and sustainable development. In this context, proposal 29 seems to be related to a social clause within a particular agreement. Although the speaker does not provide further information about what proposal 30 entails, they stress its importance in the discussion. This suggests that proposal 30 might either complement or extend the social clause mentioned earlier, or it could introduce new measures relevant to the overarching issue.

After learning about the depression, Robert consoled father while Michael didn't as Possible answers: [A]. Robert was kind.; [B]. Michael was kind.;","completion":"After learning about the depression, Robert consoled father while Michael didn't, as Robert was kind and considerate, whereas Michael struggled with expressing empathy. Robert, being a naturally compassionate person, was deeply affected by the news of his father's depression. He made it a top priority to ensure that his father received the emotional support he needed during this difficult time. Robert took the time to listen attentively when his father needed to talk about his feelings, and offered words of encouragement and love. In contrast, Michael had a harder time understanding and empathizing with the emotional turmoil his father was experiencing. As a result, he found it challenging to provide the same level of emotional support as his kind sibling. Michael, though not intentionally unkind, had a tendency to distance himself from emotionally charged situations, which often led to perceived indifference or lack of support. This difference in empathy between the two brothers did not necessarily imply that one was better than the other; rather, it highlighted the unique qualities that each of them possessed. Robert's considerate nature made him an excellent confidant and shoulder to lean on, while Michael's practicality and forthrightness allowed him to provide solutions and handle matters objectively. While Robert spent hours talking to their father, offering a comforting presence in his times of need, Michael worked on researching treatments and therapies available for individuals suffering from depression. He tried to help his father in his own way by gathering information and making appointments with mental health professionals. Michael's efforts, though not as overtly supportive as Robert's, still demonstrated that he too cared and wanted to see their father improve. Over time, both Robert and Michael came to understand the importance of balancing emotional support with practical strategies to help their father through his struggle with depression. They learned to work together, utilizing their individual strengths, to provide the care and support needed for their father's well-being. In conclusion, Robert's inherent kindness and ability to empathize made it easier for him to console his father, while Michael's demonstrative kindness was less pronounced but still present in his efforts to find practical solutions. Both brothers cared deeply for their father, and each contributed to helping him through his depression in their own unique way."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

While negotiating a deal with Omar in Yemen he is arrested and thrown into a Yemeni jail. Later, Samir and Omar become friends, and when Omar's people arrange an escape, they take Samir with them. They meet Fareed, a lieutenant in the al-Nathir terrorist organization. FBI Special Agent Roy Clayton suspects Samir has been radicalized and begins tracking him. Joining al-Nathir, Samir uses the skills he learned as a Special Forces Engineer Sergeant with the U.S. Army Special Forces to bomb the U.S. consulate in Nice, France. It is revealed that Samir is working under deep cover for a US intelligence contractor, Carter; Samir is devastated when he learns that despite Carter's covert efforts, innocent people perished in the consulate bombing. Impressed with Samir, Fareed introduces him to leader Nathir, who discloses a plot to place suicide bombers on 50 buses in the U.S. during Thanksgiving and instructs Samir to act as liaison to each of the al-Nathir sleeper bombers. Later, Carter unwittingly interrupts a meeting between Samir and Omar, and is killed by Omar. Samir reveals his deep cover to Agent Clayton, who tracks him to Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. While on board a cargo ship to Marseille, France, Samir kills Nathir and Fareed, and tells an enraged Omar that by targeting innocents they betrayed Islam. Samir then tells Omar that he switched the bombers' emails and placed them all on the same bus, so all of them died without victims (except for the driver of the one bus).

Another 160 men under Major T.O. Palmer were stationed outside the area with vehicles to evacuate the civilian population in the surrounding region should that prove necessary. They had enough vehicles to move 450 people to safety, and had food and supplies to last them for two days. Arrangements were made for Alamogordo Army Air Field to provide accommodation. Groves had warned the Governor of New Mexico, John J. Dempsey, that martial law might have to be declared in the southwestern part of the state.Shelters were established 10,000 yards (9,100 m) due north, west and south of the tower, known as N-10,000, W-10,000 and S-10,000.

Her mother, Laura, has just remarried a seemingly charming and wealthy businessman named Patrick, who moves in with them. Initially, Mia is resistant to the idea of having a new stepfather and displays a rebellious attitude, determined to make Patrick's life difficult, believing that he is trying to replace her deceased father, James. Unexpectedly, Mia starts noticing some oddities about Patrick. He appears secretive about his past, and no one seems to know much about him or his family. Overwhelmed by curiosity, Mia enlists the help of her best friend, Zoe, and together, they embark on a personal mission to unravel Patrick's true identity. As they dig deeper into Patrick's past, they stumble upon a series of unsettling revelations. The first one is that he has changed his name multiple times, and his companies are tangled up in suspicious business deals. Additionally, they find out that Patrick has been married thrice, and each of his previous spouses passed away under mysterious circumstances. Each new revelation thickens the plot and drives Mia to become even more determined to uncover the truth. The girls eventually confide in Laura, who dismisses their suspicions at first as products of their wild imaginations. However, as more evidence surfaces, Laura joins the investigation and helps her daughter uncover a shocking secret. In the climax of the movie, it is revealed that Patrick is actually a con man who was responsible for the deaths of his previous wives to inherit their wealth.

Dogen finds a murdered prospector, whose young daughter Dhyana saw him killed by Baal, Jared Syn's half-cyborg son. Baal sprayed the man with a green liquid that caused a nightmare dream-state, in which Syn appeared and executed him with a crystal. Dogen convinces Dhyana to help him find Syn.

The islands are volcanoes that increase in age from southeast to northwest. The youngest island is the Big Island of Hawaii at the southeast end of the chain. The volcanoes get older through Maui, Kahoolawe, Lanai, Molokai, Oahu, Kauai, and Niihau Islands through the northwest. The Kilauea volcano on Hawaii has been erupting almost continuously since 1983.

Does long keywords help boost your small keywords? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"1. Define keyword stemming: Keyword stemming is a useful tool for web pages and search engine optimization. The process of keyword stemming involves taking a basic but popular keyword pertaining to a particular website and adding a prefix, suffix, or pluralization to make the keyword into a new word. For instance, if we have a keyword like \\"run\\", stemming might extend it to \\"runner\\", \\"running\\", \\"ran\\", and so on. 2. Explore if long keywords help boost your small keywords: Long tail keywords, also known as long keywords are quite specific and tend to draw less traffic, however, they also tend to draw more quality traffic that is more likely to convert to a sale. They can indirectly assist in boosting your smaller, more general keywords. This is because these long term keywords are often comprised of smaller keywords and, by targeting these longer, more specific keywords, you also inevitably optimize for the smaller comprising keywords. For example, if you consistently use a long keyword like “best restaurant in New York,” you will also inadvertently rank for “restaurant in New York” and even just “restaurant.” 3. Evaluate if the two questions are paraphrases of each other: A paraphrase is a saying the same thing in a different way i.e., rewording or rephrasing a sentence while keeping the same meaning intact. The first question is asking for a definition of the concept of keyword stemming. The second question is asking if using long tail keywords can help improve the ranking for smaller, more general keywords. These two questions focus on different aspects of keyword-related SEO techniques; they do not seem to have the same underlying meaning, hence, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Les politiques et les règles efficaces relatives à la concurrence ont toujours été cruciales pour la saine coexistence de tous les opérateurs économiques dans la zone euro. Translate to English","completion":"Effective competition policies and rules have always been crucial for the healthy coexistence of all economic operators in the Eurozone. Competition policies and rules play a vital role in ensuring that markets remain open, fair, and efficient in the Eurozone. The main purpose behind these policies is to protect consumer interests and ensure a level playing field for all businesses operating within the single European market. This, in turn, boosts economic growth and innovation by promoting good business practices and preventing market abuses or distortions. The European Union (EU) has a comprehensive legal framework to ensure fair competition within the Eurozone. Key to this framework are the European Commission and national competition authorities, who have the power to enforce the regulations and policies that safeguard competitive market dynamics. This framework comprises various policies, rules, and strategies, which can be broadly grouped into the following categories: 1. Anti-competitive agreements and practices: The EU prohibits certain agreements and practices that have the potential to restrict competition and harm consumers. This includes cartels (secret agreements between businesses to fix prices or divide markets), price-fixing, market-sharing, bid-rigging, and other activities that can undermine the basic principles of a free market economy. 2. Abuse of dominance: European competition law prevents businesses with a dominant market position from abusing their power to restrict competition unfairly. Companies that hold a prominent place in the market have a special responsibility to ensure they respect the competitive marketplace, e.g., by not engaging in predatory pricing, restricting access to essential supplies, or forcing customers to accept unfair conditions. 3. Merger control: The European Commission has the authority to review and regulate major corporate mergers and acquisitions to ensure they do not harm competition within the Eurozone. This helps prevent large companies from concentrating market power by acquiring their competitors or engaging in anti-competitive practices that can damage the competitive landscape. 4. State aid control: The EU also has rules on state aid, ensuring that national governments do not grant subsidies or benefits to specific companies or industries in a manner that distorts competition. By scrutinizing the allocation of public funds, European authorities can promote fair competition between businesses and minimize distortions caused by government intervention. 5. Sector-specific regulation: Specific rules and regulations govern particular industries or sectors, like energy, transport, or telecommunications, to ensure a healthy competitive environment tailored to each industry's unique market conditions. Implementing effective competition rules in the Eurozone ensures that businesses have equal opportunities to grow, innovate, and prosper. By fostering a competitive market, these policies incentivize efficiency, responsiveness to consumer preferences, and technological advancements, resulting in broad benefits for consumers, businesses, and the overall economy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

II. yes.","completion":"II. Yes. Both questions, \\"How hard is it to play the ukulele?\\" and \\"How hard is it to play ukulele?\\" essentially have the same meaning. They are asking about the difficulty level associated with learning or playing the ukulele. The only difference between the two questions is the use of the word 'the' in the first question. The definite article 'the' is not necessary in this context as it neither adds any specific information nor changes the overall meaning of the question. The presence or absence of 'the' does not alter the question's intention or meaning in this case, which remains focused on the difficulty level of playing the ukulele. When learning a new musical instrument, the level of difficulty can vary depending on several factors such as the individual's experience, musical background, personal commitment, as well as the inherent complexities of the instrument itself. The ukulele is often considered to be one of the easier stringed instruments to learn, especially for beginners. It has a small and lightweight body, fewer strings than a guitar (four instead of six), and its nylon strings tend to be gentler on fingers. Furthermore, playing basic chords on the ukulele can be relatively simple, which allows new players to learn songs quickly. That being said, just like any other musical instrument, the level of difficulty increases as you advance. Learning advanced techniques, chord progressions, fingerpicking patterns, and playing more complex songs require commitment, practice, and patience. To summarize, the questions \\"How hard is it to play the ukulele?\\" and \\"How hard is it to play ukulele?\\" have the same meaning, and the general answer would be that the ukulele is considered to be relatively easy to learn for beginners but can become more challenging as one advances."},{"prompt":"Question: This article: Social tensions were exacerbated by the revival of the Ku Klux Klan after 1915. The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, 1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people. By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.During the 1930s, parts of the state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practice. This period was known as the Dust Bowl, throughout which areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall, strong winds, and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl. Soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes, the most in the nation.In 1995, Oklahoma City was the site of one of the most destructive acts of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people, including 19 children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"No, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. First, let's break down the two statements. Premise: \\"Florentine leather goods remain unequalled.\\" This statement implies that the quality of leather goods produced in Florence is unparalleled, meaning that there are no other comparable items in terms of quality. It suggests a high level of craftsmanship, skill, and expertise associated with products made in this region. Hypothesis: \\"Florentine leather goods are poor quality.\\" This statement is contradicting the premise, as it implies that leather products from Florence are of low quality and do not meet the desired standards of excellence. Now, let's analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. To conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis, there would need to be a logical connection between the two statements. In this case, however, the premise and hypothesis are in direct opposition to each other. If, as stated in the premise, Florentine leather goods are unequalled in terms of quality, then it is impossible for them to be of poor quality, as suggested by the hypothesis. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. In fact, if the premise is true, it would automatically negate the hypothesis, reinforcing the idea that Florentine leather goods are indeed of exceptional quality. In conclusion, the premise and the hypothesis are mutually exclusive statements. If the premise is true, it means that Florentine leather goods are of unparalleled quality, which would serve to disprove the hypothesis that they are of poor quality. Conversely, if the hypothesis is true, it would imply that the premise is false, as the quality of Florentine leather goods would not be unequalled."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Maintaining filters in large buildings","completion":"To answer this question, I will analyze the impact of each option on air quality in large Texas cities. 1. Limiting the number of cars on the roads: This option would likely reduce vehicle emissions, which are a major source of air pollution. Fewer cars on the road would result in less exhaust fumes and improved air quality. 2. Switching to wood stoves for home heating: Wood stoves produce particulate matter and other pollutants when wood is burned, which can contribute to air pollution. This option would likely not improve air quality. 3. Requiring large vehicles to use diesel fuel: Diesel fuel produces less carbon dioxide compared to gasoline, but its combustion may release other pollutants, like nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. This option might not have a significant positive impact on air quality. 4. Maintaining filters in large buildings: Properly maintained filters can help remove indoor air pollutants, but their impact on overall air quality in large cities may be limited compared to the other sources of pollution.

Write a title for this article: Updated SEP 04, 2014 12:34p ET SAN DIEGO -- Daniel Hudson needed a moment alone in the dugout to comprehend his long road back from two reconstructive elbow operations. It had been more than two years since he threw a pitch in the big leagues, and he did just fine Wednesday night, tossing a perfect inning in the Arizona Diamondbacks' 6-1 victory against the San Diego Padres. He was still a bit emotional afterward. \\"It was great. It was a lot of fun. I don't really have much to say. It's just a lot of emotions right now. I'm just glad I was able to get in there. It went as well as it could have,\\" Hudson said. Asked what he was thinking as he ran in from the bullpen, he said: \\"I hadn't done this in a long time and it's a lot farther than I remember. Again, I don't really know what I was thinking. I was thinking so many different things: Please let this go better than the last time -- and thankfully it did.\\" He retired the side on 13 pitches in the eighth inning. Hudson, who won 16 games for Arizona in 2011, was warmly greeted by his teammates when he reached the dugout. \\"I couldn't really sit down. It was a lot of different emotions. I wish I could explain them all but I can't,\\" he said. Hudson became the fourth pitcher to undergo Tommy John surgery in consecutive years and return to the majors. \\"Even if I go out tomorrow and it blows again, it was all worth it,\\" he said. \\"It was a long time coming. Thankfully today came.\\" Hudson hadn't pitched since June 26, 2012, when he originally tore his ulnar collateral ligament. He underwent surgery 15 days later, performed by the late Dr. Lewis Yocum. Hudson tore the ligament again during a rehab start with Double-A Mobile on June 4, 2013, and was operated on two weeks later by Dr. James Andrews. \\"It's a long road back. He's loved by teammates and everybody's pulling for him,\\" manager Kirk Gibson said. \\"He handled his emotions very well. Threw the ball well, good velocity. Kept it down for the most part and let his fielders take care of the balls.\\" RIP my mentions. So many emotions. So much fun. Thank you guys for sticking with me the last two plus years. I’m tearing up typing this David Peralta had two RBI hits for Arizona and Josh Collmenter (10-7) won his third straight start, holding San Diego to one run and five hits in seven innings. He struck out three and walked two. The Diamondbacks scored three runs, two of them unearned, against Andrew Cashner (2-7) in an eventful fifth inning that included two hits, a walk, two fielder's choices, a call at the plate that stood after a 2 1/2-minute review, a botched rundown and a runner called out on interference. Collmenter came up with runners on second and third and one out. He hit a grounder to rookie second baseman Corey Spangenberg, whose throw to the plate was just late enough to allow Alfredo Marte to score. Padres manager Bud Black challenged, but the call was confirmed. That put runners on first and third. Ender Inciarte grounded to first baseman Yasmani Grandal, who threw home to catch Didi Gregorius in a rundown. But third baseman Yangervis Solarte appeared to be going for a quick tag and missed the throw from catcher Rene Rivera. The ball rolled into left field for an error, allowing Gregorius to score. With Inciarte on second and Collmenter on third and the infield in, Chris Owings hit a grounder to shortstop Alexi Amarista, and Inciarte was called out for interference. Peralta then singled to bring in Collmenter. Peralta tripled in Owings in the first. Cashner allowed four runs, two earned, and five hits in seven innings. He struck out five and walked one. \\"He threw the ball fine,\\" Black said. \\"When you look at it, he was the victim of some circumstance there in the fifth inning. It was a well-pitched game. That inning got away from us a little bit.\\" Peralta had his 28th multi-hit game of the season and got his 27th extra-base hit. His nine triples are the most by a rookie since Bryce Harper of the Nationals had nine in 2012. Padres reliever Leonel Campos made his major league debut when he entered with one out in the eighth, retiring both batters he faced. R.J. Alvarez then made his big league debut when he entered to start the ninth. He allowed one run and one hit with two walks in two-thirds of an inning. Diamondbacks: Doug Brocail, Mike Lincoln and Denny Stark are the other pitchers who had Tommy John surgery in consecutive seasons and returned to the big leagues. Padres: Black said SS Everth Cabrera's balky hamstring isn't quite ready for him to be sent out on a rehab assignment. Diamondbacks: Randall Delgado (2-3, 5.85 ERA) will make his first start since April 10 at San Francisco. He's made two relief appearances against San Diego this season. Padres: Ian Kennedy (10-11, 3.65) faces his old teammates for the third time this season and fifth time since he was traded from Arizona to San Diego last season.","completion":"\\"Daniel Hudson's Emotional Return to the Mound: Perfect Inning After Two Tommy John Surgeries\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Passage: Van Coehoorn was born in March 1641, one of six sons of Goosewijn van Coehoorn and Aaltje van Hinckena on the Lettinga State in the village of Britsum near Leeuwarden in the Dutch province of Friesland. His father was an officer of German descent in a Friesland regiment of the Dutch States Army and a member of the petty nobility. Menno was educated at home with his brothers, then later at the University of Franeker by his uncle Bernardus Fullenius, where he showed a talent for mathematics and military drawing. In 1657, he was commissioned as a Lieutenant in his father's company, which formed part of the permanent garrison in Maastricht. In 1678, Van Coehoorn married Magdalena van Scheltinga; they had four surviving children, Goosewijn, Gertruda, Hendrik, and Amalia. Magdalena died in 1683 and he later married Truytje van Wigara. He died on 17 March 1704. Question 1: How many years passed between Van Coehoorn's birth in march 1641 and the time when he was commissioned as a Lieutenant in the year 1657? Explanation: This question requires numerical reasoning. To answer, one must look at two parts of the passage (Van Coehoorn's birth date and the year he became Lieutenant). The answer can be calculated by subtracting 1641 from 1657, which results in 16 years. Question 2: How many more years did Van Coehoorn live after the death of his first wife, Magdalena, who died in 1683, until his own death on 17 March 1704? Explanation: This question requires reasoning from different parts of the passage (Magdalena's death date and Van Coehoorn's death date) and numerical reasoning. The answer can be calculated by subtracting 1683 from 1704, which results in 21 years. Question 3: If Van Coehoorn's marriage to Magdalena lasted from 1678 until her death in 1683, how many years did this marriage last, and how many more years did he live after remarrying Truytje van Wigara until his death in 1704? Explanation: This question requires complex reasoning and numerical reasoning. To answer, one must look at different parts of the passage (marriage date, Magdalena's death date, and Van Coehoorn's death date) and perform multiple arithmetic operations. First, calculate the length of the first marriage by subtracting 1678 from 1683 (5 years). Next, calculate the number of years after remarrying by subtracting 1683 from 1704 (21 years). The answer is \\"5 years\\" for the first part and \\"21 years\\" for the second part."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One spot on the Catatumbo River gets, regularly, forty thousand bolts every night. The lightning has helped sailors navigate, foiled attacks on the nearby countryside, and is actually responsible for Venezuelan independence. Find out about the most zapped spot on earth. Roughly three hundred nights a year, the residents on Lake Maracaibo need to shut their blinds against the light. Each of the individual storms over the Catatumbo River are no different from lightning storms everywhere else. But with the concentration on that one spot, and the fact that the lightning comes back day after day, ten months out of every year, things start to get weird. Advertisement Theories abound as to why the lightning is concentrated in one area all the time. Some scientists say that the geological features around the Catatumbo River basin contribute to a constant low-pressure system. That would explain why the lightning hasn't stopped for more that a few months at a time for thousands of years. Weather or humidity might play a part — since the longest recorded pause for the lightning happened in 2010, an El Nino year that ushered in a terrible drought in Venezuela. Some say the months-long disappearance of the visible lightning was actually due to deforestation and agricultural development in the region around Catatumbo. Sponsored The constant lightning storms are part of the history of the region. Believe it or not, they help the region become a reliable port, since the giant bolts of lightning are excellent navigational aids for sailors. They just aren't aids for stealthy sailors. It was said that an attack on Lake Maracaibo by Sr Francis Drake was foiled because the lightning lit up the sky enough for people to spot his ships. Later, in the 1800s, it is said to have guided Admiral José Prudencio Padilla to a battle, which turned into an important victory for Venezuelan independence. The loss of the lightning, due to drought, deforestation, or El Nino conditions, may be a loss for local beauty and natural historic preservation — but it could have been a boon for the environment. The constant barrage of lightning over Lake Maracaibo helps replenish the ozone layer. Oxygen usually binds with other elements, or forms pairs with another oxygen molecule. Ozone is three different oxygen molecules bound together, which rarely happens. This is lucky for us, because ozone is poisonous. When it's up in the ozone layer it's an ecological benefit, blocking ultraviolet rays. When it's swimming around the rest of the atmosphere, it's a greenhouse gas. Lightning doesn't directly make ozone, but its high heat and pressure force oxygen to combine with another chemical it doesn't usually hook up with; nitrogen. When nitrogen atoms are bound to oxygen atoms, it's only a temporary partnership. Sunlight shakes them loose, and the extra oxygen often finds a pair of oxygen atoms to connect with.

Scott Sutherland Meteorologist/Science Writer Sunday, April 5, 2015, 11:32 AM - Think where you live gets a lot of lightning? Now, thanks to a new map from NASA's Earth Observatory, you can compare your region to others, to see who comes out on top. However, unless you live in a very specific area of Central Africa, you're going to come in at least second in this contest. Using data collected from two orbiting satellite sensors - the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) on NASA’s Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite and the Optical Transient Detector (OTD) on the OrbView-1/Microlab satellite - NASA has put together a map of lightning strikes across the Earth, plotted by rate (number per square kilometre, per year). The result was this: Global lightning activity. Credit: Joshua Stevens/NASA Earth Observatory Some regions stand out, like near Venezuela's Lake Maracaibo, along Lake Taha, in northwestern Ethiopia, throughout northwestern Colombia and most of central Africa. However, for shear concentration of strikes, nowhere comes close to what a swath of land in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo sees. Stretching between Maiko National Park and the the Itombwe National Reserve, near the borders of Rwanda and Burundi, this region shows up like a beacon, with each square kilometre receiving around 100 lightning strikes every year. Given that the entire region represents roughly 100,000 square kilometres, that's more than 10 million lightning strikes per year, concentrated in a very small part of the planet! By comparison, the entire country of Canada - all 10 million square kilometres of it - apparently only sees a little over 2 million lightning strikes per year. Zoom in closer and The two most concentrated areas, each about 100 kms on a side, are located at the northern and southern ends of that bright swath, just to the east of both Maiko and Itombwe. These two, each, receive around 15,000 strikes per year. An equivalent area in Canada - from Toronto to Hamilton, including all adjacent townships - would have to receive over 50 strikes each and every day, from April 1 to October 31, to match it.

(In fact, a 1997 study found that lighting flashes strike multiple spots simultaneously about a third of the time, and that your chances of being struck are about 45 percent higher than the number of flashes would seem to indicate). So now that we’ve gotten that out of the way, here’s another burning question: Where does lightning strike most frequently on the planet? As it turns out, those brainy folks at NASA have the answer. NEWS: Man Struck By Lightning … Twice Between 1998 and 2013, NASA’s Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission and OrbView-1/Microlab satellites gathered data on the number and location of lightning flashes worldwide, and what they found is shown on the map above. As it turns out, lightning tends to happen most often in areas closest to the equator, and more often over land than over the oceans. That makes sense, because as NASA’s Earth Observatory website explains,solid earth absorbs sunlight and heats up faster than water. That results in stronger convection and greater atmospheric instability, which leads to the production of the sort of storms that produce lightning. The spots on the planet with the highest amount of lightning turn out to be Lake Maracaibo in northwestern Venezuela, where the combination of heat, humidity and wind from the surrounding Andes mountain range causes spectacular storms, and the far eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo. NEWS: Mushroom Clouds Form Over Idaho Lightning Fires According to Reuters, the Lake Maraciabo area has lightning storms 300 nights each year, and each kilometer of the area is hit by 250 lightning strikes annually. NASA scientist Daniel Cecil noted on the Earth Observatory website that the new map is far more detailed than previous efforts to chart global lightning. “The longer record allows us to more confidently identify some of these finer details,” he said. “We can examine seasonality, and variability through the day and year-to-year.” ||||| Where does lightning flash most frequently? According to satellite observations, it occurs more often over land than over the oceans. And lightning seems to happen more often closer to the equator. The map above shows the average yearly counts of lightning flashes per square kilometer from 1995 to 2013. Areas with the fewest number of flashes each year are gray and purple; areas with the largest number of lightning flashes—as many as 150 per year per square kilometer—are bright pink. The map is based on data collected from 1998–2013 by the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) on NASA’s Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite, and from 1995–2000 by the Optical Transient Detector (OTD) on the OrbView-1/Microlab satellite. Flashes above 38 degrees North were observed by OTD only, as the satellite flew to higher latitudes. The higher frequency of lighting over land makes sense because solid earth absorbs sunlight and heats up faster than water; this means there is stronger convection and greater atmospheric instability, leading to the formation of thunder and lightning producing storms. According to NASA’s Daniel Cecil, a member of the Global Hydrology and Climate Center’s lightning team, the data also have revealed some interesting regional trends. For example, scientists have observed a large number of flashes during the month of May in the Brahmaputra Valley of far eastern India. The heating and weather patterns are unstable and changeable at that time—just before the onset of the monsoon, which brings plenty of rain but much less lightning. In contrast, locations in Central Africa and Northwestern South America have large amounts of lightning throughout the entire year. As the map shows, the highest amounts of lightning flashes occur in the far eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, and Lake Maracaibo in northwestern Venezuela. Cecil noted that more years of data has not necessarily brought notable big-picture differences when compared to the earlier maps. “The longer record allows us to more confidently identify some of these finer details,” he said. “We can examine seasonality, and variability through the day and year-to-year.” NASA Earth Observatory image by Joshua Stevens using LIS/OTD data from the Global Hydrology and Climate Center Lightning Team. Caption by Kathryn Hansen. ||||| Every second, as many as 100 lightning bolts strike the Earth. Now, a new map reveals a tally of those flashes over the last two decades, tracing where they strike the planet each year. Westward on the map, lightning flashes run down Mexico and Central America, before reaching their peak in Colombia and Venezuela; eastward, they peak in Singapore and Malaysia. But neither region compares to the dramatic strikes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Central Africa. The data reveal that lightning is more likely to strike land than water, and these flashes occur more on land close to the equator. But the different intensities also reveal subtle differences in the storms themselves. [Electric Earth: Stunning Images of Lightning] Lighting results from processes occurring within clouds. As ice particles within a cloud collide and break apart, the smaller particles acquire positive charge and the larger particles acquire negative charge. Updrafts of wind then push the small particles upward, until the top of the cloud is positively charged, while the bottom of the cloud is negatively charged. This separation of charge creates a huge electric potential within the cloud, and between the cloud and the ground. Eventually, the electric potential grows strong enough to overcome the air's resistance to electrical flow. Negative charges venture toward the ground from the bottom of the cloud, causing positive charges to surge up toward the cloud from the ground. This electrical discharge is a surge of lightning. (At least that’s the simple version of lightning.) Scientists are attempting to learn more about lightning and its accompanying thunderstorms by monitoring the flashes from above. In 1998, NASA launched a Lightning Imaging Sensor on board its Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite. It was originally planned to be a three-year-mission, but the satellite is still up and running 17 years later. A second instrument, called the Optical Transient Detector (OTD) on the OrbView-1/Microlab satellite, also collected data from 1995 to 2000, and recorded all flashes above the 38th parallel north latitude. A lightning-imaging sensor collected near-infrared light to account for flashes occurring in daylight. \\"It's taking very rapid updates,\\" said Daniel Cecil, a member of the Global Hydrology and Climate Center's lightning team. \\"So it will measure a background scene, and then with very rapid updates check to see if there's a sudden change in brightness from that background scene.\\" If there is, the instrument records that as a flash of lightning. Two basic trends can be seen across the data: Lightning is far more likely to occur on land than over the ocean, and lightning is far more likely to occur near the equator. Roughly 90 percent of the lightning strikes on Earth occur between the 38th parallel south and 38th parallel north latitudes, said Cecil. But even on equatorial land, lightning strikes vary with different types of thunderstorms. Take Brazil, for example. With its abundant warm temperatures and moisture-laden air, this country commonly experiences large thunderstorms. The number of lightning strikes per storm, however, is relatively low, with only a few flashes per minute, Cecil said. But in places like northern Argentina, or even in the central United States, rare storms bring tens or hundreds of flashes per minute, he added. \\"You get big differences for Brazil and central Africa, where they're both in the deep tropics, both overland,\\" said Cecil, who is now working on further understanding this trend. \\"But in a lot of ways the storms over Brazil behave more like the storms over the ocean, which are almost always much weaker than the ones overland.\\" The researchers are planning to send a lightning imaging sensor to the International Space Station and to geostationary orbit (orbiting over the Earth's equator), where it will be able to continuously monitor certain spots on the planet, and therefore track certain storms. \\"Right now, we're piecing together snapshots,\\" Cecil said. \\"As a satellite goes over, we get to look at a storm for about a minute and a half. And in this next generation a few years from now, we're going to have continuous measurements. So as a storm pops up, we're going to see its entire life cycle from the first flash to the last.\\" Follow Shannon Hall on Twitter @ShannonWHall.

These storms happen around 300 nights a year, mainly due to geological features around the river basin that contribute to a constant low-pressure system. This has been occurring for thousands of years, and the region has adapted to this natural feature. The lightning storms have historical significance, as they have been used as navigational aids for sailors and played a role in foiling attacks on the region, such as the one by Sir Francis Drake. In the 1800s, the lightning was said to have guided Admiral José Prudencio Padilla to a battle, which was important for Venezuelan independence. The lightning storms at Lake Maracaibo also help to replenish the ozone layer.

SA child protection overhaul outlined A new council and a children's commissioner are among the South Australian government's proposed reforms to overhaul the state's child protection system. The state government has released a draft bill consolidating most of the laws it hopes will address the damning findings of a royal commission into SA child protection, led by former Supreme Court Justice Margaret Nyland. The proposed laws include a new children's commissioner role, as the government announced earlier this month, and a Child Development Council to offer the government advice. The bill will be introduced when parliament next sits in September, alongside a bill allowing tighter checks on people working with children and another to make data sharing between child services agencies easier. \\"Establishing the office of children's commissioner, working in harmony with other agencies, is a recommendation which can be delivered swiftly if the parliament supports this important initiative,\\" Child Protection Minister John Rau said on Wednesday. \\"As we make a fresh start in child protection, we want a system which includes a high-profile, independent advocate for all children and young people.\\" The children's commissioner will have the investigation power of a royal commission and be able to hold state authorities to account if needed, to promote the rights of children. The government had been urged to create the role as far back as 2003, in a previous review into child protection.

Would \\"Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation , which made ending slavery a war goal.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"\\"Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which made ending slavery a war goal\\" is an important point in the context of the Civil War, but it isn't accurate to strictly view it as the primary trigger. The Civil War had already begun prior to the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863. The causes of the Civil War were deeply rooted and multifaceted, revolving primarily around the contentious issue of slavery. The United States was increasingly split between the North, with its industrial economy and stance against the expansion of slavery, and the South, which was largely agrarian with an economy heavily dependent on the institution of slavery. These differences escalated with several events: 1. Missouri Compromise (1820): This was an attempt to keep a balance between slave states and free states. It brought up regional animosities. 2. Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854): This repealed the Missouri Compromise by allowing states newly entering the Union to decide for themselves whether they would be free or slave, leading to significant violence and conflict. 3. Dred Scott Decision (1857): A Supreme Court case which declared that African-Americans were not US citizens and therefore couldn't sue in federal courts. The decision also stated that Congress couldn't regulate slavery in the territories thereby fueling hostility between North and South. 4. Election of Abraham Lincoln (1860): His election was treated with hostility in the South, where it was believed that Lincoln would attempt to abolish slavery. 5. Secession of Southern States (1860-1861): Following Lincoln's election, the Southern states started to secede, fearing that the balance of power would shift against them. The actual trigger was the assault on Fort Sumter by Confederate forces in South Carolina in April 1861. This event marked the beginning of the Civil War. To sum up, the Civil War was sparked by longstanding cultural, societal, economic, and political differences between the Northern and Southern states, primarily over the institution of slavery and states' rights. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation came later, in 1863, after the war had already started. It was a critical measure that reasserted the conflict as not only a constitutional struggle over states' rights but also a war about the human rights of enslaved people, but it wasn't the initial trigger for the Civil War."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A white Jesuit priest assisting in desegregation negotiations attested the \\"demonstrations [were] poorly timed and misdirected\\".Protest organizers knew they would meet with violence from the Birmingham Police Department and chose a confrontational approach to get the attention of the federal government. Wyatt Tee Walker, one of the SCLC founders and the executive director from 1960 to 1964, planned the tactics of the direct action protests, specifically targeting Bull Connor's tendency to react to demonstrations with violence: \\"My theory was that if we mounted a strong nonviolent movement, the opposition would surely do something to attract the media, and in turn induce national sympathy and attention to the everyday segregated circumstance of a person living in the Deep South.\\" He headed the planning of what he called Project C, which stood for \\"confrontation\\". Organizers believed their phones were tapped, so to prevent their plans from being leaked and perhaps influencing the mayoral election, they used code words for demonstrations.The plan called for direct nonviolent action to attract media attention to \\"the biggest and baddest city of the South\\".

His long reign -the longest of any Iberian monarch- saw the expansion of the House of Aragon in three directions: Languedoc to the north, the Balearic Islands to the south, and Valencia to the southwest. By a treaty with Louis IX of France, he wrested the county of Barcelona from nominal French suzerainty and integrated it into his crown. His part in the Reconquista was similar in Mediterranean Spain to that of his contemporary Ferdinand III of Castile in Andalusia. - Alfonso III ( 4 November 1265 , in Valencia -- 18 June 1291 ) , called the Liberal ( el Liberal ) or the Free ( also \`\` the Frank , '' from el Franc ) , was the King of Aragon and Count of Barcelona ( as Alfons II ) from 1285 . He conquered the Kingdom of Majorca between his succession and 1287 . He was a son of Peter III of Aragon and Constance of Sicily , daughter and heiress of Manfred of Sicily . His maternal grandmother Beatrice of Savoy was a daughter of Amadeus IV of Savoy and Marguerite of Burgundy , Countess of Savoy . Soon after assuming the throne , he conducted a campaign to reincorporate the Balearic Islands into the Kingdom of Aragon - which had been lost due to the division of the kingdom by his grandfather , James I of Aragon . Thus in 1285 he declared war on his uncle , James II of Majorca , and conquered both Majorca ( 1285 ) and Ibiza ( 1286 ) , effectively reassuming suzerainty over the Kingdom of Majorca . He followed this with the conquest of Minorca - until then , an autonomous Muslim state ( Manûrqa ) within the Kingdom of Majorca - on 17 January 1287 , the anniversary of which now serves as Minorca 's national holiday . He initially sought to maintain Aragonese control over Sicily early in his reign by supporting the claims to the island of his brother , James II of Aragon . However , he later pressed his brother to retract the claims and instead supported the claim from the Papal States . His reign was marred by a constitutional struggle with the Aragonese nobles , which eventually culminated in the articles of the Union of Aragon - the so - called \`\` Magna Carta of Aragon '' , which devolved several key royal powers into the hands of lesser nobles . His inability to resist the demands of his nobles was to leave a heritage of disunity in Aragon and further dissent amongst the nobility , who increasingly saw little reason to respect the throne , and brought the Kingdom of Aragon close to anarchy . During his lifetime a dynastic marriage with Eleanor , daughter of King Edward I of... - The Kingdom of Majorca (; ) was founded by James I of Aragon, also known as \\"James The Conqueror\\". After the death of his firstborn son Alfonso, a will was written in 1262 and created the kingdom to cede it to his son James. The disposition was maintained during successive versions of his will and so when James I died in 1276, the Crown of Aragon passed to his eldest son Peter, known as Peter III of Aragon or \\"Peter the Great\\". The Kingdom of Majorca passed to James, who reigned under the name of James II of Majorca. After 1279, Peter III of Aragon established that the king of Majorca was a vassal to the king of Aragon. The title continued to be employed by the Aragonese and Spanish monarchs until its dissolution by the 1715 Nueva Planta decrees. - The County of Barcelona was originally a frontier region under the rule of the Carolingian dynasty. By the end of the 10th century, the Counts of Barcelona were \\"de facto\\" independent, hereditary rulers in constant warfare with the Islamic caliphate of Córdoba and its successor states. The counts, through marriage alliances and treaties, acquired the other Catalan counties and extended their influence along Occitania. Barcelona formed the nucleus of the emergent Principality of Catalonia. In 1164, the count of Barcelona, Alfons I, inherited the Kingdom of Aragon (as Alfonso II). Thenceforward, the history of the county of Barcelona is subsumed within that of the Crown of Aragon, but the city of Barcelona remained preeminent within it. - The Count of Barcelona was the ruler of Catalonia for much of Catalan history, from the 9th until the 15th century. The County of Barcelona was created by Charlemagne after he had conquered lands north of the river Ebro. These lands, called the \\"Marca Hispanica\\", were partitioned into various counties, of which the Count of Barcelona, usually holding other counties simultaneously, eventually obtained the primacy over the region.

Summarize this article: Regardless of the type of mail fraud taking place, all of them usually ask for money or personal information. If you receive a mailing that does not look familiar, read through it and look for common fraudulent practices. If you see something that usually occurs in fraudulent mailings, be suspicious. For example, fraudulent mailings commonly: Require you to pay \\"insurance\\", \\"processing\\", or \\"service\\" fees. Ask you to provide someone with personal information, including Social Security numbers and credit card information. Promise things that are too good to be true (e.g., unreasonable returns on investments, loans for people with bad credit). Pressure you into making decisions quickly (e.g., require that you respond to the mailing within a matter of days). If you get a mailing that looks out of the ordinary, do some research. A lot of fraudulent mailings will be disguised to look like something legitimate. For example, some fraudsters will make their mailings look identical to official government documents. In another common scenario, fraudsters will disguise their scheme as a legitimate invoice (e.g., an outstanding bill). If you get one of these mailings: Do a quick online search to see if anyone else has gotten them. Describe the mailing in your search and include the word \\"fraud.\\" There are websites dedicated to people who report questionable mailings. Search online to verify the accuracy of the information in the mailing. For example, if the mailing provides an address, consider searching for the address online and see what comes up. Call the number on the mailing. If a phone number is provided, call and question their intentions. If you do speak with someone, try to gauge their demeanor. Are they nervous? Are they pushy? Are they rude? If you do speak with someone, never give out any personal information. In addition to common practices, fraudsters usually utilize the same schemes over and over again. If you get a piece of mail you suspect may be fraud, analyze it and see if it fits within one of the following categories: Sweepstakes and 'free' prizes 'Free' vacations Solicitations disguised as invoices Foreign lotteries Chain letters Charity fraud Investment fraud Fees charged for services that are normally free Advance-fee loans Unsolicited merchandise Fake check scams Don't fall for fraudsters who disguise their solicitations as invoices. Often, people will try to get you to buy something by making their mailing look like a bill. They are hoping you will automatically pay and think you placed an order but forgot about it. Always read the fine print. Most of these mailings will state they are solicitations but will do so in small print on the bottom of the mailing. Never make a payment until you have verified whether you actually ordered something. If you haven't ordered the item it says you did, or if you haven't received the item it says you did, do not pay. A lot of fraudsters will take advantage of your good will and will ask you to donate to phony charities. This type of mail fraud often takes place after a natural disaster or some other event that the country rallies behind. To avoid this type of fraud, only give to charities you know and trust. Check out the charities you don't know. Look online to determine what they are about. Beware of organizational names that are similar (but not the same) to reputable charities. Do not donate to charities that only accept cash. If you do write a check, always make it payable to the organization and not to an individual. Avoid investment solicitations you get in the mail that promise unreasonable returns on your investments. Fraudulent promoters will try to get you to invest a lot of money in bogus vehicles (e.g., fake securities, commodities, or property). If you can answer \\"yes\\" to any of the following questions, you may be dealing with mail fraud: Does the mailing make it sound as if you cannot lose? Are you promised unusually high rates of return? Are you pressured into making a decision quickly? If you have trouble obtaining loans through normal means, you may get targeted for advance-fee loan schemes. These mailings will offer you \\"guaranteed\\" loans so long as you pay a fee in advance. The mailing will usually tell you they can obtain a loan for you without a problem. In reality, the person has no such ability. If you pay the fee, the fraudster will take your money and not return any phone calls. Only enter into loan agreements with reputable lending institutions (e.g., banks and credit unions). Always read and understand the terms of your loan before signing. Never allow someone to choose and enter into a loan for you. A lot of mail fraud takes the form of unsolicited gifts, which are sent to you with the hope you will pay a fee for it. If you receive a free gift in the mail that you did not ask for, you can do any of the following: If it has not been opened, you can simply return it. If you have opened it but do not want the gift, you can simply throw it away. If you want to keep the gift, you can do so. For free. Do not send any money to the person who sent the gift. Unsolicited merchandise is yours to keep.","completion":"Mail fraud is a common occurrence and it typically involves soliciting money or personal information from recipients. To protect yourself from falling victim to mail fraud, it is essential to be vigilant and be aware of common fraudulent practices. These can include requests for payment of various fees such as insurance, processing, or service fees, asking for personal information, promising unrealistic benefits and applying pressure to make decisions quickly. If you receive suspicious mailings, it is important to research whether the mail is legitimate. Fraudsters can often disguise their mailings as legitimate documents, such as government documents or invoices. You can verify the legitimacy of mailings by conducting online searches, checking the accuracy of the information provided, and contacting the phone number given to assess the demeanor and intentions of the person on the other end. Mail fraud can take various forms, including sweepstakes and 'free' prizes, 'free' vacations, solicitations disguised as invoices, foreign lotteries, chain letters, charity fraud, investment fraud, fees charged for normally free services, advance-fee loans, unsolicited merchandise, and fake check scams. To avoid falling for mail fraud schemes, make sure to read the fine print, never give out personal information, and don't make payments until verifying the legitimacy of the mail. Additionally, only give to trusted charities, be cautious of organizations with similar names to reputable ones, and only deal with known lending institutions. If you receive unsolicited gifts, you can choose to return, keep, or dispose of them without any obligation to pay. By remaining vigilant and informed, you can effectively safeguard yourself against mail fraud."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When John DeStefano, Jr., became mayor of New Haven in 1995, he outlined a plan to transform the city into a major cultural and arts center in the Northeast, which involved investments in programs and projects other than sports franchises. As nearby Bridgeport built new sports facilities, the brutalist New Haven Coliseum rapidly deteriorated.

Tweet:i feel so used","completion":"The sentiment of the given tweet, \\"I feel so used,\\" is primarily negative. Sentiment analysis is a technique used in natural language processing, text analysis, and computational linguistics to identify and extract subjective information from source materials. It aims to determine the writer's attitude towards a particular topic or the overall tonality of the document. The sentiment can be positive, negative, or neutral, and it can also be categorized into varying degrees within those broad categories. Upon analyzing the provided tweet, one can infer that the user feels exploited or taken advantage of, which casts a negative light on their current emotional state. The word \\"used\\" in this context reveals a sentiment of dissatisfaction, discontentment, or unhappiness. The intensity of this negative sentiment isn't extreme because the tweet lacks strong negative words or slurs, but the essential tonality remains negative due to the use of the term \\"used.\\" It's also important to note that without additional context or the knowledge of what caused the user to feel this way, the analysis is merely based on this single statement. A more accurate understanding could be obtained if we knew more about the situation that led to the statement \\"I feel so used.\\" So, to sum up, the sentiment analysis of the tweet \\"I feel so used\\" suggests a negative sentiment from the user, indicating feelings of being exploited, mistreated or taken advantage of.

Anthony Field remained in the group because he found it too difficult to give up and because he still had a passion for educating children. According to Paul Field, his brother staying in the band \\"was a vital decision to placate American, British and Canadian business partners\\". Page, Fatt, and Cook remained involved with the creative and production aspects of the group. Fatt and Cook had been talking about quitting touring for many years; Cook announced his intention to retire first, citing a desire to spend more time with his family, and then Fatt announced his own retirement shortly thereafter. Page, who was still struggling with his health issues and had stated that his interest was in working with the group's original line-up, was subsequently asked to extend his stay until the end of the year so he would leave alongside Cook and Fatt, to which he agreed.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who sighed at the thought of the unhappiness that this failure must cause Saint-Saëns? In 1861 Saint-Saëns accepted his only post as a teacher, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse, Paris, which Louis Niedermeyer had established in 1853 to train first-rate organists and choirmasters for the churches of France. Niedermeyer himself was professor of piano; when he died in March 1861, Saint-Saëns was appointed to take charge of piano studies. He scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner. His best-known pupil, Gabriel Fauré, recalled in old age: After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known. ... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment ... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I [have] had for him, throughout my life. Saint-Saëns further enlivened the academic regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce performed by the students (including André Messager). He conceived his best-known piece, The Carnival of the Animals, with his students in mind, but did not finish composing it until 1886, more than twenty years after he left the Niedermeyer school.In 1864 Saint-Saëns caused some surprise by competing a second time for the Prix de Rome. Many in musical circles were puzzled by his decision to enter the competition again, now that he was establishing a reputation as a soloist and composer. He was once more unsuccessful. Berlioz, one of the judges, wrote: We gave the Prix de Rome the other day to a young man who wasn't expecting to win it and who went almost mad with joy.

Write some highlights for the following article: As Republican presidential candidates move closer to the key tests for their party's nomination, the highly charged topic of Israel and its conflict with Palestinians has come up with increasing frequency in speeches and debates. Most recently, Newt Gingrich sent a jolt through the discussion with his description of Palestinians as \\"an invented\\" people. His rivals, without disagreeing, accused Gingrich of speaking irresponsibly and potentially hurting Israel. Most people in the U.S. and around the world interpret the campaign pledges of love and support for Israel as an effort to win the Jewish vote. But the Jewish vote has little to do with it. The Republican candidates' passionate vows to support Israel have two objectives. First, they aim to capture the pro-Israel vote in a country where the vast majority of people side strongly with Israel and in a party where the most reliable primary voters, conservative Republicans and evangelical Christians, express intense feelings on the subject. Second, they seek to make President Barack Obama look weak on foreign policy with an issue people care about and where the GOP thinks it might score some points. There are many things you can say about how Obama handled the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The one thing you cannot say is that it succeeded. His early missteps managed to make Israelis and Palestinians feel betrayed by Washington. The very public pressure Obama exerted on Israel, has, according to some polls hurt his standing among Jews and among Israelis. But the president's change in tone later helped him with both groups. Most Israelis now say they view him favorably. Among American Jews, Obama's approval may have sunk significantly to the low 50s, but that is still considerably higher than the approval he enjoys nationwide. Despite the views of serious analysts and the calculations of conspiracy theorists, Jewish voters are hardly the point. The numbers confirm that a Republican fight for the Jewish vote would mostly amount to wasted energy. The number of Jewish-American voters barely registers when compared with the size of the pro-Israel vote. Barely 2% of American voters are Jewish compared with more than 60% who consider themselves pro-Israel. Worse for Republicans, a large and consistent majority of Jews vote Democratic. Obama won the Jewish vote by an incredible 78% in the last election. Most American Jews have voted for Democratic presidents for decades. Even if half of them voted for a Republican this year, the prize during the primary is hardly worth the effort. The pro-Israel vote is another matter. Americans support Israel so strongly that for every Jew in the U.S., there are at least 30 non-Jews who say they side with the Jewish state. Support for Israel is at near-record highs, making a pro-Israel position a winning formula for Republicans and Democrats. It's not just Republicans candidates who proclaim their commitment to Israel. Despite his strained relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Obama frequently asserts support. He expressed that sentiment in June at a Democratic National Committee event, saying that \\"Israel's security will always be at the top tier of considerations ... because it's the right thing to do, because Israel is our closest ally and friend ... it shares our values and it shares our principles.\\" Those are words pro-Israel voters, Jewish or not, want to hear. If Republican candidates were trying to help Israel rather than chasing votes, they might stop using it as a political issue. The most damaging change they can bring to the Jewish state's security is to turn support for Israel into a partisan matter. Until now, it is one of the few issues on which bitterly divided Republicans and Democrats usually agree. In fact, Gingrich's recent comments about Palestinians would not make him a lot of friends among Israelis. His incendiary remark -- that Palestine was never a state and Palestinians identified themselves as Arabs until recently -- does nothing to advance the cause of peace. However long Palestinians have seen themselves as a \\"people,\\" they now share a common history and view themselves as one. The obvious response to Gingrich's rhetorical Molotov cocktail is, so what? Gingrich seemed to imply Palestinians do not deserve a state. But the best conceivable way to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is creating two states. That's why a majority of Israelis support the two-state solution. But for now, Republican candidates are worried about rounding up primary votes. One way to do that is by appealing to those with the most intense feelings and the greatest anxiety about Israel's security. More than 60% of conservative Republicans and evangelical Christians, according to a recent poll by the Pew Research Center, consider it \\"a very important goal\\" to protect Israel. For evangelicals, in particular, the issue could decide their voting choice. That's why Michelle Bachmann, for example, has spoken in almost mystical terms, saying \\"as a nation we have been blessed because of our relationship with Israel.\\" Mitt Romney says his first trip as president will be to Israel. All candidates -- except Ron Paul, who wants to cut all foreign aid -- make support for Israel a cornerstone of their foreign policy. Once the Republicans choose their candidate and the race becomes a two-person contest, both sides will try to show they are the most committed to maintaining the strongest of ties and the greatest commitment to Israel's security. It will be a quest for the backing of Jewish voters, but more importantly, an effort to entice the much larger pool of Americans who consider themselves supporters of Israel. Highlights:","completion":"1. Republican presidential candidates are increasingly discussing Israel and its conflict with Palestinians, expressing strong support for Israel. 2. Their passionate pro-Israel stance aims to capture the vote of the majority of Americans who side with Israel and to portray President Barack Obama as weak on foreign policy. 3. Jewish-American voters represent only 2% of the electorate, with the pro-Israel vote being more significant at over 60%. 4. Support for Israel remains a winning position for both Republicans and Democrats, and President Obama's own vocal support for Israel's security shows this is a bipartisan issue. 5. Turning support for Israel into a partisan matter could be damaging to the Jewish state's security and could hinder progress towards peace."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Dean drops a grape on the floor tile floor and it rolls across the floor and across a rug. The grape slows down when it rolls on the rug. The rug has _____ than the tile floor. (A) more friction (B) less friction Answer:","completion":"The rug has (A) more friction than the tile floor. Explanation: When Dean drops a grape on the floor tile and it rolls across the floor and across a rug, you observe that the grape slows down when it rolls on the rug. This change in speed is due to the difference in friction between the two surfaces. Friction is a force that opposes the motion of an object when it comes into contact with another surface. It depends on the nature of the surfaces in contact and their roughness. In this case, the rug is a rougher and softer surface compared to the hard and smooth tile floor. When the grape comes in contact with the rug, it experiences more resistance (friction) due to the rug's surface, which slows down the grape's rolling motion. Thus, the rug has more friction than the tile floor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Translate to English English:","completion":"On behalf of the UEN Group - (EN) Mr. President, I became a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health, and Food Safety only after the last elections, less than two and a half years ago, and immediately saw how REACH divided opinions. As a newly appointed member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health, and Food Safety following the previous elections just under two and a half years ago, I quickly observed the division of opinions surrounding the REACH initiative. REACH, or Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals, is a European Union regulation that addresses the production and use of chemical substances while aiming to protect both human health and the environment from potential hazards. The legislation has been met with a wide range of views and reactions, as various stakeholders within the EU member states may perceive its objectives and implications differently. Some may argue that REACH is a progressive step towards ensuring the safety of chemical substances used within European industries, by mandating that manufacturers and importers register information about the properties and hazards of these chemicals. This in turn allows for better evaluation and understanding of risks associated with their use, leading to a more informed decision-making process in terms of production, control, and distribution. On the other hand, critics of the regulation stress the potential negative impact that it may have on the EU's economy and competitiveness, citing the increased administrative burden on businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The costs associated with the registration, evaluation, and authorization processes can be significant, leading some market players to shy away from innovation and hinder the development of new, potentially more environmentally friendly substances. Furthermore, concerns have been raised about the ability of the REACH regulation to fully achieve its intended goals, as the complexity of the chemical substances industry and the vast number of chemicals in the market might result in gaps and deficiencies within the legislation. To address this issue, continuous improvement and refining of the regulation would be essential, taking into account the evolving nature of the industry and the ever-advancing knowledge in the fields of chemistry and toxicology. In conclusion, as a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health, and Food Safety, I have witnessed firsthand the differing viewpoints surrounding the REACH regulation. While it presents a robust framework for promoting the safe use of chemicals and protecting both human health and the environment, it is also important to consider the potential drawbacks, economic implications, and areas for improvement within the legislation. An ongoing dialogue between all relevant stakeholders, policymakers, and experts is essential in ensuring that REACH remains an effective and balanced approach towards the regulation of chemical substances in the European Union."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The first sentence states that Kulappully is part of the Palakkad Assembly Constituency and the Shornur Parliament Constituency. 2. The second sentence states that Kulappully is part of the Shornur Assembly Constituency and the Palakkad Parliament Constituency. Let me explain further. In India, the political divisions for representation purposes are structured in two tiers: 1. Assembly Constituency: This refers to a district or area within a state where a representative, often called a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA), is elected to represent the needs and interests of their constituents in the State Legislature. Assembly constituencies are thus part of a state's political administration and governance. 2. Parliament Constituency: This refers to a larger geographic area that may consist of multiple Assembly Constituencies. A representative, known as a Member of Parliament (MP), is elected from each Parliament Constituency to represent the needs and interests of their constituents in the national legislative body, the Parliament of India. In the first sentence, Kulappully is described as being part of the Palakkad Assembly Constituency, which means that it falls under the jurisdiction of the Palakkad MLA. Additionally, Kulappully is said to be part of the Shornur Parliament Constituency, which means that it falls under the jurisdiction of the Shornur MP. In the second sentence, Kulappully is described as being part of the Shornur Assembly Constituency, which means that it falls under the jurisdiction of the Shornur MLA. Additionally, Kulappully is said to be part of the Palakkad Parliament Constituency, which means that it falls under the jurisdiction of the Palakkad MP.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the ballet that the composer performed which led to him being carried on the shoulders of his admirers? On 18 February 1914 The Rite received its first concert performance (the music without the ballet), in St Petersburg under Serge Koussevitzky. On 5 April that year, Stravinsky experienced for himself the popular success of The Rite as a concert work, at the Casino de Paris. After the performance, again under Monteux, the composer was carried in triumph from the hall on the shoulders of his admirers. The Rite had its first British concert performance on 7 June 1921, at the Queen's Hall in London under Eugene Goossens. Its American premiere occurred on 3 March 1922, when Stokowski included it in a Philadelphia Orchestra programme. Goossens was also responsible for introducing The Rite to Australia on 23 August 1946 at the Sydney Town Hall, as guest conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.Stravinsky first conducted the work in 1926, in a concert given by the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam; two years later he brought it to the Salle Pleyel in Paris for two performances under his baton. Of these occasions he later wrote that \\"thanks to the experience I had gained with all kinds of orchestras ... I had reached a point where I could obtain exactly what I wanted, as I wanted it\\". Commentators have broadly agreed that the work has had a greater impact in the concert hall than it has on the stage; many of Stravinsky's revisions to the music were made with the concert hall rather than the theatre in mind. The work has become a staple in the repertoires of all the leading orchestras, and has been cited by Leonard Bernstein as \\"the most important piece of music of the 20th century\\".In 1963, 50 years after the premiere, Monteux (then aged 88) agreed to conduct a commemorative performance at London's Royal Albert Hall. According to Isaiah Berlin, a close friend of the composer, Stravinsky informed him that he had no intention of hearing his music being \\"murdered by that frightful butcher\\".

This network of 12 lines can get you to most places in the center of the city quickly. It's most necessary to get an Oyster Card or a Travelcard. Single tickets are priced starting at the intentionally absurd price of PS 4.80 (Zone 1-3), if you pay cash. Using an Oyster card, a single fare is PS 2.30 if you are traveling within the central Zone 1. On hot days it is also advisable to take a bottle of water with you as Underground trains are not air-conditioned. Last trains leave central London at around 00:30 weekdays, 23:30 Sundays. First trains leave the suburbs at around 5:00. The Bus System Outside the center of London, Tube stations are farther apart, so buses help fill the gaps. Also, the bus offers a cheaper alternative, even if it is a slower journey. Cash fares for London buses have been abolished -- you cannot pay cash. A bus fare costs PS 1.50 if using only buses, the fare is capped at PS 4.40 per day for Oyster or contactless users. River Services There are a number of different routes along the River Thames. The faster commuter services operate all day from Greenwich Pier to Embankment and from Putney and Chelsea harbour to Blackfriars during Peak Hours only. These routes will pass a number of places of interest including the Houses of Parliament and London Bridge. A return fare from Putney to Blackfriars will cost about 12 pounds. National Rail Once you leave Central London or if you are traveling South of the River Thames, the best public transport option will often be National Rail. There are numerous connections to the Rail System from the Tube. Travelcards can be used for travel on the National Rail (but not the Heathrow Express).

First, let's combine the constant terms of -3935 and 10838. We find their sum as follows: -3935 + 10838 = 6903. So the equation becomes: -117*r + 6903 = 0. Step 2: Isolate the variable r. Now, we want to get r by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, we'll need to subtract 6903 from both sides of the equation: -117*r + 6903 - 6903 = 0 - 6903. This simplifies to: -117*r = -6903. Step 3: Solve for r. To completely isolate r, we'll need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient -117: (-117*r) / -117 = -6903 / -117. This division gives us the following: r = 59. So, the solution for r is 59."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the difference between a gas turbine, a steam turbine, a water turbine and an internal combustion engine? What is the main function of disel engine at Gas turbine? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Select from: 1). no. 2). yes.","completion":"1. Gas Turbine vs Steam Turbine vs Water Turbine vs Internal Combustion Engine: - A gas turbine, also known as a combustion turbine, works on the principle of the Brayton cycle. It's mainly composed of a compressor to draw air in and compress it, a combustion chamber where fuel is burned to produce high-pressure gas, and a turbine where the energy is extracted from the high-pressure gas to do work. The work could be to produce electricity, propel an aircraft, or drive a pump, among other things. - A steam turbine operates on the Rankine cycle. In this system, water is boiled to generate high-pressure steam. The energy from this steam is then used to rotate the turbine and generate electricity. - A water turbine, on the other hand, makes use of the kinetic energy in flowing or falling water to generate rotary mechanical motion. This can be used directly for mechanical work or to generate electricity in hydropower installations. - An internal combustion engine burns fuel inside the engine itself. The pressure resulting from the combustion of fuel forces the movement of mechanical components, which can be converted to rotational movement for a vehicle or other machinery. This contrasts with gas and steam turbines where the combustion occurs outside the turbine. Overall, all these energy conversion systems perform the same fundamental task: they convert some form of energy into useful work. However, the fluids they work with (gas, steam, water), the principles of operation, and the type of work they perform may differ. 2. The main function of a diesel engine in a gas turbine: A diesel engine can be used as a driver in a gas turbine. This means that instead of burning gaseous fuels in the combustion chamber to generate high-pressure gas, the turbine is driven mechanically by the diesel engine. This can provide operational flexibility in areas where gaseous fuel supplies may be inconsistent or unavailable. 3. Regarding the similarity of the two questions: The answer is \\"1). no.\\" The questions aren't the same. The first question is asking for a comparison of several types of turbines and engines, focusing on how they differ in their operation and application. The second question focuses on a specific application of a diesel engine in a gas turbine.

The conductor Adrian Boult recalled, \\"Just before the Armistice, Gustav Holst burst into my office: 'Adrian, the YMCA are sending me to Salonica quite soon and Balfour Gardiner, bless his heart, has given me a parting present consisting of the Queen's Hall, full of the Queen's Hall Orchestra for the whole of a Sunday morning. So we're going to do The Planets, and you've got to conduct'.\\" There was a burst of activity to get things ready in time. The girls at St Paul's helped to copy out the orchestral parts, and the women of Morley and the St Paul's girls learned the choral part in the last movement.The performance was given on 29 September to an invited audience including Sir Henry Wood and most of the professional musicians in London. Five months later, when Holst was in Greece, Boult introduced The Planets to the general public, at a concert in February 1919; Holst sent him a long letter full of suggestions, but failed to convince him that the suite should be played in full. The conductor believed that about half an hour of such radically new music was all the public could absorb at first hearing, and he gave only five of the seven movements on that occasion.Holst enjoyed his time in Salonica, from where he was able to visit Athens, which greatly impressed him. His musical duties were wide-ranging, and even obliged him on occasion to play the violin in the local orchestra: \\"it was great fun, but I fear I was not of much use\\".

Dennis has a meeting lined up with DOE decisionmakers on the 25th. He is going to pitch the project as an approximately 100 mw power plant, to be owned by (read \\"financed by\\") DOE, with the gas pipeline owned by Dennis andor third parties (read \\"Enron\\"?). Dennis has run economics that show the DOE will get a more than 10% cost savings on the project compared to current PNM rates, even assuming a fairly high gas transport cost because of the smaller gas load. How did he do it? Very easy: they ran the power plant economics using about a 2.00 gas cost instead of current, real world prices. Dennis' argument is going to be: \\"I'll take the risk on building the pipeline and the power plant at a capped cost, and then sell the power plant to you.\\" \\"You take the risk on gas cost: if gas cost tracks the 18-24 month average, you will realize your 10% cost savings, but if current fuel costs continue or escalate, you lose.\\" Either way, your reliability improves and you kick PNM in the shins.\\" Dennis and Tino apparently think they can sell DOE on this. By the way, their current story on Richardson is that he won't resign, and won't be forced out by the administration because that would create even more publicity. You'll love this: they think Richardson is even more likely to sign off on the deal now because his chances of being nominated for VP or cabinet are dead and he now has nothing to lose in DC.

A year ago this week, Moon, a former human rights lawyer and candidate for the progressive Democratic Party, won a special presidential election held after former conservative President Park Geun-hye was impeached for her involvement in a bribery and corruption scandal. This year, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison during criminal trial related to the scandal in which she was charged with abuse of power, coercion and bribery. Moon assumed power at a time of increasing tensions, not just concerning North Korea’s accelerated nuclear and ballistic missile tests, but also China’s imposing of informal economic sanctions against South Korea for deploying the U.S. THAAD missile defense system, and the Trump administration’s talk of possible military action to end the North’s efforts to develop a nuclear armed intercontinental missile that could strike the U.S. mainland. In his inaugural address in May 2017, Moon promised to engage in shuttle diplomacy with Washington, Beijing and Pyongyang to work out a peaceful solution to the growing crisis. In a July speech in Berlin, President Moon laid out his vision for inter-Korean reconciliation that called for peaceful co-existence of the two Korean governments, but also said that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is “the absolute condition for peace.” But unlike past progressive South Korean governments that provided unconditional economic assistance, the Moon administration complied with economic sanctions in place and...

He instead trains new recruits while settling down with his fiancée, Julia Meade, a nurse who is unaware of Ethan's true job. He is approached by fellow IMF agent John Musgrave about a mission to rescue one of Ethan's protégés, Lindsey Farris. Lindsey was captured while investigating arms dealer Owen Davian. Musgrave has already prepared a team for Ethan: Declan Gormley, Zhen Lei, and his old partner Luther Stickell. The team rescues Lindsey and collects two damaged laptop computers. As they flee, Ethan discovers an explosive pellet implanted in Lindsey's head. Before he can disable it, it goes off and kills her. Back in the U.S., Ethan and Musgrave are reprimanded by IMF Director Theodore Brassel. Ethan learns that Lindsey mailed him a postcard before her capture and discovers a magnetic microdot under the stamp. IMF technician Benji Dunn recovers enough data from the laptops to determine Davian will be in Vatican City to obtain a mysterious object called the \\"Rabbit's Foot\\". Ethan plans a mission to capture Davian without seeking official approval. Before leaving, he and Julia have an impromptu wedding at the hospital's chapel. The team successfully infiltrates Vatican City and captures Davian. On the flight back to the U.S., Ethan threatens to drop Davian from the plane as he interrogates him about the Rabbit's Foot, but Davian refuses to reveal anything.

Oscar Leonard Carl Pistorius was born to Henke and Sheila Pistorius on 22 November 1986 in Sandton, Johannesburg, in what was then Transvaal Province (now Gauteng Province) of South Africa. He grew up in a Christian home and has an elder brother, Carl, and a younger sister, Aimee. Pistorius credits his mother, who died at the age of 43 when Pistorius was 15 years old, as a major influence in his life. Pistorius is a white South African with Italian ancestry from his maternal great-grandfather, who was an Italian emigrant to Kenya. Pistorius competed in T44 (single below-knee amputees) events though he is actually classified in T43 (double below knee amputee). Sometimes referred to as the \\"Blade Runner\\" and \\"the fastest man on no legs\\", Pistorius took part in the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens and came third overall in the T44 (one leg amputated below the knee) 100-metre event. Despite falling in the preliminary round for the 200 metres, he qualified for the final. He went on to win the final in a world record time of 21.97 seconds, beating a pair of American runners both possessing a single amputation, Marlon Shirley and Brian Frasure. In 2005, Pistorius finished sixth in the non-disabled South African Championships over 400 metres with a world-record time of 47.34 seconds, and at the Paralympic World Cup in the same year, he won gold in the 100 metres and 200 metres, beating his previous 200-metre world record. At the 2006 IPC Athletics World Championships, Pistorius won gold in the 100-, 200- and 400-metre events, breaking the world record over 200 metres. On 17 March 2007, he set a disability sports world record for the 400 metres (46.56 seconds) at the South African Senior Athletics Championships in Durban; and at the Nedbank Championships for the Physically Disabled held in Johannesburg in April 2007, he became the world record holder of the 100- and 200-metre events with times of 10.91 and 21.58 seconds respectively. Pistorius was invited by the IAAF to take part in what would have been his first international non-disabled event, the 400-metre race at the IAAF Grand Prix in Helsinki, Finland, in July 2005. He was unable to attend, however, because of school commitments. On 13 July 2007, Pistorius ran in the 400-metre race at Rome's Golden Gala and finished second in run B with a time of 46.90 seconds, behind Stefano Braciola who ran 46.72 seconds. This was a warm-up for his appearance at the 400 metres at the Norwich Union British Grand Prix at the Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield on 15 July 2007. As American Olympic champion Jeremy Wariner stumbled at the start of the race and stopped running, Pistorius took seventh place in a field of eight in wet conditions with a time of 47.65 seconds. However, he was later disqualified for running outside his lane. The race was won by American Angelo Taylor with a time of 45.25 seconds. Pistorius had ambitions of competing in other non-disabled events. In particular, he had set his sights on competing at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, but was ultimately not selected by the South African Olympic Committee (see below). Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What are T44 events?","completion":"T44 events are athletic competitions specifically designed for single below-knee amputees. These events cater to athletes who have one leg amputated below the knee, allowing them to participate in various sports activities alongside others with similar physical disabilities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Jean-Marie Le Pen (French pronunciation: [Za ma.Ri l@.pen]; born 20 June 1928) is a French politician who has served as Honorary President of the National Front since January 2011 and a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from France since 2004, previously between 1984 to 2003. He previously served as President of the National Front from 1972 to 2011. Le Pen is often nicknamed the \\"Menhir\\", due to his \\"granitic nature\\" as he is perceived as someone who does not give way to pressure or who cannot be easily knocked down. It also connects him to France's Celtic origins. Le Pen is often described as one of the most flamboyant and charismatic orators in Europe, whose speech blends folksy humour, crude attacks and rhetorical finesse. However, Le Pen remains a polarizing figure in France: opinions regarding him tend to be quite strong. A 2002 IPSOS poll showed that while 22% of the electorate have a good or very good opinion of Le Pen, and 13% an unfavorable opinion, 61% have a very unfavorable opinion. Le Pen and the National Front are described by much of the media and nearly all commentators as far right. Le Pen himself and the rest of his party disagree with this label; earlier in his political career, Le Pen described his position as \\"neither right, nor left, but French\\" (ni droite, ni gauche, francais). He later described his position as right-wing and opposed to the \\"socialo-communists\\" and other right-wing parties, which he deems are not real right-wing parties. At other times, for example during the 2002 election campaign, he declared himself \\"socially left-wing, economically right-wing, nationally French\\" (socialement a gauche, economiquement a droite, nationalement francais). He further contends that most of the French political and media class are corrupt and out of touch with the real needs of the common people, and conspire to exclude Le Pen and his party from mainstream politics. Le Pen criticizes the other political parties as the \\"establishment\\" and lumped all major parties (Communist, Socialist, Union for French Democracy (UDF) and Rally for the Republic (RPR)) into the \\"Gang of Four\\" (la bande des quatre - an allusion to the Gang of Four during China's Cultural Revolution). what kind of opinions did they have?","completion":"A 2002 IPSOS poll showed that while 22% of the electorate have a good or very good opinion of Le Pen, and 13% an unfavorable opinion, 61% have a very unfavorable opinion."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please tell me if those questions are the same. Choices: (A). no (B). yes","completion":"Question 1: Has anyone with 500 marks been selected in AFMC? AFMC (Armed Forces Medical College) is a prestigious medical college in India, established for the purpose of providing trained medical personnel to the Indian Armed Forces. Admissions to AFMC are based on various factors, including an entrance examination score (NEET), followed by an interview process, and medical fitness assessment. It is not uncommon for candidates with lower marks to be selected for admission to AFMC, as the final admission decision depends on a combination of factors, with entrance examination scores constituting only a part of the admission process. Students with 500 marks or more may have been admitted to AFMC in the past; however, this cannot be guaranteed for every admission cycle as the cutoff scores vary depending on the performance of the applicants each year. Additionally, the overall merit and individual performance in the interview process can significantly influence one's final selection. Question 2: Dell vs HP for mechanical engineering? When considering Dell and HP for mechanical engineering coursework or projects, it is essential to keep in mind that both brands offer a wide range of laptops that feature different specifications and cater to various user needs. Therefore, it is crucial to focus on the specific laptop models rather than the brands themselves while making a decision. For mechanical engineering, you would need a laptop with a powerful processor, sufficient RAM, dedicated graphics, and ample storage space to handle complex applications, simulations, and CAD software. While both Dell and HP have laptops that may satisfy these requirements, you must analyze the detailed specifications of each laptop model before making a choice. Popular models like the Dell XPS or Precision series and the HP Spectre or ZBook series offer powerful components catering to the needs of engineering professionals and students. You may also want to consider factors such as the build quality, portability, battery life, and pricing of the models from both brands before making a decision. Customer reviews and online comparison tools can be helpful while comparing the laptops to make an informed choice. Answer to the question – Are those questions the same? (A) No These questions are not the same. The first question deals with the possibility of being selected in the Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC) based on a specific marks criterion, while the second question focuses on choosing between laptops from well-known brands (Dell and HP) for mechanical engineering purposes. These questions address entirely different subjects and do not have any direct relevance to each other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I was so excited to come here because my friends and family talk about it all the time. We got into Vegas, met my brother for some drinks and couldn't wait to get out of there. The place is nice, but the service is horrible. There was literally 3 people sitting at the bar, our group of 5 sitting outside and 3 other people playing on one of the games on the patio. The 3 in our group already had drinks so my husband went to the bar to get us a drink. 15 minutes later, he finally gets helped. The bartender didn't pick her head up at all to help him, apparently she's not a great multi-tasker. He also said that she gave a guy about 40 extra in change, but lucky for her he told her she gave him too much. My sister in law said they didn't have the drink she wanted even though it said in big bold letters on their tv menu that they had it. Apparently they didn't have ANY of the beers listed on their TV menu. How hard is it to change that? My brother went up later to get a new beer, he asked her what kind of IPA's they had. She named one, but sounded like there was more so they just looked at eachother until my brother asked if that was it. She said yes. Then he said \\"What else do you have?\\" She said \\"As far as what?\\" he said,....anything? She grabbed the drink menu and threw it at him. Seriously??? We then wanted to order some food and she got upset about that so my husband just ordered from another guy that was running around like crazy because apparently he was the only one that wanted to work. (it is around midnight at this time, which is not late in Vegas standards). The food was interesting which is why they are getting 2 stars instead of 1.

A sense of empathy(the ability of feeling and sharing another person's feelings) and one hundred percent prepared to help your students is important. Also, if you are a special education teacher working in the high school, it is your job to make sure your special education students are able to be employed after they graduate, and then the special education teacher needs to stay in touch with the special students a year after they graduate to make sure they are employed and can support themselves. Education is a very political field next to working in politics. One needs to know what to say, when to say it and make sure it is a benefit for everyone involved. It is a mixture of knowing medical diagnosis and teaching with that in mind. Your record needs to be perfect, and it would also help to be a very strong Christian because you will need to pray often to yourself. This position is not about the money but more of a service.

Article: It was near Christmas during my first term teaching at a new school. I loved my small special class more than any group I had taught in the past. They were hungry for knowledge and I was enjoying teaching. Other teachers had told me that our children were from poor families and not to expect any child to bring a Christmas gift. In fact, I wasn't expecting any gifts. Imagine my surprise when every child brought me a gift on the day before our holiday break. First, I got a much-loved toy monkey from a shy girl. I was told, \\"He is my favorite, but I love you and I want him to be with you, Miss Taylor.\\" How thrilled I was! Next came a new set of Christmas tree lights that was \\"missing\\" from a mother's cupboard . Finally, I came to one little boy's gift which I had never received. It was an old, dirty and broken Christmas storybook. Just when I wanted to show my happiness, I was interrupted by the giver, \\"And see, it is new! It still has the price tag .\\" When other children laughed at him, I stopped them and said, \\"Oh, books are good in that way. The story is always new if you have not read it before. Now, Let's read one together.\\" Everyone listened quietly as I read the most wonderful Christmas story of my life. I still keep those Christmas gifts. They always remind me of my lovely kids.

First batch of ice cream, I shut down the operation when the motor began to lug, as instructed in the manuel, and discovered a 1-inch rime of frozen ice cream with a totally liquid center.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I can use this background: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products. Now, I have a new situation: Berg city used only gas powered vehicles while Hill city used electrical vehicles. The two cities had a similar population and vehicle numbers. Answer this question please: Which city had fewer problems with carbon monoxide? A:","completion":"Given the background information and the situation presented, it is clear that Hill City, which used electric vehicles (EVs), had fewer problems with carbon monoxide. Gasoline-powered vehicles, like the ones predominantly used in Berg City, emit various harmful materials, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile hydrocarbons. These emissions contribute to air pollution and can have negative impacts on both the environment and human health. The high temperatures in gasoline engines facilitate the formation of nitrogen oxides, while carbon monoxide is produced as a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Though catalytic converters can reduce the harmful effects of these emissions, they are still present in the exhaust from gasoline-powered vehicles. In contrast, electric vehicles used in Hill City do not have internal combustion engines and, as a result, do not emit carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, or volatile hydrocarbons. Instead, electric vehicle emissions are limited to those associated with the production of the electricity used to charge their batteries. As long as the electricity is generated from clean and renewable sources, the overall emissions from electric vehicles tend to be much lower than those from gasoline-powered vehicles. Thus, Hill City would have had fewer problems with carbon monoxide. It is important to note that while electric vehicles are a cleaner alternative to gasoline-powered vehicles, their overall environmental impact largely depends on the source of electricity used for charging. If the electricity is generated from fossil fuels, the emissions associated with electric vehicles would still be present, albeit indirectly, and in lower amounts compared to gasoline-powered counterparts. In conclusion, as Hill City mainly used electric vehicles, it experienced fewer problems with carbon monoxide compared to Berg City, which relied on gasoline-powered vehicles."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: next prev Iranian state television is airing the first images of the site of an airplane crash in southern Iran that killed 65 people. The footage aired on Tuesday shows the plane crash site against the side of a snow-covered mountain near Yasuj, some 780 kilometers, or 485 miles, south of Tehran, Iran's capital from which the flight took off on Sunday. The tail of the plane could be seen in the footage. Separately, Iran's Revolutionary Guard released a still image of the site captured by one of its drones, which it said showed corpses in the snow. The Aseman Airlines ATR-72, a twin-engine turboprop used for short-distance regional flying, went down on Sunday in foggy weather. All on board Flight EP3704 were killed, including 59 passengers and six crew members. ||||| Mohammad Taghi Tabatabai, a spokesman for Iran Aseman Airlines, first told state television that everyone aboard the aircraft had been killed. But the airline later issued a statement saying it could not reach the crash site and could not “accurately and definitely confirm” any deaths. Iran has been struck by several accidents and natural disasters recently, and lawmakers have sought the resignation of Mr. Akhoundi and the minister for labor and social welfare, Ali Rabiei, because of their “inability” to address the challenges. Gholamreza Tajgardoun, who leads the Budget Consolidation Committee in Parliament, told the semiofficial news agency ISNA on Monday that lawmakers would seek to impeach the two ministers if they did not resign. The plane was carrying 60 passengers and six crew members, according to state media. News reports said it disappeared from radar screens 50 minutes after taking off from Mehrabad International Airport, in western Tehran, which mainly serves domestic flights but has some international routes. Under decades of international sanctions, Iran’s commercial passenger aircraft fleet has aged, and it has regularly suffered accidents in recent years. The sanctions prevented the oil-rich country from updating its fleet, forcing it to use substandard Russian planes and to patch up older models far past their normal years of service, using spare parts bought on the black market. The ATR-72 involved in the crash on Sunday was a French-Italian aircraft introduced in the late 1980s. The Aseman fleet was delivered from 1993 to 2009. ||||| Iran Aseman Airlines flight 3704 from Tehran to Yasuj, Iran, impacted a mountainside in the Mount Dena range to the northeast of Yasuj Airport. All on board (60 passengers, two flight crew members, two cabin crew members and two security officers) were killed. The flight departed Mehrabad Airport at 08:05 hours local time and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL210. At 09:22 the aircraft was over the Isfahan (IFN) VOR. The flight requested permission to descend from FL210 to FL170. This was approved by Tehran ACC. The flight followed Airway W114 from the OBTUX navaid to the Yasuj DVOR/DME. Minimum altitude on that airway is FL170. Minimum safe altitude over the sector close to Yasuj Airport is 15500 feet. Flight tracking website Flightradar24 shows that the aircraft reached FL170 at 09:25:59. At 09:29:10 the aircraft was 14 nautical miles from the airport. Last radio contact with the flight was at 09:30:10, when the pilots acknowledged a weather report. At 09:32:00 the pilot keyed the mic but there was no transmission. Attempts to contact the flight by the Yasuj controller at 09:34 were fruitless. The wreckage was located the following day at an elevation of about 3600 m (11800 feet). Weather conditions at the crash site included snow and strong winds. The approach procedure for Yasuj Airport is a circling NDB approach with a 25NM minimum safe altitude circle of 11500 ft - 15500 ft. Flights from Tehran first have to cross Mount Dena, which is an 80 km mountain range with a highest elevation of 4,409 m (14,465 ft). After arriving over the NDB at the airport at 15,000 feet, a teardrop approach has to be flown for landing on runway 13/31.

This fear dated back to her childhood, when she had once fumbled through a presentation in front of her schoolmates and was laughed at. It left her feeling vulnerable and ostracized. As the day of the speech approached, Mary, who was already well-prepared for her part, noticed Kayla's discomfort. She decided to help Kayla overcome her fear. One evening, after they had spent hours at the library researching their topics, Mary suggested they head to a nearby park to practice their speeches. The park was serene and almost empty, offering Kayla the perfect atmosphere to practice without judgments. Mary encouraged Kayla to imagine the trees and passing squirrels as their audience. At first, Kayla stumbled over her words and felt her heart race with anxiety. But, with Mary's gentle guidance and unwavering support, Kayla gradually found her voice. Over the next few days, Mary and Kayla continued to practice together. They held informal sessions in both private and slightly more public spaces, such as local cafes and community centers. Mary consistently provided feedback, suggestions, and constant reassurance to build up Kayla's confidence. On the day of the speech, the auditorium was filled with people, including friends, family, and mentors. As their names were called, Mary and Kayla walked onto the stage together. Kayla felt a surge of nervous energy, but she also felt a newfound sense of confidence – a result of the unwavering support from her friend and the countless hours they had spent honing her public speaking skills. Mary delivered her speech flawlessly, just as Kayla knew she would. Her eloquence and charisma captivated the audience. As Mary concluded her speech, she whispered some final words of encouragement to Kayla before taking her seat. For a brief moment, a familiar wave of anxiety washed over Kayla as she took the microphone. But then she remembered Mary's reassurances and the countless hours they had practiced together. She took a deep breath, locked eyes with her friend, and began her speech. To her surprise, the words flowed smoothly, and her message was coherent and well-received by the audience. They applauded her not just for her speech, but also for her courage to stand before them and conquer her fears. As the event came to an end, and the two friends walked off the stage, Kayla couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment. She knew she would never look at public speaking the same way again. She also realized the importance of having a friend who believed in her more than she believed in herself. From that day forward, Kayla continued to work on her fear of public speaking, never missing an opportunity to share her voice with the world. She learned that a support system could make even the most insurmountable challenge seem achievable. As for Mary, her friendship with Kayla deepened, and it reminded her that everyone has something to offer, even when they are afraid. Mary learned that being there for someone and helping them face their fears could make a lasting difference in their lives.
