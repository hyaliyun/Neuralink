Pour the bleach solution into the container. Let the container soak for 1-2 hours. Wash out the container thoroughly. Article:","completion":"Title: A Simple Guide to Cleaning and Disinfecting Containers with Bleach Solution Introduction: Containers are widely used for storing various items, from food and beverages to chemicals and cleaning supplies. Over time, these containers may accumulate grime, harbor bacteria, or develop unpleasant smells. One effective and affordable method to clean and disinfect containers is by using a bleach solution. This article will walk you through the steps to achieve a hygienic and fresh-smelling container using this method. Step 1: Prepare the Bleach Solution The first step in this process is to prepare a bleach solution. You will need a small amount of bleach and warm water. It is important to follow the manufacturer's instructions for the recommended bleach-to-water ratio, as this may vary depending on the concentration of the bleach. Typically, one tablespoon of bleach for every gallon of warm water is suitable. Step 2: Pour the Bleach Solution into the Container After preparing the bleach solution, gently pour it into the container needing cleaning. Make sure the entire interior surface of the container comes into contact with the solution, as this will ensure thorough disinfection. If the container has a lid, you may also soak it in the solution for a comprehensive cleaning. Step 3: Soak the Container Allow the container to soak in the bleach solution for 1-2 hours. This duration ensures that the bleach has enough time to break down any stubborn grime, eliminate odors, and kill any bacteria present. If the container has stubborn stains or a particularly strong smell, you may extend the soaking time as needed. Step 4: Wash the Container Thoroughly After soaking the container, it is crucial to wash it thoroughly to remove any bleach residue and dislodged dirt. A sponge or cloth can be used to scrub the interior and exterior surfaces of the container. Take care to ensure that all corners and crevices are cleaned and the bleach residue is entirely rinsed off. Step 5: Dry the Container Finally, after washing and rinsing the container, allow it to air dry completely. This will help prevent the growth of bacteria and keep it smelling fresh. You may also consider using a clean cloth to wipe the container dry, especially if you need to store items in it immediately. Conclusion: In conclusion, using a bleach solution is an effective and simple way to clean and disinfect various types of containers. By following the steps detailed in this guide, you can ensure your containers are not only clean but also free from harmful bacteria, for the safe storage of your valued items."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Unhappy with the efforts of Will Records, the band signed a worldwide deal with Richard Branson's V2 Records in 1999, their first release on the label being the Signal to Snow Ratio EP in September that year. In May 2000 they released their second album, The Sophtware Slump, to critical acclaim. NME later placed it at number 34 in their \\"Top 100 Greatest Albums of the Decade\\", and The Independent described it as \\"easily the equal of OK Computer\\". The album reached number 36 on the UK Albums Chart, and the band's fanbase increased, including celebrities such as David Bowie, Kate Moss and Liv Tyler. By early 2001 the album had sold 80,000 copies worldwide. The first single from the album, \\"The Crystal Lake\\", became the band's first UK top 40 single when it was reissued in 2001. Around the time that The Sophtware Slump was released, Grandaddy was invited to open for Elliott Smith on his tour for Figure 8. On some nights, Smith would join Grandaddy onstage and sing lead vocals on portions of \\"He's Simple, He's Dumb, He's the Pilot\\". The band later opened for Coldplay on their US tour in mid-2001. Also in 2001, the band's version of The Beatles' \\"Revolution\\" was used in the film I Am Sam. Their third album, Sumday, recorded in Lytle's home studio, was released in 2003. The band promoted it with a pre-release US tour with Pete Yorn followed by a three-week European tour (including a performance at the Glastonbury Festival) and a larger US tour. Lytle described the album as \\"Grandaddy influenced by Grandaddy ... the ultimate Grandaddy record\\". In 2004 and 2005 Lytle recorded Just Like the Fambly Cat, which was released as a Grandaddy album, although by then the band had decided to split up. The title is a reference to Lytle's desire to leave Modesto, a town which he complained \\"sucks out people's souls\\". Lytle created the album over a year and a half in his home studio in Modesto, \\"fueled by alcohol, painkillers for his body aches and ... recreational drugs\\", with only Burtch from the remainder of the band playing on it. At the same time as working on the album, Lytle created the EP Excerpts From the Diary of Todd Zilla, which was released first.

(ii) Logan is a native English speaker..","completion":"The English reading skills of Lawrence are far superior to Logan because Lawrence is a native English speaker. Logan is also a native English speaker, but there are other factors that have contributed to the difference in their respective language abilities. Lawrence's journey to mastering English began even before he entered school, thanks to the loving environment created by his parents. They took it upon themselves to ensure Lawrence was surrounded by a rich and diverse vocabulary from a young age. Books filled the shelves of his home, stories were shared at bedtime, and conversations contained vivid descriptions that painted pictures in his mind. On top of that, his parents encouraged him to ask questions and guided him to understand the subtle complexities of language such as idioms, similes, and metaphors. All of these elements cumulatively influenced Lawrence to grow into a young man with a deep appreciation for the written word. As he progressed through school, he found solace in reading and writing assignments. Teachers praised him for his impeccable grasp of the language and his ability to craft engaging narratives. Additionally, his proficiency enabled him to excel in various literature courses, demonstrating an ability to analyze complex themes and understand the nuances of authors' intentions. On the other hand, Logan, despite being a native English speaker, did not have the same exposure to the language as Lawrence. He grew up in a household where reading and writing took a backseat to other activities. Instead, his parents focused more on physical activities and outdoor pursuits, which left little time for cultivating his linguistic skills. Though Logan was capable of comprehending English, his reading and writing abilities lagged behind his peers. As he advanced through school, the gap between the two boys' English skills only grew wider. Logan encountered trouble decoding texts, often relying on others for assistance. His comprehension was also subpar, making it hard for him to analyze the deeper meaning behind various literary works. Teachers, noting his struggles, attempted to provide additional resources to help Logan improve. However, the years of inattention made it a herculean task to overcome his deficiencies. Furthermore, the social circles in which the two boys moved also contributed to the disparity in their English skills. Lawrence surrounded himself with friends who shared his passion for literature, further refining and enhancing his already excellent abilities. In contrast, Logan spent his time with friends who showed little interest in the written word. This didn't provide him with the opportunities to stretch and develop his language skills, perpetuating the difference between the two boys' reading abilities. Despite their contrasting journeys, it is important to note that language development is not the sole measure of a person's worth. Logan excelled in other areas, such as sports and arts, which made him a well-rounded individual. On the other hand, Lawrence's superior command of English allowed him to pursue opportunities that might otherwise have been inaccessible. In conclusion, the English reading skills of Lawrence are far superior to Logan's not simply because Lawrence is a native English speaker, but rather due to the difference in exposure, environment, and interests between the two. Both boys possess their unique strengths, and any future opportunities they decide to chase will be undeniably shaped by the skills and experiences each has gained in their respective spheres."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Dario Fo (Italian pronunciation: ['da:rjo 'fo]; 24 March 1926 - 13 October 2016) was an Italian actor-playwright, comedian, singer, theatre director, stage designer, songwriter, painter, political campaigner for the Italian left-wing and the recipient of the 1997 Nobel Prize in Literature. In his time he was \\"arguably the most widely performed contemporary playwright in world theatre\\". Much of his dramatic work depends on improvisation and comprises the recovery of \\"illegitimate\\" forms of theatre, such as those performed by giullari (medieval strolling players) and, more famously, the ancient Italian style of commedia dell'arte. His plays have been translated into 30 languages and performed across the world, including in Argentina, Chile, Iran, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka Sweden, the UK and Yugoslavia. Context: An eldest child, Fo was born at Sangiano, in Lombardy's Province of Varese, near the eastern shore of Lago Maggiore. His younger brother Fulvio would become a theatre administrator, their younger sister Bianca Fo Garambois, a writer. Their mother, Pina Rota Fo, from a peasant background, wrote a book of reminiscences of the area between the wars, Il paese delle rane (Land of Frogs, 1978). Their father, Felice, was a station master for the Italian state railway, and the family frequently moved along the Swiss border when Felice was transferred to new postings. Felice, a socialist, was also an actor, appearing for an amateur theatre company in works by Ibsen among others. Fo learned storytelling from his maternal grandfather and Lombard fishers and glassblowers. Among the places in which Fo lived during his early years was Porto Valtravaglia, a glassblowing colony in which, it has been claimed, resided the highest percentage of insane people in Italy. In 1942, Fo moved to Milan to study at the Academy Brera Academy. However, the Second World War intervened. Fo joined the fascist army of Mussolini's Repubblica Sociale Italiana. Years later, Fo did not deny this affiliation but supported this moot thesis: he did it to avoid arousing suspicion, because his family was active in the anti-fascist Resistance and Fo helped his father to smuggle refugees and Allied soldiers to Switzerland by disguising them as Lombard peasants. His father is also thought to have helped smuggle Jewish scientists to the safety of Switzerland. As the end of the war approached, Fo joined an anti-aircraft division of the navy, anticipating an immediate discharge due to a shortage of munitions. He was mistaken and was instead dispatched to a camp in Monza at which Benito Mussolini himself arrived. Fo soon deserted with the aid of false documents and wandered for a while before joining a parachute squadron. He then deserted this as well, prompting a further unsuccessful search for the Resistance movement during which he slept rough in the countryside. After the war Fo returned to the Brera Academy, also taking up architectural studies at the Politecnico di Milano. He started a thesis on Roman architecture, but becoming disillusioned by the cheap impersonal work expected of architects after the war, he left his studies before his final examinations. He had a nervous breakdown; a doctor told him to spend time doing that which brought him joy. He began to paint and became involved in the piccoli teatri (small theatres) movement, in which he began to present improvised monologues. He considered his artistic influences to include Beolco, Brecht, Chekhov, De Filippo, Gramsci, Mayakovsky, Moliere, Shaw and Strehler. Question: Who are Dario Fo's parents?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Dario Fo's parents were Felice Fo and Pina Rota Fo.

Between the two methods provided, wrapping the crust in foil (Option A) is the more reasonable and effective approach for achieving this goal. Wrapping the crust in aluminum foil allows you to create a barrier between the heat source and the crust, effectively reducing the direct exposure to heat and lowering the risk of the crust becoming burnt. The foil also acts as an insulator, reflecting heat away from the crust edges to prevent over-browning. To utilize this method, simply place a small strip of aluminum foil around the edges of the pie crust, ensuring that they are adequately covered. It is also important to make sure the foil is not too tight around the crust, as this can cause the crust to steam instead of becoming flaky and crisp. On the other hand, using saran wrap (Option B) to wrap the edges of the pie crust is not an advisable method for preventing crust burning. Plastic saran wrap is not designed to withstand the high temperatures of an oven, and as a result, it could melt and create an unpleasant taste and potential health hazard due to the release of chemical compounds. Furthermore, the melted plastic may make a mess on the pie and the oven, ultimately making the entire baking process more difficult and less enjoyable. In conclusion, the most reasonable method for preventing a pie crust from burning is to wrap the crust edges in aluminum foil. Not only does this technique provide an effective barrier against direct heat exposure, but it is also a safe and practical method suited for baking."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When the Moon passes through Earths penumbra, it is a penumbral eclipse. Since Earths shadow is large, a lunar eclipse lasts for hours. Anyone with a view of the Moon can see a lunar eclipse. So unlike a solar eclipse, it doesnt get dark on Earth. Instead it gets dark on the Moon. Partial lunar eclipses occur at least twice a year, but total lunar eclipses are less common.

Children need time to stand and stare. They should be allowed to get bored to that they can develop their ability to be creative. Children are expected by their parents to be reading a textbook all the time. However, research shows that it may _ the development of their imagination, while boredom can give them opportunities to develop creativity. Boredom is often linked with loneliness, but a writer named Meera Syal said boredom had helped here in developing her mind. She told researchers about her childhood. Having few things todo, Syal often talked with her neighbors. She also tried to do things like learning to bake cakes. \\"But importantly, I Thought and wrote a lot, because I was bored,\\" Syal said. She kept a diary, filling here time with short stories and poems she made up. Grayson Perry, an artist, grew up in a family with little money. He enjoyed himself by making up stories, drawing pictures for his stories and reading many books in the library. Bored but free, he spent hours looking out of the window, watching the changing clouds and seasons. Perry filled up his free time with what he liked. He became creative, because he could think freely. Dr. Belton is an expert on the effects of emotions on learning. \\"Boredom could be an uncomfortable feeling,\\" she said. \\"But some young people cannot deal with that boredom creatively. So sometimes they may break a classroom window, or drive a car out for a mad race.\\" Usually, when children have nothing to do, they would turn on the TV, the computer, or the phone. Their time on these things has increased, yet they need to have time to think about their experiences through play or just watching the world around them. It is this kind of thinking that can inspire the imagination. On the other hand, the TV or phone may cut short the thinking process.

Process: - A star burns in space - Eventually it burns all its hydrogen - Becomes a red giant - Once the red giant burns itself out - The core of the star collapses - The gasses will start to disperse - Only the core is left - A white dwarf has been formed. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is less hydrogen happens, how will it affect it burns longer. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The process of a star's life cycle typically involves burning its hydrogen through nuclear fusion, eventually causing it to expand into a red giant, burning out, and then collapsing into a white dwarf. This process is driven by the availability of hydrogen in the star's core. We'll analyze how a perturbation in the amount of hydrogen affects this process and determine if there are any direct or indirect effects on the star's life cycle. A star's life cycle depends on its mass, which in turn determines how much nuclear fuel it has and the speed at which it burns that fuel. If a star were to have less hydrogen, it would directly impact the duration of its life cycle and the rate at which it burns through its available fuel. When a star has less hydrogen, it will not have enough fuel to sustain nuclear fusion in its core for an extended period. As a result, the fusion reactions occurring within the star will have less energy output, causing the star to burn through its hydrogen at a slower rate. This could potentially lead to a longer life cycle for the star compared to the scenario with normal amounts of hydrogen. However, this scenario also comes with some potential consequences. The reduced energy output from the lower hydrogen quantities can cause the star's core temperature to drop. This will affect the delicate balance between the forces of gravity and radiation pressure within the star, potentially impacting the stability and structure of the star over time. The perturbed star may also experience changes in its evolution path. As it consumes hydrogen at a slower pace, it might not expand into a red giant with the same characteristics as a star with a regular hydrogen composition. The red giant phase could be altered, resulting in a final stage of evolution that is different from the usual white dwarf state. The dispersal of gasses may also occur over a different timescale than one would expect for a typical star, and the ultimate fate of the star might be quite different, depending on the dynamics of its internal processes. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of a star having less hydrogen significantly impacts the star's life cycle both directly and indirectly. With less hydrogen, the star's rate of nuclear fusion is reduced, leading to a potentially longer life cycle and altered red giant phase. This lower hydrogen content can also impact the star's stability and structure by lowering the core temperature and affecting the balance between gravity and radiation pressure. The hypothesis influences not only the duration of the star's life, but also its evolutionary path and ultimate fate, clearly indicating that it has both direct and indirect effects on the star's life process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: i. yes; ii. no;","completion":"i. yes; The statement \\"They mobilized to resist various attempts at the dissolution of communal landholdings and used legal recognition of 'empowered caciques' to further communal organization\\" is indeed a correct answer to the question \\"What did the highland peasants resist attempts at?\\" Throughout history, the highland peasants, often referred to as indigenous communities in countries like Peru, Mexico, and Bolivia, have faced significant challenges due to the exploitation and oppression experienced under colonial rule and post-colonial governments. One primary concern for these communities was the protection of their ancestral lands and the communal organization associated with them. These communal landholdings held significant cultural, social, and economic value for the highland peasants, allowing them to maintain their traditional way of life. The highland peasants resisted attempts at the dissolution of communal landholdings mainly because of the imposition of external forces that threatened to dismantle and destroy their traditional way of life. Colonial powers and post-colonial governments sought to impose private property systems and integrate the indigenous people into the larger economic structure, often with the objectives of resource extraction, exploitation of indigenous labor, and expansion of settler colonies. In their efforts to resist these attempts, the highland peasants used various strategies, including legal recognition of empowered caciques to ensure communal organization. Empowered caciques were native leaders who held local administrative and judicial authority recognized by the colonial and post-colonial governments. They used their positions and legal recognition to negotiate land rights, facilitate conflict resolution, and push for the continued existence and protection of communal landholdings. Additionally, the highland peasants mobilized collectively to protect their lands and communal organization, creating various forms of resistance groups that acted against external threats. These collective actions took many forms, including protests, legal battles, petitions, and, in some cases, armed struggle. Some examples of this resistance include the Peruvian peasant revolts during the late colonial period like the Tupac Amaru II rebellion or the Zapatista movement in Mexico. In conclusion, the statement provided is a correct answer as it highlights the key aspects of highland peasants resisting attempts at the dissolution of communal landholdings and the practical steps, such as the legal recognition of empowered caciques, they took to protect their communal organization and way of life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible answers: - can be used to package a giftbasket that's full of condiments; - can be used to package a sandwich that's full of condiments;","completion":"In terms of naive physics reasoning, the more sound solution for using wrapping paper would be to package a gift basket that's full of condiments. There are a few factors that make this solution more suitable compared to packaging a sandwich that's full of condiments. 1. Structure: A gift basket usually has a solid and well-defined structure that can provide support and hold the condiments securely. Wrapping paper can be easily wrapped around the gift basket and provide an appealing appearance. On the other hand, a sandwich full of condiments has a more delicate and soft structure. The condiments within the sandwich might make it difficult to handle, as squeezing or pressing the sandwich can cause the contents to spill out, resulting in a mess. 2. Presentation: A gift basket wrapped in attractive wrapping paper can enhance the overall presentation and make the gift even more appealing. In contrast, using wrapping paper to package a sandwich, especially one full of condiments, may not look as visually pleasing. It could also potentially damage the sandwich's appearance or compromise its structural integrity. 3. Functionality: Wrapping paper is typically used for packaging and presenting gifts, and a gift basket of condiments is an appropriate gift item. The purpose of using wrapping paper in this scenario aligns with its intended function. Conversely, packaging a sandwich with wrapping paper may not be as functional, as it could complicate the process of consuming the sandwich. Additionally, wrapping paper is generally not designed to be in contact with food and may not be food-safe, posing potential health risks. 4. Practicality: Finally, gift baskets are often given as presents during special occasions, and using wrapping paper can contribute to the festive atmosphere. In contrast, sandwiches are typically meant for quick, convenient consumption and do not need an elaborate packaging like wrapping paper. Other alternatives, such as food-safe sandwich wrappers, foil, or wax paper, would be more practical for packaging a sandwich full of condiments. In conclusion, using wrapping paper to package a gift basket full of condiments is a more sound solution when considering naive physics reasoning. This approach aligns with the structure, presentation, functionality, and practicality aspects that are associated with wrapping paper.

Would banning notes of denominations 500 and 1000 help to curb the black money in system? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"Both questions are essentially the same, as they are seeking to understand whether banning 500 and 1000 denomination notes would help in addressing the problem of black money in the system. Let me provide a detailed answer to this question. India's decision to ban 500 and 1000 rupee notes back in 2016, also known as \\"demonetization\\", was aimed at addressing the issue of black money, which refers to funds that are generated through illegal activities, tax evasion, or have not been declared to tax authorities. This action was taken to eradicate corruption, counterfeit currency, and promote a cashless economy. Here is a detailed explanation of how the demonetization of these high-value currency notes was expected to curb the problem of black money: 1. Forcing the declaration of black money: By announcing the ban and setting a limited time frame to exchange or deposit the 500 and 1000 rupee notes, the government forced individuals and businesses holding black money to declare it to the authorities or risk losing the value of the money. This was expected to result in a significant chunk of the black money in the form of cash being brought back into the formal economy. 2. Discouraging cash-based transactions: The ban aimed to reduce the reliance on cash-based transactions by encouraging digital and non-cash payment methods, thereby creating a paper trail that can be monitored by tax authorities. This would make it more challenging for individuals and businesses to evade taxes and generate undeclared income. 3. Reducing the scale of counterfeit currency: At the time of demonetization, there were concerns that a significant portion of high denomination notes were counterfeit, facilitating illegal activities and boosting the black economy. By banning these high-value notes, the government aimed to reduce the circulation of such counterfeit notes and make it difficult for criminal organizations involved in their production to continue their operations. 4. Increasing tax compliance: The shock of demonetization and the subsequent efforts to bring more transactions within the ambit of taxation were expected to deter people from engaging in tax evasion and encourage tax compliance, thus reducing the generation of black money in the future. However, it is important to note that the efficacy of demonetization in curbing black money has been debated and criticized. Some arguments against the effectiveness of the measure include: 1. Not all black money held in cash: While demonetization targeted black money held in the form of cash, it did not address other forms of black money, such as those held in offshore accounts, real estate, gold, and other assets. This meant that the action only addressed a portion of the black economy. 2. Inconvenience and economic repercussions: Demonetization led to a significant cash crunch, with people struggling to conduct daily transactions and businesses suffering from reduced demand. The disruption in the economy resulted in job losses, reduced economic growth, and challenges for various sectors. 3. The return of cash into the system: An overwhelming majority of the banned notes were returned to the banking system, leading to questions about whether the action successfully forced people to declare their black money or provided them with means to launder it back into the system. In conclusion, the banning of 500 and 1000 rupee notes was intended to curb the problem of black money by forcing its declaration, reducing cash-based transactions, fighting counterfeit currency, and increasing tax compliance. However, the actual effectiveness of the measure remains a topic of debate, and the decision to demonetize had its own set of challenges and economic repercussions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Ludendorff was born on 9 April 1865 in Kruszewnia near Posen, Province of Posen, Kingdom of Prussia (now Poznan County, Poland), the third of six children of August Wilhelm Ludendorff (1833-1905). His father was descended from Pomeranian merchants who had achieved the prestigious status of Junker. Erich's mother, Klara Jeanette Henriette von Tempelhoff (1840-1914), was the daughter of the noble but impoverished Friedrich August Napoleon von Tempelhoff (1804-1868) and his wife Jeannette Wilhelmine von Dziembowska (1816-1854), who came from a Germanized Polish landed family on the side of her father Stephan von Dziembowski (1779-1859). Through Dziembowski's wife Johanna Wilhelmine von Unruh (1793-1862), Erich was a remote descendant of the Counts of Donhoff, the Dukes of Duchy of Liegnitz and Duchy of Brieg and the Marquesses and Electors of Brandenburg. In 1885, Ludendorff was commissioned as a subaltern into the 57th Infantry Regiment, then at Wesel. Over the next eight years, he was promoted to lieutenant and saw further service in the 2nd Marine Battalion, based at Kiel and Wilhelmshaven, and in the 8th Grenadier Guards at Frankfurt on the Oder. His service reports reveal the highest praise, with frequent commendations. In 1893, he entered the War Academy, where the commandant, General Meckel, recommended him to the General Staff, to which he was appointed in 1894. He rose rapidly and was a senior staff officer at the headquarters of V Corps from 1902 to 1904. Next he joined the Great General Staff in Berlin, which was commanded by Alfred von Schlieffen, Ludendorff directed the Second or Mobilization Section from 1904-13. Soon he was joined by Max Bauer, a brilliant artillery officer, who became a close friend. By 1911, Ludendorff was a full colonel. His section was responsible for writing the mass of detailed orders needed to bring the mobilized troops into position to implement the Schlieffen Plan. For this they covertly surveyed frontier fortifications in Russia, France and Belgium. For instance, in 1911 Ludendorff visited the key Belgian fortress city of Liege. Deputies of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, which became the largest party in the Reichstag after the German federal elections of 1912, seldom gave priority to army expenditures, whether to build up its reserves or to fund advanced weaponry such as Krupp's siege cannons. Instead, they preferred to concentrate military spending on the Imperial German Navy. Ludendorff's calculations showed that to properly implement the Schlieffen Plan the Army lacked six corps. Members of the General Staff were instructed to keep out of politics and the public eye, but Ludendorff shrugged off such restrictions. With a retired general, August Keim, and the head of the Pan-German League, Heinrich Class, he vigorously lobbied the Reichstag for the additional men. In 1913 funding was approved for four additional corps but Ludendorff was transferred to regimental duties as commander of the 39th (Lower Rhine) Fusiliers, stationed at Dusseldorf. \\"I attributed the change partly for my having pressed for those three additional army corps.\\" Barbara Tuchman characterizes Ludendorff in her book The Guns of August as Schlieffen's devoted disciple who was a glutton for work and a man of granite character but who was deliberately friendless and forbidding and therefore remained little known or liked. It is true that as his wife testified, \\"Anyone who knows Ludendorff knows that he has not a spark of humor...\\". He was voluble nonetheless, although he shunned small talk.

(CNN) -- A preliminary investigation report into last month's Lion Air crash into the sea off Bali has called on the budget carrier to implement several safety and pilot training recommendations. The report by Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee found the 24-year-old co-pilot, with 1,200 hours flying experience, could not see the runway upon approach and handed controls to the pilot at an altitude of 150 feet (45 meters) moments before the crash. The plane, a Boeing 737-800 manufactured in February and only used by Lion Air since March, was found to be airworthy and had only 142 hours of flying time.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Associated Press. Last updated at 7:56 PM on 5th January 2012. Smouldering embers blamed for a Christmas morning house fire that killed three girls and their grandparents had been taken out of a fireplace so the children would not worry about Santa Claus coming down the chimney, two officials briefed on the investigation said on Tuesday. The officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the investigation is still under way. Authorities say embers in a bag of discarded ashes started the blaze in Stamford that killed ten-year-old Lilly and seven-year-old twins Grace and Sarah Badger and their grandparents, Lomer and Pauline Johnson. Devastating: Fire fighters were unable to save Madonna Badger's three girls and their grandparents from the flames at her home in Stamford, Connecticut. The girls' mother, Madonna Badger, escaped the fire along with a friend, Michael Borcina. Borcina and Badger were treated at a local hospital and released. Fire officials have said Borcina is believed to have placed the ashes in or outside an entryway, near the trash. A funeral service will be held on Thursday in New York City for the girls. The. victims died of smoke inhalation. Lomer Johnson also suffered a blunt. head and neck trauma, which resulted from a fall or being hit by an. object. One of the girls, found dead just inside. a window, had been placed on a pile of books, apparently so Johnson. could reach in and grab her after he jumped out. Instead, authorities. say, he fell through the roof. Stamford police are helping fire officials investigate the blaze. Victims: Lomer Johnson, 71, his wife Pauline, 69, and their three granddaughters, Grace, Lily and Sarah (all pictured right) perished in a fire on Christmas morning after fireplace embers caught the house (left) alight. Victims: Lomer and Pauline Johnson and their grandchildren, from left, Lily, Grace, Sarah and Morgan - who was not in the house - perished in the 5am fire. Last family photo: Matthew Badger with his daughters (left to right) Grace, Sarah and Lily, are pictured for the last time together in front of the Statue of Liberty, four days before the fire that claimed their lives. Survivors: Madonna Badger, left, and her boyfriend Michael Borcina, right, escaped the inferno at her home. Police said Monday officials want to know if there were smoke alarms, the status of renovation work in the house and whether the contractor had permits. The issue of permits could figure in the investigation because the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection has said that neither Borcina nor his company, Tiberias Construction Inc., was registered to perform home improvement work in Connecticut. Contractors are required to register with the state, though numerous building and other permits are issued by local officials. Gone: The house, which was built in the 1890s, has been entirely demolished. Pain: Firefighter Nick Tamburro pays respects outside the destroyed home in Stamford, Connecticut. Many of the fire fighters dispatched to the scene are undergoing counselling to deal with the horrifying memories. Fire: A neighbour was woken up in the early hours by screaming and saw the house was engulfed in flames. The agency said it did not yet have enough information about what work may have been done or completed and would not comment on whether it will investigate. Facebook messages have been left for Borcina. Repeated attempts to contact him by telephone since the fire have been unsuccessful. Stamford authorities deemed the house unsafe following the fire and ordered it torn down the day after the fire. Fire Chief Antonio Conte said the fire was Stamford's deadliest since a 1987 blaze that also killed five people.","completion":"1.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Hubble space telescope captures stunning image of barred spiral galaxy The Hubble space telescope has captured a stunning image of a faraway galaxy known as a barred spiral. Galaxy NGC 4639 is located over 70 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Virgo. NGC 4639 is one of about 1500 galaxies that make up the Virgo Cluster, according to the European Space Agency (ESA), one of NASA’s Hubble partners. A light year measures the astronomical distance that light travels in one year and is equivalent to 5.8 trillion miles. Related: The best of Hubble The image clearly shows a “bar” running through the galaxy’s bright, round core, the ESA said, in a statement. “Bars are found in around two thirds of spiral galaxies, and are thought to be a natural phase in their evolution,” it added. The image on the right can be expanded to show galaxy NGC 4639 (ESA/Hubble & NASA). NGC 4639’s arms are “sprinkled with bright regions of active star formation,” according to the ESA. “Each of these tiny jewels is actually several hundred light-years across and contains hundreds or thousands of newly formed stars,” it explained. Related: Supermoon lunar eclipse in pictures However, scientists note that the galaxy contains a dark secret at its core - a massive black hole that is consuming the surrounding gas. “This is known as an active galactic nucleus (AGN), and is revealed by characteristic features in the spectrum of light from the galaxy and by X-rays produced close to the black hole as the hot gas plunges towards it,” said the ESA. The Hubble space telescope, which was launched by NASA in 1990, celebrated its 25th anniversary earlier this year. Earlier this year astronomers used three telescopes, including the Hubble to spot a baby blue galaxy that is farther away in space than any other galaxy ever seen. The galaxy, named EGS-zs8-1, is 13.1 billion light-years away.","completion":"The Hubble space telescope has captured an astonishing image of the barred spiral galaxy, NGC 4639, located within the Virgo Cluster over 70 million light-years away from Earth.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are given a new situation: John is trying to figure out how the shape of an object affects how it reacts with other elements. For that, he chose two objects, both made of the same element - object A and object B. Object A has a larger surface area, but object B has smaller surface area. He let these objects to react with other reactants to see how the processes work. and a hint : When a solid substance is involved in a chemical reaction, only the matter at the surface of the solid is exposed to other reactants. If a solid has more surface area, more of it is exposed and able to react. Therefore, increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the reaction rate. Look at the hammer and nails pictured in the Figure below . Both are made of iron and will rust when the iron combines with oxygen in the air. However, the nails have a greater surface area, so they will rust faster. Please answer this question : Would object A be more or less exposed to the reactants than object B?","completion":"Object A would be more exposed to the reactants than Object B due to its larger surface area. This is because in a chemical reaction involving a solid substance, only the matter at the surface of the solid is available to make contact with other reactants. The higher surface area implies more of the substance is exposed to the reactants, thus, it gives more opportunity for the reaction to occur. In John's situation, both Object A and Object B are composed of the same element, therefore, the chemical properties of the material itself are not different. However, the physical form - or the size and shape, which determine the surface area - is different for each object. Since Object A has a larger surface area, more of it is exposed, meaning it can interact more freely with other reactants. This results in a higher reaction rate because there are more surface molecules that can be attacked by the reactants compared to Object B with a smaller surface area. The explanation is similar to the given hint where the nails (similar to Object A) would rust faster than the hammer (similar to Object B). Both are primarily made of iron, which reacts with oxygen in air to cause rusting. This is a chemical reaction where increased exposure from greater surface area results in faster reaction. Therefore, due to its greater surface area, Object A is likely to react faster, hence, it is more significantly exposed to the reactants than Object B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Europe's top court ruled that people have the right to have 'inadequate' and 'irrelevant' results about them wiped from the web, which led to the tech giant being bombarded with requests. Searches for people’s names now include a message at the bottom of the results page that says results ‘may have been removed under data protection law in Europe’. This warning appears on all results, regardless of the name that has been searched for, and is not an indicator that the specific person has requested links be deleted. Google has started to remove search results, following last month's 'right to be forgotten' ruling. Users now see a message that reads results 'may have been removed' (pictured). This warning appears on all results, regardless of the name that has been searched, and is not an indicator they have requested links be deleted. A Google spokesman told MailOnline: ‘This week, we’re starting to take action on the removals requests that we’ve received. ‘This is a new process for us. Each request has to be assessed individually and we’re working as quickly as possible to get through the queue. ‘We’ll continue to work with data protection authorities and others as we implement this ruling.’ Last. month’s decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union, which. affects 500 million citizens, requires that search services remove. information deemed 'inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant' - and. failure to do so can result in fines. European. citizens can submit take-down requests directly to internet companies. rather than to local authorities or publishers under the ruling. If a. search engine elects not to remove the link, a person can seek redress. from the courts. Last month's decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union requires that search services remove information deemed 'inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant' and failure to do so can result in fines. The ruling was made by the European Union Court of Justice, pictured. Under the European Data Protection Regulation, Article 17 includes the ‘right to be forgotten and to erasure’. Under Article 17, people who are mentioned in the data have the right to ‘obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data.' This particularly relates to data about the person when they were a child, when the data is no longer relevant or necessary for the purpose it was collected, the person who owns the content withdraws their consent, the storage period has expired, or if it was gathered illegally. The EU defines ‘data controllers’ as ‘people or bodies that collect and manage personal data.’ The EU General Data Protection Regulation means any data controller who has been asked to remove data must ‘take all reasonable steps, including technical measures' to remove it. If a data controller does not take these steps they can be heavily fined. Last month, a MailOnline investigation uncovered that a man convicted of possessing child pornography, a misbehaving politician seeking re-election and a doctor with bad reviews, were among the flood of people who contacted Google demanding that their internet histories be deleted. Legal experts have commented that the criteria for determining which take-down requests are legitimate, is not completely clear from the EU court’s decision. Google has therefore had to painstakingly sort through the requests and last week sent notifications to people who requested a removal, asking them to bear with the search engine. It began removing the first results under the European data law yesterday, and plans on ramping up the speed of the process when it is sure that the systems put in place are effective. Google is starting its work now to show good faith in complying with the ruling, which it did not greet with enthusiasm last month. Following the ruling, Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt told the company’s annual shareholder meeting: 'There's many open questions.’ 'A simple way of understanding what happened here is that you have a collision between a right to be forgotten and a right to know. From Google's perspective that's a balance. 'Google believes having looked at the decision, which is binding, that the balance that was struck was wrong.’ The company is now keen to be transparent about the modification of its search results, which is why it is showing the message: ‘Your results may have been modified under data protection law in Europe,’ for all name search results, expect for celebrities. This is so that notices do not appear next to certain individuals, but the notice could evolve over time. Google is also notifying people who made ‘right to be forgotten’ requests that have been turned down, as well as those where more information is required. The tech giant is not new to notice-and-takedown removals, to do with defamation, for example. It also has experience dealing with take-down requests in its YouTube video website, which has a process to remove uploads that infringe copyrights. But the ruling marks an entirely new process for search engines. Google is the dominant search engine in Europe, commanding about 93 per cent of the market, according to StatCounter global statistics. Microsoft Corp's Bing has 2.4 per cent and Yahoo Inc has 1.7 per cent. A spokesman for Microsoft's Bing told MailOnline: 'We’re currently working on a special process for residents of the European Union to request blocks of specific privacy-related search results on Bing in response to searches on their names. 'Given the many questions that have been raised about how the recent ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union should be implemented, developing an appropriate system is taking us some time. We’ll be providing additional information about making requests soon.'

(Tim Boyle - BLOOMBERG) Groupon’s IPO has been delayed indefinitely, according to reports. The news hit Silicon Valley with a thud. After all, while Groupon was deemed to be the follow-up to expectation-shattering LinkedIn and wildly successful Pandora, it was also coming at one of the worst periods in the global economy. So, with Groupon extending its wait in the wings, has the social media bubble popped, been averted or merely been delayed? Groupon is not alone when it comes to postponing a highly anticipated IPO in the wake of Wall Street’s tumultuous summer. On Aug. 29, it was reported that social media game-maker Zynga was likely to delay its IPO for similar reasons as Groupon: questions from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the market downturn. But Groupon has additional problems — problems that some argue are potentially of its own making. For example, a leaked memo from the CEO and co-founder to the staff highlighting how well the company is doing during the required “quiet period” is likely to complicate the IPO process — bubble or no bubble. Washington Post columnist Vivek Wadhwa, in a Sept. 1 appearance on “Bloomberg West,” called Groupon CEO Andrew Mason’s e-mail to staff “childish” and said the company should delay its IPO rather than contribute to a growing social media bubble: This is not the first time Wadhwa has warned of a bubble. In June, he wrote that the public markets were merely the tip of the iceberg: In the secondary markets, LinkedIn was valued at 2.5 billion and, at closing on its first day of trading in May, hit a market cap of 9 billion. At the end of trading Tuesday, LinkedIn was valued at 7.62 billion. This comes after the markets went on a roller-coaster ride driven by Standard & Poor’s downgrade, the turmoil in Europe and stagnant U.S. unemployment numbers for the month of August. This leaves little-to-no oxygen for Groupon or Zynga — to say nothing of larger social media companies, such as Facebook. For now, it appears the social media bubble hasn’t budged, but its stasis is dependent on how long Groupon and Zynga will wait before going public and what they’ll do during that time. And, as Wadhwa writes, there’s more to the bubble than the primary markets.

New innovations and curiosity helped spread interest in windmills and wind power.Middle Eastern citizens used them for food production by the 11th century.Merchants along trade routes returned to Europe and shared the idea.Windmills caught on,especially in Holland,and the Dutch improved their use.Here,windmills drained lakes and other bodies of water.In France,the windmill pumped irrigation water.Elsewhere in Europe,windmills were used to grind grain. By the 19th century,settlers in the United States realized the importance of the simple windmill.Pioneers pumped water for livestock and farming.As estimated six million windmills dotted America's landscape by the end of the 1880s.Charles Brush,the US inventor,invented a windmill capable of producing electricity in 1888.And now the machines are called wind turbines.As late as the 1920s,Americans used small windmills to provide electricity in rural areas without electric service.When power lines began to transport electricity to rural areas in the 1930s,local windmills were used less and less,though they can still be seen on some Western farms. In the 1970s,oil shortages pushed the development of alternative energy sources,paving the way for the re-entry of the windmill to produce electricity.In the early 1980s,wind energy really took off in California,partly because of State policies that encouraged renewable energy sources.In the 1990s,the push came from a renewed concern for the environment in response to scientific studies indicating potential changes to the global climate if the use of...

Article: The United States covers a large part of the North American continent. Its neighbours are Canada to the north and Mexico to the south. Although the United States is a big country, it is not the largest in the world. In 1964, its population was over 185,000,000. When this land first became a nation, after winning its independence from England, it had thirteen states. Each of the states was represented on the American flag by a star. All these states were in the eastern part of the continent. As the nation grew toward the west, new states were added and new stars appeared on the flag. For a long time, there were 48 stars. In 1959, however, two more stars were added to the flag, representing the new states of Alaska and Hawaii. Indians were the first people of the land which is now the United States. There are still many thousands of Indians now living in all parts of the country. Sometimes it is said that the Indians are \\"the only real Americans\\". Most Americans come from all over the world. Those who came first in greatest numbers to make their homes on the eastern coast of North America were mostly from England. It is for that reason that the official language of the United States is English and that its culture and customs are more like those of England than those of any other country in the world. Question: Why is English the official language of America? Answer: A:","completion":"English is the official language of America because the majority of the early settlers who arrived and established their homes on the eastern coast of North America were primarily from England. Due to this, they brought with them their language, culture, and customs, which heavily influenced the developing nation. As a result, the United States adopted English as its official language, and its culture and customs are more closely related to those of England than any other country in the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Definition: In this task, you are given a passage which has a question and the context. You have to generate an answer to the question based on the information present in the context. Input: Context: Increased placental growth secondary to reduced apoptosis may contribute to the development of macrosomia in GDM pregnancies. We hypothesize that reduced apoptosis in GDM placentas is caused by dysregulation of apoptosis related genes from death receptors or mitochondrial pathway or both to enhance placental growth in GDM pregnancies.', 'Newborn and placental weights from women with no pregnancy complications (controls; N=5), or with GDM (N=5) were recorded. Placental villi from both groups were either fixed for TUNEL assay, or snap frozen for gene expression analysis by apoptosis PCR microarrays and qPCR.', 'Maternal, placental and newborn weights were significantly higher in the GDM group vs. Controls. Apoptotic index of placentas from the GDM group was markedly lower than the Controls. At a significant threshold of 1.5, seven genes (BCL10, BIRC6, BIRC7, CASP5, CASP8P2, CFLAR, and FAS) were down regulated, and 13 genes (BCL2, BCL2L1, BCL2L11, CASP4, DAPK1, IκBκE, MCL1, NFκBIZ, NOD1, PEA15, TNF, TNFRSF25, and XIAP) were unregulated in the GDM placentas. qPCR confirmed the consistency of the PCR microarray. Using Western blotting we found significantly decreased placental pro-apoptotic FAS receptor and FAS ligand (FASL), and increased mitochondrial anti-apoptotic BCL2 post GDM insult. Notably, caspase-3, which plays a central role in the execution-phase of apoptosis, and its substrate poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were significantly down regulated in GDM placentas, as compared to non-diabetic Control placentas.Question: Does gestational diabetes mellitus alter apoptotic and inflammatory gene expression of trophobasts from human term placenta? Output:","completion":"Task Explanation: In this task, you need to read and understand the passage provided and then answer the question based on the information given in the passage. Specifically, you need to determine if gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) alters apoptotic and inflammatory gene expression of trophoblasts from human term placenta. Guidelines: 1. Read the passage thoroughly to understand the context. 2. Focus on the key terms and findings mentioned in the passage, such as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), apoptotic, inflammatory gene expression, and trophoblasts from human term placenta. 3. Use the findings and data mentioned in the passage to answer the question. Solution: 1. Reading the passage makes it clear that maternal, placental, and newborn weights were significantly higher in the GDM group than the control group. 2. In the GDM group, apoptotic index was lower than the control group, showing reduced apoptosis in GDM placentas. 3. The passage mentions specific genes that were either downregulated or upregulated in GDM placentas compared to control group placentas, which suggests altered apoptotic and inflammatory gene expression in GDM placentas.

Plot title: Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge Movie plot: Raj Malhotra (Shah Rukh Khan) and Simran Singh (Kajol) are non-resident Indians living in London. Simran was raised by her strict and conservative father, Baldev Singh (Amrish Puri), while Raj's father (Anupam Kher) was very liberal. Simran always dreams of meeting her ideal man. Her mother Lajjo (Farida Jalal) warns her against this, saying dreams are good but one should not blindly believe they come true. One day, Baldev receives a letter from his friend Ajit (Satish Shah), who lives in Punjab. Ajit wants to keep a promise he and Baldev made to each other 20 years agoâto have Simran marry his son Kuljeet (Parmeet Sethi). Simran is disappointedâshe does not want to marry someone whom she has never met. One evening, Raj enters Baldev's shop after closing time to buy beer. Baldev refuses and Raj grabs a case of beer, throws the money on the counter and runs away. Baldev, infuriated, calls Raj a disgrace to India. Meanwhile, Raj's father has agreed to his request to go on a train trip across Europe with his friends, and Simran's friends have invited her to go on the same trip. Simran asks her father to let her see the world before her marriage, and he reluctantly agrees. On the trip, Raj and Simran meet. Raj constantly flirts with Simran, much to her irritation. The two miss their train to Zurich and are separated from their friends. They start to travel with one another and become friends. Raj falls in love with Simran on the journey; when they part ways in London, Simran realises she is in love with him too. Simran tells her mother about the boy she met; Baldev overhears the conversation and becomes furious with Simran. He says the family will move to India the next day. Meanwhile, Raj tells his father about Simran and that she will soon be getting married. When Raj says he believes Simran loves him too, his father encourages him to go after her. In India, Baldev is reunited with his relatives and his friend Ajit. Simran and her younger sister Chutki take an instant dislike to Simran's fiancÃ© Kuljeet... My question: Simran then arrives at the train station alone? Answer:","completion":"No, Simran does not arrive at the train station alone. After realizing her love for Raj, Simran's family moves to India for her arranged marriage to Kuljeet. Raj, determined to win Simran's heart, also travels to India with his father's encouragement. Upon arriving in India, Raj befriends Simran's family and attends the wedding festivities, making several attempts to convince Simran's father, Baldev, to accept their love. The plot proceeds with several dramatic incidents, including a confrontation between Raj and Kuljeet. The train station scene occurs later in the movie, towards the climax. After an intense confrontation, Baldev finally realizes the deep love between Simran and Raj, and as they leave, he calls out to Simran. She runs towards the departing train, where Raj holds out his hand to help her aboard. The train sequence showcases Raj and Simran reuniting and leaving together, symbolizing the acceptance of their love by both families."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It consisted of Auschwitz I (the original camp), Auschwitz IIBirkenau (a combination concentration/extermination camp), Auschwitz IIIMonowitz (a labor camp to staff an IG Farben factory), and 45 satellite camps. - Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (\\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of the German Reich, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was central to the Holocaust. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The German extermination camps or death camps were designed and built by Nazi Germany during World War II (193945) to systematically kill millions of Jews, Slavs and others whom the Nazis considered \\"Untermenschen\\", primarily by gassing, but also in mass executions and through extreme work under starvation conditions. - Franciszek Piper ( born 1941 ) is a Polish scholar , historian and author . Most of his work concerns the Holocaust , especially the history of the Auschwitz concentration camp . Dr. Piper is credited as one of the historians who helped establish a more accurate number of victims of Auschwitz - Birkenau death camps . According to his research , at least 1.1 million people perished at Auschwitz - Birkenau , of whom about 960,000 were Jewish . He is the author of several books and chair of the Historical Department at the Auschwitz - Birkenau State Museum . - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - Following the Invasion of Poland at the beginning of World War II, nearly a quarter of the entire territory of the Second Polish Republic was annexed by Nazi Germany and placed directly under the German civil administration. The rest of Nazi occupied Poland was renamed as the General Government district. The annexation was part of the \\"fourth\\" partition of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, outlined months before the invasion, in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. - Nazi Germany maintained concentration camps (KZ or KL) throughout the territories it controlled before and during the Second World War. The first Nazi camps were erected in Germany in March 1933 immediately after Hitler became Chancellor and his Nazi Party was given control over the police through Reich Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick and Prussian Acting Interior Minister Hermann Göring.

Immediately after you send it, text him again to say it was an accident. This will make him think that you don’t care about him anymore and quickly found someone new. You might text him, “Thanks for taking me out last night. Can’t wait to see you again.” Then, send, “Oops, wrong number. Deleting your contact now.” While you should never post private photos of an ex, you can get away with posting unflattering photos. Share the photo on your social media page or have a friend post it. As another option, print out the photo or turn it into a poster, then hang it up around your ex’s neighborhood or at their favorite hangouts. For instance, you might use a photo of your ex doing something stupid or one of them on a bad hair day. Don’t post a photo of your ex in the nude or partially dressed for any reason. Tell your ex that you need to come over to retrieve something you left there when you were dating. While you’re there, hide an item that you know he loves, like his TV remote, his favorite video game, or pieces from a Lego set that he owns. This will drive him crazy until he finds the hidden item. Don’t take anything of his because that’s stealing. When you hide the item, make sure that it won’t get damaged. For instance, it’s okay to tuck the remote between the couch cushions. However, it’s not okay to put it in the back of the toilet where it will get waterlogged. Put the item somewhere he’ll find it eventually. As an example, you might put his bottle opener in the wrong kitchen drawer but not in his air conditioning vent. If he’s already seeing someone, it’s probably very painful for you, especially if he cheated with this person. Try not to take things out on the new partner because they may not have known about you. However, it’s okay to let them know that your ex may be bad news. Send them a message via email, social media, or text that explains what happened in your relationship. Create a fake profile on social media or use a dummy email address. If you want to send a text, try an app that lets you send a text from a fake number. You could say, “I heard that you’re dating Liam. I thought you should know that he was already in a relationship when he started seeing you. He cheated on his ex, and he lied to her constantly. I’d be cautious with him if I were you.” This is a great way to get back at him because you don’t have to do anything. After he hurt you, it may have felt like he got away with treating you wrong. However, his actions will eventually catch up to him. Just sit back and watch him deal with the aftermath of his bad behavior. For instance, right now he might seem on top of the world with the person he left you for. However, people will recognize that he’s a cheater, and that’ll hurt his reputation. Additionally, this new relationship started off in a bad place, so he and his new partner might develop trust issues. Think about those consequences whenever you feel upset about what happened.

Part-timers who work fewer than 30 hours a week will no longer be covered by the company plan starting next year—instead, they will pick their insurance policy from the exchanges being created under the Affordable Care Act, reports the Huffington Post. The company, which has a sterling reputation in terms of the benefits it offers its part-time staff, will provide each worker with a 500 stipend. Between that \\"and the tax credits available under the ACA, many of you should be able to obtain health care coverage at very little if any net cost to you,\\" says the company memo, obtained by HuffPo. The story includes quotes from one affected worker understandably anxious over the move, and both critics and supporters of ObamaCare are starting to weigh in. On the right, John Nolte at Breitbart writes that it's a sign employers are afraid their health care costs will \\"explode\\" under ObamaCare and are looking to cut benefits. But at Think Progress, Sy Mukherjee argues that the \\"decision isn’t an indictment of the health law at all. In fact, it’s a definitive sign that ObamaCare is working as intended.\\" We're finally on our way toward a \\"workable insurance market\\" for all the working poor, not just those lucky enough to work for conscientious companies, he writes.

The country is not a signatory to the treaty offering a blueprint for international adoptions. One rights worker says many vulnerable children are at risk. Others say international adoptions give the children a better life. Article:","completion":"Title: International Adoptions From Uganda: A Mixed Perspective Introduction International adoptions from Uganda have been rapidly increasing in recent years, resulting in a complex and divisive debate among experts, rights groups, and prospective adoptive families. While many believe that international adoptions are providing Ugandan children with a better life, others argue that the growing popularity of international adoptions is putting vulnerable children at risk. The disagreement is further exacerbated by Uganda's lack of adherence to a key international treaty that aims to protect the rights of children in such situations. This article dissects the issue, presenting its various dimensions while striving to generate a balanced perspective on the matter. Uganda's Rising Numbers of International Adoptions As international adoptions from Uganda intensify, many children living in dire circumstances find themselves at the precipice of newfound opportunities and life-changing experiences. For some, being adopted by a loving family from overseas is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to escape poverty, gain access to education, healthcare, and a promising future. However, the increase in adoption numbers has ignited concerns among rights groups who are worried about the lack of safeguards and potential exploitation of vulnerable children. One rights worker claims that the absence of a proper framework or stringent regulations has made Uganda a hotspot for unscrupulous orphanages and adoption agencies to cash in on the lucrative adoption market. This situation puts Ugandan children at risk, as decisions made about their welfare may be guided by monetary gains rather than genuinely serving their best interests. International Treaty and Uganda's Non-Adherence A significant point of contention is Uganda's non-association with the Hague Adoption Convention, a multilateral treaty that sets standards for international adoptions and seeks to prevent child abductions, sale of children, and human trafficking. As Uganda is not a signatory to the treaty, experts believe that the lack of compliance with the convention's guidelines allows orphanages and adoption agencies to operate in an unregulated environment, further amplifying the vulnerability of these children to potential abuse and exploitation. The Case For International Adoptions Despite the concerns and potential risks associated with international adoption, proponents argue that it remains a valuable and much-needed service that significantly improves the children's quality of life. Many adoptive families provide not only financial support but also emotional security and stability, nurturing environments that promote positive growth and development. Furthermore, international adoptions can also serve as a viable alternative to institutional care which can often be detrimental to a child's development. Studies have shown that children growing up in institutions, where one-on-one attention and consistent care is lacking, can experience developmental delays and attachment disorders. Finding A Balanced Perspective The debate on international adoptions from Uganda is a complex one, with compelling arguments on both sides. While it is undeniable that numerous Ugandan children are finding better opportunities abroad, the government of Uganda needs to take proactive measures to protect the rights of these children and ensure that the process is transparent, ethical, and adheres to globally recognized standards. In order to achieve this delicate balance, it is essential for Uganda to sign and adhere to the principles laid out by the Hague Adoption Convention. This would establish a framework that safeguards the rights of vulnerable children while still allowing for the benefits of international adoption. Furthermore, increased collaboration between Ugandan authorities, international organizations, and prospective adoptive families can provide a more transparent and secure system that fosters the best interests of each child caught in the midst of this complex and emotionally-charged issue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Question: \\"What were the organizations that dyers gathered in called?\\" Context: \\"There were guilds of dyers who specialized in red in Venice and other large Europeans cities. The Rubia plant was used to make the most common dye; it produced an orange-red or brick red color used to dye the clothes of merchants and artisans.

It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - A stream is a body of water with a current, confined within a bed and banks. Depending on its location or certain characteristics, a stream may be referred to as a \\"bayou\\", \\"beck\\", \\"branch\\", \\"brook\\", \\"burn\\", \\"creek\\", \\"crick\\", \\"ghyll\\", \\"gill\\", \\"kill\\", \\"lick\\", \\"mill race\\", \\"race\\", \\"rill\\", \\"river\\", \\"rivulet\\", \\"run\\", \\"runnel\\", \\"streamage\\", \\"syke\\", or \\"wash\\". - A lagoon is a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by barrier islands or reefs. Lagoons are commonly divided into coastal lagoons and atoll lagoons. They have also been identified as occurring on mixed-sand and gravel coastlines. There is an overlap between bodies of water classified as coastal lagoons and bodies of water classified as estuaries. Lagoons are common coastal features around many parts of the world. - A pond is a body of standing water, either natural or artificial, that is usually smaller than a lake. They may arise naturally in floodplains as part of a river system, or they may be somewhat isolated depressions (examples include vernal pools and prairie potholes). Usually they contain shallow water with marsh and aquatic plants and animals. A few animals also make their home in ponds, including both alligators and beavers. The type of life in a pond is generally determined by a combination of factors including water level regime (particularly depth and duration of flooding) and nutrient levels, but other factors may also be important, including presence or absence of shading by trees, presence or absence of streams, effects of grazing animals, and salinity. - A lake is an area of variable size filled with water, localized in a basin, that is surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams. - Maple Valley is a city in King County, Washington, United States. The population was 22,684 at the 2010 census. The population was 25,686 at the 2015 estimate. - Lake Wilderness is the largest lake in Maple Valley , Washington , United States .

Our favorite was the Denny's about ten miles outside of downtown Savannah, and we had a regular waitress that was AWESOME. As a side note, I met her several years later and found out we were a major help putting her daughter through school. We had one kid in our group who was a perpetual problem, a wannabe at everything. He just tried too freaking hard to be the center of attention. Well, he joined us ONCE in a trip to Denny's. I mean we pulled up in six cars, all packed to the gills at 3a.m. and took up almost half of the restaurant. We get done, our favorite waitress drops the check, and this goofball says something about “dine and dash.” We all just looked at him like he had grown a penis in the middle of his forehead and was trying to screw anyone within spitting distance with it. This kid wasn't driving, it would be a ten mile walk through neighborhoods that were questionable during the daytime, and he is talking about not just stiffing our favorite waitress on a tip, but walking out without paying? Are you kidding me? “Ryan. If you do that, you will be left beaten and bloody in the parking lot and EVERY ONE of us will participate.” He hanged his head and coughed up his share of the bill, but he still didn't leave a tip. She made over five bucks a head in tips every time we walked in the door. Several of us were servers, bartenders, bouncers, and a couple strippers. Tips were how a lot of us put food on the table, and chemicals in our system. We shared when we had a good night. Needless to say, Ryan never joined us on a run to Denny's again.

He looked at two different states of the patient's diaphragm, state A and state B. In state A the the diaphragm contracted, but in state B the diaphragm relaxed. He now needs to figure out other phenomena related to this. Would the air pressure inside lungs increase or decrease in state A? Hint: Inhaling is an active movement that results from the contraction of a muscle called the diaphragm. The diaphragm is large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs (see Figure below ). When the diaphragm contracts, the ribcage expands and the contents of the abdomen move downward. This results in a larger chest volume, which decreases air pressure inside the lungs. With lower air pressure inside than outside the lungs, air rushes into the lungs. When the diaphragm relaxes, the opposite events occur. The volume of the chest cavity decreases, air pressure inside the lungs increases, and air flows out of the lungs, like air rushing out of a balloon. A:","completion":"In State A, when the diaphragm contracts, the phenomenon occurs as follows: 1. Contraction of the diaphragm: The diaphragm is a large, sheet-like muscle located below the lungs. It plays a crucial role in the inhalation process. When the diaphragm contracts, it flattens and moves downward, creating more space in the chest cavity. 2. Expansion of the ribcage: As the diaphragm contracts, it pulls the lower ribs upward and outward, causing the ribcage to expand. This expansion increases the volume of the chest cavity. 3. Movement of abdominal contents: The contraction of the diaphragm pushes the contents of the abdomen downward, further contributing to the increase in chest volume. 4. Decrease in air pressure inside the lungs: As the chest cavity volume increases, the air pressure inside the lungs decreases. According to Boyle's Law, the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume when the temperature remains constant. So, when the volume of the chest cavity increases, the pressure inside the lungs decreases. 5. Air rushes into the lungs: Due to the decrease in air pressure inside the lungs, air from the atmosphere, which is at a higher pressure relative to the lungs, rushes into the lungs to equilibrate the pressure difference. This process is called inhalation. In conclusion, the air pressure inside the lungs would decrease in State A as a result of the diaphragm contracting, leading to an increased chest cavity volume and enabling the patient to inhale air. Conversely, in State B, when the diaphragm relaxes, the process would be reversed. The chest cavity volume would decrease, leading to an increase in air pressure inside the lungs, resulting in exhalation of air."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke), a lonely and painfully shy teenager, who is under pressure by his stern parents because he must live up to his older brother's reputation to attend Yale and become a lawyer, arrives for the new semester at the Welton Academy for boys -- Todd's brother also attended Welton and was a popular and well-regarded student there. This semester begins during an orientation gathering with a speech given by the stern Headmaster Nolan (Norman Lloyd), who states the academy's four pillars: Tradition, Honor, Discipline, and Excellence. Todd meets Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) an ambitious student whom becomes his dorm roommate.Later in his dorm, Neil is ordered by his grumpy and domineering father (Kurtwood Smith) to drop his involvement with the school annual in order to maintain good grades so the boy may become a doctor much as he has done. Neil is under pressure from his stern father's will. Also, Mr. Perry tells Neil that Mrs. Perry also wants him to become a doctor, which further worries the boy. A little later, Todd tells Neil that he is in a similar situation with his parents involving his older brother who also attended Welton a few years ago, graduated, and attended Yale Law School and became a lawyer and his parents want the exact same thing for him. But Todd does not have the courage to tell his parents that he instead wants to be a writer, not a lawyer.During the first day of classes Todd and Neil experience the various teaching methods which include speeches by the trig teacher, as well as the Latin teacher, and the math teacher who states that \\"all 20 questions at the end of the first chapter are due tomorrow\\". In stark contrast to these orthodox teaching methods, the guys see a different side of the school when they attend English class taught by the newly arrived (and liberal-minded) Mr. Keating (Robin Williams), whom they met briefly during the orientation -- Keating tells his class he was also a student at Welton (\\"Helton\\" as the students...

Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: who destroyed street cars Suggested answer: Several of the companies involved were convicted in 1949 of conspiracy to monopolize interstate commerce but were acquitted of conspiring to monopolize the ownership of these companies. Should I validate this answer? A:","completion":"The suggested answer is partly correct, but it needs more context and clarity to provide a more accurate explanation. The question asks about the destruction of streetcars, referring to the decline of the streetcar system in the US during the 20th century. This decline was partly a result of the actions of National City Lines (NCL), a corporation that was owned by General Motors, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California, and Phillips Petroleum. NCL, along with its parent companies, played a significant role in dismantling many streetcar systems across the US and replacing them with bus transit systems. This practice, known as the \\"Great American Streetcar Scandal\\" or \\"General Motors Streetcar Conspiracy,\\" led to the widespread decline of streetcar systems in the US. In 1949, as the suggested answer mentions, several of these companies were indeed convicted of conspiracy to monopolize interstate commerce but were acquitted of conspiring to monopolize ownership of these companies. However, it's important to note that while the actions of NCL and its parent companies contributed to the decline of streetcars, other factors such as increasing automobile use, suburban expansion, and changes in urban planning also played a role.

Article:","completion":"Title: How Dogs Learn: Trial and Error, Direct Connections, and Routines Introduction As a dog owner, it is important to understand the way your pet learns in order to maximize their growth and development. Dogs are notorious for their loyalty, playfulness, and intelligence, which makes it crucial for owners to harness these traits effectively. Understanding how dogs learn through trial and error, their ability to make direct connections, and the importance of routine can help strengthen the bond between the owner and their dog while ensuring a happier and well-adjusted pet. This article will explore these three aspects of a dog's learning process in-depth. Trial and Error Dogs are excellent problem solvers and rely on trial and error as a key method of learning. Trial and error, or learning by doing, is the process by which dogs try different approaches to accomplish a particular task or solve a problem. If a specific approach results in a desirable outcome, the dog will associate that action with a positive experience and integrate it into their behavior. For example, when you begin to teach your dog to sit, they may not understand the command right away. By being patient and using positive reinforcement (such as verbal praise, head pats, or treats), your dog will begin to understand the desired behavior and repeat it. Essentially, they rely on their past experiences of success and failure to guide their future actions. Direct Connections In addition to learning through trial and error, dogs are quick to make direct connections between an action and a consequence. This type of associative learning, or classical conditioning, is a crucial aspect of a dog's learning process. When a dog forms a connection between an action and a consequence, whether positive or negative, they will adjust their behavior accordingly. For instance, if every time your dog jumps on the couch they are scolded, they will learn to associate the act of jumping on the couch with the negative consequence of being scolded and will likely avoid that behavior in the future. Similarly, if your pet is rewarded with a treat every time they follow a command, they are more likely to repeat that behavior due to the positive association. Routines Establishing regular routines for your dog is another important aspect of their learning process. Many dogs thrive on routine, as it provides them with a sense of structure and security. Developing a consistent routine can also help them learn daily tasks, such as mealtime, walk schedules, and bedtime patterns. Utilizing a daily routine as a foundation for your dog's life not only helps them learn but also benefits their overall well-being. Studies have shown that dogs have reduced stress levels and increased feelings of safety when their lives are structured around predictable routines. Furthermore, consistently engaging in specific activities at the same time can help reinforce desired behavior patterns and create a strong foundation for additional learning experiences. Conclusion Understanding how your dog learns is an essential aspect of pet ownership. By recognizing the natural ways in which your dog learns through trial and error, direct connections, and the implementation of routines, you can provide the love and support they need to grow and develop into well-behaved, happy pets. Furthermore, actively engaging with your dog in their learning process will not only benefit their development but also strengthen the bond between pet and owner. So, take the time to understand your dog's learning process and enjoy the rewarding journey of growing together."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Give me the correct facts to answer this: what is the political system of the us? Answer:","completion":"The political system of the United States is known as a federal presidential constitutional republic. This system is characterized by a division of powers and responsibilities between the federal government and the individual states, as well as a separation of powers among the three branches of government: the Legislative branch, the Executive branch, and the Judicial branch. Below are the key aspects of the U.S. political system: 1. Federalism: The United States is composed of 50 individual states that each have their own governments, with their own state constitutions and laws. The federal government, which governs the entire nation, has powers granted to it by the U.S. Constitution, while the states retain significant authority over local matters. 2. Separation of Powers: The U.S. Constitution divides government power into three branches: a. Legislative Branch: Congress, which consists of the Senate and the House of Representatives, is responsible for making, amending, and repealing federal laws. The Senate is comprised of 100 members (2 from each state), while the House of Representatives has 435 members (based on the population of each state). Members of the House serve two-year terms, and Senators serve six-year terms. b. Executive Branch: The President of the United States serves as the head of the Executive branch, responsible for enforcing the laws created by the Legislative branch. The President is both the head of state and government and is elected to a four-year term, with a maximum of two terms. The Executive branch also includes the Vice President and the President's Cabinet, which is composed of the heads of the major federal agencies and departments. c. Judicial Branch: The Supreme Court of the United States, composed of nine Justices appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, serves as the highest court in the federal judiciary. The Judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and ensuring that federal laws are consistent with the Constitution. The federal judiciary also includes lower federal courts, such as U.S. District Courts and U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeals. 3. Checks and Balances: The U.S. political system incorporates a system of checks and balances to prevent any one branch of government from becoming too powerful. For example, the President has the power to veto legislation passed by Congress, Congress can override the veto with a two-thirds majority vote in both houses, and the Supreme Court can declare laws unconstitutional. Additionally, the Senate must confirm the President's Cabinet nominations and judicial appointments. 4. Political Parties: The United States has a two-party system, with the Republican Party and the Democratic Party serving as the major political parties. Members of these parties typically share similar policy positions and work together to advance their agendas in the government. Third parties and independent candidates can also participate in the political process, but they generally have less influence and success in the U.S. political system. In summary, the U.S. political system is a federal presidential constitutional republic with a clear separation of powers among the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches, underpinned by a system of checks and balances. It is also characterized by a primarily two-party system, with the Republican Party and the Democratic Party dominating national politics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the English artist whose portraits of male nudes were generally well received?, using the article: William Etty was born in 1787 in York, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as..., what would be the answer ? A:","completion":"The answer to your friend's question is: Etty.

Lemon Henry \\"Blind Lemon\\" Jefferson (September 24, 1893 - December 19, 1929) was an American blues and gospel singer, songwriter, and musician. He was one of the most popular blues singers of the 1920s and has been called the \\"Father of the Texas Blues\\". Jefferson's performances were distinctive because of his high-pitched voice and the originality of his guitar playing. His recordings sold well, but he was not a strong influence on younger blues singers of his generation, who could not imitate him as easily as they could other commercially successful artists. Jefferson was born blind (or possibly partially blind), near Coutchman, Texas. He was the youngest of seven (or possibly eight) children born to Alex and Clarissa Jefferson, who were sharecroppers. Disputes regarding the date of his birth derive from contradictory census records and draft registration records. By 1900, the family was farming southeast of Streetman, Texas, and his birth date is indicated as September 1893 in the 1900 census. The 1910 census, taken in May, before his birthday, further confirms his year of birth as 1893 and indicated that the family was farming northwest of Wortham, near his birthplace. In his 1917 draft registration, Jefferson gave his birth date as October 26, 1894, further stating that he then lived in Dallas, Texas, and had been blind since birth. In the 1920 census, he is recorded as having returned to Freestone County and was living with his half-brother, Kit Banks, on a farm between Wortham and Streetman. Jefferson began playing the guitar in his early teens and soon after he began performing at picnics and parties. He became a street musician, playing in East Texas towns in front of barbershops and on street corners. According to his cousin Alec Jefferson, quoted in the notes for Blind Lemon Jefferson, Classic Sides: They were rough. Men were hustling women and selling bootleg and Lemon was singing for them all night... he'd start singing about eight and go on until four in the morning... mostly it would be just him sitting there and playing and singing all night. In the early 1910s, Jefferson began traveling frequently to Dallas, where he met and played with the blues musician Lead Belly. Jefferson was one of the earliest and most prominent figures in the blues movement developing in the Deep Ellum section of Dallas. It is likely that he moved to Deep Ellum on a more permanent basis by 1917, where he met Aaron Thibeaux Walker, also known as T-Bone Walker. Jefferson taught Walker the basics of playing blues guitar in exchange for Walker's occasional services as a guide. By the early 1920s, Jefferson was earning enough money for his musical performances to support a wife and, possibly, a child. However, firm evidence of his marriage and children has not been found.

Question: Process: - The human body takes a breath inward - Air is transported to the lungs - Air reaches the alveoli, the smallest air sacs in the lungs - In the alveoli, air passes into the blood within small capillaries - The gaseous oxygen in the air dissolves into the capillary blood - The dissolved oxygen is picked-up by red blood cells - The red blood cells bind the oxygen via a protein called heme - Red blood cells circulate throughout the body and reach the various tissues - Within small capillaries, the heme release the oxygen - The oxygen can then reach the cells within the tissue - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less oxygen is bound by heme happens, how will it affect \\"MORE oxygen being brought to the bodys cells\\". Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests a scenario in which less oxygen is bound by heme, potentially affecting the delivery of oxygen to the body's cells. This scenario can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of oxygen transport and delivery in the human body. Direct effects: 1. Reduced oxygen binding capacity: If less oxygen is being bound by heme, the overall oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells (RBCs) would be diminished. As a result, there would be less oxygen available for transport to body tissues. This would most likely lead to cellular hypoxia, a state in which cells are deprived of the necessary oxygen required for proper functioning. 2. Compensation by other oxygen-binding proteins: The human body contains other proteins capable of binding and transporting oxygen, such as myoglobin. In situations where heme's oxygen-binding capacity is reduced, these other proteins may attempt to compensate for the shortfall. However, their capacity to do so may be limited, leading to an overall decrease in oxygen delivery to tissues. Indirect effects: 1. Increased respiratory rate: If the body senses that its oxygen levels are low, it may respond by increasing the respiratory rate. This can lead to an increased intake of air and, therefore, more oxygen being brought into the lungs. However, if the oxygen-binding capacity of heme remains reduced, this compensatory mechanism may not be sufficient to restore proper oxygen delivery to tissues. 2. Increased heart rate and cardiac output: Similarly, the body may attempt to compensate for decreased oxygen levels by increasing the heart rate and cardiac output. This would circulate the RBCs more rapidly throughout the body, potentially delivering more oxygen to tissues. However, the effectiveness of this compensation would still depend on the oxygen-binding capacity of heme. 3. Erythropoietin production and increased RBC count: The body may respond to hypoxia by producing erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone released by the kidneys that stimulates the production of RBCs. This would lead to an increase in the overall number of RBCs, thereby boosting the body's total oxygen-carrying capacity. However, this process may also be limited due to the reduced oxygen-binding capacity of heme. 4. Adaptations at the tissue level: In response to chronic hypoxia, tissues may undergo adaptations to improve their ability to extract oxygen from the blood. This could include the growth of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) or an increase in the number and efficiency of mitochondria within cells. These adaptations can help to offset the reduced delivery of oxygen to tissues but may not fully compensate for the perturbation. In conclusion, if less oxygen is bound by heme, it can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of oxygen transportation and delivery in the human body. Although multiple compensatory mechanisms exist, their effectiveness would rely on the remaining oxygen-binding capacity of heme and the body's adaptive capabilities. Persistent hypoxia resulting from a substantial reduction in heme's oxygen-binding capacity could potentially lead to detrimental effects on cell function and overall health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: A new book written by a Chinese American on her super-strict parenting - \\"Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother\\" has raised fierce debates in the US. Amy Chua is a Yale Law School professor and the mother of two teenage girls. She is the daughter of Chinese immigrants. In the Chinese culture, the tighter represents strength and power. In her book, Ms. Chua writes about how she demanded excellence from her daughters. Chua writes that her daughters, Sophia and Louisa, were never allowed to go on a date, be in a school play, watch TV or play computer games. They couldn't choose their own after-class activities or get any grade less than an A. They had to play piano or violin - and no other musical instruments. She writes that if a Chinese child gets a B - which she says \\"would never happen\\" - there would be \\"a screaming, hair-tearing explosion.\\" She describes making her 7-year-old daughter play a piano piece perfectly - yelling and not letting her leave the bench even to use the bathroom - until it was. Many people have criticized Amy Chua. Some say her parenting methods were abusive. She even admits that her husband, who is not Chinese, objected to her parenting style. But she says that was the way her parents raised her and her three sisters. Stacy Debroff, who has written four books on parenting, says Amy Chua's parenting style is not limited to Chinese families. She says it represents a traditional way of parenting among immigrants seeking a better future for their children. But she also sees a risk. When children have no time to be social or to follow their own interests, they might not develop other skills that they need to succeed in life. Stacy Debroff advises parents not to just repeat the way they were raised. Alison Lo, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Washington's Bothell campus, said. \\"I don't think Amy is advocating a best practice of parenting style, or that success and achievements are critical yardsticks of a good life.

Translate to English","completion":"After continuous and strenuous efforts, inflation has fallen from 18 percent to 2 percent within six years. The given statement in Finnish discusses the significant accomplishment of reducing inflation from a high rate of 18 percent to a remarkably lower rate of 2 percent over a time period of six years. This achievement is attributed to persistent and rigorous endeavors. Inflation, as an economic indicator, measures the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and subsequently, how the purchasing power of money is falling. Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States or the European Central Bank in the Eurozone, aim to stabilize inflation rates in order to maintain a healthy economy. A high rate of inflation often erodes the purchasing power of money and can result in several negative consequences, such as reduced consumer confidence, decreased consumer spending, and a higher cost of living. In order to reduce inflation, central banks and governments employ a mix of monetary and fiscal policies. Monetary policies involve adjusting the money supply and interest rates. By reducing the money supply or raising interest rates, central banks can encourage saving and discourage borrowing, which can reduce the amount of money flowing through the economy and, in turn, lower inflation. Fiscal policies include measures such as raising taxes or reducing government spending in order to decrease the amount of money circulating in the economy. By employing these economic strategies, the governments and central banks within the six-year time frame specified in the statement have been able to significantly reduce inflation from 18 percent to 2 percent. This accomplishment is critical for fostering economic stability and growth, as it helps keep the purchasing power of money stable and encourages consumer spending and investment. As a result, businesses can better plan for the future, and individuals can maintain a more predictable standard of living. In conclusion, the Finnish statement highlights the significant achievement of curbing a high rate of inflation over a period of six years through diligent and persistent efforts. By utilizing a combination of monetary and fiscal policies, governments and central banks have been successful in bringing inflation down from 18 percent to 2 percent, fostering a more stable and sustainable economic environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: In recent years, a growing body of research has shown that our appetite and food intake are influenced by a large number of factors besides our biological need for energy, including our eating environment and our perception of the food in front of us. Studies have shown. for instance. that eating in front of the TV (or a similar distraction) can increase both hunger and the amount of food consumed. Even simple visual cues( ). like plate size and lighting, have been shown to affect portion size and consumption. A new study suggested that our shot-term memory also may play a role in appetite. Several hours after a meal, people's hunger levels were predicted not by how much they'd eaten but rather by how much food they'd seen in front of them --- in other words, how much they remembered eating. This difference suggests the memory of our previous meal may have a bigger influence on our appetite than the actual size of the meal. says Jeffrey M . Brunstrom , a professor of experimental psychology at the University of Bristol. \\"Hunger isn't. controlled solely by the physical characteristics of a recent meal. We have identified an independent role for memory for that meal.\\" Brunstrom says. \\"This shows that the relationship between hunger and food intake is more complex than we thought.\\" These findings echo earlier research that suggests our perception of food can sometimes trick our body's response to the food itself. In a 2011 study, for instance, people who drank the same 380-calorie milkshake on two separate occasions produced different levels of hunger-related hormones, depending on whether the shake's label said it contained 620 0r 140 calories. Moreover, the participants reported feeling more full when they thought they'd consumed a higher-calorie shake. What does this means for our eating habits? Although it hardly seems practical to trick ourselves in to eating less, the new findings do highlight the benefits of focusing on our food avoiding TV and multitasking while eating. ... Question: What would happen at meal time if you remembered eating a lot in the previous meal? Answer: Options: - You would probably be more picky about food.; - You would not feel like eating the same food.; - You would have a good appetite.; - You would not feel so hungry.; The answer is:","completion":"You would not feel so hungry. According to the article, research has shown that our short-term memory plays a significant role in our appetite. If we remember eating a lot during our previous meal, our hunger levels later on would be affected by that memory, rather than the amount of food we actually consumed. Therefore, if you remember eating a substantial amount in your previous meal, you would likely not feel as hungry at the next mealtime.

Q:What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Its nice\\" A:","completion":"To determine the star-rating of the review \\"Its nice,\\" I will consider the level of enthusiasm or satisfaction expressed by the reviewer. Steps: 1. Look at the words used: The review uses the word \\"nice,\\" which is a positive but not highly enthusiastic word. It expresses satisfaction but not necessarily excitement. 2. Consider the length of the review: The review is quite short, consisting of just two words. This may indicate that the reviewer appreciates the product or service but does not feel the need to elaborate on the details. As such, the enthusiasm or satisfaction may be moderate. 3. Compare with other reviews' language: Compare the language used in the review with language used in other reviews to ascertain whether the review leans more to a moderate level of satisfaction or a high level. Since I don't have context for other reviews, I cannot definitively determine whether \\"nice\\" is the highest satisfaction for that specific user/reviewer. 4. Make an educated guess: Based on the analysis, the word \\"nice\\" and the brevity of the review, I would assess the review as being moderately satisfying. This translates into a middle-of-the-road rating. Considering these factors, the star-rating of the review \\"Its nice\\" would likely be ★★★☆☆ (3 out of 5 stars)."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: A Shine of Rainbows Movie plot: Young orphan TomÃ¡s (John Bell) is harassed and ridiculed for his small size, timidity and stuttering by the other children in his orphanage. Just after freeing a pigeon from his classroom, he is called to the headmasters' office to be greeted by Maire (Connie Nielsen), who has adopted him, and takes him back to her island home, where TomÃ¡s is greeted somewhat coldly by her husband, Alec (Aidan Quinn), a fisherman, who had expected someone older and perhaps more confident, and TomÃ¡s is intimidated by Alec. TomÃ¡s makes friends with Nancy (Tara Alice Scully) and is greeted tepidly by Seamus (Jack Gleeson). They take him to their 'secret' cave, inhabited by bats. There, TomÃ¡s runs away, scared, after which his two friends chase after him and console him. TomÃ¡s is introduced to his new school and, unlike at his previous school, here he is generally accepted by the pupils. As Maire's influence on him begins to shine through, he starts to gain in confidence and become drawn to wildlife. Soon thereafter, Alec and TomÃ¡s get a little closer, and when Maire has to go to the mainland for some shopping, Alec and TomÃ¡s go fishing. Together they find a young seal, apparently abandoned, on the beach. Christened 'Smudge' by TomÃ¡s, he wants to care for it and feeds it regularly for the next many days. For TomÃ¡s' birthday, the couple give him a new fishing rod &amp; reel. Maire suggests that the two guys go fishing, Alec to teach TomÃ¡s how to use the tackle, and the plan is set. The next morning, they head out, but Alec, distracted with helping some friends move a stuck boat, tells TomÃ¡s, \\"I won't be long, wait down there.\\" TomÃ¡s waits around nearly all day for him to show up, but Alec, after helping, then instead goes to the pub with the friends. Maire finds TomÃ¡s and takes him out in the boat herself.

A 2007 trial observed that elderly men taking 80 mg daily were hospitalized for urinary complications more often than those taking a placebo. The USDA RDA is 11 and 8 mg Zn/day for men and women, respectively. Levels of 100–300 mg may interfere with the utilization of copper and iron or adversely affect cholesterol. Levels of zinc in excess of 500 ppm in soil interfere with the ability of plants to absorb other essential metals, such as iron and manganese. There is also a condition called the zinc shakes or \\"zinc chills\\" that can be induced by the inhalation of freshly formed zinc oxide formed during the welding of galvanized materials.

How do you say \\"Rail The rim of a poker table or a barrier outside a poker area.\\" in Spanish?","completion":"To translate the phrase \\"Rail: the rim of a poker table or a barrier outside a poker area\\" into Spanish, it would be \\"Riel: el borde de una mesa de póker o una barrera fuera de un área de póker\\". However, it's important to mention that poker terminology can vary widely depending upon the region or the specific group playing the game. Your translation may not be immediately understood in all Spanish-speaking communities since poker-specific vocabulary may not always have a direct corresponding term in Spanish, or may be localized to a specific region. \\"Riel\\", for example, is a direct translation of \\"rail\\", but in the context of poker, it may not be universally recognized. Similarly, the term \\"poker\\" has been borrowed directly from English into Spanish, as is common with many specialized or technical terms. It's spelled and pronounced the same way in both languages. In Spanish, \\"el borde de una mesa de póker\\" directly refers to the edge or rim of a poker table. An alternative could be \\"la orilla de una mesa de póker\\", which emphasizes the intent of the word \\"rail\\" as the outermost part of the table. When it comes to translating \\"a barrier outside a poker area\\", a more commonly understood phrase can be \\"una barrera fuera de un área de juego de póker\\" or \\"una barrera fuera de la zona de juego de póker\\". These phrases would be clearly understood as indicating a physical barrier around the area where poker is being played.

Trump, however, sought to quell some of the high expectations, saying the summit would \\"be a beginning\\" and subsequent discussions were likely to be needed to get Pyongyang to agree to denuclearization. \\"We're not going to go in and sign something on June 12th, and we never were,\\" he said. \\"We're going to start a process.\\" Trump declared he \\"never said it happens in one meeting,\\" but that it \\"will ultimately be a successful process.\\" Asked by VOA News whether the North Koreans had committed to complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization, Trump replied only that \\"we talked about a lot of things.\\" 'Take your time' The president said he told Kim Yong Chol, the former head of North Korean military intelligence, \\"Take your time. We can go fast. We can go slowly.\\" The president made clear that sanctions on North Korea would not be lifted, however, until the country agreed to give up its nuclear arsenal.

Infrared thermal-imaging cameras are used to detect heat loss in insulated systems, to observe changing blood flow in the skin, and to detect overheating of electrical apparatus. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What technology allows infrared thermal imaging cameras to observe people or animals without being detected?","completion":"Infrared thermal imaging cameras can observe people or animals without being detected by utilizing passive infrared technology. Passive infrared technology works by detecting the natural thermal radiation emitted by objects, including humans and animals. This emitted heat, or infrared radiation, is invisible to the human eye, but can be detected by specialized sensors and imaging devices, such as thermal imaging cameras. The key advantage of passive infrared technology is that it does not require any active illumination or energy source to work. Instead, it relies on the differences in thermal signatures between the objects in the environment and the ambient temperature. Since the cameras are only receiving and processing the emitted heat signals, they themselves are producing minimal or no emissions that could be detected by an observer. This makes it difficult for people or animals being observed to detect the presence of a thermal imaging camera. Within the thermal imaging camera, there is an array of infrared detector elements, often made from materials like vanadium oxide or amorphous silicon, which are sensitive to infrared radiation in a specific wavelength range. When these detectors receive the incoming infrared radiation, they create a temperature-based image called a thermogram. This thermogram is then processed by the camera's internal electronics to generate a visible image that represents the temperature variations in the scene. This image can then be analyzed by an observer or an algorithm to draw conclusions about the presence, location, and activity of people or animals within the camera's field of view. Moreover, thermal imaging cameras often operate in the long-wave infrared (LWIR) range, which has wavelengths extending from about 8 to 15 micrometers. This range of wavelengths allows for better penetration through atmospheric obscurants such as fog, smoke, and light foliage, making it an effective tool for detecting concealed objects or beings. In summary, passive infrared technology, coupled with the use of infrared-sensitive materials and the processing of thermograms, allows thermal imaging cameras to effectively observe people or animals without being detected. This capability has numerous applications in various fields like military surveillance, security, wildlife monitoring, search and rescue operations, and forensic investigations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The planner charged more to work on the wedding than on the birthday party because the","completion":"wedding required more attention to detail, coordination, and time commitment. Wedding planning is often a more intricate process than putting together a birthday party because it involves bringing together two families, accommodating their traditions, and handling a myriad of other elements that go into creating a beautiful and memorable event. Step 1: Research and understand cultural traditions To accommodate both family's traditions, the planner starts by researching and understanding their respective customs and expectations. This step will allow the planner to integrate these elements seamlessly, ensuring that both families feel represented and respected in the wedding. Step 2: Assessing the venue The planner schedules a visit to the venue in order to evaluate the size, layout, and decorating possibilities. They consider factors such as ample seating, lighting, and space for other elements, such as the dance floor, dessert table, and photo booth. This step serves to ensure that the planner can accommodate the guest count and desired activities without compromising on aesthetics. Step 3: Selecting vendors The planner strategically selects vendors to align with the style and budget of the wedding. This includes finding suitable caterers, photographers, florists, and entertainment. They will compare costs and secure contracts with the chosen vendors, guaranteeing that all parties are on the same page in terms of expectations and deliverables. Step 4: Designing the wedding With the family's input and preferences in mind, the planner conceptualizes the overall design for the wedding. They will create a color palette and theme, curate suitable décor, and develop a seating plan that is both functional and visually appealing. Step 5: Communicating with guests The planner will assist in designing and sending out invitations, tracking RSVPs, and updating guests regarding any changes to the program. This ensures that all attendees receive necessary information and that their attendance is accounted for in the overall orchestrations. Step 6: Coordinating rehearsals Rehearsals are essential for a smooth wedding day, and the planner will arrange for all relevant parties, such as the couple, their families, and the bridal party, to understand their roles and the flow of events. This ensures that everyone is prepared and poised for the actual event. Step 7: Event management On the day of the wedding, the planner will take care of all aspects of event management, overseeing vendors, handling any problems that arise, and making sure everything stays on schedule. This allows the couple and their families to relax and enjoy the wedding without worrying about the minutiae of the day. In contrast, a birthday party typically involves fewer guests, a more straightforward venue, and less elaborate decorations, making it a less complex planning process. As a result, the planner charges more for their services in a wedding due to the greater effort and expertise needed to create a successful and memorable event."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Though hooded and cloaked, Nicolette trembled. The chill of the January afternoon pierced her through, but it was fear, more than the cold, that made her limbs shake. Having just crossed over to the Left Bank, she glanced back over her shoulder and saw the towers and spires of the royal palace across the Seine. She felt as if hidden eyes there were watching her. Could anyone on the palace wall have seen her walk over the Petit-Pont? Not Amalric. He was still in the south, the King having just appointed him seneschal for Beziers and the surrounding country. But he had so many agents in Paris and allies at court. Except for Agnes, all the servants in the Gobignon town house were loyal to him. His aunt, Queen Blanche, was forever praising him to all who would listen. If Nicolette were involved in scandal, the White Queen would be furious, and would see to it that word reached Amalric. And if indeed he found out about her meeting the troubadour? Just a message, a song, let alone a meeting like this one, could mean death for her and Orlando. I should turn around right now, cross this bridge, and run back to the palace. The streets of the Latin Quarter were crawling with ruffians and criminals - it was insane for her to be walking here alone after sunset. The sight of the small knife she carried under her cloak might deter an attacker, but then she would be discovered. If I screamed for help, the whole palace would find out. Blanche would demand to know why I was here. No, she thought, her blood turning to ice, she would know why. But those eyes of his? to look into them again, was that not worth any risk? She stood, vacillating, in the shadows by a wooden house that overhung the Rue Saint-Jacques. I must see Orlando, she thought. Over a year now, and I have not been able to forget him.

Team X started their training in the heat so many team members had problems sweating. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which team had more people that experienced fatigue? Hint: Millions of people in the world jog for exercise. For the most part, jogging can be a healthy way to stay fit. However, problems can also develop for those who jog in the heat. Excessive sweating can lead to electrolyte loss that could be life-threatening. Early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency can include nausea, fatugue, and dizziness. If not treated, individuals can experience muscle weakness and increased heart rate (which could lead to a heart attack). Many sports drinks can be consumed to restore electrolytes quickly in the body. A:","completion":"Based on the given information, it can be inferred that Team X, which trained in the heat, had more people experiencing fatigue. This is due to the fact that jogging in hot weather can lead to problems such as excessive sweating, electrolyte loss, and increased risk of dehydration. These factors can contribute to early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency which include fatigue, nausea, and dizziness. Training in such conditions can put a strain on the cardiovascular system, potentially leading to muscle weakness and an increased heart rate, which could result in a heart attack. On the other hand, Team Y trained early in the morning when the weather was cool, which likely helped them maintain their electrolyte balance and stay adequately hydrated. As a result, they were less likely to suffer from fatigue or other heat-related issues. In summary, since Team X trained in a more challenging environment with increased heat, they would have a higher probability of experiencing fatigue compared to Team Y, who trained under more favorable conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His host-mom did a couple of steps back, and looked puzzled. She thought that he didn't want to go out because he shook his head from side to side. However, he wanted to go out to the movies. Bulgarians shake their heads from side to side when they mean \\"yes\\". People in other countries shake their heads from side to side when they mean \\"no\\". Gestures can have different meanings according to different cultures. For example, in America, putting your index finger and your thumb in a circle is commonly used as an OK sign that means everything is all right.

Use of Personal Preferences: The reviewer begins by stating, \\"We love the card tables at Bellagio,\\" which denotes a strong personal inclination and admiration for the establishment and its services. 2. Emphasizing Quality: \\"Pierre is an awesome and entertaining dealer\\" illustrates the author's endorsement of Pierre's services, highlighting his exemplary skills and ability to engage with the customers and keep them entertained. 3. Loyalty and Frequency: The remark, \\"We come to play here every time,\\" portrays an unwavering loyalty to the Bellagio card tables and further emphasizes the recurrent satisfaction derived from their experiences at the establishment. 4.

If yeah at uh they had they had some good teams though, can we conclude that \\"They didn't have many bad teams.\\"?","completion":"Based on the statement, \\"Yeah at uh they had they had some good teams though,\\" we can infer that the place being referred to has experienced several good teams. However, the statement does not provide sufficient information to accurately and definitively conclude that \\"They didn't have many bad teams.\\" There are a few key points to consider that make it difficult to draw this conclusion: 1. Lack of defining metrics: The statement does not outline any specific parameters or criteria to define \\"good\\" teams or \\"bad\\" teams. Thus, it becomes difficult to gauge what constitutes a bad team and whether having some good teams correlates with not having many bad teams. 2. Relativity: Teams' performance may be relative to one another or to the environment in which they compete. For instance, a good team in their respective context may only be considered good compared to the other teams around them, but might not necessarily be seen as exceptional when compared to other standards. 3. Insufficient information: The given statement does not provide data on the total number of teams, their performance levels, or any historical trends that allow us to make a reasonable assumption about the quality and frequency of bad teams at that specific place. 4. Subjectivity: The perceived quality of a team can be subjective, making it challenging to categorize them as solely good or bad. A team's performance could potentially be based on various factors such as coaching, individual talent, teamwork, and even external factors like injuries and scheduling. 5. Temporality: The statement implies that there have been some good teams, hinting at a certain time frame but lacking specificity about when these good teams existed. It is not clear if the reference is to past, present, or potentially future good teams. This makes it harder to deduce whether the absence of many bad teams is applicable to the same time frame. In conclusion, while it is tempting to assert that \\"They didn't have many bad teams\\" based on the existence of good teams, we cannot reasonably conclude this because of the limitations explained above. To make a more informed conclusion, it would be necessary to gather more information, such as the context and standards of team performance, the total number of teams, historical trends, and any other factors that may impact the quality of teams at the given place."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A client or manager gets everyone assembled in a fluorescent-bleached conference room, and the hum of the projector signals “marching orders to come.” If you are in the agency world, you have the privilege of being able to move regularly among various such assemblies, all in a short period of time. When you start seeing the same slide showing up in multiple conference rooms and on conference stages, you know a pop-management meme is on the loose. Purpose or “The Why?” is a pop-management meme on a tear. One’s never entirely sure who puts a meme in play; but I will credit Nikos Mourkogiannis for his book Purpose: The Starting Point of Great Companies, which I believe will become the Good to Great of the first half of this new decade. A Purpose genre has emerged in his wake. Agency legend Roy Spence, of Austin’s GSD&M Idea City, has made Purpose his purpose, both as author of It’s Not What You Sell, It’s What You Stand For and as CEO of the Purpose Institute. In 2009, Simon Sinek joined the Purpose parade with his book, Start with Why, as does former P&G CMO Jim Stengel in his forthcoming book, Grow, a work founded in the concept of Purpose. So why are they all asking, “Why?” Is this just the latest in a long list of “USPs,” “Mission Statements,”,“Hedgehogs,” “Elevator Speeches,” “Brand Stories” and other such buzz speak that keeps the consultants in their platinum cards, or is something bigger going on? All of these tomes speak to how important Purpose is for marshaling organizations, attracting talent and fueling growth, but they are also very heavily associated with the changing dynamics of marketing communications. There is an important intersection at which Purpose and social media cross. The mainstream of communications is now controlled by users, not distributors. Okay, no duh. But where Purpose meets this new mainstream is in the conversation content of social-media chatter. Nearly every marketer who has thus far entered that stream with the conventional “deal-points” approach to marketing communications has been rebuffed. You can’t just show up at social conversations with your bullet points and promotional offers. You need to be able to talk to people like, well, like you would talk to people. So how does a company or its representatives enter such conversations? By talking about Purpose, or “The Why.” You need to be able to enter such conversations with altruistic, empathetic observations, stories and POVS—admittedly contextualized in what your business is up to, but nevertheless not so baldly mercenary. What real good, not just value, is your business delivering to the world? What causes are you pursuing that are larger than next quarter’s deliveries, or even the technical dimensions of your product or service engagement? Without such Purpose, without starting with “The Why,” you’ll be excluded from the new, critical first phase of the sales cycle: the conversation that precedes and begets consideration. The bad news is that 99 percent of companies haven’t a clue about their larger Purpose, much less an altruistic, empathetic storyline with which they can enter conversations. The good news is that there is a powerful emerging market demand for the strategic and creative services required to define and propagate such Purpose, conceptually and technically, larger than any the marketing industry has ever known.

Parents who believe that playing video games is less harmful to their kids' attention spans than watching TV may want to reconsider -- and unplug the Xbox. Video games can sap a child's attention just as much as the tube, a new study suggests. Elementary school children who play video games more than two hours a day are 67 percent more likely than their peers who play less to have greater-than-average attention problems, according to the study, which appears in the journal Pediatrics. Playing video games and watching TV appear to have roughly the same link to attention problems, even though video games are considered a less passive activity, the researchers say. \\"Video games aren't less likely than television to be related to attention problems,\\" says the lead author of the study, Edward Swing, a doctoral candidate in the department of psychology at Iowa State University, in Ames. \\"They were at least as strong as television at predicting attention problems.\\" However, the study doesn't prove that video games directly cause attention problems. It could be that kids who have short attention spans to begin with might be more likely to pick up a joystick than a book, for instance. Health.com: Quiz: Do you have adult ADHD? The relationship between video games and attention is probably a two-way street, Swing says. \\"It wouldn't surprise me if children who have attention problems are attracted to these media, and that these media increase the attention problems,\\" he says. Swing and his colleagues followed more than 1,300 children in the third, fourth, and fifth grades for a little over a year. The researchers asked both the kids and their parents to estimate how many hours per week the kids spent watching TV and playing video games, and they assessed the children's attention spans by surveying their schoolteachers. Previous studies have examined the effect of TV or video games on attention problems, but not both. By looking at video-game use as well as TV watching, Swing and his colleagues were able to show for the first time that the two activities have a similar relationship to attention problems.

Shawn Green, Ph.D, a postdoctoral associate in the department of psychology at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis, points out that the study doesn't distinguish between the type of attention required to excel at a video game and that required to excel in school. \\"A child who is capable of playing a video game for hours on end obviously does not have a global problem with paying attention,\\" says Green, who has researched video games but was not involved in the current study. \\"The question, then, is why are they able to pay attention to a game but not in school? What expectancies have the games set up that aren't being delivered in a school setting?\\" Experts have suggested that modern TV shows are so exciting and fast paced that they make reading and schoolwork seem dull by comparison, and the same may be true for video games, the study notes. Health.com: 10 kid-targeted junk foods. It's unclear from this study whether that's the case, however, because Swing and his colleagues didn't look at the specific games the kids were playing. \\"We weren't able to break [the games] down by educational versus non-educational or nonviolent versus violent,\\" says Swing, adding that the impact different types of games may have on attention is a ripe area for future research. The study also suggests that young kids aren't the only ones whose attention spans may be affected by video games. Health.com: Too much TV linked to earlier death. In addition to surveying the elementary school kids, the researchers asked 210 college students about their TV and video-game use and how they felt it affected their attention.

These attention problems later in life may be the result of \\"something cumulative that builds up over a lifetime\\" or \\"something that happens early in life at some critical period and then stays with you,\\" Swing says. \\"Either way, there are implications that would lead us to want to reduce television and video games in childhood.\\" The American Academy of Pediatrics, the leading professional organization for pediatricians and the publisher of Pediatrics, recommends that parents limit all \\"screen time\\" (including video and computer games) to less than two hours per day.

Write a summary based on this article: Auckland headmaster says prop razor was checked ‘many, many times’ and he has no idea how 16-year-olds were hurt A New Zealand school production of Sweeney Todd was called off on opening night after two teenage cast members’ necks were cut with a prop razor. Ambulance services were called to Saint Kentigern college in east Auckland just after 9pm on Wednesday night. Two 16-year-old boys were taken to Auckland hospital, one with serious and one with moderate injuries. Both were acting in the school’s production of Sweeney Todd, Stephen Sondheim’s 1979 musical about “the demon barber of Fleet Street”, and were injured halfway through the second act about in a throat-cutting scene. Michael Simkins: Slitting your throat and other theatrical hazards Read more Fairfax New Zealand quoted an audience member who said she did not know there had been an accident until after the show. “No announcements were made to the audience that the throat slitting was not all just fake blood,” she said. “The show went on, we never knew anything about the real blood being spilt until later. “It is terribly sad what has happened. It’s a great show and I’d hate to see anything bad overshadow the quality of the show.” Counties-Manukau police visited the school on Thursday, though a spokesman told the New Zealand Herald it had not been “not a criminal injury”. “In this instance the play is not the reality,” he said. Worksafe New Zealand, the government service responsible for workplace health and safety, is investigating. In a radio interview on Thursday, the Saint Kentigern college head, Steve Cole, said the prop razor had been blunted with a number of materials, including duct tape and foam, and the injuries were the result of a “very unfortunate mistake”. “It’s normal for Sweeney Todd to have such an instrument [and it] clearly had been checked many, many times,” he said. “It has been bound and cellophaned and all sorts of things. It had been blunted and had been through all sorts of health and safety checks. It was a very unfortunate mistake.” Cole said he had “no idea” how the boys had come to be injured. He understood that both had been discharged from hospital. He said the play had been rehearsed since January, and that particular scene had been practised “many, many times”. Thursday’s performance would be postponed but Cole said he hoped the season could be rescued – “obviously, without those particular props”. “I’m very, very hopeful that we will have a full production Friday, Saturday and maybe Sunday, a matinee.” Cole told other media that, “in hindsight”, it might have been better to use a plastic prop. A post to Saint Kentigern’s website on Tuesday, before opening night, said the choice of Sweeney Todd had “raised the bar and challenged our student actors, musicians and stage crew on many levels”. “The biggest challenge of all, however, was the ghoulish murder scenes themselves, as Todd’s barbering skills cleanly dispatched victim after victim. Let’s just say there was ‘gore’ – and plenty of it!” ||||| A prop which cut the necks of two Auckland private school students during a rendition of Sweeney Todd was a \\"razor\\" wrapped in duct tape and paper.

He said the play about a Victorian-era murdering barber in London was \\"pushing the boundaries\\" of the students involved. \\"Maybe next year we'll do something more general, but these kids need to be extended.\\" He added the drama teachers involved were \\"struggling\\", but were \\"very competent and have run numerous shows at the college\\". He did not believe there would be any ramifications for the teachers. Source: ONE News Mr Cole said the prop had been used throughout rehearsals since January, and while some parents were initially concerned about their children performing Sweeney Todd the show went on. He said there was no \\"legal situation\\", but WorkSafe New Zealand and police were both investigating. \\"I’m very confident the health and safety situation was strong.\\" The two wounded students were discharged from Auckland hospital this afternoon. ||||| The prop which cut two students in a Saint Kentigern College production of Sweeney Todd was a real razor wrapped in duct tape and paper, the school has said.

Cole did not believe there would be any ramifications for the teachers. But the school will undergo an investigation by Worksafe New Zealand . Counties-Manukau police visited the school on Thursday and made \\"initial enquires\\" about the incident, a police spokeswoman said. The exclusive east Auckland school has also launched its own investigation into how the students suffered injuries to their necks during Wednesday's opening night performance of Sweeney Todd. Cole said he was \\"very concerned\\" about the accident. One 16-year-old student sustained serious injuries and another had moderate injuries. Both were taken to Auckland Hospital Wednesday night. Cole said Thursday night's performance would not go ahead while an investigation was under way to determine exactly what happened and ensure it did not recur. However the play was likely to be staged again on other nights. \\"Our priority is to continue to support the boys and their families, and we would appreciate if their privacy is respected. \\"We are also very focused on helping other cast and crew members, along with the wider school community and have offered all students counselling.\\" An eyewitness said the audience on Wednesday night had no idea an accident had happened and that the blood spilt was real blood - not all fake blood. \\"No announcements were made to the audience that the throat slitting was not all just 'fake blood', the show went on, we never knew anything about the real blood being spilt until later,\\" the audience member said.

Penny Fitt, Associate Director at Toi Whakaari said it was not normal practice in productions to use real knives and if so, they are usually made to be very blunt. In some versions of the musical, adapted from a Victorian penny dreadful, Sweeney Todd (a barber) slits his victims' throats before disposing of them through a trapdoor. According to the school's website, the St Kentigern's performance tells how Sweeney Todd, a barber turned serial-killer, sets up a barber's shop above a struggling pie shop and kills his victims using a razor blade. He and Mrs Lovett, the pie shop owner, then turn the victims' corpses in to meat pies. The college website said; \\"The biggest challenge of all, however, was the ghoulish murder scenes themselves, as Todd's barbering skills cleanly dispatched victim after victim. Let's just say there was 'gore' – and plenty of it!\\" The show was scheduled to run until Saturday, April 9 at the school's Elliot Hall.

It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.

Because Rutherford’s model was weak on the position of the electrons, Bohr focused on them. He hypothesized that electrons can move around the nucleus only at fixed distances from the nucleus based on the amount of energy they have. He called these fixed distances energy levels, or electron shells. He thought of them as concentric spheres, with the nucleus at the center of each sphere. In other words, the shells consisted of sphere within sphere within sphere. Furthermore, electrons with less energy would be found at lower energy levels, closer to the nucleus. Those with more energy would be found at higher energy levels, farther from the nucleus. Bohr also hypothesized that if an electron absorbed just the right amount of energy, it would jump to the next higher energy level. Conversely, if it lost the same amount of energy, it would jump back to its original energy level. However, an electron could never exist in between two energy levels. These ideas are illustrated in the Figure below . I am facing a new situation today: Greg was studying Bohr's model. He found it helpful to categorize different scenarios in the model. First, he labeled electron with higher energy as cat A, and electron with lower energy as cat B. Then he labeled electron that gained energy as cat C, and election that lost energy as cat D.

An open jail has been condemned as a laughing stock after a second prisoner went missing in a week – bringing the total on the run to 82. Burglar Greg Disbrey, 27, simply walked out of Ford Open Prison on Monday and has not been seen since. Three days before, thug Lucas Lamb absconded from the Category D facility in Arundel, West Sussex. On the run: Greg Disbrey (left) and Lucas Lamb (right) have both absconded from Ford Open Prison in West Sussex in the last week - bringing the total number of prisoners who have gone missing to 82. Sussex Police said Disbrey has links to Edgware in north London and Devon, and was sentenced to three-and-a-half years for burglary and handling stolen goods in 2012. The jail holds 521 inmates - meaning the total who have absconded are equal to almost a sixth of its capacity. Andy Silvester, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will be shocked their money is being used to run a laughing stock of a prison. ‘They rightly expect that prisoners are not able to wander off at their leisure.’ Yesterday figures obtained via a Freedom of Information request revealed that the two men bring the total missing from Ford to 82. This includes two murderers, a kidnapper and five other violent criminals. About half have been missing for at least four years, and 18 escaped in the 1990s. Slammed: Some 82 prisoners are missing from Ford Open Prison in West Sussex, many for several years. Justice campaigner Peter Cuthbertson slammed the lax security at the prison. The director of the campaign group Centre for Crime Prevention said: 'Open prisons in general and HMP Ford in particular have a terrible record for prisoner escapes. 'Eighty-two separate cases is an appalling figure. 'It is dangerous to rely on prisons that have such a bad record of escapes, and it’s high time to stop the overuse of open prisons.' Police described Disbrey as white, 5ft 7ins tall and with a pierced eyebrow, two large moles behind his right ear and a tattoo of a cross on his right forearm.

I was a very confused 17 year old, and she took an interest in me, and we would talk about all my problems with my own family, and everything that was going wrong with me. I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’. We separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why. I just couldn’t go on living the lie. I hate myself for doing it to her. Selfishly, I wouldn’t change things though, as I have my daughter and I love her, and I love being a parent.

Given the question: You are presented with the question \\"What can cause rocks to break down?\\" and the following answer choices: - Wind Barriers - Protective Barriers - Stone Sealers - wind - mines - Water - erosion - Gravity Now knowing that mechanical weathering is when rocks are broken down by mechanical means and water is a mechanical weathering force, choose the best answer. The answer is:","completion":"Water. To fully understand why water is the best answer for what can cause rocks to break down, we must first delve into the concept of mechanical weathering. Mechanical weathering, also known as physical weathering, is the process by which rocks and minerals are broken down into smaller particles by natural physical agents. These agents, such as wind, water, temperature fluctuations, and living organisms, work to weaken and fragment rocks over time. In the provided answer choices, several options relate indirectly to mechanical weathering, but water is the most potent and direct force mentioned. Here is a breakdown of the answer choices and why water stands out as the best option: 1. Wind Barriers, Protective Barriers, and Stone Sealers: These options are not agents of weathering but rather protection measures against weathering. They might slow the weathering process by limiting exposure to certain natural elements, but they do not directly contribute to the breakdown of rocks. 2. Wind: Wind can indeed contribute to the mechanical breakdown of rocks by blowing abrasive particles like sand against rock surfaces, a process called abrasion. Wind also plays a part in a type of freeze-thaw weathering in which wind-driven ice pellets can fracture rock surfaces. However, its impact is generally less significant compared to water's influence on weathering. 3. Mines: Mining activities by humans can lead to the mechanical breakdown of rocks, but this process is anthropogenic and localized, making it a less comprehensive answer than water, which impacts rocks on a larger scale and independent of human intervention. 4. Water: Water is a powerful force in the mechanical breakdown of rocks through several mechanisms. These include freeze-thaw weathering, where water enters rock fractures, freezes, expands, and exerts pressure that fractures the rocks further; abrasion, in which water transports abrasive particles like sand and pebbles that grind against rock surfaces; and dissolution, where water chemically reacts with certain minerals in the rocks, breaking them down. Water is the most encompassing and effective weathering agent among the given answer choices. 5. Erosion: Erosion is the process by which weathered rock materials are removed and transported from one location to another. Although related to weathering, erosion itself does not cause the breakdown of rocks but is a process that occurs after weathering has taken place. 6. Gravity: Gravity can contribute to the mechanical breakdown of rocks by causing rockfalls or landslides, particularly on steep slopes. However, compared to water, it is not as universal or efficient in breaking down rocks in various geological contexts. In summary, water is the best answer for the question, \\"What can cause rocks to break down?\\" as it is a direct, effective, and widespread mechanical weathering force. Its various mechanisms, such as freeze-thaw weathering, abrasion, and dissolution, make it a vital agent in the breakdown of rocks across various environments and geological contexts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The younger man takes the three to the Cafe Royal and promises them experiences they will never forget but insists that they go to see Weller and purchase from him Dracula's ring, cloak and dried blood. Having done so, the three meet with Courtley at an abandoned Church for a ceremony during which he puts the dried blood into goblets and mixes it with drops of his own blood, telling the men to drink. They refuse, so he drinks the blood himself, screams and falls to the ground. As he grabs their legs, they kick and beat him, not stopping until Courtley dies, at which they flee.

The study compared surveys from the early 1990s and the mid-2000s. Each included a few thousand teenagers. In the first survey, about 15 percent of teenagers had some degree of hearing loss. Some 15 years later, that number had risen by a third, to nearly 20 percent. \\"This certainly is big news,\\" said Alison Grimes, an ear doctor. \\"Hearing loss is very common in old people,\\" Grimes said, but she added that it was worrying to see it happen in the younger age group. In babies and young children, hearing problems are known to slow language development. The science is less clear for teenagers, but it is easy to imagine how being hard of hearing could influence learning, said Grimes. The reasons for the rise are still unclear.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. when you convert dvd to other formats, you can set the settings to suite your requirements. This is all lower case. Can you fix that?","completion":"When you convert a DVD to other formats, you can set the settings to suit your requirements. In the process of converting a DVD to another format, one common reason for doing this is to make the video file more compatible with various devices and media players. Another reason is to save storage space, as some video formats can offer better compression while maintaining high quality. To make your converted video file compatible and tailored to your specific needs, you can choose to adjust various settings during the conversion process. Here are some key settings you can customize while converting a DVD to another format: 1. Video Format: First and foremost, you need to select the output format for the video file. Popular formats include MP4, AVI, MKV, and WMV. Each format has its own advantages and compatibility with different devices. For example, MP4 is a widely accepted format that works with almost all devices, while MKV offers excellent quality and supports multiple audio tracks and subtitles. 2. Resolution: The resolution of the video file determines the level of detail and clarity. You can choose to maintain the original resolution of the DVD (typically 720 x 480 or 720 x 576), or you can downscale it to a lower resolution to save space. Conversely, you can also upscale the resolution, but this may not result in a significant improvement in quality. 3. Aspect Ratio: The aspect ratio represents the proportional relationship between the width and height of the video. DVDs usually use a 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio. Ensure that you set the correct aspect ratio to avoid stretching or compressing your video during playback. 4. Frame Rate: The frame rate is the number of frames displayed per second (fps) in the video. A higher frame rate often results in smoother motion, while a lower frame rate may lead to choppier video. DVDs usually have a frame rate of 23.976, 24, 25, or 29.97 fps. You can maintain the original frame rate or adjust it based on your preferences and intended playback devices. 5. Bitrate: The bitrate represents the amount of data used to store each second of video or audio. A higher bitrate generally results in higher quality but larger file sizes, while a lower bitrate can save storage space at the cost of some quality loss. You can experiment with different bitrates to find the ideal balance between quality and file size. 6. Audio Settings: You can also customize the audio settings, such as the codec, bitrate, and the number of audio channels. Common audio codecs include MP3, AAC, and AC3. Adjusting these settings can help you achieve the desired audio quality and compatibility with your devices. 7. Subtitles and Additional Tracks: If your DVD contains subtitles or multiple audio tracks, you can choose which ones you want to include in your converted video file. This is particularly useful for preserving foreign language audio tracks, commentary tracks, or subtitles for accessibility. By adjusting these settings during the DVD conversion process, you can create a tailored video file that meets your specific requirements regarding format, quality, compatibility, and storage space. Make sure to use reliable DVD conversion software that offers a wide range of customization options and supports the output format you need."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read this: On basic Church teachings, the pope was unwavering. On the tenth anniversary of Humanae vitae, he reconfirmed this teaching. In his style and methodology, he was a disciple of Pius XII, whom he deeply revered. He suffered for the attacks on Pius XII for his alleged silences during the Holocaust. Pope Paul VI was less outstanding than his predecessors: he was not credited with an encyclopedic memory, nor a gift for languages, nor the brilliant writing style of Pius XII, nor did he have the charisma and outpouring love, sense of humor and human warmth of John XXIII. He took on himself the unfinished reform work of these two popes, bringing them diligently with great humility and common sense and without much fanfare to conclusion. In doing so, Paul VI saw himself following in the footsteps of the Apostle Paul, torn to several directions as Saint Paul, who said, \\"I am attracted to two sides at once, because the Cross always divides.\\" Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): Whose theology did Paul VI continue to propagate during his papacy?","completion":"Pope Paul VI continued to propagate the theology of his predecessors, particularly that of Pope Pius XII and Pope John XXIII, during his papacy. He remained committed to upholding the basic Church teachings and diligently worked on completing the unfinished reform work initiated by these two previous popes. His approach, which involved great humility, common sense, and dedication without much fanfare, reflects his admiration for their theological stances and accomplishments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I read this background article the other day: Ocean acidification occurs when excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes the oceans to become acidic. Burning fossil fuels has led to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This carbon dioxide is then absorbed by the oceans, which lowers the pH of the water. Ocean acidification can kill corals and shellfish. It may also cause marine organisms to reproduce less, which could harm other organisms in the food chain. As a result, there also may be fewer marine organisms for humans to consume. I am facing a new situation today: Two islands were situated in different oceans. Hill island used fossil fuels and released a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, while Coral island was very protective towards the air and the ocean. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which island contributed more to an increase in carbon dioxide levels? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article, it would be correct to say that Hill Island contributed more to an increase in carbon dioxide levels. The article states that burning fossil fuels leads to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Since Hill Island used fossil fuels, they would have released a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. On the other hand, Coral Island was more protective towards the air and ocean, which implies that they likely did not use or used less fossil fuels, thus contributing less carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Therefore, Hill Island has more responsibility for increasing carbon dioxide levels."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"dDT protects plants by doing what?\\" is \\"energy barrier\\", given that dDT is used for protecting plants by killing insects? Answer:","completion":"I believe that the term \\"energy barrier\\" does not precisely capture the function of DDT in protecting plants. DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane) is a synthetic chemical compound that was initially developed as an insecticide. Its primary function is to protect plants and crops by exterminating insects that pose a threat to their growth and existence. Thus, to understand how DDT works and protects plants, we need to delve deeper into its mechanism of action, its history, and ramifications of its usage. First synthesized in 1874, DDT became widely used during World War II for controlling the spread of diseases like malaria and typhus by targeting disease-carrying insects such as mosquitoes and lice. After the war, it became a popular insecticide in agriculture due to its effectiveness in killing a wide variety of insects without harming plants. The mechanism of action of DDT primarily involves targeting the nervous systems of insects. It interferes with the normal functioning of their nerve cells, leading to overstimulation and, ultimately, the death of the insect. DDT acts on the voltage-gated sodium channels, preventing them from closing and causing a continuous influx of sodium ions into the nerve cells. This results in hyperactivity, paralysis and, eventually, the demise of the insect. In terms of protecting plants, DDT fulfills this function by effectively killing insects that typically threaten their vitality and survival. In this sense, DDT acts as a chemical barrier that prevents or, more accurately, eliminates these insects from infesting or consuming the plants. However, since the 1960s, the extensive use of DDT has been met with widespread concern. The main issues are its persistence in the environment, its bioaccumulation in the food chain, and its potential negative effects on the health of humans and wildlife. Studies have shown that DDT can accumulate in the fatty tissues of animals, which can then be ingested by humans. Its long-term presence in the environment can also lead to resistance in certain insect populations, rendering the insecticide ineffective. Consequently, the use of DDT has been banned or restricted in many countries to mitigate these risks. In conclusion, the right answer to the question \\"DDT protects plants by doing what?\\" would be \\"killing insects that pose a threat to the plants.\\" While the term \\"energy barrier\\" does not accurately describe the action of DDT, it is evident that its insecticidal properties indeed serve as a form of chemical barrier to safeguard plants from potential harm. However, it is essential to note that the long-term and widespread use of DDT has contributed to significant environmental and health concerns, leading to its ban or restriction in numerous countries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The deputy director for operations mentioned the Delta flight and concluded that \\"that would be the fourth possible hijack.\\" At 9:49, the commander of NORAD directed all air sovereignty aircraft to battle stations, fully armed. At 9:59, an Air Force lieutenant colonel working in the White House Military Office joined the conference and stated he had just talked to Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley. The White House requested (1) the implementation of continuity of government measures, (2) fighter escorts for Air Force One, and (3) a fighter combat air patrol over Washington, D.C. By 10:03, when United 93 crashed in Pennsylvania, there had been no mention of its hijacking and the FAA had not yet been added to the teleconference. The President and the Vice President The President was seated in a classroom when, at 9:05, Andrew Card whispered to him: \\"A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.\\" The President told us his instinct was to project calm, not to have the country see an excited reaction at a moment of crisis. The press was standing behind the children; he saw their phones and pagers start to ring. The President felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening. The President remained in the classroom for another five to seven minutes, while the children continued reading.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: Sir Richard Starkey (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, songwriter, singer, and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals, usually for one song on an album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Good Night\\", and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". Starr was twice afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. Context: When Starr married Maureen Cox in 1965, Beatles manager Brian Epstein served as best man, with Starr's stepfather Harry Graves and fellow Beatle George Harrison as witnesses. Soon afterwards, the couple's matrimony became the subject of a US novelty song, \\"Treat Him Tender, Maureen\\", by the Chicklettes. Starr and Maureen had three children together: Zak (born 13 September 1965), Jason (born 19 August 1967) and Lee (born 11 November 1970). In 1971, Starr purchased Lennon's former home, Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill in Berkshire and moved his family there. Following Starr's repeated infidelities, the couple divorced in 1975. Maureen died from leukaemia at age 48 in 1994. In 1980, while on the set of the film Caveman, Starr met actress Barbara Bach; they were married on 27 April 1981. In 1985, he was the first of the Beatles to become a grandfather upon the birth of Zak's daughter, Tatia Jayne Starkey. Zak Starkey is also a drummer, and during his father's regular absences, he spent time with The Who's Keith Moon. Zak has performed with his father during some All-Starr Band tours. In total, Ringo Starr has eight grandchildren - one from Zak, four from Jason and three from Lee. In 2016, he was the first Beatle to become a great-grandfather. Starr and Bach split their time between homes in Cranleigh, Surrey; Los Angeles; and Monte Carlo. In the Sunday Times Rich List 2011, Starr was listed at number 56 in the UK with an estimated personal wealth of PS150 million. In 2012, Starr was estimated to be the wealthiest drummer in the world. In 2014 Starr announced that his 200-acre Surrey estate at Rydinghurst, with its Grade II-listed Jacobean house, was for sale. However, he retains a property in the London district of Chelsea off King's Road, and he and Bach continue to divide their time between London and Los Angeles. In December 2015, Starr and Bach auctioned some of their personal and professional items to the public via Julien's Auctions in Los Angeles. Highlights of the collection included Starr's first Ludwig Black Oyster Pearl drum kit; instruments given to him by Harrison, Lennon and Marc Bolan; and a first-pressing copy of the Beatles' White Album numbered \\"0000001\\". The auction raised over 9 million, a portion of which was set aside for the Lotus Foundation, a charity founded by Starr and Bach. In 2016, Starr expressed his support for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, explaining: \\"I thought the European Union was a great idea, but I didn't see it going anywhere lately.\\" In 2017 he described his impatience for Britain to \\"get on with\\" Brexit, declaring that \\"to be in control of your country is a good move.\\" Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects in the article beyond the ones already mentioned: 1. Overcoming illnesses and hospitalizations in childhood: The fact that Ringo Starr faced life-threatening illnesses during his childhood and fell behind in school due to prolonged hospital stays illustrates the resilience he showcased later in life, ultimately becoming a successful musician and integral part of the Beatles. 2. Ringo Starr's diverse talents and contributions to the Beatles: While primarily known as the drummer, Starr also occasionally provided lead vocals and contributed to songwriting, highlighting his diverse skill set within the group. 3. Second marriage to Barbara Bach: It is interesting to note that after his divorce with Maureen Cox, Starr met actress Barbara Bach on the set of the film \\"Caveman\\"; the couple has been married since 1981, showcasing a long-lasting relationship in the entertainment industry. 4. Wealth and financial success: Starr's position as the wealthiest drummer in the world in 2012 and his ranking at number 56 in the UK Sunday Times Rich List 2011 reveal his significant financial success throughout his career. 5. Charitable efforts and philanthropy: In addition to his successful music career, Ringo Starr and his wife Barbara Bach are also involved in charity work through their Lotus Foundation. The auction of their personal and professional items, which raised over 9 million, showcases their commitment to philanthropy. 6. Political Views: Starr's support for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, also known as Brexit, offers some insight into his political views and opinions regarding his home country. Overall, this article provides a comprehensive overview of Ringo Starr's personal life, career, achievements, relationships, and even his political views, painting a full picture of the musician's life and legacy."},{"prompt":"What key details about terry schoonover can be extracted from the following bio?

Upon arriving in Hollow Oak, the Blairs are welcomed by the warm embrace of the tight-knit community.

In Texas, a drifter faces the death penalty in just a few days. His only hope is that his lawyers can persuade the serial killer Richard Ramirez to confess to the crime instead. His legal team includes Kit, who is tasked with traveling to California, and visiting Ramirez in San Quentin State Prison in an attempt to persuade him to confess. She stays in a budget hotel and spends time in a bar during her time off. The murder in Texas took place before Ramirez's first known killing. Kit initially speaks with Ramirez by phone through glass; he refuses to reveal anything until they meet in a visitation room. There, he demands she remove her gold jewelry; he says that he is a Satanist, and gold is offensive to Satan because it is God's metal. He remains uncooperative because guards are in the room, but suggests that they can have privacy if she says she's his lawyer. Even then he remains uncooperative and insulting, demanding that she reveal personal details about herself to make herself interesting enough that she deserves to know more about him.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: ALMOST everyone wants to get smarter. We struggle to improve our memory, intelligence, and attention span. We drink cup after cup of coffee to help us get through the day. However, a new study published in the journal Current Directions in Psychological Science warns that there are limits to how smart humans can get, and trying to increase your thinking ability could beurisky. Each of our body parts evolved in a certain way for a reason. For example, we are not 3 meters tall because most people's hearts are not strong enough to send blood up that high. Scientists are now saying that our thinking ability works in the same way. A baby's brain size is limited by a series of factors, such as the size of the mother's pelvis . If our brains evolved to vbe bigger, there could be more deaths during childbirth. The study of Ashkenazi Jews , who have an average IQ much higher than other Europeans, showed that they were more likely to develop diseases of the nervous system. This might be because of their increased brainpower. If intelligence cannot be improved, can we at least get better at concentrating? Not really, say scientists. They studied drugs like caffeine that improve attention span. They found that the drugs only helped people with serious attention problems. For those who did not have trouble paying attention, the drugs could have the opposite effect. Scientists say that this suggests there is an upper limit to how much people can or should concentrate. Our memory is also a \\"double-edged sword \\". People with extremely vivid memories could end up having a difficult life because they cannot forget bad things that happen to them. Thomas Hills of the University of Warwick in the UK, one of the authors of the paper, said that considering all the problems in trying to get smarter, it's unlikely there will ever be a \\"supermind\\". Options: A there are limits to people's intelligence B a baby's IQ is determined by the mother's pelvis C most people's hearts are not that strong to make them smarter D it's likely that people's body parts will continue to evolve Answer: A there are limits to people's intelligence Question: A:","completion":"Based on the study published in the journal Current Directions in Psychological Science, which of the following statements is correct?

Given the question: Process: - Air is taken into the body via the nose or mouth - The air travels into the windpipe - The windpipe divides the air to the two lungs via the bronchial tubes - The lungs oxygenate the blood in the body - Carbon dioxide is filtered out by every cell in the body - The carbon dioxide is carried back to the lungs via the bloodstream - The carbon dioxide is exhaled. Question: suppose more reservations made happens, how will it affect more air is taken in via the nose or mouth. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","completion":"When considering the scenario of more reservations being made, it seems unrelated to the process of air being taken into the body via the nose or mouth. However, if we were to interpret the term \\"reservations\\" in the context of lung capacity or breathing rate, then we could analyze the potential effects on the process. If more reservations are being made in terms of increased lung capacity or breathing rate, this would result in more air being taken in via the nose or mouth. This increased air intake would have several effects on the second stage of the process mentioned - the air traveling into the windpipe. Firstly, an increased breathing rate would lead to a higher volume of air passing through the windpipe. This would cause the windpipe to work more efficiently in order to transport the increased air volume to the bronchial tubes. This increased movement of air through the respiratory system would increase the rate at which oxygen reaches the lungs and the overall efficiency of the blood oxygenation process. Secondly, an increase in lung capacity would allow for a greater amount of air to be held within the lungs at any given time. This would result in a larger surface area for gas exchange to occur, potentially enhancing the efficiency of oxygen absorption into the bloodstream and the removal of carbon dioxide. Therefore, in conclusion, if more reservations are made in terms of increased lung capacity or breathing rate, the effect on the second stage of the process - the air traveling into the windpipe - would be more significant. The increased air intake would lead to a higher volume of air passing through the windpipe and a greater efficiency in the overall respiratory process, including oxygenation of the blood and removal of carbon dioxide from the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against Richard Wagner's music dramas, heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period. Fanning writes, \\"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera Saul and David and the Second Symphony (The Four Temperaments) and the cantatas Hymnus amoris and Søvnen\\". Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start, but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer's life.Nielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate.

Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? The answer is:","completion":"The review depicts the product in a mostly flattering light. Here's why: 1. The reviewer begins by appreciating the setup/story and characters, indicating satisfaction with the plot and character design of the product. This points towards a positive or flattering depiction. 2. The reviewer's criticism about wanting more confrontational scenes between Reno and the bad guy or his goons, signifies that they find these scenes exciting or engaging. They are expressing a desire for more of a certain element they enjoyed, which can still be seen as generally flattering. 3. Similarly, the reviewer expresses a desire for a longer, more creative ending rather than a simple bank shootout. This means they are engaged enough with the story that they wish it had a more elaborate finale. 4.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Paragraph: Breathing is the process of moving air into and out of the lungs. The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens. This increases the size of the chest. This too decreases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows air and gases to enter the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened. Next, air passes through a passageway that is connected to the windpipe. The air then finds its way to the lungs. In the chest, the windpipe splits so that air enters both the right and left lung. Question: \\"What happens to the air pressure inside the lungs when the diaphragm muscle tightens?\\" Answer: \\"Going down\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"Yes, the answer is correct.

Serebro (Russian: Serebro; English translation: Silver) (Stylized as SEREBRO) is a Russian girl group formed by their manager and producer Maxim Fadeev. After the decline of their success after \\"Mama Lover\\", the group started to record songs for their third studio album. In January 2013, the group announced that they would release their further material in Japan after signing with EMI Music. They also announced that they plan to release a compilation entitled Serebration that includes songs from their first and second studio albums. The group traveled to Japan to promote the compilation album and to do a live concert tour. In March 2013, the group released their promotional single \\"Sexy Ass\\", but it failed to chart in Russia. In June 2013, the group released their single \\"Mi Mi Mi\\" which charted in Italy, peaking at 5 on the Italian iTunes chart. In July 2013, the group released the song \\"Malo Tebya\\". The song was released on Russian radio airplay on 10 July and marked a welcome return to the top ten in Russia for the band, ultimately peaking at number five. A new collaboration with DJ M.E.G., entitled \\"Ugar\\" (Ugar), has premiered on the band's Facebook page and the Promo DJ website on 18 September. The group announced that they signed a deal with Republic Records and Universal Music Group and discussed plans to re-release their single \\"Mi Mi Mi\\" as their first international single. On 28 September, member Anastasia Karpova confirmed her planned departure from the group. Karpova had told Fadeev months prior that she intended to leave the group. She noted that the decision was mutual with other members of the band and that her primary motivation was to pursue a solo career. A new member, named Dasha Shashina, was announced on 3 October 2013. Shashina had re-recorded Anastasia's recordings in the group's songs \\"Malo Tebya\\" and \\"Ugar\\", which is expected to release a video with Shashina featuring in it. Temnikova left the group in May 2014, ahead of her planned December exit, after having become pregnant. Karpova temporarily returned until newest member Polina Favorskaya was introduced on June 5, 2014.

Plot title: Gidget Movie plot: Frances Lawrence (Sandra Dee) is a socially awkward, 16-year-old girl about to turn 17 and is on her summer break between her junior and senior years of high school. She resists the pressure to go \\"man-hunting\\" with her girlfriends and laments the days when the girls had fun together without boys. Frances also rejects her parents wishing to fix her up on a date with the son of a friend of the family, Jeffrey Matthews.On a jaunt to the beach with her bikini-clad girlfriends, flat-chested tomboy Frances meets surfer Moondoggie (James Darren). She quickly becomes infatuated with him, but he shows no romantic interest, however Frances is more attracted to surfing than man hunting.At home, Francie importunes her parents for 25 for a used surfboard. Russ and Dorothy Lawrence (Arthur O'Connell and Mary LaRoche) grant their daughter's request as an early birthday present and the excited youngster returns to the beach to surf. The gang dubs their female associate \\"Gidget\\", a portmanteau word based on 'girl' and 'midget'.She associates with an all-male surfer gang led by the worldly beach bum, The Big Kahuna (Cliff Robertson). Kahuna, (who's real name is Burt Vail) is a Korean War Air Force veteran twice the age of Frances who was fed up with all the rules he had to live by when he flew combat missions and has dropped out of normal society. He travels the hemisphere surfing with his pet bird. Moondoggie admires Kahuna and wants to emulate him by joining Kahuna in working his way on a freighter to go surfing in Peru at summer's end instead of going off to college as his self-made father planned.Over the next few weeks, Kahuna and Gidget enjoy each other's company with Gidget questioning how he can survive an aimless and lonely existence without a job.

Q:Given the background: Any unused energy in food, whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids, is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. and the situation: Two neighboring villages were living mostly off the land. Boar village was full of fat people, because they would overeat lots of animal products. Leap village was inhabited by vegetarians and vegans.Their food consumption was moderate. Answer the following question: Which village had fewer people with increased risk of type 2 diabetes? A:","completion":"Based on the provided background information and situation, Leap village had fewer people with increased risk of type 2 diabetes as compared to Boar village. The residents of Boar village consistently consumed more food energy than they needed, particularly from animal products. This overconsumption led to the storing of unused energy as fat in their bodies, which in turn resulted in obesity. As stated, obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 30.0 kg/m² or greater, and it increases the risk of health problems, such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The link between obesity and type 2 diabetes is well-established; excess body fat, particularly in the abdominal area, can cause insulin resistance that leads to type 2 diabetes. On the other hand, Leap village had residents who led vegetarian and vegan lifestyles and consumed food in moderate amounts. This dietary choice is less likely to promote obesity, as plant-based diets are high in nutrients and generally lower in calories and saturated fats than animal-based diets. By keeping their food consumption in check, the people of Leap village maintained a healthier BMI and were at a decreased risk of obesity-related health issues like type 2 diabetes. Therefore, due to their healthier and more moderate dietary habits, Leap village had fewer people with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes than Boar village, which had a higher prevalence of obesity because of their over-indulgence in animal products."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Process: - Water comes into contact with something made of iron - The water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid - As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve - Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen - The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together - They form iron oxide, which is rust - Question: suppose the iron will dissolve happens, how will it affect MORE rust forming. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","completion":"A: more When iron dissolves, it leads to a higher propensity for rust formation. Here's a detailed explanation of how and why this occurs: 1. When water comes into contact with iron, a series of chemical reactions begin, as you have described in the process above. The presence of water and carbon dioxide in the air leads to the formation of carbonic acid. 2. The carbonic acid acts as an electrolyte, which allows the iron to dissolve better. As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve into its constituent ions, providing more ions in the solution that can react with water molecules. 3. As water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen, the free oxygen in the presence of the dissolved iron ions will form iron oxide (Fe2O3), which is rust. 4. The higher the concentration of dissolved iron ions in the solution, the greater the chance for the free oxygen to bond with the iron. More dissolved iron means more available ions to react, and consequently, more iron oxide will form. 5. Additionally, the continuous dissolution of iron can expose more iron surface to the chemical reactions, which can further accelerate the corrosion process and lead to more rust formation. In summary, the dissolution of iron increases the availability of iron ions in the solution and exposes a larger surface for further chemical reactions. This leads to a higher likelihood of rust formation, thus resulting in more rust when iron dissolves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: Since grade school we have known about the food pyramid, but the food pyramid I want to discuss today is quite different: The Mediterranean Food Pyramid. The pyramid is used by countless health organizations, clinics, doctors and many others to guide people to eat in a healthy manner. It is the standard to live by and health professionals unanimously agree that by following this diet pyramid, your health will benefit tremendously. The pyramid is a wonderful synopsis of what the Mediterranean Diet entails. It shows four different food groups and the optimal number of servings of each group that should be consumed. The pyramid was created based on research of the diet that the people in the Mediterranean countries consume. The area was selected as the model because of the low incidence of heart disease and high life expectancy found in the region. One of the primary reasons for the healthy results of the diet is that the people not only use fresh, unadulterated ingredients, they also cook their meals in very healthy ways. They are among the minority of the world’s population that have not embraced the fast food culture that dominates the US and Australia. It should be noted that both countries are battling an obesity epidemic. There are no processed foods, colas, white flour products, pizzas or any unhealthy food in the food pyramid. There are only categories of fresh, healthy foods: fruits and vegetables, nuts and grains, beans, fish and seafood, and healthy oils (primarily olive oil) – plus a little red wine. Your fat consumption should be moderate along with consumption of dairy products such as yogurt and cheese. Eggs can be consumed daily. Fish (seafood) is preferred over meat and should be consumed twice a week. Poultry is also preferred over red meat and should be consumed once a week. Red meat should only be consumed 3 to 4 times a month. The rest of the time, vegetables, legumes, and/or pasta should be the focal point of your meals. Fruit and vegetables (7 servings) should be consumed daily. Question: What issue is the author trying to address by promoting the Mediterranean diet? Options: - Fast food culture - consumption of dairy is too high - Obesity epidemic - not enough information === The correct answer is A:","completion":"Obesity epidemic Reasoning: The text provided discusses the benefits of the Mediterranean diet and contrasts it with the fast food culture, particularly in the US and Australia. The author points out that these regions are battling an obesity epidemic, implying that adoption of a Mediterranean diet could potentially help combat this issue.

Here is a question about this article: The X-ray crystal density method is primarily a method for determining the Avogadro constant NA but as the Avogadro constant is related to the Planck constant it also determines a value for h. The principle behind the method is to determine NA as the ratio between the volume of the unit cell of a crystal, measured by X-ray crystallography, and the molar volume of the substance. Crystals of silicon are used, as they are available in high quality and purity by the technology developed for the semiconductor industry. The unit cell volume is calculated from the spacing between two crystal planes referred to as d220. The molar volume Vm(Si) requires a knowledge of the density of the crystal and the atomic weight of the silicon used. The Planck constant is given by What is the answer to this question: Calculating molar volume requires knowledge of what two factors?","completion":"Calculating the molar volume according to the X-ray crystal density method, as described in the given article, requires a comprehensive understanding of two primary factors. 1. Density of the Crystal: The density of the crystal is one of the crucial pieces of information required in determining the molar volume of a substance. In simple terms, density is defined as the measure of mass per unit of volume. It is an important characteristic of the crystal which will significantly affect the final calculation of its molar volume. 2. Atomic Weight of the Silicon: The atomic weight of silicon is the other key factor which must be taken into consideration in order to compute the molar volume effectively. The atomic weight of an element refers to the weighted average mass of atoms of an element in a naturally occurring sample, compared to the carbon-12 isotope. In this case, the atomic weight of silicon becomes a vital attribute for the successful accomplishment of the calculation process. In summary, the calculation of molar volume (Vm(Si)) requires a comprehensive understanding and knowledge of both the density of the crystal and the atomic weight of the silicon used. This understanding, combined with the measurement of the volume of the unit cell of the crystal, facilitates the determination of not only the Avogadro constant (NA) but also the Planck constant (h)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Figure B above shows an important relationship between the wavelength and frequency of a wave. The top wave clearly has a shorter wavelength than the second wave. However, if you picture yourself at a stationary point watching these waves pass by, more waves of the first kind would pass by in a given amount of time. Thus the frequency of the first waves is greater than that of the second waves. Wavelength and frequency are therefore inversely related. As the wavelength of a wave increases, its frequency decreases. The equation that relates the two is Bill is working in a sound studio recording sound effects for a short film that he is working on.

Do the high frequency sounds have a longer or shorter wavelength than the low frequency sounds? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the relationship between wavelength and frequency. According to the given information, wavelength and frequency are inversely related. This means that as the wavelength of a wave increases, its frequency decreases, and vice versa. Step 2: Apply this relationship to the sounds Bill is working with in the sound studio. Bill is editing sounds with both high frequency and low frequency. Based on the inverse relationship established in Step 1, we can analyze the following: - High frequency sounds have shorter wavelengths, because as the frequency increases, the wavelength decreases. - Low frequency sounds have longer wavelengths, because as the frequency decreases, the wavelength increases. Step 3: Answer the question. The high frequency sounds have a shorter wavelength than the low frequency sounds."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Two sister villages, both situated near volcanoes, experience daily earthquakes. Green village started recording an increased size and number of earthquakes one day. Blue village didn't experience a change in the number of earthquakes. Which village had less magma pushing upward into the magma chamber near them? Hint: Earthquakes may take place every day near a volcano. But before an eruption, the number and size of earthquakes increases. This is the result of magma pushing upward into the magma chamber. This motion causes stresses on neighboring rock to build up. Eventually the ground shakes. A continuous string of earthquakes may indicate that a volcano is about to erupt. Scientists use seismographs to record the length and strength of each earthquake. Answer:","completion":"Based on the hint provided, we know that an increase in the number and size of earthquakes near a volcano is the result of magma pushing upward into the magma chamber, causing stresses on neighboring rocks to build up. This can be an indication that a volcano is about to erupt. In the scenario described, Green village has experienced an increased size and number of earthquakes, suggesting that there is more magma pushing upward into the magma chamber near them. On the other hand, Blue village didn't experience a change in the number of earthquakes, implying that there is less magma pushing upward into the magma chamber near them. Therefore, considering the information provided, it can be concluded that Blue village had less magma pushing upward into the magma chamber near them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article with the title: \\"Kony 2012: Viral video tries to take down Uganda militia leader\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Kony 2012: Viral Video Tries to Take Down Uganda Militia Leader Introduction: In 2012, a 30-minute documentary titled \\"Kony 2012\\" took the world by storm, with its powerful message and chilling portrayal of the crimes committed by Ugandan militia leader Joseph Kony. The video, directed by Jason Russell, aimed to raise awareness about Kony's Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and its appalling acts, including kidnap, rape, and murder of innocent children. Through the use of social media, the documentary sought to create awareness and induce global action to extradite Kony and bring an end to his militant reign. Background of Joseph Kony and LRA: Joseph Kony emerged as a self-proclaimed prophet and the leader of the LRA in the late 1980s. Believing that he received messages from spirits, Kony led his followers in a brutal campaign to end oppression and establish a theocratic government in Uganda. Over the years, the LRA's violent tactics escalated, forcing thousands of Ugandans into refugee camps and displacing millions. Kony and the LRA are responsible for abducting an estimated 30,000 children, forcing them to become child soldiers or sex slaves. The Power of Social Media: The release of \\"Kony 2012\\" highlighted the potential of social media in generating awareness and galvanizing global action against human rights abuses. Within days of its release, the video amassed over 100 million views on YouTube and dominated social media platforms, sparking heated conversations about Kony and the atrocities committed by the LRA. The hashtag #StopKony quickly trended worldwide, and celebrities like Oprah Winfrey, Rihanna, and Taylor Swift shared the video, boosting the visibility of the cause. Impact and Criticisms: The massive publicity generated by \\"Kony 2012\\" led to increased international pressure for Kony's arrest and the commitment of resources to combat the LRA. The video prompted the U.S. Congress to pass a resolution supporting efforts to counter the LRA and capture Kony. However, the documentary also faced numerous criticisms, with detractors citing oversimplification of the issue, concerns about the funding and operations of the organization behind the film, and the white-savior narrative. Legacy and Lessons Learned: Despite the controversies, \\"Kony 2012\\" played a significant role in shedding light on the brutalities committed by Joseph Kony and the LRA. While Kony remains at large to this day, the LRA's activities have drastically diminished, and over 13,000 former combatants, abductees, and captives have been freed. The legacy of \\"Kony 2012\\" goes beyond the pursuit of one man. The documentary showcases how powerful storytelling can harness the connectivity of social media to raise awareness of and create momentum for specific global issues. Nevertheless, it also highlights the importance of acknowledging the complexities of such issues and being mindful of potential pitfalls and limitations in advocating for change. In conclusion, \\"Kony 2012\\" represents a milestone in utilizing social media to expose human rights abuses and incite the world to take action. It serves as a poignant reminder that, while we have made significant strides, there is still much work to be done in the fight against human rights violations and the pursuit of justice for those who have suffered at the hands of brutal leaders such as Joseph Kony."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Judge excludes part of email evidence in Rutgers trial NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. – A former Rutgers dorm resident assistant testified on Wednesday in Superior Court that Tyler Clementi appeared \\"uncomfortable\\" and that his voice was \\"a little shaky and quiet\\" when he came to him to request a room change the day before he committed suicide by jumping off the George Washington Bridge. Raahi Grover said Clementi came to his room on the evening of Sept. 21, 2010, with a \\"roommate conflict.\\" Grover said Clementi spoke to him that evening before sending an email on it within about an hour. \\"As an RA, based upon our conversation, I needed to create an incident report. It was something that needed to be explored,\\" said Grover, who said Clementi was the roommate of Dharun Ravi. Ravi is on trial for using a webcam to spy on Clementi, who was gay, and his encounter with another man in their dorm room. Ravi is charged with bias intimidation as a hate crime, along with invasion of privacy and hindering apprehension. He is not being charged in connection with Clementi's death. Evidence rules on \\"hearsay\\" precluded Grover from divulging either the specific contents of Clementi's email or what Clementi told him that night. Tyler Clementi: Killed himself after his roommate allegedly used a webcam to spy on his intimate encounter with another man. Judge Glenn Berman sent the jury out of the room during most of Wednesday morning's session as he heard arguments from attorneys regarding what portions of Clementi's online room change request form and email could be admitted into evidence and presented to the jury. Ravi's attorney, Steven Altman, questioned Grover in an attempt to elicit facts that could bolster his argument to have the email portion and the online request excluded as evidence because, he said, it is hearsay. Hearsay occurs when a witness does not have direct knowledge of a fact asserted but knows it only from being told by someone else. Hearsay statements generally are inadmissible because they cannot be verified first-hand in court, particularly if the person who uttered them or wrote them is unavailble or deceased, as in Clementi's case. Middlesex County First Assistant Prosecutor Julia McClure argued that the email and online room change request form filled out by Grover — who attached Clementi's email to it — should be admitted, in part, as a business record exception to the hearsay rule. Business records are considered more reliable by courts than ordinary statements. Grover said he filled out the report in the course of his role as an RA. Berman said he would allow into evidence portions of the room change request that were written by Grover because he allowed for opinions based on Grover's perception at the time. Berman also allowed in some statements that Grover wrote in the online room change request form, including: \\"Resident came to me to discuss an issue admissible\\" and that Clementi appeared \\"uncomfortable\\" and \\"demands room change ASAP and punishment.\\" Berman then took a brief break before returning with another evidence ruling on Clementi's original email to Grover that ended with: \\"I feel like my privacy has been violated and I am extremely uncomfortable sharing a room with someone who would act in such a wildly inappropriate manner.\\" Berman said he would exclude part of the statement and allow only this statement to be read: \\"I feel like my privacy has been violated and extremely uncomfortable sharing a room with someone who would act in this manner.\\" Berman said he thought the words \\"I feel like my privacy has been violated\\" and \\"I am extremely uncomfortable sharing a room\\" could come into evidence as \\"present sense impression\\" exceptions to the hearsay rule. Berman, however, ruled that the words \\"wildly inappropriate\\" did not describe feelings that were experienced at the time by Clementi but rather described past events and Ravi's actions, which Clementi had time to deliberate on. The words were redacted from the evidence that could be heard by the jury. Under cross-examination by Altman, Grover said that prior to the online room change request and email complaint, Clementi never had come to him to complain. Altman then posed a series of quick questions to Grover: \\"Dharun Ravi never engaged you about how he felt about Tyler Clementi, correct? \\"He never said he didn't like Tyler Clementi, correct? \\"Or that he didn't like gay people? \\"Or that he didn't like Tyler Clementi because he was gay? \\"Did he ever share any thoughts at all about homosexuality? \\"Did you personally ever make an observation of Dharun Ravi interacting with Tyler Clementi to cause you to be concerned? \\"Did you ever make an observation that caused you to think Dharun Ravi was hateful of Tyler Clementi? Grover answered \\"No\\" to each question. It was unclear by lunch break whether a witness known as \\"M.B.\\" would testify for the prosecution later Wednesday. M.B. is the guest Clementi had in his dorm room on Sept. 19 and Sept. 21, when the spying and attempted spying incident are alleged to have occurred. The court is keeping M.B.'s identity anonymous to both the jurors and the public because of victim privacy concerns. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"1.

Art historian Adam Hardy categorizes their building activity into three schools: Ellora, around Badami, Aihole and Pattadakal, and at Sirval near Gulbarga. The Rashtrakuta contributions to art and architecture are reflected in the splendid rock-cut cave temples at Ellora and Elephanta, areas also occupied by Jain monks, located in present-day Maharashtra. The Ellora site was originally part of a complex of 34 Buddhist caves probably created in the first half of the 6th century whose structural details show Pandyan influence. Cave temples occupied by Hindus are from later periods.The Rashtrakutas renovated these Buddhist caves and re-dedicated the rock-cut shrines. Amoghavarsha I espoused Jainism and there are five Jain cave temples at Ellora ascribed to his period. The most extensive and sumptuous of the Rashtrakuta works at Ellora is their creation of the monolithic Kailasanath Temple, a splendid achievement confirming the \\"Balhara\\" status as \\"one among the four principal Kings of the world\\". The walls of the temple have marvellous sculptures from Hindu mythology including Ravana, Shiva and Parvathi while the ceilings have paintings. The Kailasanath Temple project was commissioned by King Krishna I after the Rashtrakuta rule had spread into South India from the Deccan. The architectural style used is Karnata Dravida according to Adam Hardy. It does not contain any of the Shikharas common to the Nagara style and was built on the same lines as the Virupaksha temple at Pattadakal in Karnataka. According to art historian Vincent Smith, the achievement at the Kailasanath temple is considered an architectural consummation of the monolithic rock-cut temple and deserves to be considered one of the wonders of the world. According to art historian Percy Brown, as an accomplishment of art, the Kailasanath temple is considered an unrivalled work of rock architecture, a monument that has always excited and astonished travellers.While some... answer the following question: What was the last name of the art historian who stated that the Kailasanath temple is considered an unrivalled work of rock architecture?","completion":"The last name of the art historian who stated that the Kailasanath temple is considered an unrivalled work of rock architecture is Brown."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Carolyn Hax: Must I really indulge my ‘psychic’ sister-in-law? Adapted from an online discussion. Dear Carolyn: My husband’s sister “Beth” fancies herself a psychic of sorts who can communicate with the beyond. A few months ago, we were eating dinner when she began talking about a spirit with me. I honestly had no idea who she was talking about and told her that, because I had no deceased relatives or friends who fit her description. Beth became very upset, claiming that she was overwhelmed with what the spirit was trying to tell her. She was so upset she ran from the room to lie in a dark room and compose herself. My in-laws asked me to be gentler with her, since this “gift” is a major part of her identity. I see two paths. I can either lie to Beth and feed her belief that she has this “gift.” Or I can tell her she is dead wrong. Which makes me feel like I’m kicking a puppy. My husband and I would ideally like to handle Beth’s “gift” in a thoughtful way, but it’s hard to see what middle ground we have, especially when she puts you on the spot. How can I thoughtfully respond to Beth in a way that preserves her self-worth but also doesn’t give in to a delusion? I See Dead People: Please, make my month and tell me she looks like Sybill Trelawney in the Harry Potter movies. It’s not your place to tell Beth she’s “dead wrong” or push her to conform to your idea of non-delusional; skepticism is a lot less arrogant than certainty. It’s also not your place to indulge Beth as though you believe what she’s saying when you secretly think it’s a crock. If you can summon a non-mocking “Why not?” attitude and go along with the possibilities, then, great, that’s ideal. Otherwise I suggest: “Wow, interesting — no one comes to mind but I’ll try to figure it out.” Even as I type this, I have the phrase “No one’s doing Beth any favors here” clanging in my head, but that’s why I advise remaining kindly neutral. Take no sides and let her sort it out. That includes not biting when the in-laws try to draw you into anything deeper than a kind, non-committal response to Beth’s gift or “gift.” And think of it this way: Wherever you believe the stories come from, Beth is a storyteller, and surely we’ve all been to dinners that could have used one of those. (If my kids were reading this, they’d say, “Thanks, but don’t call me Shirley.”) Re: Beth: I think I would stop at “Wow, interesting,” unless I really were going to try to figure it out. If Beth continues, depending on what she says, there’s also “Hmm, doesn’t ring a bell,” and “I’ll give that some thought” (if Beth says that the spirit is giving advice or a warning), and just “Hmm.” There really is a lot of middle ground; most of it consists of neutral responses and looking for opportunities to change the subject.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Now, I have a new situation: Phillip just came home to his apartment after taking a long, vigorous bike ride. He enters the front door to find his roommate, Brandon, sitting on the couch playing videogames and eating potato chips. Phillip tells Brandon that if he keeps being so lazy and snacking so much he's going to start looking chubby. Brandon just waves Phillip off and goes back to his game. Answer this question please: Are Brandon's cardiac muscles increasing or decreasing in strength? A:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, when exercising, such as running or biking, the heart works harder and pumps more blood, leading to an increase in cardiac muscle strength and efficiency. In the given situation, Phillip has just taken a vigorous bike ride, so his cardiac muscles are likely increasing in strength. However, Brandon is sitting on the couch, playing video games, and eating potato chips, which suggests that he is not participating in any physical activity that would strengthen his cardiac muscles. Therefore, we can conclude that Brandon's cardiac muscles are not increasing in strength at the moment. As for whether they are decreasing in strength, that would depend on the overall level of exercise and physical activity he engages in over time, as well as his general health habits. If Brandon regularly leads a sedentary lifestyle and doesn't use his muscles, they may get weaker over time according to the \\"use it or lose it\\" principle from the background information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: The app shows users when it's safe to have unprotected sex (a green day) or when other contraceptive methods such as condoms should be used (a red day) thanks to body temperature readings -- after ovulation a rise in progesterone makes women's bodies up to 0.8 Fahrenheit higher than usual. The app helps women both plan and prevent pregnancy, and has proven just as effective for those with irregular periods, or those who have just come off other cycle-disrupting forms of contraception, such as the pill or injections. Natural Cycles was the first app to be approved as a form of contraception in the EU, and the company has made no secret of its plans to win certification worldwide. Getting FDA approval for use in the US would be a significant milestone. In August this year The Verge published an article examining Natural Cycles' position in the mobile health space, noting that its published research to date didn't yet meet contraceptive efficacy standards. This new study moves the goalposts, meaning that the FDA could approve a fertility app sooner than expected, and when it does, it will very likely be this one. ||||| The FDA on Friday cleared the first-ever app to prevent pregnancy — but not everyone is convinced it works. The app, Natural Cycles, isn’t your typical form of contraception. It asks women to take their temperature upon waking and keep a daily log in its interface. It uses that data to help women keep track of when they’re ovulating. The FDA cleared the app as a medical device, using a regulatory pathway reserved for low-to-moderate risk devices. advertisement According to the FDA’s press release, the app’s typical-use failure rate was about 6.5 percent in large-scale clinical trials — far better than the reported 24 percent typical failure rate of “fertility awareness,” commonly known as the “rhythm method.” The typical-use failure rate of the birth control pill is about 9 percent, according to the CDC. A hormonal IUD has a failure rate of less than 1 percent, while condoms alone have a typical-use failure rate of 18 percent. “Consumers are increasingly using digital health technologies to inform their everyday health decisions, and this new app can provide an effective method of contraception if it’s used carefully and correctly,” Terri Cornelison, the assistant director for the health of women in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, stated in a press release. Natural Cycles got European clearance in February 2017. But in January, the Swedish Medical Products Agency announced it was investigating the app after reports that 37 women in one Swedish clinic who were using the app had become pregnant accidentally. One woman wrote about her own experiences in The Guardian in July. Some people have expressed concerns via social media that basal temperature, estimated by taking the measurement immediately after waking, may be an unreliable metric to use. Both the app @NaturalCycles and the EU should know better. You DO NOT launch an app that tracks female fertility based *solely* on basal temperature and you certainly DO NOT approve it as a method of contraception. This is so utterly irresponsible. — Anna Rascouët-Paz (@rascouet) July 25, 2018 Dr. Juan Acuna, an OB-GYN specialist at Florida International University and one of Natural Cycle’s scientific advisers, said “the whole realm of natural contraception has always been deemed as not being one of the safest.” Monitoring ovulation properly relies on multiple measurements over a long time — and even then, stress and other factors affect the data. The app, he said, makes otherwise difficult calculations simpler. All forms of birth control come with at least a small risk of failure. “During the first two or three or four months, you need to use two methods,” he said. And even Acuna noted that basal temperature isn’t the best possible way to predict fertility. “The gold standard [to measure ovulation] is ultrasound,” Acuna noted. “It might not be the safest form of data, but when you balance the pros and cons, all in all, of doing other tests and the cumbersome process of measuring cervical mucus characteristics, then body temperature is still a good measurement to take.” This app’s clearance also means that future contraceptive apps will be able to go through a different, simpler process — albeit with some special considerations. Now that one app is on the market, any other app that is substantially similar will be able to go through the FDA’s 510(k) medical device marketing notification procedure. But they must meet the agency’s new “special controls” — criteria that the agency says will “provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for apps used for contraception.” The FDA didn’t immediately comment on what those criteria would include. The FDA also on Friday approved a contraceptive vaginal ring that can be used for a full year. ||||| CLOSE An app that claims to help women track their fertility just cleared a hurdle from the FDA. USA TODAY A screenshot of the mobile app Natural Cycles. (Photo: Natural Cycles) The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved marketing for a smartphone app claiming to help prevent pregnancy. Stockholm-based Natural Cycles bills itself as a contraception app leaning on fertility awareness, where a woman tracks the days when she is fertile based on body temperature readings and the timing of her menstrual cycle. The app requires women who use it to check their temperature daily using a basal body thermometer. The app groups days as either green or red. During red days, users are advised to avoid sex or use protection such as a condom. \\"Consumers are increasingly using digital health technologies to inform their everyday health decisions, and this new app can provide an effective method of contraception if it’s used carefully and correctly,\\" said Terri Cornelison, assistant director for the health of women in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, in a statement Friday. According to the Natural Cycles website, the app has proven to be 93 percent effective at preventing unwanted pregnancies. Aug. 8: Boxers or briefs? Men who wore boxers had higher sperm counts, study says Cornelison also warns despite the high effectiveness rate, Natural Cycles isn't a foolproof solution. \\"Women should know that no form of contraception works perfectly, so an unplanned pregnancy could still result from correct usage of this device.\\" Questions have been raised over whether this app is as effective in preventing pregnancy as its makers claim. The U.K.-based Advertising Standards Authority announced in June it was launching an investigation into Natural Cycles after reports women became pregnant while using it, reports the Guardian. In January, the app faced investigation from Swedish medical authorities after 37 women who used the app became pregnant, reports The Verge. Follow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23 Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2nqDXET ||||| The Advertising Standards Authority has launched a formal investigation into marketing for a Swedish app that claims to be an effective method of contraception, after reports that women have become pregnant while using it. An ASA spokesman said it had received three complaints about Natural Cycles and its paid advertising on Facebook, which describes the app as highly accurate contraception that has been clinically tested. “We would require robust substantiation from any company to support such a claim,” he said. A spokesperson for Natural Cycles confirmed the investigation, but said it related to a 2017 ad and that it had accepted the ASA’s draft recommendations. Natural Cycles is also being investigated in Sweden by the Medical Products Agency after it emerged that of 668 women who sought an abortion at a Stockholm hospital between September and December last year, 37 had been using the app for birth control. The UK statistics are unknown, but one user wrote in the Guardian that she had become pregnant and had an abortion after relying on the app to indicate the days when she could not conceive. The Family Planning Association is also concerned about the app. A spokeswoman said: “The use of the word ‘certified’ suggests that there is independent evidence supporting these claims, whereas in fact the only evidence is from the company itself. It has amassed a vast database, which is very interesting, but that is not the same as verified independent evidence. “Many other apps focus on getting to know your own body, but Natural Cycles is specifically targeting itself as a contraceptive, which is concerning.” The app’s promotion as a natural means of birth control was attractive to many women worried about taking hormones, but the association’s concern was that a generation which has come to believe there is an app for everything may be over-reliant on it without realising how motivated and disciplined users have to be to make it effective, she said. Women are turning to birth control smartphone apps for a reason | Dawn Foster Read more The app was developed by two scientists from Sweden and Austria: Elina Berglund, who worked at the Cern laboratory in Geneva on the discovery of the Higgs Boson particle, and Raoul Scherwitzl. The married couple originally devised the algorithm for their own family planning, and now both work full time for the company they founded. They claim to have 600,000 users worldwide, who pay an annual subscription. Users monitor their fertility with the app by taking their temperature each morning. It tracks the results to detect ovulation, and advises which days are safe or unsafe to have unprotected sex without the risk of conception. The app relies on users taking their temperature at around the same time every morning, and cautions: “Remember that you must always measure as soon as you wake up before you snooze, sit/get up, or check your phone.” The Facebook page is full of tributes from users, and one woman has posted the launch of a petition against any possibility of the app being banned in Sweden following the Medical Product Agency’s investigation. A spokeswoman for Natural Cycles said: “We are in contact with the ASA and, since the investigation is ongoing, it would not be appropriate for us to speculate on the outcome. “We can confirm however, that the ASA complaint in relation to the Facebook advertisement in question was actually raised in 2017. The advertisement which only ran for a few weeks has been taken out of circulation and we have accepted the draft recommendations very recently shared with us by the ASA.” ||||| Sweden’s medical regulator says it is continuing to investigate the contraceptive app Natural Cycles over 37 unintended pregnancies, despite claims from Natural Cycles that the company is “all clear” following the investigation. The Medical Products Agency (MPA) says reports that the investigation has closed are incorrect. Natural Cycles, the contraceptive app that is certified in the EU as a form of birth control, was hit with a complaint earlier this month after Södersjukhuset hospital in Stockholm reported the app to the MPA. Thirty-seven women had visited the hospital for abortions after becoming pregnant while using the app. Earlier today, Natural Cycles put out a statement saying it was “all clear” after the closure of investigations into each pregnancy. “This proves that we have acted according to regulations regarding contraception, both when it comes to the actual product, but also the way we market it,” said co-founder and CEO Raoul Scherwitzl in the statement. But the regulator says while it's closed the first part of the investigation, it’s now moving on to the next step. “Now the investigation goes on to the next step, which means that we collect information to be able to decide if any action is needed.” The MPA’s manager, Ewa-Lena Hartman, said the investigation of Natural Cycles is ongoing. “The MPA has decided to escalate the ongoing market surveillance investigation to review parts of the documentation that was compiled as a justification for the CE mark certification issued by a third party,” Hartman said in an emailed statement to The Verge. The MPA said it had completed the first phase of the investigation and will collect more information and ask Natural Cycles for its clinical data, risk analysis, and aftermarket control. That information will be used to determine any shortcomings in the product, or how the manufacturer can follow up the product’s information and use. “The result of our investigation will form a base for a decision if further action is needed related to the contraception app placed on the EU market,” Hartman said. In an email to The Verge, Natural Cycles said it did not claim the investigation had ended: Yes, we agree with the MPA, we have not claimed otherwise. The Medical Products Agency has decided that all reports concerning Natural Cycles will be transitioned to trend reporting, in order to continuously monitor and report any unintentional pregnancies given the spread of the popular contraception app. Natural Cycles welcomes further data from the public to strengthen our clinical studies and aftermarket follow-up, [sic] why our open case at the Medical Products Agency is important to us. Natural Cycles’ original statement implied that no investigation was continuing. Natural Cycles says its app is 93 percent effective at typical use. The company also states that as more people start to use a contraceptive, more unplanned pregnancies would be linked to that contraceptive. Natural Cycles says it’s experienced a boom in users in the last year, with the number of UK women using the app soaring from 5,000 to 125,000. The company has over 600,000 users worldwide. Moving forward, Natural Cycles said it will work together with the MPA on trend reporting to monitor rates of unintended pregnancies. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Natural Cycles, a mobile app, can help women learn about their bodies to know the best times they can have safe, unprotected cuddle time without having a baby.

In an interview for the December issue of InStyle, Farrell said he “nearly broke in half” when James, now 9, took his first steps. “We share in the smallest victories; the first words at age six or seven, being able to feed oneself at 19, and getting the seizures under control,” he said. “When James took his first steps at age four, I nearly broke in half!” Angelman Syndrome is characterized by seizures, jerky movements, sleeping problems, and developmental disability. The seizures can be treated, but there’s no cure for the disease. For the first years of James’ life, Farrell and Kim Bordenave, James’ mother, coped in private. “It was at the Special Olympics in Shanghai in 2007 that I decided, after consulting with James’ mother, that I wanted to talk publicly about the pride and joy I had in our son,” he said. He has enriched my life, but I don’t want to minimize the trials that so many families go through; the fear, consternation, frustration, and pain.” Farrell now works with the Foundation for Angelman Syndrome (FAST) to raise awareness and empower other families affected by the disorder. “When you’re the parent of a child with special needs, it’s important to feel that you’re not alone,” he said.

Analyze the offensive formation: Before the play starts, observe the receiver's stance, alignment, and positioning. This will help you anticipate potential routes and make necessary adjustments. 2. Maintain good footwork: As a cornerback, footwork is crucial for covering your assigned receiver. Focus on maintaining balance and staying on the balls of your feet, ready to change directions quickly. 3. Keep your eyes on the receiver: While it's important to pay attention to the quarterback and other offensive players, your primary responsibility is the receiver. Watch his movements and use your peripheral vision to stay aware of the rest of the field. 4. React quickly: Once the ball is snapped, read the receiver's route and react accordingly. If he breaks for a short pass, immediately close the gap and prepare to make a play on the ball. If he goes for a deep route, be ready to turn and sprint alongside him. 5. Maintain proper positioning: As the cornerback, it is your job to prevent your assigned receiver from catching the ball. Always try to stay between the receiver and the quarterback, cutting off any passing lanes and being prepared to deflect or intercept passes. 6. Communicate with your teammates: As a cornerback, it's essential to communicate with your fellow defensive players. Let your teammates know if you need help in coverage, or if you see something the offense might be planning. Good communication can lead to more successful defensive plays. 7. Tackle effectively: When the receiver catches the ball, it's your responsibility to bring him down. Maintain proper tackling form by wrapping up the receiver, keeping your head up, and driving through with your legs until the play is over."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Would the following sentence, by the strictest standards, be considered correct by a linguist? The man who ordered ice cream said the pudding would be tasty.","completion":"To determine if the given sentence is considered correct by the strictest standards, we'll analyze it step-by-step. 1. Sentence structure: The sentence is a complex sentence, consisting of a main clause (\\"The man... said\\") and a relative dependent clause (\\"who ordered ice cream\\"). Complex sentences are grammatically correct forms. 2. Subject-verb agreement: The main subject \\"the man\\" agrees with its verb \\"said\\", and the subject \\"the pudding\\" agrees with its verb \\"would be\\". All subjects and verbs have proper agreement. 3. Use of relative pronouns: The relative pronoun \\"who\\" is used correctly here, referring to a human antecedent (\\"the man\\") and beginning an adjective clause that describes the main subject. 4. Word order: The word order is correct, following the subject-verb-object (SVO) pattern common in English sentences. 5. Punctuation: The sentence contains no punctuation errors. Although it's a complex sentence, no commas are needed since the relative clause is provided as essential information. 6. Verb tenses: The verb \\"said\\" is in the simple past, and \\"would be\\" is in the future conditional, which is appropriate for reporting what someone has said about a future event. 7. Diction: The words chosen in the sentence are appropriate and convey clear meaning.

Q: Quinn got a puppy, she let it outside a lot. Given the question \\"How would Quinn feel about her puppy?\\", is \\"pessimistic and hopeful\\" a valid answer? A:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the context of the question. The question is asking how Quinn feels about her puppy. She let the puppy outside a lot, which means she trusts the puppy and allows it to have some freedom. Step 2: Analyze the given answer. The given answer is \\"pessimistic and hopeful.\\" These are two conflicting emotions and it is important to determine if they make sense in the given context. Step 3: Evaluate the emotions in the context. - Pessimistic: This describes a negative outlook, expecting the worst in situations. This emotion doesn't fit the context since Quinn seems to trust her puppy enough to let it outside frequently. - Hopeful: This describes a positive outlook, expecting or hoping for a good outcome. This emotion could make sense in the context since Quinn might have a positive outlook on her puppy's growth and development. Step 4: Determine the validity of the answer. As the given answer contains conflicting emotions and only one emotion (hopeful) fits the context, \\"pessimistic and hopeful\\" is not a valid answer. A more valid answer could be \\"Quinn feels trusting and hopeful about her puppy,\\" since she allows the puppy to have freedom outside and might have a positive outlook on its growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets. Given that these planets have no names, the explorers decide to name them after themselves. The planet of Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift. Many of the continents on the planet are currently breaking apart and moving. Timon, however, has been a stable planet with no continental moving for quite awhile now. and a hint : At the end of the Proterozoic, the supercontinent Pannotia had broken apart into the smaller continents Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia and Gondwana. During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416–359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana. Please answer this question : Which planet is currently making less oceanic crust? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, the planet Timon is currently making less oceanic crust. This is because Timon has been a stable planet with no continental moving for quite a while now. In contrast, the planet Sarahn is going through a large geographic shift, with continents breaking apart and moving. As mentioned in the hint, during periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity, leading to rising sea levels. Since Sarahn is experiencing these geographic shifts and Timon is not, it can be concluded that Timon is currently making less oceanic crust."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: It may seem as though the 2020 U.S. presidential election is a long way off. But good luck telling that to President Donald Trump or a dozen or so Democrats contemplating a White House bid two years from now. Trump has already been out on the campaign trail testing themes for his expected re-election bid. \\"Our new slogan for 2020. Do you know what it is? Keep America great!\\" Trump told cheering supporters at a recent rally in Elkhart, Indiana. But Trump also made it clear he is concerned about this year's congressional midterm elections, in which opposition Democrats are favored to make gains. \\"And all of the great momentum that we are having as a country on jobs, on safety, on security, on our military — it is all at stake in November,\\" Trump warned at the Indiana rally. 2020 is expected to produce a bumper crop of Democratic presidential contenders who will vie for their party's nomination. Those in the group range from the well-known like former Vice President Joe Biden and 2016 contender Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to a younger, less recognizable contingent that includes California Senator Kamala Harris and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Several potential Democratic presidential contenders spoke about the party's future at a recent conference in Washington hosted by the Center for American Progress, a Democratic-leaning public policy institute in Washington. Among the speakers was Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who said Democrats face an uphill battle to win back control of Congress this year because of long-standing Republican advantages in winning a majority in the House of Representatives. \\"We can't climb that hill by ignoring the millions of Americans who are angry and scared about the damage this president and this Republican Party have done to our democracy,\\" Warren told the conference to a round of applause. \\"We can't ignore it and we shouldn't want to ignore it.\\" The democrats probably believe - they will have to campaign hard - they will have a good candidate - they will hove trouble making a decision as to which candidate - not enough information Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, the Democrats likely believe that: 1.

Here are possible answers to this question: - carriage - armored car - trenches - tent - battlefield I believe the correct choice is \\"armored car\\", here's why: The answer is:","completion":"Armored car, and here's a detailed explanation behind this choice: A soldier's typical travel method is determined by several factors, including their mission, role, and the environment in which they operate. Considering these factors, the options provided can be evaluated in terms of appropriateness, practicality, and feasibility. 1. Carriage: Historically, carriages were used for moving soldiers before the invention of modern vehicles. A carriage, however, is no longer a suitable or efficient form of transportation for a soldier due to its slow speed, vulnerability, and outdated design. 2. Armored car: An armored car is a vehicle specifically designed for military use, offering protection, speed, and mobility for soldiers. It is equipped with armor plating, a powerful engine, and often has a mounted weapon system. These vehicles are designed to withstand gunfire, explosions, and other forms of attack, making them a far safer mode of transportation for soldiers in hazardous situations or while on combat missions. The combination of safety, speed, and capabilities make the armored car the correct answer to this question. 3. Trenches: Trenches are not a form of transportation, but rather a defensive strategy in warfare. Soldiers dig trenches to provide cover and protection from enemy fire, and to serve as a frontline base of operations. While trenches played a significant role in World War I, they are not applicable to the question of how a soldier is likely to travel. 4. Tent: A tent is a temporary shelter used by soldiers in the field, especially during extended missions or when proper facilities are not available. As tents are meant for accommodation, not transportation, this option is not relevant to the question at hand. 5. Battlefield: A battlefield represents the location where military engagements occur between opposing forces. While soldiers may move within a battlefield during combat, it does not provide a mode of transportation for them. Therefore, considering the various factors that determine a soldier's method of travel, the option of \\"armored car\\" is the most appropriate, practical, and feasible choice among the provided alternatives. This vehicle ensures that soldiers can move efficiently, safely, and swiftly, regardless of the challenges presented by their mission or environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When you turn the curds out onto your cutting board, they should be semi-solid. The texture will resemble that of jelly or gelatin. Return the sliced curds to the dried, empty stockpot. Cover well with the lid or with aluminum foil. The water should be about 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.8 degrees Celsius). Make sure that the basin or sink is at least as deep as your stockpot, and fill it 1/2 to 2/3 full so that the part of the stockpot where the cheese rests will be completely submerged. Place the stockpot in the basin, making sure that the water does not reach the lid or seep into the pot itself. The curds need to be kept at a consistent temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius) for 2 hours. Refresh the water, if needed, to keep the contents of the stockpot hot. Turn the slices of cheese curd every 15 minutes. This process is known as \\"cheddaring,\\" and it is thanks to this process that cheddar cheese has its trademark flavor.

QUEBEC CITY — Emotions were on display when U.S. President Donald Trump met other G-7 leaders at their annual summit in Canada on Friday, but the discussions were civilized and diplomatic, according to sources. Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). She said Canada, however, will not change its mind about the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs which she termed “illegal.” Trump imposed the tariffs on the grounds that weak domestic industries could affect U.S. national security.

Area was closed at night after earlier attack on seals by two women. Incidents were all captured on round-the-clock 'Seal Cam' Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: La Jolla 'Children's Pool' Seals Face Harassment from Ill-intentioned Individuals Introduction: Wildlife advocates and local residents are infuriated and concerned after two separate incidents of human harassment towards seals in La Jolla's \\"Children's Pool\\" this week. The documented cases have put the seal sanctuary into the spotlight, reigniting the debate on human interaction with these protected animals. Both incidents were captured on video and have since gone viral online – calling for awareness and better enforcement of laws protecting the seals. Incident 1 - Three Men Harassing Seals: The first of the two incidents involved a group of three men who were seen on the “Seal Cam” not only entering the restricted area after hours but also harassing the resident seals. Frightened by the men's unexpected presence and intrusions, the seals began a hurried retreat towards the water. This type of behavior is particularly dangerous for the seals, as it can lead to physical injury and stress among the colony. The three men continued their disruptive and aggressive behavior for several minutes, until they were finally chased away by an on-site volunteer. Police are currently reviewing the videos capturing the event to identify the individuals and take necessary legal action. Incident 2 - Two Women Attacking Seals: In a separate incident, two women managed to enter the Children's Pool area at night, when the area was closed to the public due to an earlier attack on the seals. Ill-intentioned, the women instigated another instance of harassment towards the helpless animals. The Seal Cam operators forwarded the video to the authorities in hopes of tracking down the culprits and preventing any future incidents. Reactions from Local Community: The response from La Jolla’s community has been one of outrage and disappointment – both at the individuals involved in the harassment and at the lack of preventative measures in place. Local residents and wildlife activists are calling upon the city and the California Coastal Commission to enforce stricter regulations towards human interaction with the seals, as well as to promote awareness of the effects of these disturbances on the marine mammals. Future Measures and Conclusion: In light of these events, local volunteers are stepping up their patrols of the Children's Pool area, determined to protect the seals from all future threats. It is clear that these experiences have taken a toll on the beloved seal colony – both emotionally and physically – and it is up to the conscientious efforts of the community and authorities to ensure that such incidents do not recur. By acting together, we can guarantee a safe and prosperous sanctuary for the seals of the La Jolla Children's Pool."},{"prompt":"Question: What would you be if you comfort friend?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: This was one the polls got right. Heading into Ohio, various surveys showed the race there as a statistical tie, and it did not disappoint:Mitt Romney won, but just narrowly, over Rick Santorum, by a single percentage point. Text Size - + reset Winners & Losers in 60 seconds And that wasn’t even the whole Super Tuesday story. Here are POLITICO’s five takeaways from the 10-state political extravaganza: 1. Win, no bounce, repeat, continued It’s better to win ugly than to lose pretty, especially in a key fall battleground state like Ohio. But the victory that Mitt Romney eked out Tuesday night over Rick Santorum in Ohio was far closer than his campaign would have liked. With six states captured on the night — Alaska, Idaho, Massachusetts, Ohio, Vermont and Virginia — the front-runner is poised to take a majority of the 437 delegates up for grabs on Super Tuesday. He remains the delegate leader, and he scored big in Massachusetts, Virginia and Idaho on that front. (See also: 2012 delegate tracker) And yet. Romney, as we’ve written before, is likely heading into another bounce-free news cycle. The former Massachusetts governor’s campaign and its backers had hoped to use a strong night to start making the case that it’s time to wind this down, and his election night speech, delivered from Boston, was supposed to convey the aura of a nominee-in-waiting. But in the end, he underperformed. He does not head into Wednesday with the spin on his side, and his campaign has done little to finesse expectations throughout this race. The muddled results Tuesday — Romney’s cache of victories, Newt Gingrich’s win in Georgia and Santorum’s surprisingly strong clinch in Tennessee accompanied by wins in Oklahoma and North Dakota — are going to do little to bring an immediate end to the primary. The Ohio exit polls showed Romney is still struggling with working-class voters and evangelicals, as well as “very conservative” voters. He and his supporting super PAC also outspent Santorum 4 to 1 for a win of less than 15,000 votes. Losing Tennessee by a wide margin, after his campaign had hoped he would be competitive there, was also a blow: Had he taken the state, he could have essentially argued that, coupled with his Ohio win, the race was effectively over. But he continues to have trouble in the South, traditional Republican territory. Romney now heads into a less-than-friendly patch of contests, with Kansas, Alabama and Mississippi up in the next week. That’s going to be a tough narrative for him to overcome. Worse, it will generate ongoing headlines about a failure to close the deal, even though most people — a majority of primary voters — agree that Romney is the eventual nominee. ||||| Mitt Romney’s margins in Michigan and Ohio — the Associated Press has called Ohio for Mr. Romney, although The New York Times has not yet – weren’t much different from one another: 3.2 percentage points in the former state, and 1.0 percentage points in the latter. But the benefit of winning a state is mostly symbolic, especially in a state like Ohio which divides most of its delegates by Congressional district and the remainder proportionately. And the aesthetics of Ohio and Michigan were much different, although for somewhat arbitrary reasons. Michigan counted its vote very quickly, and Mr. Romney led almost the whole way along — often by slightly larger than the 3.2 point margin that he wound up with. Ohio counted its vote slowly, and Mr. Romney trailed for most of the evening, sometimes by as many as 3 or 4 points. In Michigan, Mr. Romney’s win came by a slightly larger margin than polls expected, but the difference was in well within most survey’s margin of error. In Ohio, Mr. Romney leads by a slightly smaller margin than some polls called for, but the polling average was nevertheless very close. Mr. Romney’s narrow win in Michigan came at a time when his campaign seemed to be struggling. His probable win in Ohio came when he seemed to have the momentum and expectations were higher. In Michigan, there was nothing else to look at except for that state’s results — that and Arizona, where Mr. Romney did very well. But on Tuesday night, Mr. Romney had lost four other states by the time that the A.P. called Ohio, changing the context that Ohio was viewed in. Should any of this matter? In my view, it probably shouldn’t. In fact, I tend to find Mr. Romney’s one-point lead in Ohio more impressive than his three-point win in Michigan since the latter was his home state — something that is probably worth at least several points to him. But, factors like these do affect the way that the results are reported upon and can therefore affect the momentum of the race, for better or for worse. — NATE SILVER ||||| John GilmoreArchive-It Partner Since: Apr, 2007Organization Type: Other InstitutionsOrganization URL: http://www.toad.com John Gilmore is a private individual who cares about archiving the Internet for future generations.

Yes, it was. 1) Mitt Romney has the same rural problem that Barack Obama does. Here's the map of Ohio from last night's primary. Here's the map from 2008, an unusually good Democratic year. Both candidates figured out a pretty simple lesson: Get more votes where people live, don't lose too many votes where people don't. But a county map of the primary so far, even if it excludes Missouri, reveals only urban and suburban areas breaking for Romney. The rural areas that build up any eventual nominee's margin -- all for the other guys. 2) Ron Paul has hit his ceiling. The pre-Tuesday campaign schedule for the Paul campaign pointed reporters to the states where he might win. Idaho's low-attendence caucus. Alaska's low-attendence caucus. North Dakota's low-attendence caucus, where Paul spent election night. In Alaska, where Paul got 2,004 caucus votes in 2008, he drew more than 1,000 to two stump speeches. He had the state to himself. And... he edged up to 3,175 votes, coming in third place. Yes, the \\"win\\"-driven coverage of the primary is a little silly. Paul won delegates in all of yesterday's caucus states, Vermont, and Virgina. But he's now averaged around 11 percent of the vote in primaries and 21 percent and caucuses. As he stays in, and as, in April, we move to a winner-take-all process, he's hitting the natural limits of his support. In Missouri, Santorum could win a one-on-one beauty contest with Romney, with Paul taking votes on the side. In Virginia, Paul could only win 40 percent and one district. 3) Newt Gingrich owns the deep south. He won all but three counties in Georgia, just as he'd won all but three counties in South Carolina. When Florida voted, he won all but three counties in the panhandle, losing two of them (Oskaloosa and Bay) by less than 100 votes. This is one of Mitt Romney's best prospects for March: Gingrich is in a good position to win Alabama and Mississippi next week, further muddling the \\"Santorum, conservative champion!\\" story. 4) Mitt Romney's a good closer. The frontrunner's strategy from state to state looks a bit like Galactus's strategy for planet-devouring: Move in, absorb everything. Restore Our Future is his Silver Surfer, softening up the terrain and warning of doom. So in Tennessee, Romney spent money late, made one appearance, and won voters who decided in the last few days, 30-28 -- he lost the state overall, 37-28. In Ohio, where he defeated Rick Santorum by one point, he won last-few-day-voters 43-37. But Santorum had once led by around 10 points in an average of polls. When Romney needs to dispatch Santorum, or he needs to cut into his delegate advantage -- as long as Newt Gingrich is in the race, he can do it. 5) Caucuses reveal that the base is cold on Romney. Here are four numbers: 37%, 45%, 60%, 41%. Here are four more: 24%, 32%, 35%, 17%. Those are the numbers for Rommey, respectively, from the 2008 caucuses in North Dakota, Alaska, Colorado, and Minnesota, and from the 2012 caucuses in the same states. ||||| Republican presidential candidate Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, takes in the applause of the crowd as he address a crowd during the North Dakota caucus Tuesday, March 6, 2012, in Fargo, N.D. (AP Photo/Charles... (Associated Press) Republicans in 10 states weighed in on the GOP presidential nomination race in its busiest day yet. Mitt Romney won six states, Rick Santorum clinched three and Newt Gingrich prevailed in one. And along the way, clues were gleaned from the results about the path ahead. A look at what we learned: ___ REPUBLICANS AREN'T HOT ON ANYONE It's almost like a bad version of Goldilocks. Nobody is just right. Listen to voters _ in person and in exit polls _ and it's pretty clear Republicans aren't all that hot on any of the candidates. Only in three states did most people say they strongly supported the contender they backed, nowhere reaching 6 in 10. In the four other states where polling was conducted Tuesday, less than half expressed that degree of support for their candidate. Even so, Republicans will eventually support the nominee. They always do. Just look at how the grumbling over John McCain faded four years ago when voters were given the choice of begrudgingly supporting the Arizona senator _ seen as a moderate _ or backing Barack Obama. ___ GINGRICH ISN'T DEAD But that doesn't mean he can fully come back a third time. Until Tuesday, the former House speaker hadn't won since South Carolina on Jan. 21. He had declared Georgia a must-win state and essentially camped out there for the past week. Gingrich, who represented Georgia for years in the U.S. House, made the state his firewall in hopes of winning a rationale to continue his bid. It worked. At least for the moment. \\"The media said, \`Oh, I guess this is over, finally,'\\" Gingrich told supporters. \\"But you all said no.\\" Now the question is whether his backers open their wallets to prove he can compete. Underscoring the urgency, ally Herman Cain was soliciting donations even before Gingrich had gone to bed. ___ ORGANIZATION MATTERS Unless it doesn't. On one hand, Santorum should have been embarrassed in Ohio. His shoestring, scattershot campaign didn't collect enough signatures to appear on the ballot in the Steubenville area, a rural, conservative part of the state where his message on social issues _ and his kinship with a region that neighbors his home state of Pennsylvania _ should have given him an advantage. And that meant he ceded delegates from that region. Yet, Santorum still managed to make it a close race with Romney, and he won at least some delegates. And Romney just eked out a win, not the decisive victory he had sought. The results wouldn't force Santorum from the campaign. If anything, Santorum's almost-win _ with scant organization _ foreshadows problems for Romney in contests ahead. ___ RICH PEOPLE LIKE ROMNEY Got money? Chances are, you voted for Romney. In the seven states that had exit polls, Romney _ a millionaire many times over who has struggled to connect with working-class voters _ was the preferred candidate of the wealthiest voters. In Ohio and Tennessee, Romney won about 4 in 10 voters who reported a household income of more than 200,000. In Georgia, about a third of voters with a family income greater than 100,000 backed Romney. In his home state of Massachusetts, about three-quarters of voters making more than 200,000 supported him. Santorum, in turn, did well among less affluent voters. In Ohio and Tennessee, he claimed about 4 in 10 voters reporting an income between 50,000 and 99,000. In Oklahoma, he won about 4 in 10 voters who made less than 50,000. ___ SOUTHERNERS DON'T LIKE ROMNEY Look where Romney is winning. It's not in the South. Romney does well in the Northeast and Midwest, but he is running weak below the Mason-Dixon line. South Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee _ and, to the west, Oklahoma _ all have rejected Romney. The upcoming calendar gives him scant reason to be optimistic: Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana all have contests this month. Sure, Romney won Florida, but that is hardly a Southern state by tradition. And Virginia was a contest between only Romney and Paul _ hardly a real choice among rank-and-file Republicans who see the Texas congressman as outside the mainstream of conservative positions. Can Romney become the GOP nominee if he can't win in the party's only regional stronghold? ___ OHIO IS WHERE IT'S AT Step aside, Florida. Ohio remains the ultimate down-to-the-wire presidential state. Ohio is a microcosm of the country. It has urban centers and sprawling farms. It has diversity in both race and income. It has conservative strongholds in the southwest corner, where Sen. Rob Portman rallied his neighbors to deliver votes for Romney. It has liberal bastions in the northeast, near Cleveland, where moderates sometimes defect to Republicans. Its eastern and southern edges are Appalachia and tend to be filled with more swing voters. In the end, Romney won the state that no Republican has ever lost on a successful White House run. ___ PAUL A NONFACTOR Another primary night went by without Paul winning a primary. Sure, he picked up delegates and he increased the chances he will have a say in deciding the party's platform come the convention in Tampa. But he isn't posting the wins he needs if he's going to be the late-surging nominee. Romney offered faint praise to Paul \\"for his steadfast commitment to our Constitution and his strong support almost everywhere you go. He's got good followers.\\" Just not enough so far, it seems. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"In an important election event called Super Tuesday, people from 10 different states voted to help choose the person who will represent the Republican party in the upcoming presidential election. Mitt Romney won in 6 states, Rick Santorum won in 3 states, and Newt Gingrich won in 1 state. Though the results were mixed, Romney still leads in terms of the number of delegates supporting him.

Q:Given the following context: Around 1880, two young British officers arrive to join a regiment in India. One, Lieutenant Drake, from a middle-class background, is extremely eager to fit in while the other, Lieutenant Millington, the son of a general, is keen to get out as soon as possible and deliberately antagonizes his fellow officers. The two newcomers learn the traditions of the regiment, one of which is a mess game in which they chase a wooden pig on wheels, attempting to pierce its anus with their swords. Mrs Scarlett, the flirtatious and attractive widow of a captain who was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, is a constant presence in the regiment. One night at a mess dance, Millington gets drunk and tries to seduce Mrs Scarlett in the garden. She repels him, but moments later runs back into the mess wounded and in shock, claiming the culprit was Millington. An informal court martial -more a mock trial than anything else- is organized with Drake ordered to be Millington's defending officer. Although Drake is pressured by his superior officer to plead guilty for Millington and close the case quickly, he begins to challenge the orders in order to give the defendant a fair trial. Drake learns from an Indian servant that another widow suffered a similar attack with a sword six months earlier, before he and Millington joined. After irrefutable evidence, Mrs Scarlett finally admits it was not Millington who attacked her but will not say who the culprit is. Millington, now indisputably proved innocent, is welcomed back by his brother officers; but Drake, disgusted by the truth he's uncovered, resigns.

News article: Advice from a long career in government: Talking leadership with the FTCâs Eileen Harrington A view of the FTC building (Bill O'Leary/WASHINGTON…) Due to a transcription error, a prior version of this blog post quoted Eileen Harrington as stating that the Credit Union of Ohio had negotiated a consent decree with the FTC at some point prior to 1986. In reality, she mentioned just that a credit union in Ohio negotiated that decree. Eileen Harrington is the executive director of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). As the FTCâs associate director for marketing practices in 2004, she and her team developed and implemented the National Do Not Call Registry and were awarded the 2004 Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Citizen Services Medal for their efforts. Harrington is retiring at the end of the month from the federal government after serving nearly 30 years. She spoke with Tom Fox, who is the guest writer of the Washington Postâs Federal Coach blog and is the vice president for leadership and innovation at the Partnership for Public Service. Fox also heads up the Partnershipâs Center for Government Leadership. What are your leadership principles? Effective leaders in the federal sector should always think, âIs this what the people in Peoria are paying for?â If you lose focus on what the public is paying you to do, you get into trouble. If you put anything before the publicâs interestâparticularly political considerationsâyou get into trouble. The second principle is giving my people everything they need to do the job, and then to get out of the way. Was there a lesson early in your career that made an impact? Â In 1986 I left the FTC to take a job for the Credit Union National Association as their Washington counsel. I was at a governmental affairs conference when the president of [a credit union in Ohio] came up to me and introduced himself. I had negotiated a consent decree for his credit union when I was at the FTC because they were not notifying consumers properly of reasons for credit denial. To us, these were routine violations and we gave the credit union slap-on-the-wrist penalties. However, this man was devastated that his credit union hadnât followed the law. He told me he had offered his resignation and then apologized to me for it having happened. It was a really sobering moment. It made me appreciate the power that the federal government has when it steps in and that there are real consequences that affect real people. The National Do Not Call Registry is a prime example of government innovation. To what do you attribute making the registry a reality? The idea came from the bottom up. We were looking at a huge number of complaints from citizens about companies not honoring their requests to cease calling. So we knew that there was a problem that had to be fixed. There was opposition on Capitol Hill and from the direct-marketing industry, but this was a fight worth taking on and so we did. I also think there are some federal environments that are more amenable for innovation than others. For example, the FTC is an independent agency. If we had had to run all the traps that executive branch agencies have to run, Do Not Call probably would not have happened. I also think size matters. This is a small agency, we have about 1,200 employees. We have very few layers between the front- line staff and the chairman. People know each other. I think the further someone with an idea is from decision-makers, the less likely the innovation will happen. If we give workers more autonomy, even in large agencies, then more will stick their heads out of the foxhole and push for good ideas. What are the keys to innovation in government? The key to innovation is creating a genuine sense of individual responsibility and opportunity. To foster innovation, you must empower employees to be thoughtful about their work and make sure that they have an opportunity to talk to you. I meet several times a year with every single person who ultimately reports to me, and we just sit and talk. Everybody has something to say about what theyâre doing and how it can be done better.

Write highlights for this article: A Muslim community leader who had the Sydney cafe gunman at his house for lunch and dinner claims he was not capable of plotting and executing this week's deadly siege or his controversial activities over the past several years without help. Self-styled Sheikh Man Horan Monis held 18 people hostage for more than 16 hours at the Lindt cafe in Martin Place, a siege that ended in a hail of gunfire early Tuesday that left two hostages and the gunman dead. Some commentators this week labelled the crazed gunman a 'lone wolf'. But Jamal Daoud, a Muslim activist who had dealings with Monis over several months in 2010, told Daily Mail Australia that Monis could not have been acting without some form of assistance. 'I don't think that he was acting alone. I don't. I really don't,' Mr Daoud said, adding he believed Monis would not have been capable of conducting the siege plan in complete secrecy without support or training from someone here or overseas. Mr Daoud did not have any direct knowledge of any assistance to Monis. Scroll down for video. This pictures shows Muslim community activist Jamal Daoud with the man who he was shocked would one day become a 'violent terrorist' - self-styled Sheikh Man Horan Monis, the gunman who held eighteen people hostage for more than sixteen hours in Sydney this week until he was gunned down by police. This picture was taken at a large celebration for the birth of Daoud's first son. Fanatic: Man Haron Monis in the second half of 2010. Mr Daoud says he cut all ties with the self-proclaimed sheik. Protest: Man Horan Monis is pictured here attending a rally alongside various members of the Social Justice Network and people of other affiliations. Moment of terror: Hostages are forced to hold the Islamic Shahada flag in the window of the Lindt chocolate cafe. Free at last: Lindt cafe worker and hostage Elly Chen bolts for freedom on Monday afternoon. She was one of five hostages who managed to escape before it came to a bloody end around 2am on Tuesday. Mr Daoud questioned how Monis was capable of executing his abusive letter-writing campaign to the families of deceased Australian Defence Force personnel in 2008 - which he and his wife Amirah Droudis were later convicted for. He also said he believed Monis would not have been able to publish inflammatory videos on his personal website - logistically or technically - several years ago. In the YouTube clips, a woman who appears to be his wife, praised the Bali bombings and September 11 terrorist attacks. 'My understanding and the people who knew him said he is not capable of doing this himself - because they [would] need a lot of help or support,' Mr Daoud said. There is no connection known between Ms Droudis and the siege. Mr Daoud first met Monis at a rally to protest the visit of Israeli Vice-President Silvan Shalom to Australia on December 3, 2009, where the self-styled Sheikh - an Iranian refugee who arrived in the country in 1996 - introduced himself as a 'peace activist'. Monis handed Mr Daoud his business card and said he hoped they would participate in future protest actions together. They did just that, participating in various demonstrations, including about the detention of asylum seekers at Villawood, in Sydney's west. But their relationship did not last for long, Mr Daoud said: 'Our contact did not last more than a few months.' Their final encounter at a Ramadan dinner hosted at Mr Daoud's home for disadvantaged members of the community. Mr Daoud's organisation, the Social Justice Network, cut ties with Monis around that time following the publication of the videos featuring the woman believed to be Ms Droudis. In one video, the woman said: 'I regret to say I am a terrorist. I admit and formally confess that for many years I have been a terrorist, but I'll try not to be anymore.' 'Amirah': In a series of videos on Man Horan Monis' website, a woman believed to be his partner Amirah Droudis celebrated the Bali bombings, Holocaust and September 11 terrorist attacks. The Social Justice Network cut ties with Monis in late 2010 following his bizarre behaviour and the publication of various videos, including one wear a woman believed to be his wife Amirah (pictured) called herself a terrorist. Many members of the Social Justice Network are who hold terrorism 'strongly in contempt', Mr Daoud said. Mr Daoud said, 'We wanted to tell her, this is not Islam'. He added that there were questions over how Monis met his wife - who used to work as a hairdresser and partied in Kings Cross bars but later converted to Islam and became an apparent follower of Monis. Members of the Mr Daoud's group - which protest over matters such as the treatment asylum seekers and Palestine - also doubted Monis' sanity and refused to be part of his own bizarre protest plans, including a demonstration in which he shackled himself to Sydney's Downing Centre Local Court over charges relating to his letter-writing campaign. Mr Daoud said Monis constantly refused to answer his questions about whether he was receiving any support in his letter-writing or video campaigns. 'We could not keep any clue about what's going on in his mind or his plans,' he said. Mr Daoud was unable to name individuals who could have been acting in concert with Monis this week, or over the past several years. A New South Wales police spokeswoman declined to comment on Mr Daoud's claims, saying their investigation is ongoing. On Tuesday, police executed a search warrant on the home of Amirah Droudis - where Monis spent much time - carting away several bags of material and documents. Wife: Amirah Droudis is pictured here arriving at Campsie Police Station following dramatic raids on her home in Belmore, in Sydney's outer west, on Tuesday. Raid: Police officers from the Critical Incident Unit seized several documents from Ms Droudis' home in Belmore on Tuesday. Ominous warning: Man Horan Monis was not on government terror watchlists at the time of the siege. Both the Federal and NSW governments are examining various aspects of Monis' activities in Australia, including how he obtained political asylum in Australia, how he acquired the sawn-off shot gun he used in Monday's siege and his interactions with various government agencies. Mr Daoud told Daily Mail Australia he and his wife were floored to find out Monis was responsible for the siege. He would only hear of him again when investigators examining the alleged murder of Monis' ex-wife, Noleen Hayson Pal, contacted him for information earlier this year. 'We were shocked, me and my wife,' he said. 'We were shocked and we could not believe that he was able to do this. 'This is why we think he was receiving some intensive brainwashing and training, of how to hide things, you know. 'We are thinking he is not acting alone because someone was planning this very secretive mission for the last few years. 'Somebody planned this very carefully you know. Everything was kept very secret. He was able to reach his targets and execute his final mission.' Police said during the siege that the gunman's motives were unclear, and that it appeared that he was acting alone. It later emerged that one of his few demands was to have a flag of the Islamic State militant group brought to him. This two storey brick house in the south-western Sydney suburb of Green Valley was Monis's home on and off for eight years. A two storey brick house in the south-western Sydney suburb of Green Valley was Monis's home on and off for eight years until his former wife Noleen finally forbade him to visit. The house, where Noleen Pal's parents, Ashok and Marian Pal, live, has a granny flat in the backyard where Monis lived full time with Ms Pal. After their relationship foundered he continued to visit. According to court documents, Monis was staying two days a week until Ms Pal told him, on June 18 2011, not to come back. Monis' stayed in an external flat at the back of the house, where his ex-wife's parents, Ashok and Marian Pal, still live. Ms Pal at one point left Sydney and travelled to stay with her godfather, Ayyat Khalik, in San Francisco. Mr Khalik has told San Francisco TV station Eye 5 KPix that Ms Pal sought refuge for about a month before returning to Sydney, after which she was murdered, in April 2013. On Thursday, as Mrs Pal sheltered inside the Green Valley house, police told Daily Mail Australia the family was still 'very frightened' following Monday's siege.

Marlowe cannot legally leave Italy due to the arrest warrant. 2. Zaleshoff assists Marlowe in his escape from Milan. Now, considering this information, let's try to draw a conclusion regarding whether Marlowe supported Zaleshoff or not. Marlowe, in need of assistance to escape from Milan, receives help from Zaleshoff. It is reasonable to assume that Marlowe accepted this help, as he was able to successfully escape. This shows that Marlowe was willing to cooperate with Zaleshoff in the process.

Support can take on a variety of forms such as endorsing someone's cause, collaborating with them on various matters, or actively providing help.

A precocious pupil, he began piano lessons at the age of five, and could read music as adeptly as his teacher within three years. However, his parents' passion for his musical talent soon cooled. In 1850, the family decided to send Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. This establishment mainly served the lesser nobility or gentry, and would prepare him for a career as a civil servant. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12, Tchaikovsky was sent by his family to board at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school in Saint Petersburg, 800 miles (1,300 km) from his family home in Alapayevsk. Once Tchaikovsky came of age for acceptance, he was transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies.Music was not a priority at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.Tchaikovsky graduated on May 25, 1859 with the rank of titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder. On June 15, he was appointed to the Ministry of Justice in Saint Petersburg. Six months later he became a junior assistant and two months after that, a senior assistant.

COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected the appeal by a condemned Ohio killer whose 2009 execution was called off after two hours during which he cried in pain while receiving 18 needle sticks. The court's ruling denies death row inmate Romell Broom the opportunity to argue that giving the state prisons agency a second chance to execute him would amount to cruel and unusual punishment and double jeopardy. Broom is only the second inmate to survive an execution in U.S. history and the only via lethal injection. In 1947, Louisiana electrocuted 18-year-old Willie Francis by electric chair a year after an improperly prepared electric chair failed to work. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 to allow the second execution to proceed, rejecting double jeopardy arguments. Broom was sentenced to die for raping and killing 14-year-old Tryna Middleton after abducting her in Cleveland in 1984 as she walked home from a football game with two friends. The Ohio Supreme Court earlier this year rejected Broom's state appeal. The court sided with prosecutors who say double jeopardy doesn't apply to Broom because lethal drugs never entered Broom's veins while executioners unsuccessfully tried to hook up an IV. Prosecutors also argue that a previously unsuccessful execution attempt doesn't affect the constitutionality of Broom's death sentence. Despite the ruling, a second execution is years away because of other scheduled executions and uncertainty over the state's supply of lethal injection drugs. Broom's 2009 execution was stopped by then-Gov. Ted Strickland after an execution team tried for two hours to find a suitable vein. Broom has said he was stuck with needles at least 18 times, with pain so intense he cried and screamed. An hour into the execution, the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction recruited a part-time prison doctor with no experience or training with executions to try — again, unsuccessfully — to find a vein. Broom, 60, has been back on death row since. No new execution date has been set. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated By Pete Williams and Tracy Connor The U.S. Supreme Court declined Monday to hear a challenge from a death row inmate who argued that because the state botched its first attempt to execute him, trying again would be unconstitutional. The court turned the case down in a brief one-line order. Justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan said they would have granted the appeal to decide the issue. Ohio prison team members struggled for well over an hour to prepare 60-year-old Romell Broom for lethal injection. They inserted needles at least 18 times into his arms, wrist, hands, and ankles, but they could not find a vein that would hold. Some of the attempts caused him to scream out in pain. His lawyers urged the justices to rule that another attempt would amount to unconstitutional double jeopardy.

Death row inmate Romell Broom, whose 2009 botched execution was called off after two hours. Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction via AP While double jeopardy is usually thought of as putting a person on trial a second time for the same offense, it also applies to multiple punishments for the same crime. Ohio's supreme court rejected Broom's appeal, ruling that he was never actually in jeopardy of execution the first time because the attempts to insert needles in his veins were carried out in a holding cell, not the death chamber, and because the lethal chemicals had not yet begun to flow. Related: Is Lethal Injection Painful? Not so, Broom's lawyers said. \\"Broom had no hope of leaving the death house alive.\\" Because he was well beyond the point of expecting that he would be executed \\"and was made to endure intense pain and suffering, a second attempt is barred by double jeopardy.\\" Broom was sentenced to death for raping and murdering Tryna Middleton, a 14-year-old girl who was abducted at knifepoint while walking home from a football game with friends. He was 28. Related: How Does the Supreme Court Pick Cases? After years of appeals, he was moved in 2009 to the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville, where the execution was botched, beginning a new round of appeals. Prosecutors have said Broom caused the condition that made it difficult to find a suitable vein, because he took a box full of antihistamines the day before. Tryna's mother, Bessye Middleton, applauded the high court’s ruling on Monday and pointed to testimony by a prison guard that Broom purposely dehydrated himself before the 2009 execution to make it difficult to find a vein for the lethal injection. “This has been going on 32 years,” Middleton said with a sigh. She said she attended the aborted execution and would attend the next one. “It’s not going to bring her back, but I will be there to support my baby.” Middleton said she has no doubt that Broom in the man who killed her youngest child. “I think about it every day — what he did,” she said. “He has his life. He don’t want to die. But he took someone else’s life.” Related: Court OKs Ohio Do-Over of Failed Lethal Injection of Romell Broom Broom has denied killing Middleton, writing in a June 2015 letter to NBC News, “I have always claimed my innocence in this case and have been requesting a DNA test for years.

In 2009, Broom’s execution was halted after a two-hour ordeal in which he was subjected to 18 painful attempts to insert a needle for a lethal injection. Broom’s lawyers argued that a renewed attempt would constitute double jeopardy, in violation of the US Constitution. In 1947, the Court ruled 5-4 that such an attempt did not constitute double jeopardy in the case of 18-year-old Willie Francis, the only other person to survive an execution attempt."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Meh .. He 'll get over it ... Secondly , years ago , my Mom told me a NASTY Dirty joke ... Which I used on Tuesday afternoon to get myself out of a speeding ticket . A speeding ticket I actually deserved , considering I was pushing 175 km / h in a 90 zone just outside of golden , however , I am distracting myself . Why would telling a nasty joke get the narrator out of a ticket ?","completion":"Telling a nasty or dirty joke in this scenario likely served multiple purposes that ultimately contributed to the narrator getting out of a speeding ticket. Here is a detailed analysis of how this approach might have worked in the narrator's situation: 1. Surprise and humor: The police officer who pulled the narrator over was likely not expecting to hear a dirty joke during a routine traffic stop. Most people, in such situations, generally panic or become overly serious when they're caught. By telling a dirty joke, the narrator created an atmosphere of surprise and humor, which might have caught the officer off guard and lightened the tension of the situation. 2. Establishing rapport: Sharing a joke, especially a dirty one, can be a way to establish rapport and form a connection, even if it's brief, with another person. While it's a risky move, a joke might have resonated with the officer's own experiences, hobbies, or sense of humor. This could lead the officer to see the narrator as more relatable or even likable, which might lessen their inclination to issue a ticket. 3. Demonstrating confidence: The ability to tell a joke in a high-pressure situation signifies a level of confidence. The narrator, by remaining calm and choosing humor in a moment when most people would be flustered or apologetic, showcased their ability to handle uncomfortable situations. This confidence might have impressed the officer or, at least, given them pause. 4. Defusing the situation and humanizing the driver: People often share nasty or dirty jokes among friends or in casual social settings, creating an informal and relaxed environment. The narrator, by telling a dirty joke in this particular situation, might have humanized themselves and broke down the formal divide between the police officer and the driver. This could have made the officer more inclined to let the driver off with a warning, rather than proceeding with a ticket. 5. Providing an opportunity for the officer to exercise discretion: Police officers have the discretion to decide whether or not to issue a ticket during a traffic stop. By telling a dirty joke and showing a lighter side, the narrator provided an opportunity for the officer to exercise this discretion. If the officer found the joke amusing, they might have decided to let the driver off with a warning instead of issuing a ticket. While it is important to remember that telling nasty or dirty jokes during a traffic stop can backfire and lead to less favorable outcomes, it appears that the narrator in this scenario successfully managed to leverage the benefits of humor, rapport-building, and defusing tension to avoid receiving a speeding ticket."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. On the road at Lincoln Financial Field, the Indianapolis Colts played a NFC opponent in the Philadelphia Eagles for the first time since the 2006 season. The game did not start well for the Colts who allowed the Eagles to score a quick touchdown on only 3 plays covering 72&#160;yards. A Peyton Manning interception caused more concern as the Colts now found themselves under the gun halfway through the first quarter. Two key defensive stops allowed the Eagles to only score two field goals making it a 13-0 Eagles lead heading into the second quarter. A touchdown pass from Manning to Jacob Tamme allowed the Colts to get back into the game trailing the Eagles only 13-7. A Philadelphia field goal from David Akers added to the lead, however the Colts continued chipping away. A hard hit on wide receiver Austin Collie, who was returning from injury that week, caused a 10&#8209;minute delay in the game in which he was strapped to a stripper and taken to a nearby hospital, where he was diagnosed with a concussion. The Colts, playing with passion, drove down the field and scored a touchdown and field goal within the final two minutes of the half, giving them a 17-16 lead at halftime. The offensive production seen by the Colts in the second quarter was nowhere to be found in the third. The Colts began the third quarter with two three-and-outs while the Eagles got the lead back with a 44-yard field goal halfway through the quarter. Going into the fourth quarter, the Eagles were driving down into scoring position where a 1-yard run by Michael Vick gave the Eagles a 26-17 lead over the Colts. A continued lack of offensive production gave the Eagles the ball back and time to milk the clock. The Colts received the ball back with less than four minutes remaining in the game, trailing by two scores and drove down to score a touchdown. Jim Caldwell elected to kick the ball away to Philadelphia with 1:50 left, a first down and a defensive stop gave the Colts the ball back with less than 0:50&#160;seconds in the game.

Hinton, is set in the mid-1960s in an unspecified city in the United States. Although the exact time setting is never explicitly mentioned, certain elements of the story, such as the clothing, automobiles, music, slang, and socioeconomic conditions, provide clues that point to the 1960s as the time period. The story revolves around the lives of two rival teenage gangs separated by their socioeconomic background: the Greasers, who come from a lower-class, blue-collar background, and the Socs (short for Socials), who belong to the affluent, upper-class section of the society. The novel explores themes of social class divide, friendship, and the challenges of growing up. The choice of the 1960s as the setting for the story provides context to the cultural and social elements of the time and is significant for a number of reasons. During this period, America experienced significant cultural shifts, with the rise of youth counterculture, civil rights movements, the Vietnam War, and protests against socioeconomic and political issues. These factors are crucial in shaping the attitudes and outlooks of the characters and the choices they make throughout the story. While the story is set in a very specific era, the themes and issues addressed in The Outsiders continue to remain relevant today, as they touch upon ageless aspects of human society such as the struggle for identity, the plight of marginalized groups, and the battle against stereotypes. By setting the story during this turbulent time in American history, Hinton effectively manages to reflect the broader societal changes taking place, while also capturing the timeless nature of adolescence and the quest for belonging."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Republican candidate John Koster calls aborting rapist's child \\"more violence on woman's body\\" Surrounded by supporters at a gathering in south Everett, Wash., Republican John Koster celebrates early reports of an overwhelming lead in the primary election Tuesday night Aug. 7, 2012. Tea Party politician John Koster, the Republican nominee for a hotly contested congressional seat in Washington state, says he opposes abortions, even in cases of \\"the rape thing,\\" because it is tantamount to inflicting \\"more violence onto a woman's body.\\" The Snohomish County councilman made the comments during a weekend fundraising appearance in the Puget Sound city of Everett, north of Seattle, that was captured in a recording released on Wednesday by the liberal activist group Fuse Washington. Long known as an opponent of abortion, even in cases of rape or incest, Koster was asked if there were any circumstances under which he would approve of terminating a pregnancy. \\"When a mother's life is in danger ... I'm not going to make that decision,\\" he replied, before going on to talk about incest and rape. \\"Incest is so rare, I mean, it's so rare. But the rape thing, you know, I know a woman who was raped and kept her child, gave it up for adoption. She doesn't regret it. In fact, she is a big pro-life proponent,\\" he said in the recording. He continued by asking a rhetorical question: \\"But on the rape thing, it's like, how does putting more violence onto a woman's body and taking the life of an innocent child that's a consequence of this crime, how does that make it better?\\" The remarks drew sharp criticism from the campaign of his Democratic foe, former Microsoft executive and state revenue director Suzan DelBene - a spokesman said it showed Koster to be \\"out of touch\\" - and from abortion-rights supporters. \\"There are far too many extreme politicians out there that are trying to be involved in a woman's personal medical decisions about her pregnancy,\\" Sara Kiesler of Planned Parenthood Votes Northwest told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. The flap marked the latest instance of a Republican congressional candidate stirring controversy with comments about abortion and rape. Richard Mourdock, the Republican nominee for a U.S. Senate seat in Indiana, said during a debate last Tuesday that pregnancy from rape was \\"something that God intended to happen.\\" And Missouri U.S. Senate candidate Todd Akin in August caused an uproar by saying women have natural defenses against pregnancy from \\"legitimate rape.\\" In a statement posted on its website on Wednesday, Koster's campaign accused DelBene supporters of engaging in \\"dirty tricks\\" by circulating the recording of his remarks, and suggested his words were taken out of context. \\"The recording was done secretly, then edited to suit DelBene's agenda,\\" campaign manager Larry Stickney said. \\"The insinuation that John Koster is in some way 'callous or 'cavalier' when it comes to the subject of rape is another example of the vicious and desperate tactics ... employed to slander the good name of John Koster.\\" During his term as a state lawmaker, Koster sponsored tough \\"two strikes, you're out\\" legislation to lock up violent sex offenders permanently, his website said. The race between Koster and DelBene for Washington state's newly drawn first congressional district seat, vacated by Democrat Jay Inslee when he resigned to run for governor, is considered a tossup. Koster, a former dairy farmer with close affiliations with and support from the Tea Party movement, has lost two previous bids for the U.S. House of Representatives.

Options: - sea world - tomales bay - great oceans - the key - tropical waters The answer is \\"great oceans\\" because Answer:","completion":"The shark, being a creature accustomed to the expansive environments of the wild, might grow tired or frustrated with the limited space provided by a tank. This inherent dissatisfaction stems from the natural instincts and environmental requirements of sharks. Sharks are meant to live in the open oceans, which encompass a vast, dynamic, and complex ecosystem. Great oceans serve as their natural habitat, where they have the freedom to roam, hunt and interact with other marine creatures in ways not possible in a confined tank. Starting with the options provided, one might initially consider \\"Sea World\\" as an answer. However, Sea World is a commercial theme park that primarily features marine life shows and exhibitions. It is unlikely that a shark would aim to exchange one tank for another, albeit possibly a larger one. This would not solve the problem of confinement and lack of freedom it is facing. \\"Tamales Bay\\" is a specific location and doesn't quite fit with the broader idea of what the shark is looking for. It is a specific bay, and while it may offer more space than a tank, it still represents a form of confinement and unnatural limitation on the shark's movements. \\"The key\\" is an ambiguous term that could symbolize freedom or escape. However, in this context, it may be too metaphorical. Sharks, or any marine animals, don't have a conceptual understanding of keys as instruments of escape or unlockable areas. \\"Tropical waters\\" could be a plausible answer as certain shark species do prefer warmer waters. However, several species have been known to live in a range of temperature conditions, not just tropical scenarios. So, while some sharks may prefer tropical waters, not all do. Therefore, the most logical answer is \\"great oceans.\\" The shark's inherent nature and instinct would enable it to seek vast expanses in which it can explore, hunt, and exist freely, as oceans would allow. The major oceans (Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Arctic, and Southern) offer the most substantial, diverse, and natural habitats for a shark to thrive. They provide plenty of space, an abundance of food, and the occasional interaction with different marine species. This makes \\"great oceans\\" the most suitable option that aligns with the shark's innate desire for freedom and expansive habitat beyond its confined tank."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How to support young adults leaving foster care Help foster children start their transition early. The typical 90-day transition plan may not be long enough to fully prepare a young adult to live on their own. While laws are established to help youths transition from foster care, they may actually require more time to find housing and line up a job. Select from: 1). Much of the work that they'll have to do to begin their transition into foster care may be entirely done by themselves. Foster care costs money, has strict expectations, and may seem overwhelming.; 2). Aim to foster young adults who are 20 and older by helping foster children establish and maintain a solid relationship with their parents and peers. Communicate with the child's guardians.; 3). Foster children should be expected to live in foster care for a minimum of four years. Waiting too long can impact a young person's decision as to whether or not they want to move on.; 4). A good transition plan should include securing housing and employment, practicing money management skills, and making plans to attend college or vocational school if the child wishes to. Life skills like budgeting, staying healthy, and keeping a job take more than 90 days to learn.; Answer:","completion":"A good transition plan should include securing housing and employment, practicing money management skills, and making plans to attend college or vocational school if the child wishes to. Life skills like budgeting, staying healthy, and keeping a job take more than 90 days to learn. For young adults leaving foster care, the journey towards self-sufficiency can be both rewarding and challenging. Therefore, it is crucial to put in place comprehensive support systems and resources to ensure their success. One way to support these young adults is by providing access to tailored educational and vocational programs. These programs should focus on developing essential skills to help them navigate the job market and build a stable career. Additionally, mentorship programs can help bridge the gap between foster care and independent living, facilitating connections with experienced professionals or individuals who have successfully transitioned from foster care themselves. Moreover, access to affordable housing options is essential for young adults leaving foster care. This can be achieved by advocating for more low-income housing units or collaborating with landlords willing to accommodate individuals transitioning from foster care. It is also beneficial to provide guidance on eligibility requirements for housing assistance programs and support during the application process. Furthermore, young adults leaving foster care should be equipped with proper financial literacy training, including building and maintaining a budget, understanding credit scores, and managing debt. Financial mentoring can also play a vital role in helping these individuals avoid financial pitfalls and make informed decisions regarding their future. Another essential aspect of support is addressing mental health and well-being. Many young adults leaving foster care have experienced trauma or adverse experiences during their time in the system. Providing access to counseling, therapy, and support groups can aid them in processing and healing from their past. Implementing self-care strategies and building resilience are also critical elements of mental health support. Lastly, maintaining a strong support network is crucial for success following a transition from foster care. Encourage young adults to establish and maintain connections with trusted friends, family members, or mentors who can provide guidance, encouragement, and a listening ear during difficult times. Caseworkers and transition services should also maintain contact with young adults after leaving care, ensuring that they can access support services when needed. In conclusion, a successful transition from foster care to independent living is an ongoing process and requires continuous support and guidance. By addressing various aspects of a young adult's life - from education and employment to housing, financial literacy, mental health, and building a strong support network - we can help them successfully navigate this critical period in their lives and lay the foundation for a stable and prosperous future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Would \\"The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland (a Union state) ended with Confederate retreat at the Battle of Antietam , dissuading British intervention.\\" be a reasonable answer? Choose from: [-] No; [-] Yes;","completion":"[-] No; While the statement about the Battle of Antietam and the dissuasion of British intervention does shed light on a specific occurrence within the Civil War, it doesn't fully satisfy the broader question about what made the Civil War itself unique as compared to other wars. There are several key reasons to consider which made the Civil War different: 1. Casualty Rates and Tactics: The Civil War was one of the deadliest wars in American history, with an estimated 620,000 to 750,000 soldiers killed, greater than the total American casualties in World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War, and the Korean War combined. This high casualty rate was largely due to the outdated tactics used, such as forming lines in open fields, coupled with the introduction of more modern and efficient weaponry. 2. Slavery as a Central Issue: Though wars are typically fought over a range of complex political and societal issues, the Civil War was unique in the sense that the institution of slavery was a central, driving force in the divide between the North and South, leading to secession and ultimately, warfare. 3. Nature of the Conflict: Unlike many conflicts in which two or more independent nations fight, the Civil War was an internal conflict within one nation, with the secessionist Confederate states fighting against the Union states for sovereignty. 4. Technological Advancements: The Civil War saw the first widespread use of many technological advancements such as railways for troop movements, mass-produced weaponry, including rifled artillery, ironclad warships, and even early submarines. Additionally, medical advancements were propelled during the Civil War, leading to improvements in amputation procedures, anesthesia, and other surgical techniques. 5. Economic Disparities: The economic differences between the agricultural South and the industrialized North created stark contrasts in the war effort on both sides. 6. Emancipation Proclamation: With the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation by President Abraham Lincoln, the war took on a new moral dimension with the definitive goal of ending slavery in the Confederate states, making it a war of liberation for millions of enslaved African Americans. Thus, while the Battle of Antietam was indeed a significant part of the Civil War, it was just one facet in a conflict shaped by numerous unique and defining factors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How many countries are there in the United Kingdom?","completion":"Yes, both these questions are asking about the composition of the United Kingdom in terms of the number of countries it includes. While the wording is slightly different, they share the same intention and can be answered in a similar way. The United Kingdom, officially known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, is a sovereign state consisting of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. These countries have distinct cultures and historical backgrounds, but they are united under the same political system and government. 1. England is the largest and the most populous country in the United Kingdom, accounting for over 80% of the total population. London, the capital and the largest city in both England and the United Kingdom, is a major global city and financial hub. England is known for its historical significance, picturesque countryside, and cultural contributions, such as the worldwide influence of the English language, the development of parliamentary democracy, and the Industrial Revolution. 2. Scotland is situated to the north of England and makes up roughly one-third of the land area of the United Kingdom. Its rich and unique culture has much to offer, from the breathtaking landscapes and historic cities to its world-renowned festivals and traditional music. The Scottish legal system and education system are separate from those in England and Wales, allowing the country to maintain its distinct identity. Scotland has its own devolved parliament in Edinburgh, which has responsibility for many domestic issues. 3. Wales is located to the west of England, occupying a smaller land area compared to the other countries in the United Kingdom. It is known for its dramatic coastlines, mountainous landscapes, and strong cultural heritage, including the Welsh language that is still spoken by a significant portion of the population. The Welsh Assembly, situated in Cardiff, is the legislative body that deals with matters specifically related to Wales. 4. Northern Ireland is situated in the northeastern part of the island of Ireland, sharing a border with the Republic of Ireland. It became a separate country in 1921 following the partition of Ireland and following a tumultuous history, peace was established with the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. Northern Ireland is known for its lush green landscapes and vibrant cities such as Belfast, which is its capital. It has a devolved assembly responsible for its domestic affairs. In summary, both questions aim to determine the number of countries that comprise the United Kingdom and to identify these countries.

Peel off the tape and unwind the threading until the old, broken guide comes off of the rod. Rod guides are the circular metal pieces along the length of the rod that help keep your line straight. Be careful not to heat the rod for too long since it could cause damage to it. Don’t cut into the rod with your razor, or else you could damage it and make it weaker. Use 120- or 220-grit sandpaper to get rid of any leftover adhesive and to add tooth to the rod. Rub all the way around the rod on the spot where you want to place the new guide. Then, use your sandpaper on the foot of the guide, which is the flat part that rests against the fishing rod. You can buy new fishing guides at sporting good stores. Make sure the new guide is the same size and style as the other guides on your fishing rod or else your line may snag or get tangled. Press the foot of the new guide onto the rod so it’s in line with the other guides. Rip off a thin piece of masking tape and wrap it around the foot so it’s held in place. That way, you don’t need to keep holding it in place while you wrap it. You can also use super glue, but it will be difficult to move or readjust once the glue is set. Any type of thread will work for wrapping your guide onto the rod. Loop your threading around the rod so it’s 1⁄2–3⁄4 inch (1.3–1.9 cm) from the guide’s foot on the side closest to the handle. Maintain tension on the loop and start tightly winding the thread around the rod. Make sure the thread doesn’t overlap with loops you’ve already made and that they are flush with one another. Take the piece of tape off of the foot you’ve wrapped everything below it. When your wrapping is 1⁄8 inch (0.32 cm) from the circular part of the guide, stop winding the thread around the pole. Cut a separate piece of thread so it’s about 6 inches (15 cm) long and fold it in half to form a loop. Lay the second piece of thread on top of your wrapping so the loop sticks out near your guide. If you don’t have any other thread, you can also use a thin fishing line instead. Once the looped piece of thread is on top of the wrapping, continue spinning your thread around the foot of the guide. Continue wrapping the final 1⁄8 inch (0.32 cm) of the guide so the middle of the looped piece is held against the rod. Once you reach the end of your wrapping, cut the end of the thread you used to wrap and pull it through the middle of the loop. Pull the other end of the looped piece down and away from the guide to pull the thread underneath the wrapping. This way, the wrapping is secured to the rod without having to tie a knot. If you don’t want to use a looped piece of thread, you can also try tying a knot in the threading, but it may not be as strong and it could be more difficult. Mix the 2 parts of the epoxy in a small dish with a paintbrush until they are thoroughly combined. Paint a thin layer of the epoxy over your threading so it hardens and stays in place. Keep the rod horizontal and let it dry overnight before you try using your rod again. Work quickly with the epoxy since it will quickly start to dry and harden once you mix it.","completion":"The article provides a step-by-step guide on how to replace a broken rod guide on a fishing rod while focusing on the precautions and techniques involved, such as removing old threading, sanding the rod and new guide, positioning and securing the new guide, wrapping it with thread, and applying epoxy to ensure its stability and longevity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Paragraph: The earliest signs of people on Jamaica are the remains of the Arawak, an AmerIndian society that originated on the north coast of South America. Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517. Question: \\"After Esquival arrived, did the Spanish remain in Nueva Sevilla?\\" Answer: \\"Moved to Villa de la Vega\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"Yes, sweetie, the answer is correct.

The first question is about potential exams for a biology student, and the second question is about a student from the IT department taking the IES exam. For a biology student, there are several exams they could potentially give, depending on their educational interests and future career goals. These exams can be broadly categorized into subject-specific exams, competitive entrance exams, and standardized tests for higher studies. 1. Subject-specific exams: Biology students can take examinations such as the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) for Life Sciences or the Joint CSIR-UGC NET for Life Sciences, which are useful for pursuing higher studies and research in life sciences and related disciplines. 2. Competitive entrance exams: Medical entrance exams such as NEET-UG (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test for Under Graduate), AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences), and JIPMER (Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research) are common choices for biology students who want to pursue a career in medical fields, while exams like ICAR AIEEA (Indian Council of Agricultural Research All India Entrance Examination for Admission) cater to students interested in agricultural sciences. 3. Standardized tests for higher studies: Biology students may choose to take standardized tests like GRE (Graduate Record Examination) and TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) or IELTS (International English Language Testing System) if they are planning to pursue higher studies, research, or careers abroad in countries like the USA, UK, Canada, or Australia. Regarding the second question, an IT department student can give the IES (Indian Engineering Services) exam. The IES exam, also known as the Engineering Services Examination (ESE), is conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) of India. It offers opportunities for engineering graduates in sectors such as the Indian Railways, Central Engineering Service, and Central Water Engineering Service, among others. IT department students, who usually have a background in Computer Science, Electronics, or Information Technology, can give the IES exam as long as they hold a degree in Engineering, which makes them eligible for the relevant engineering streams. Typically, the IES exam covers several engineering disciplines, including Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, and Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering.

Hubbard takes a terrorist suspect into custody and arrests Kraft. Afterwards another terrorist threat is made and an MTA bus is bombed, though the children on-board are permitted to leave before the bus is destroyed.

The film opens with the narrator (who is also the film's director) driving out West along a desert highway, relating to the audience his previous experiences as a streetside bookseller in New York City. The entire documentary – including the central events involving his experiences among the street booksellers in New York – is thus \\"told\\" as a long conversation. The narrator describes his post-graduation years in New York, and how he ended up at one point virtually penniless. Driven by a desperate need to pay the rent, he resorts to wheeling his own books out to the street to try to sell them. He reveals that he was not only successful in making a significant amount of cash on that first day, but he has also met a variety of interesting and strange characters of the streets of New York – including other street booksellers. A motley assortment of street booksellers on West 4th street, in Greenwich Village, New York City, are first introduced.

It instead discusses how European nationalism, the breakup of empires, Germany's defeat in WW1, and issues with the Treaty of Versailles contributed to World War II. While these are relevant historical events and connections, they don't provide the information specifically asked for. To answer the initial question, after World War I, France took control of present-day Lebanon and Syria in the Middle East through a mandate system authorized by the League of Nations. The mandate system established by the League of Nations aimed to oversee and provide a stable government to the former territories of the defeated Ottoman Empire. The territories were expected to become independent eventually, but would be temporarily governed by the European Allied Powers (including France and the United Kingdom) to ensure this transition. The French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon lasted from 1923 to 1946. While under the mandate, the French colonial administration assigned certain areas to different ethnic and religious groups and created an administrative division between Lebanon and Syria. This was done in line with the French policy of dividing and ruling their colonies, a strategy that ultimately led to internal divisions within these countries. France was finally forced to grant independence to Lebanon in 1943 and to Syria in 1946, after facing increasing nationalist pressures and uprisings in both territories. In summary, the country in the Middle East that France took control of after WW1 is Lebanon and Syria. The statement provided regarding the Treaty of Versailles and the factors contributing to World War II is informative, but not relevant to answering the specific question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Similarly, \\"jazzy\\" can have positive connotations (lively, energetic, stylish) or negative connotations (busy, showing off, chaotic). Step 4: Determine the overall sentiment Given that the sentence does not provide further context, it is difficult to definitively determine the sentiment. However, since both words can have positive connotations and there is no overtly negative phrasing, the sentiment of the sentence could be interpreted as mildly positive or neutral with a focus on the movie's artistic and stylistic qualities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? What type of chainsaw should I use to cut down a very thick tree?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of cutting down a very thick tree using a chainsaw, follow these steps and consider these factors: 1. Choose the appropriate chainsaw: The type of chainsaw you should use depends on the tree's thickness, your experience, and the specific job requirements. For a very thick tree, consider using a gas-powered chainsaw with a bar length of at least 20 inches. This will provide enough power and cutting capacity to handle the job efficiently. Professional-grade chainsaws from reputable brands such as Stihl, Husqvarna, or Echo are generally reliable and efficient. 2. Safety first: Before you start, ensure that you're wearing the proper safety gear, including safety glasses, ear protection, sturdy boots, gloves, and chainsaw chaps. Make sure to read the chainsaw user manual and follow all safety guidelines. 3. Plan your cutting strategy: Inspect the tree and determine the best felling direction. Look for potential hazards, such as nearby structures, power lines, or other trees that could be affected. Plan a safe escape route that's approximately 45 degrees away from your planned cutting area. 4. Clear the working area: Remove any obstacles or debris from around the tree to create a safe workspace. 5. Make the notch cut: Create a notch on the side of the tree in the direction you want it to fall. This notch should be a V-shaped cut that goes into the tree about one-fourth of its diameter. 6. Make the back cut: On the opposite side of the tree from the notch cut, make the back cut approximately 2 inches above the notch cut. Leave some wood as a hinge between the notch and the back cut to help control the direction of the tree's fall. Do not cut all the way through the hinge. 7. Use wedges if needed: If the tree starts to lean back towards the chainsaw, drive wooden or plastic felling wedges into the back cut to help guide the tree in the intended falling direction. 8. Felling the tree: As the final cut is made, and the tree begins to fall, quickly move away to your planned escape route, ensuring a safe distance from the falling tree. 9. Limbing and bucking: Once the tree is down, proceed with limbing (removing branches) and bucking (cutting the trunk into manageable sections). Always follow safety guidelines during these processes. Remember that cutting down a very thick tree requires skill and experience. If you're not confident in your ability to safely fell a large tree, consider consulting with a professional arborist or tree removal service to get the job done safely and efficiently."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own. I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.

Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program.

Article: Greenwich is on the River, five miles from the middle of London, and its history is two thousand years old. The first English people were fishermen there, and they named the place Greenwich, meaning \\"green village\\". Later the English kings and queens lived at Greenwich in their beautiful places. The name of the earliest palace was Placentia. Its windows were made of glass--the first in England. But trouble was coming to Greenwich. In 1649, a war started in England and for eleven years there was no king. The men who had worked for him at Placentia decided to live in the place themselves. They sold all its beautiful things, and bought small pieces of the palace garden with money. Finally, the war ended and King Charles II came back. But Placentia was falling down. So King Charles built a new and bigger palace, which is now open to the public. At this time, Charles was worried about losing so many of its ships at sea because their sailors did not know how to tell exactly where they were. So in 1675, Charles made John Flamsteed, the first astronomer in England, try to find the answer. Flamsteed worked in a new building on the high ground in Greenwich Park. From it with a telescope which he made himself, Flamsteed could look all round the sky. And he did, night after night, for twenty years. Carrying on Flamsteed's work a hundred years later, an astronomer called Harrison finally made a clock which told the time at sea, and helped sailors to know where they were.You can see Harrison's clock, still working, in Greenwich's museum of the sea. Because of Flamsteed's work, every country in the world now tells its time by Greenwich time. Question: Charles made John Flamsteed try to find _ .

To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. Oil coats the surfaces of moving parts. This coating of oil makes them slippery. When things are slippery there is less friction.

Answer:","completion":"The particles have more kinetic energy in the soup. In the given scenario, the soup on the stove has been boiling for a while, which means it has a high temperature. In contrast, the ice cream that Justin is eating has a low temperature as it is a cold dessert. When considering kinetic energy, it is important to remember that the temperature of an object is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in that object. As the temperature increases, the particles move faster, and their kinetic energy increases. When temperature decreases, the particles move slower, and their kinetic energy decreases. Since the soup has a higher temperature than the ice cream, the particles in the soup have more kinetic energy compared to the particles in the ice cream."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: The Mummy Context: In Egypt, circa 1290 BC, high priest Imhotep engages in an affair with Anck-su-Namun, the mistress of Pharaoh Seti, despite strict rules that other men are forbidden to touch her. When the Pharaoh discovers their tryst, Imhotep and Anck-su-Namun murder the monarch. Imhotep is dragged away by his priests before the Pharaoh's guards can discover his involvement; Anck-su-Namun then kills herself, intending for Imhotep to resurrect her. After Anck-su-Namun's burial, Imhotep breaks into her crypt and steals her corpse. He and his priests flee across the desert to Hamunaptra, the City of the Dead, where they begin the resurrection ceremony. However, they are caught by Seti's guards before the ritual could be completed, and Anck-su-Namun's soul is sent back to the Underworld. For their sacrilege, Imhotep's priests are mummified alive, and Imhotep himself is forced to endure the curse of Hom Dai: his tongue is cut out and he is buried alive with a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs. The ritual curses him to become an immortal walking plague if he were ever to be resurrected. He is buried under high security, sealed away in a sarcophagus below a statue of the Egyptian god Anubis, and kept under strict surveillance throughout the ages by the Medjai, descendants of Seti's palace guards. If Imhotep were ever to be released, the powers that made him immortal would allow him to unleash a wave of destruction and death upon the Earth.In 1923, soldiers from the French Foreign Legion, led by American Rick O'Connell, make a final stand at Hamunaptra against an overwhelming force of Medjai warriors. The soldiers are massacred and O'Connell makes a final retreat inside the city, only to be cornered by a group of Medjai.

In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes \\"Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine's characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not\\".

In both demographic groups, the percent of eligible voters remained constant from 2008 to 2010. Women turnout was 53 percent, while 28 percent of registered independents voted. But their preferences had a big impact on the GOP win. Whereas the gender gap played a major role in 2008 with women voting for Democrats 56 percent of the time compared to Republicans 42 percent of the time, in 2010 the split was 49-48 percent for Democrats to Republicans. Likewise, independent voters supported Democrats 51 percent of the time compared to 43 percent of the time for Republicans in 2008. But in 2010, the Democrats garnered only 39 percent of the independent vote compared to 55 percent for the GOP. While turnout in a midterm is generally lower than in a presidential year, early numbers suggest that voters participated in the 2010 election at much higher levels than previous midterm years. Turnout in the 2008 race was measured at 61.6 percent of the eligible electorate, or 132.6 million voters. Comparing 2008 to 2010 also shows that youth and minority voting blocs for the most part stayed in the Democratic camp. According to polls, turnout for African-Americans and young voters declined from 13 to 10 percent and 10 to 5 percent of eligible voters in each category, respectively. In 2008, African-Americans voted for Democrats 93 percent of the time compared to Republicans who chose the GOP candidate 5 percent of the time. The change was modest in 2010, with African-Americans voting for the Democrat in 90 percent of the cases compared to 9 percent for Republicans. Likewise, voters ages 18 to 24 were overwhelmingly supportive of Democrats in 2008, with 62 percent of the vote. In 2010, they chose the Democratic candidate 58 percent of the time. The GOP choice rose among young voters modestly, from 35 percent in 2008 to 39 percent in 2010. Hispanic turnout was the same in both years at 8 percent, and the numbers changed only slightly from 68 percent of support for Democrats in 2008 to 65 percent in 2010. GOP support from Hispanics rose from 29 percent to 33 percent, belying the fact that several Hispanic candidates won Republican races, most notably the New Mexico and Nevada governors.

Which British rock band’s original line-up was Syd Barrett, Nick Mason, Roger Waters and Richard Wright????","completion":"The original line-up of the British rock band featuring Syd Barrett, Nick Mason, Roger Waters, and Richard Wright was none other than Pink Floyd. Formed in 1965, Pink Floyd is a legendary rock band known for their progressive, psychedelic music style, elaborate live shows, and thought-provoking concept albums. They are considered one of the most influential and groundbreaking groups in the history of rock music. Initially, the band was formed under the name \\"The Tea Set,\\" and later changed their name to \\"The Pink Floyd Sound,\\" inspired by the blues artists Pink Anderson and Floyd Council. Eventually, they shortened the name to \\"Pink Floyd.\\" The name change mirrored the transformation of their musical style from R&B covers to a more experimental sound, driven by Syd Barrett's unique approach to playing the guitar and his peculiar songwriting abilities. Syd Barrett was the lead vocalist, guitarist, and the main creative force behind the band during its early years. His inspired songwriting and innovative guitar techniques helped shape the band's early psychedelic sound, as heard on their debut album, \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,\\" released in 1967. This album received critical acclaim and established Pink Floyd as one of the leaders in Britain's emerging psychedelic rock movement. Nick Mason, the drummer, was the only constant member throughout the entire history of the band. His playing style contributed significantly to Pink Floyd's rhythms, and he contributed to the unique soundscapes that characterized the band's music. Roger Waters was the band's bassist and later became the primary lyricist after Barrett's departure. Besides his indispensable musical contributions, Waters was responsible for many of Pink Floyd's powerful conceptual themes, which dealt with socio-political issues, emotional struggles, and human existence as a whole. His time as the band's creative leader, especially during the late 1970s, resulted in some of the band's most iconic albums, such as \\"Animals,\\" \\"The Wall,\\" and \\"The Final Cut.\\" Richard Wright, the keyboardist, was vital in crafting Pink Floyd's signature atmospheric sound. Wright's use of various keyboard instruments, including the organ, piano, and the synthesizer, helped elevate the band's music to new heights. His contributions to the band's compositions, as well as his occasional roles as a lead vocalist, were essential to Pink Floyd's undeniable success. In 1968, due to mental health issues and erratic behavior, Syd Barrett left the band and was replaced by David Gilmour, who became a key figure in Pink Floyd's later years, taking over as the lead guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter alongside Waters. The band then transitioned from its psychedelic roots to a more progressive rock sound, resulting in classic albums such as \\"The Dark Side of the Moon,\\" \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" and \\"Animals.\\" Pink Floyd remains an iconic band with a massive influence on rock music history. The original line-up of Syd Barrett, Nick Mason, Roger Waters, and Richard Wright laid the groundwork for the band's continuing legacy and created a sound that has inspired countless musicians for generations to come."},{"prompt":"In this task, you are given a sentence in Persian, and your task is to translate it into English. قوانین هویت ملی‌ کشور تبعیض جنسی‌ دارد!","completion":"The national identity laws of the country have gender discrimination!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In August, the eight surviving members of the expedition returned to Fort Saint Louis, having never left East Texas.While La Salle was gone, six of those who had remained on the Belle finally arrived at Fort Saint Louis. According to them, the new captain of the Belle was always drunk. Many of the sailors did not know how to sail, and they grounded the boat on Matagorda Peninsula. The survivors took a canoe to the fort, leaving the ship behind. The destruction of their last ship left the settlers stranded on the Texas coast, with no hope of gaining assistance from the French colonies in the Caribbean Sea.By early January 1687, fewer than 45 of the original 180 people remained in the colony, which was beset by internal strife. La Salle believed that their only hope of survival lay in trekking overland to request assistance from New France, and some time that month he led a final expedition to try to reach the Illinois Country. Fewer than 20 people remained at Fort Saint Louis, primarily women, children, and those deemed unfit, as well as seven soldiers and three missionaries with whom La Salle was unhappy. Seventeen men were included on the expedition, including La Salle, his brother, and two of his nephews. While camping near present-day Navasota on March 18, several of the men quarreled over the division of buffalo meat. That night, an expedition member killed one of La Salle's nephews and two other men in their sleep. The following day La Salle was killed while approaching the camp to investigate his nephew's disappearance. Infighting led to the deaths of two other expedition members within a short time. Two of the surviving members, including Jean L'Archeveque, joined the Caddo. The remaining six men, led by Henri Joutel, made their way to Illinois Country. During their journey through...","completion":"Based on the context provided, the men who deserted did not tell anyone about La Salle's death in 1688. It was the remaining six men, led by Henri Joutel, who made their way to Illinois Country and possibly informed others about the unfortunate events, including La Salle's death."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Wallflowers are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1989 by singer-songwriter Jakob Dylan and guitarist Tobi Miller. The band has gone through a number of personnel changes but has remained centered on Dylan. After releasing their eponymous debut album in 1992, the Wallflowers released what would become their best-known and highest-selling album, Bringing Down the Horse in 1996, which featured songs such as \\"One Headlight\\" and \\"6th Avenue Heartache\\". They went on to release an additional three albums before going on a seven-year hiatus, beginning in 2006. In 2001, Jakob Dylan began writing for the Wallflowers' fourth album, Red Letter Days. Later that year while on tour with John Mellencamp, the band began recording using portable equipment. Some recording was also done at keyboardist Rami Jaffee's house. Once the band was finished touring for the year they began recording the bulk of the new record at Jackson Browne's studio in Santa Monica. By the time the Wallflowers had gotten into Browne's studio, Michael Ward had left the band, leaving them without a lead guitarist for the recording process. Dylan took on much of the lead guitar duties with Mike McCready, Rusty Anderson and Val McCallum also contributing on guitar. Moe Z M.D., who had been touring with Mellencamp, contributed additional percussion and background vocals to the album.Red Letter Days was produced by founding Wallflowers member Tobi Miller along with Bill Appleberry. Recording continued through the new year and was completed on April 12, 2002. The album was mixed by Tom Lord-Alge, who had mixed the band's previous two albums. Mixing was completed on May 15, 2002. While the Wallflowers were working on Red Letter Days, they recorded a cover of the Beatles' 1965 song \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" for the soundtrack to the 2001 film I Am Sam. The soundtrack was released on January 8, 2002. The first single from the Red Letter Days, \\"When You're On Top,\\" was released to radio on August 16, 2002. A music video directed by Marc Webb followed. After a few false starts, Red Letter Days was released on November 5, 2002. The album was met with mixed to positive reviews. Many critics noted the harder rock sound and catchy melodies used throughout the album. Commercial performance was relatively mixed as well, peaking at No.32 on the Billboard 200. Around the time of Red Letter Days' release the Wallflowers embarked on a monthlong U.S. tour stretching into early December. After another U.S. tour in January 2003, the Wallflowers toured in several European countries in February including Spain, Italy, Germany and Great Britain. After this tour, the Wallflowers' drummer since 1995, Mario Calire announced he was parting ways with the band. In 2003, the Wallflowers were featured on the soundtrack for the film American Wedding. The band recorded a cover of Van Morrison's 1970 song \\"Into the Mystic\\". The film's music department weren't able to secure the licensing rights to use Morrison's version so they enlisted the Wallflowers to cover the song. Both versions of the song were, however, featured in the film. most interesting aspect of the article?","completion":"The most interesting aspect of the article is the process of creating the Wallflowers' fourth album, Red Letter Days.

Pearlstein Live - washingtonpost.com Washington Post business columnist Steven Pearlstein was online Wednesday, May 9 at 11 a.m. ET to discuss the growing credibility gap of Washington trade associations who are supposed to oversee and set high standards for student loans, subprime loans and Medicare plans -- all industries that are currently under scrutiny. Read today's column: Industries Could Take Cues From Hollywood on Self-Control. About Pearlstein: Steven Pearlstein writes about business and the economy for The Washington Post. His journalism career includes editing roles at The Post and Inc. magazine. He was founding publisher and editor of The Boston Observer, a monthly journal of liberal opinion. He got his start in journalism reporting for two New Hampshire newspapers -- the Concord Monitor and the Foster's Daily Democrat. Pearlstein has also worked as a television news reporter and a congressional staffer. His column archive is online here. Danvers, Mass.: Yes. Filed this column under HTWW (How The World Works). But, the reason why, in the face of inevitable loss, businesses continue to act out your script ... could it have something to do with them taking enough money off the table before the regulatory costs finally arrive? Could it be that the judicial costs rarely amount to much in the cold calculation of rate of return on the corrupt deals? Steven Pearlstein: It is possible the profits made during the boom periods, when standards are lax, more than offset the \\"costs\\" of having to clean things up once the public and government turn against an industry. That would be an interesting calculation. But to do it, you have to consider a lot of intangibles, chief among them the reputation of the industry and its ability to lobby effectively across a range of issues in the future. Those issue can also involve big money, and losing on them because the industry is in bad odor can be expensive. There are also the impact on people's careers, and the ability to attract and retain people to the industry. I guess I have trouble believing at this point, for example, that the mortgage industy thinks it is better off the way things turned out than to have taken action to reign in some of the worst practices that led to the deterioration of underwriting standards. They would have foregone some business, but not enough to justify the cost of the collapse of the subprime market that has resulted, and the effect of that on the housing market, which in turn impacts the vitality of their basic prime mortgage businesses. Silver Spring, Md.: Great column Steve. But I have to ask... where were the regulators in all of this? You say trade associations are supposed to protect members from themselves, prevent things from getting to such a bad point, and it would be wonderful if that always worked. But while my tax dollars certainly shouldn't go to protect corporations from themselves, I'd sure be happy if some more of them went to protecting me, the consumer, from them! Where were the regulators that should have kept those student loan lenders from getting in bed with my college, so perhaps I'd have a more competative choice? Where were the regulators to prevent mortgage companies from marketing a half a million dollar mortgage for 1500 /month knowing darn well that many many people are not well versed enough in finance to realize that payment's going to double when the interest only period is over? What in the world happened to protecting consumers from these sorts of practices BEFORE they got out of hand that our only hope is trade assocations? Steven Pearlstein: That, of course, is a separate issue. The banking regulators were clearly not vigilant enough, and have effectively admitted as such. The regulators at the Department of Education look, at this point, as if they were in the business of protecting the industry rather than borrowers. The health care issue is more complicated. Some of it involves behavior of state-licensed brokers. The health insurance industry has set up best practices that many of them used to screen out business from bad brokers. But the issue there also concerns whether there should be so-called fee-for-service plans under the Medicare Advantage program, since the view of many who have looked at it is that these don't add any value to the traditional medicare program beyond additional benefits that are paid for by additional subsidies (minus, of course, a profit margin and administrative fees that are higher than the traditional Medicare program.) The health insurance industry has been vigorously defending these fast-growing fee for service programs, which as I indicated is very shortsighted, since the subsidies they receive are indefensible and they threaten political support for the larger Medicare Advantage program, which hold out the real promise of bringing the benefits of managed care to the Medicare program. Arlington, Va.: President Bush strongly favors industry self-regulation. It never seems to work. A corporation's profit motive isn't tempered ethics. Corporations understand two things when it comes to adhering to the law, jail and fines. While you praise Jack Valenti's ratings system, I don't think you'll find too many parents or filmakers who think it's helpful. Sure, he kept Congress out of an area they didn't want to go, but the ratings system is a joke. Steven Pearlstein: On the rating system, I think it does work in two ways. One, it has been well enforced and does give everyone -- not just parents by the way -- a sense of what they are getting into. But more important is that it has set a limit on how raunchy films can get, because the studios do anything to avoid an X rating. That sets a self-imposed limit. This has worked better with sex than with violence -- in fact, I wonder if there needs to be a violence equivalent of the X movie. And don't get me wrong. I'm not for self-regulation as a replacement for regulation in every case. Far from it. I'm only referring to the fact that, in their own self interest, industries should try to prevent the kind of competitive dynamic that sucks everyone into questionable practices or products that, in the long run, wind up costing the industry dearly. New York, N.Y.: Since 2003, the GSE's purchase close to 50 percent of all subprime loans annually and bundle them as mortgage-backed securities. At the same time, they refuse to purchase many prime loans to lower income borrowers because these prime loans appear to be less profitable for their quarterly earnings ledger sheets. As tax-exempt \\"Government Sponsored Enterprises\\" should Fannie and Freddie do business with predatory subprime lenders and turn a blind eye to affordable prime lenders who desperately need to benefit from the liquidity and excess capital the government subsidy provides the GSE's? - Cal Steven Pearlstein: First, GSE's aren't fully tax exempt. Fannie and Freddie, anyway, are exempt from state taxation, not federal. And their bonds are not tax exempt. But to your larger point, you are right. Fan and Fred, to different degrees, participated in packaging and marketing subprime mortgage packages to the bond market, and they weren't as effective in this area as they have been in the prime mortgage area in setting standards. Which, in a way is my point. Because Fan and Fred are the biggest and most powerful members of the MOrtgage Bankers Association, and they could have worked through that organization to set better standards and let the public know about companies that weren't meeting them. This second point is really crucial. Its not just a matter of having standards. Most associations have them. It is a matter of really making them stick with their members and bringing pressure on those that don't. That's where the opportunity is often missed, because it is very uncomfortable doing that. Bowie, Md.: The three industries you mention are all essentially financial middleman -- companies that don't do much except transfer funds, so there isn't a lot of overhead to enter the industry, or sunk-cost loss of getting out (like building a factory). Unlike the film industry, which owns lots of stuff, and in which unsucessful efforts are very expensive; isn't the problem with loans and health insurance that there just aren't many barriers to discourage unsuccessful particiaption? Steven Pearlstein: That's an interesting observation. I'm not sure where it goes, exactly, other than we expect financial intermediaries to be gatekeepers of sorts -- that's one of the reasons they deserve to get a fee -- and when they don't do this job, it can cause markets not to work in the way we expect. Great Falls, Va.: The question about the regulators is an important one, but the real weakness in the system is the regulatory framework instituted by Congress. The subprime mortgage situation has been a perfect example. Congress has held showy hearing after hearing, trying to show constituents that they care about major issues. And at each of those hearings, the Congressmen and Senators ignore the more well-measured responses and play to the camera by feigning indignation. Meanwhile, one could point out that Congress is invariably a decade late to investigate these issues, and while they hold hearings, business interests move on to their next ventures (some of which should probably be the subject of regulation, but won't be for years to come). By the time Congress gets around to acting, it will produce a watered-down regulatory framework that half-fixes older problems that may be moot anyway. You can't really blame Wall Street for holding Congress in disdain. They're not wrong in thinking that the legislators are too slow to respond, a bit too dim to understand the nuance of the issues, and more willing to produce sound bites than helpful regulation. With assistance like that, how can the regulators be expected to accomplish anything? Steven Pearlstein: You know, there's no one who can be as dismissive of Congress than I, but I wonder if they are really the major culprits here. Not having any oversight hearings for six years no doubt allowed regulators to fall into the natural trap of getting too cozy with the industries they are supposed to oversee. But Congress isn't the first line of regulatory defense. I think that's asking too much of them. An Adam Smith moment: I think what you've defined is the difference between self-interest and -enlightened- self-interest; short-term gains (splitting up the pie) vs. long-term industry health (baking a bigger pie). The movie industry was able to latch onto that longer-term view, probably because their products have a longer useful life, whereas the financial middlemen aren't interested in building a long-term customer base. Steven Pearlstein: Thanks, Mr. Smith. You said it better than I did. Washington, D.C.: Steve - Since we were never contacted for your opinion piece that indicts industry practice in the area of Medicare Advantage, I would like to ask you a simple question: At what point does your bias against a particular type of Medicare Advantage plan become a convenient route to besmirch an industry and its trade association for not doing the right thing - especially given the fact that this industry has led the way in improving the Medicare Part D program through intensive systems changes that have cost millions of dollars and also the Medicare Advantage program, which, in any form, provides better benefits for millions of beneficiaries? Steven Pearlstein: This is Mohit Ghose, from the American Heath Insurance Plans trade group, who took particular exception to my column today. I guess, Mohit, I would turn the question around: at what point does your bias in favor of fee-for-service Medicare plans, which siphon money away from other Medicare recipients, get in the way of your seeing the political damage they are causing for the more valuable private plans under Medicare Advantage? It is true I am biased against fee for service plans, because I have studied the criticism and your organization's defense of them, and find the defense very unconvincing. so did the Medicare advisory committee in its recent report, by the way. And as a columnist, I thought I was entitled to have and defend my biases. Anonymous: Steve - thanks for the response - Your column is about brokers and agent issues and the marketing of products. You can now make the issue the existence of private fee for service plans in Medicare Advantage, but that is not what your column was about. However, you indicted the industry for not remedying the issues in marketing, not for selling a product. And - people are entitled to their opinions about PFFS or MA in general, but that should not form the basis to say that the industry doesn't police itself - especially since the track record of the MA program shows that the satisfaction rates among beneficiaries are more than 80 percent across the board - precisely because of the better benefits that ALL plans provide - not just any one model - in the MA program. In fact, PFFS plans have chronic care management programs that are patient-centric, not physician centric because they have no networks. Additonally, PFFS plans and all other plans in MA are able to provide better benefits like vision, hearing and dental care which is not available in the regular FFS program. So, we believe that people should have the right information to make the most informed choice in their Medicare coverage - what we see is that people are choosing with their feet to join ALL MA products. Moreover, the industry has mechanisms in place to address the issues raised by the inappropriate marketing of all MA products, including services like call-backs to beneficiaries to confirm their choice and understanding, ride-alongs with brokers, monitoring of broker calls, and termination of contracts upon observed patterns of complaints. Steven Pearlstein: Mohit, The column wasn't just about marketing of products. It was also, in some instances, about the products themselves, such as subprime mortgages with no documentation and no money down. But I'm glad we have the opportunity here to hear/read what you have to say. Beaumont, Calif.: I agree with your concern Steve about any fee for service option under Medicare Advantage Programs. These managed care Medicare programs are why the average cost for seniors in California for medical coverage are less than most other States in the Union. They emphasize preventive care, annual physicals, shots and vaccinations, incentives for good behavior that reduce the end of life outrageous expenses, etc. I guess all of this reflects the sad state of affairs for the upcoming baby boomers in our country. The majority are way over weight, have no regular exercise programs, eat all the wrong foods, practice no preventive medicine - but they want a deal on real low cost medical insurance after the sad way in which they take care of themselves. To top it off, 75 percent of them have about 50,000 saved for their retirement. Give me a break! What has happened to personal accountability in this wonderful country of ours? Steven Pearlstein: Thanks. Didn't know that about California, which as you know, has more of a tradition of welcoming managed care than those of us in the East, where \\"chosing your own doctor\\" is considered to belong in the Bill of Rights!

Step 5: Add the text to complete the story: She poked her head out in time to see Stan run across the field, hurdling over rocks past a structure of stacked stones and into a thick wood. She climbed out of the tent into the sprinkling rain. The little fox was a few yards away, but Stan was no longer in sight. She hollered out his name a few more times, unsure whether she should search for him or wait in the tent for his return. As the raindrops grew heavier, so did her concern. Shivering and with a deep breath, she decided that waiting was not an option - she had to find Stan. Step 6: Justification I added a more heightened sense of urgency for the protagonist, as she observes the rain and becomes worried for Stan. This prompts her to make the decision to search for him rather than wait in the tent, justifying her choice as the story continues."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: Retired boxing champ Mike Tyson has been left \\"totally broke\\" after years of excessive spending and lives pay check to pay check to cover his monthly expenses. The sporting icon's legacy has been marred by a series of alcohol and drug-related arrests throughout the years and his wild lifestyle away from the ring led to him filing for bankruptcy in 2003. He was inspired to turn his life around after landing a role playing himself in the hit 2009 comedy The Hangover, but he insists he is still struggling to make ends meet, despite recently scoring his own reality TV show about his love of bird racing. However, Tyson insists he is happy with his new frugal way of living and is simply thankful to have been given a second chance at life with his third wife Lakiha Spicer. Appearing on The View on Friday, he says, \\"I'm totally destitute and broke. But I have an awesome life; I have an awesome wife who cares about me.\\" Asked if he has enough money in the bank to tie him over between jobs, Tyson replies, \\"No, I'm totally broke. I had a lot of fun. It (going broke) just happened. I'm very grateful. I don't deserve to have the wife that I have; I don't deserve the kids that I have, but I do, and I'm very grateful.\\" Tyson is dad to five children from various relationships, including his 16-month-old daughter, Milan, with Spicer.

I'm never gonna use again,\\" he said, his voice cracking more.Those in attendance applauded, and some stood, impressed with the frailty and honesty and rawness on display.Follow Woods on Twitter. ||||| Mike Tyson said he’s been lying about being sober and is on the verge of death because of alcoholism. During a startling news conference at the Turning Stone Resort in New York, Tyson said he hasn’t had any alcohol or drugs for six days, which for him is “a miracle,” and he seemed to plea for forgiveness for being “a bad guy.” Tyson has lived an alternately crushing and soaring life. By the age of 16, his mother was dead and his father was locked up. Boxing trainer Cus D’Amato took him in and Tyson became “Iron” Mike, the most feared boxer in the world. That all imploded when he was convicted of rape in 1992. When he got out of prison, he recovered as a boxer to the point he fought Evander Holyfield twice, in two of the biggest fights of all time. Holyfield won the first fight by TKO, and the second one was the night a desperate Tyson took a bite of Holyfield’s ear, establishing him as one of the craziest guys in sports. Tyson’s boxing career slowly and sadly eroded, and he began stacking pounds on top of pounds of fat. He weighed 380 pounds at one point. He’s 5-foot-10. All that boxing money was going out as soon as it was coming in, and Tyson soon found himself broke, disgraced and addicted. And then, miraculously, Tyson became one of the most beloved characters in pop culture. He started getting acting roles, and he did well in them. His turn as himself in “The Hangover” was wonderful. He did a one-man Broadway show, turned into a film by Spike Lee that will air on HBO. Tyson appeared on FOX Sports Live during its first week and next month will be seen on FOX Sports 1 in the documentary series “Being: Mike Tyson”. Video: Mike Tyson joins Fox Sports Live - part 1 THE GREATS Where do Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali rank among the Where do Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali rank among the best boxers of all time All in all, it has looked like the manifestation of a full comeback. Not as Iron Mike, but as our charmingly screwed-up cousin. Tyson’s candor and self-awareness have served him well in his post-boxing life, but every now and then it seems like Tyson wants to remind everybody that he’s still a deeply hurt, deeply troubled person. On top of his aforementioned troubles, he's endured two broken marriages and the death of a 4-year-old daughter, and has been diagnosed as bi-polar. “I’m a bad guy sometimes,” he said. “I did a lot of bad things, and I want to be forgiven. So in order for me to be forgiven, I hope they can forgive me. I wanna change my life, I wanna live a different life now. I wanna live my sober life. I don’t wanna die. I’m on the verge of dying, because I’m a vicious alcoholic.\\" It is not surprising to see Tyson unload all that weight during a news conference that I’m sure was expected to be sort of silly and whimsical. This was at a casino. But Tyson always has had a tendency to drop his baggage in the middle of the lobby. His many confessions have tended to come straight out of nowhere, which is probably a big part of the reason people like him now. He does not appear to be orchestrating some kind of thing in the media. Some people have grandparents like this, who without any context will blurt out some old secret and then just move on like nothing happened. There’s a lot of that in Tyson’s public appearances over the years. FALLS FROM GRACE Some sports icons were on top of the world until they lost respect with these Some sports icons were on top of the world until they lost respect with these epic falls from grace It has endeared him to a public that once considered him a lowlife, but it sounds like Tyson is having a hard time trusting that. Tyson described a recent conflict and how he resolved it. He was vague about the conflict, but not how he felt about it. ”I hate myself,” he said. “I’m trying to kill myself. I hate myself a lot. But I made myself proud of myself, and I don’t do that much.” |||||","completion":"A famous retired boxer named Mike Tyson spent too much money and had problems with alcohol and drugs.

The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word \\"cult\\" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an \\"ad hominem\\" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices. Cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions. - Carol Patricia Mas (born October 20, 1955), professionally known as Carolyne Mas, is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, pianist, and producer. She broke out of the Greenwich Village music scene boom of the late 1970s, along with other artists such as Steve Forbert, The Roches, and Willie Nile. Although she remains relatively unknown in the United States, except for a loyal cult of fans, she managed to gain popularity in Europe and Canada, mostly due to the use of television as a promotional tool in these markets. Her records did well in the charts in Canada, but her greatest success was in Germany, where a live album, \\"Mas Hysteria\\", was released by Phonogram. It was originally intended to promote her upcoming appearance on Rockpalast in January 1981, and included her most significant hit, \\"Sittin' in the Dark\\". - Willie Nile (born Robert Noonan on June 7, 1948) is an American singer-songwriter.

В прошлые времена, прежде чем электронные калькуляторы и компьютеры стали распространенными инструментами для решения математических задач, люди использовали логарифмические линейки, чтобы выполнить вычисления. Логарифмическая линейка - это аналоговый вычислительный инструмент, состоящий из двух масштабных линеек с наметками, которые представлены в виде логарифмической шкалы. Логарифмическая линейка была изобретена английским математиком Эдмундом Гюнтером в 1620-х годах и с тех пор значительно развилась. Инженеры и ученые широко пользовались логарифмическими линейками весь XX век, и именно этот инструмент был основным способом относительно быстрых вычислений до 1970-х годов, когда были разработаны доступные электронные калькуляторы. Логарифмическая линейка позволяла выполнять различные операции, такие как сложение, вычитание, умножение, деление, возведение в степень, извлечение корня и многие другие. Для этого надо было перемещать одну из линеек относительно другой, а затем считывать соответствующие значения с логарифмической шкалы. Несмотря на тот факт, что логарифмические линейки не так точны, как электронные калькуляторы, они предоставляли достаточный уровень точности для большинства инженерных и научных расчетов. В конечном итоге, с ростом сложности вычислительной техники и появлением доступных электронных калькуляторов, логарифмические линейки стали менее популярными и в настоящее время являются скорее уникальными предметами коллекционирования и обучающими инструментами, чем практическими вычислительными аппаратами."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In addition to the administrative capacity to implement legislation, Gunlick emphasizes that strong Länder should also possess fiscal capacity, which includes the ability to pay for the implemented legislation using own-source revenues. Delving deeper into Gunlick's assertion, we can understand that the German system of dual federalism has unique requirements for its strong Länder. Both administrative and fiscal capacities are crucial for the efficient functioning of the system. Here's a more elaborated explanation of these capacities: 1. Administrative capacity: This refers to the ability of the Länder to create, manage, and enforce laws and regulations within their jurisdictions. In a dual federal system, it becomes necessary for the Länder to have a robust administrative structure that supports the execution of policies, ensuring that the regulations are well-coordinated and cater to the local requirements. This is vital in maintaining a balance of power between the federal and state governments. 2. Fiscal capacity: This aspect of the Länder's capacity refers to the financial resources they have at their disposal, either through taxation or other sources of revenue. The fiscal capacity of the Länder is crucial for them to implement and maintain the laws and regulations they create. By having the ability to generate own-source revenues, Länder can finance the programs and public services they administer, ensuring that they're financially independent and sustainable. This financial autonomy is a cornerstone of dual federalism, allowing Länder to tailor their policies and services to their specific needs without relying heavily on the federal government for funding. In conclusion, according to Gunlick, the German system of dual federalism requires strong Länder not only to possess the capacity to implement legislation but also to have the administrative and fiscal capacities to enforce and fund it, thereby promoting a healthy balance of power between the central and state governments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Melanie reached out after the tragic death of L’Wren Scott, Mick’s partner of 13 years, and their relationship developed. They were pictured at the time cuddled up on the penthouse balcony of Mick’s luxury Zurich hotel. Friends said she put a smile back on his face after months of mourning L’Wren. Melanie is one of the top ballet dancers in the US and was engaged to Cuban classical dancer José Manuel Carreño up until early 2014. The glamorous pair were among the star couples on the US dance circuit, often attending society parties. Nigel Norrington 6 In action . . .

This article: Like other Spanish liberals, Goya was left in a difficult position after the French invasion. He had supported the initial aims of the French Revolution, and hoped its ideals would help liberate Spain from feudalism to become a secular, democratic political system. There were two conflicts being fought in Spain: the resistance against the French threat, and a domestic struggle between the ideals of liberal modernisation and the pre-political incumbent ruling class. The latter divide became more pronounced—and the differences far more entrenched—following the eventual withdrawal of the French.Several of Goya's friends, including the poets Juan Meléndez Valdés and Leandro Fernández de Moratín, were overt afrancesados: the supporters (or collaborators, in the view of many) of Joseph Bonaparte. He maintained his position as court painter, for which an oath of loyalty to Joseph was necessary. However, Goya had an instinctive dislike of authority, and witnessed first-hand the subjugation of his countrymen by French troops. During these years he painted little aside from portraits of figures from all parties, including an allegorical painting of Joseph Bonaparte in 1810, Wellington from 1812 to 1814, and French and Spanish generals. Meanwhile, Goya was working on drawings that would form the basis for The Disasters of War. He visited many battle sites around Madrid to witness the Spanish resistance. The final plates are testament to what he described as \\"el desmembramiento d'España\\"—the dismemberment of Spain. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that maintained his position as court painter?, what is it ?

The Duke of Wellington is often incorrectly quoted as saying that \\"The Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing-fields of Eton\\". Wellington was at Eton from 1781 to 1784 and was to send his sons there. According to Nevill (citing the historian Sir Edward Creasy), what Wellington said, while passing an Eton cricket match many decades later, was, \\"There grows the stuff that won Waterloo\\", a remark Nevill construes as a reference to \\"the manly character induced by games and sport\\" amongst English youth generally, not a comment about Eton specifically. In 1889, Sir William Fraser conflated this uncorroborated remark with the one attributed to him by Count Charles de Montalembert's \\"C'est ici qu'a été gagné la bataille de Waterloo\\" (\\"It is here that the Battle of Waterloo was won.\\") In what year was Charles de Montalembert made a Duke?

Ne dorim o strategie de negociere realistă şi care poate fi pusă în practică, dar cum nu au fost stabilite priorităţi clare în acest raport, suntem de părere că acest obiectiv nu a fost îndeplinit. Translate this to English?","completion":"We desire a realistic and practical negotiation strategy, but since clear priorities have not been established in this report, we believe that this objective has not been achieved. Here is a more detailed and longer explanation: We understand the importance of developing a negotiation strategy that is both realistic and capable of being implemented effectively. In order to achieve this, it is crucial to establish a set of clear priorities that all parties can agree upon, providing a solid foundation for the strategy. These priorities should accurately reflect the goals and objectives of the negotiation process, addressing the needs and concerns of all involved parties. However, the issue at hand is that the report, as it currently stands, fails to provide such a framework for establishing clear priorities. This can lead to confusion and misalignment among the parties, as well as inefficiency in the negotiation process. Without a common understanding of the main priorities, it becomes much more difficult to develop a cohesive and effective negotiation strategy. For a negotiation strategy to be successful, it must take into account several key factors. First and foremost, the strategy needs to be adaptable to the constantly changing dynamics and circumstances surrounding the negotiation. This includes the interests and agendas of the various parties involved, as well as any potential external factors that may impact the process. In addition, the negotiation strategy should ideally be rooted in a collaborative approach, fostering open communication and information sharing among all parties. This allows for the development of mutual trust and a greater likelihood of reaching an agreement that is satisfactory to all. Effective negotiation strategies also require a deep understanding of the issues at hand, as well as familiarity with the various bargaining tactics and techniques commonly used in negotiations. This knowledge can be invaluable in helping negotiators make informed decisions and navigate potential pitfalls. Overall, a well-thought-out and realistic negotiation strategy hinges on a clear set of priorities that are agreed upon by all parties. In order to achieve the desired outcome, this crucial foundation must first be laid and thoroughly discussed. In the absence of clearly defined priorities, the strategic goals of the negotiation process may not be well-defined, ultimately leading to a less effective and less successful negotiation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a detailed breakdown: - \\"AKP\\" stays the same, as it is the proper abbreviation for the \\"Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi\\" (Justice and Development Party in English) in Turkish. - \\"enjoys\\" can be translated as \\"sahip olmak\\" which means \\"to possess\\" or \\"to have\\" in Turkish. In the context of majority, it becomes \\"sahip olmak\\" as a verb and \\"sahip olduğu\\" as a relative clause. - \\"a 368-seat parliamentary majority\\" can be translated as \\"368 sandalyeli bir parlamento çoğunluğu\\". In Turkish, the adjective (368 sandalyeli) comes before the noun (parlamento çoğunluğu). - \\"allowing\\" can be translated as \\"olanak tanıyan\\" which means \\"enabling\\" or \\"providing the opportunity\\" in Turkish. - \\"it to amend\\" becomes \\"değiştirmesine\\" in Turkish. The verb \\"değiştirmek\\" means \\"to change\\" or \\"to amend\\", and the suffix \\"–me\\" indicates the action is potential. The additional \\"sine\\" allows the phrase to be used depending on context as “its amend.” - \\"the country's constitution\\" translates as \\"ülkenin anayasası\\".

The premise asserts that the GPRA is the primary legislative framework for agencies to set strategic goals, measure performance, and report on their progress towards achieving these goals. 2. The hypothesis, on the other hand, contradicts this by asserting that the GPRA is not the primary legislative framework.

The premise states that \\"two soldiers stand in front of a pile of children's toys,\\" but it does not provide any context as to where these soldiers are or why they are in this situation. The hypothesis suggests that \\"children are waiting in line to see Santa.\\" While it is possible that this might be the case, the premise does not provide any evidence to support or refute this hypothesis directly. For the hypothesis to be true, we would expect some information about the presence of children, the location (such as a mall or holiday event), or a reference to Santa. Furthermore, the presence of soldiers is not common in typical Santa Claus scenarios, where children wait in line to see Santa. Soldiers could be present for various reasons, such as a toy drive event, a military base holiday celebration, or even as an unrelated occurrence, like a security detail or event guards. The premise does not provide us with any contextual information about the soldiers or their intentions. So, even though the premise and the hypothesis might be related in some way, we cannot confirm the truth of the hypothesis based solely on the information provided in the premise. In conclusion, the premise alone does not tell us whether the hypothesis is true. Additional context and information would be required to make an accurate determination.

Like our sun, stars are unbelievably hot furnaces that burn their own matter as fuel. When most of the fuel is used up, the star begins to die. The death of a star is not a quiet event. First there is a huge explosion. As its outer layer is blasted off into space, the dying star shines as brightly as a billion suns. After the explosion gravity pulls in what's left of the star. As the outside of the star sinks toward the center, the star gets smaller and smaller. The material the star is made of becomes tightly packed together. A star is so dense that a teaspoon of matter from it weighs billion of pounds. The more the star shrinks, the stronger the gravity inside it becomes. Soon the star is very tiny, and the gravity pulling it in is unbelievably strong. In fact, the gravity is so strong that it even pulls light into the star! Since all the light is pulled in, none can go out. The star becomes black when there is no light. Then a black hole is born! That's what we know about black holes. What we don't know is this: What happens inside a black hole after the star has been squeezed into a tiny ball? Does it keep getting smaller and smaller forever? Such a possibility is hard to imagine. But if the black hole doesn't keep shrinking, what happens to it? Some scientists think black holes are like doorways to another world. They say that as the star disappears from our universe, it goes into another universe. In other words a black hole in our universe could turn into a \\"white hole\\" in a different universe. As the black hole swallows light, the white hole shines brightly--somewhere else. But where? A different place, perhaps, or a different time -- many years in the past or future.

Based on the paragraph provided, digestion is a process that consists of both mechanical and chemical components. Mechanical digestion occurs in the mouth and stomach, where food is physically broken down into smaller pieces through actions like chewing and the churning motion of the stomach. Chemical digestion, on the other hand, takes place primarily in the small intestine. This process involves breaking down food molecules into simpler components with the help of enzymes and other substances. In the small intestine, the food is exposed to various enzymes and fluids that are secreted by accessory organs like the pancreas and liver. These fluids aid in the process of digestion, allowing the body to efficiently absorb nutrients and expel waste products. To recap, among the choices provided, the small intestine is the correct answer as it is the primary location where chemical digestion occurs in the human digestive system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Snowshoes sometimes colloquially referred to as webs are footwear for walking over snow Add punctuation","completion":"\\"Snowshoes,\\" sometimes colloquially referred to as \\"webs,\\" are footwear for walking over snow. Snowshoes raise one's foot above the snow, spreading out the weight over a larger area in order to avoid sinking into the snow. This technique, known as 'flotation', enables the person wearing the snowshoes to traverse snowy areas that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to traverse on traditional footwear alone (due to the person's weight causing them to sink into the snow). Snowshoes, although simple in their design, have a large impact on the ability to navigate in snowy conditions. There are numerous types of snowshoes available, but they generally all possess the same key design features: a robust frame that provides the necessary support and flotation, and a decking system (the part of the shoe that touches the snow) which can be made of a variety of materials but usually is a tough, synthetic material, designed to resist tears, punctures and general wear and tear from usage. The origins of the snowshoe can be traced back thousands of years to societies living in snowy environments. Originally, it is believed the snowshoes were developed by indigenous peoples of North America, who required the assistance of these devices to hunt and travel in the heavy snowfall areas. Over time, the use of snowshoes spread to other cultures and reached Europe, where they became an essential tool for winter survival and travel. Modern day snowshoes have seen significant improvements in design, function, and materials used. There are now a variety of models designed to cater for different snow conditions and individual preferences, ranging from models with crampons (metal claws) for better grip in icy conditions, to lightweight models for sports such as snowshoe running and racing. Despite these advancements, the basic principle remains the same; to allow users to walk on snow without sinking or slipping. In conclusion, snowshoes, or \\"webs\\" as they are sometimes referred to, are an incredibly important innovation in footwear that allow us to traverse snow considerably easier than we could without them. Their history is vibrant, rooted in survival and adaptation, and their presence is still very much evident in today's society—particularly in places where heavy snowfall is a common occurrence."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: U.S. Republican presidential candidate and former Governor Jeb Bush speaks at the North Texas Presidential Forum hosted by the Faith & Freedom Coalition and Prestonwood Baptist Church in Plano, Texas October 18, 2015. WASHINGTON Republican Jeb Bush's struggling presidential campaign is cutting salaries across the board and reducing staff in a money-saving effort intended to concentrate resources on early voting states, an internal memo said on Friday. The memo, seen by Reuters, said payroll costs were being slashed by 40 percent and staff at the campaign's Miami headquarters drastically cut back with some workers offered positions at reduced pay in states that vote early in the nominating process, such as New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina and Nevada. The move follows a dramatic fall in Republican voters' support for Bush's attempt to secure his party's nomination for the November 2016 election and to become the third member of the famous Bush family to win the White House. \\"We are making changes today to ensure Jeb is best positioned to win the nomination and general election,\\" the memo said. Once considered the heavy favorite for the nomination, the former Florida governor is running far behind poll leaders Donald Trump and Ben Carson in national polls and in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states on the 2016 election nominating calendar. Now, Bush is facing questions as to whether he has the ability to remain a viable candidate. A key test will be next week when he appears on stage with his rivals at the third Republican debate, in Boulder, Colorado. Appearing at a forum on Friday at Regent University in Virginia Beach, Virginia, Bush was asked by moderator Pat Robertson whether the cost-cutting was aimed at making his campaign leaner \\"or does this mean you're in trouble?\\" \\"This means lean and mean and means that I have the ability to adapt,\\" Bush said. \\"I have not met a person who thought Donald Trump would be the front-running candidate at this point. God bless him for his success in that regard. We'll see how long it lasts. But you have to adapt.\\" In a poll of likely Iowa Republican caucus participants released on Thursday by Quinnipiac University, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson led the Republican field with 28 percent support, followed by Trump at 20 percent. Bush was tied in sixth place with former business executive Carly Fiorina with 5 percent. Bush's move to reduce expenses comes a month after the departure from the race of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who ran out of cash. \\"If you do the right thing about budget cuts at the right time, they don't necessarily affect your chances,\\" said Republican strategist Charlie Black, citing the examples of Ronald Reagan in 1979 and John McCain in 2007. DONOR RETREAT THIS WEEKEND Bush's heavy policy focus has shown him to be among the more serious candidates in the Republican field, but he has often been drowned out by Trump's bombastic rhetoric and has lacked the polished communication skills of rivals such as U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Bush announced last week that his third-quarter fund-raising was 13.4 million, a competitive sum but not enough to finance the large campaign operation he had built. As of last week he had 10 million in cash on hand. \\"It's no secret that the contours of this race have changed from what was anticipated at the start,\\" the memo said. The Bush campaign also sought to reassure donors who have started to doubt that their candidate still has a path to the nomination. Bush and his senior aides are staging a two-day donor retreat in Houston on Sunday and Monday that will feature appearances by his father, former President George H.W. Bush, and his brother former President George W. Bush. The retreat will give donors a sense of where the campaign stands now and what is planned for the next 100 days, an aide said. The staff deployments from Miami will have a special focus on increasing the Bush presence in New Hampshire. Bush will make more trips to the early voting states as well. \\"We are unapologetic about adjusting our game plan to meet the evolving dynamics of this race to ensure that outcome,\\" the memo said. The cost-cutting moves were welcome in the Bush donor community, where there have been concerns about his prospects. \\"I particularly appreciate that this strategy shift was quick, strategic and bold. As a donor, I am thrilled to see the campaign focus the lion's share of resources on voter contact and this will redirect energy to early states,\\" said Slater Bayliss, a Florida lobbyist who is bundling donations for Bush.

The campaign is removing some senior staff from the payroll, parting ways with some consultants, and downsizing its Miami headquarters to save more than 1 million per month and cut payroll by 40 percent this week, according to Bush campaign officials who requested anonymity to speak about internal changes. Senior leadership positions remain unchanged. The campaign is also cutting back 45 percent of its budget, except for dollars earmarked for TV advertising and spending for voter contacts, such as phone calls and mailers. Some senior-level staff and consultants will continue to work with the campaign on a volunteer basis, while other junior-level consultants, primarily in finance but including other areas, will be let go, the officials said. The officials declined to say who would be removed from the payroll or provide an exact dollar figure for the savings. (A summary of the changes, provided to Bloomberg Politics by the campaign, is posted here.) Bush's advisers, under pressure from their donors and from falling and stagnant poll numbers, have been discussing ways to retool the campaign in recent days, and came to the conclusion that a course correction was essential. While recent tangles with Donald Trump have energized the campaign, Bush's senior team recognized a more fundamental set of changes was required that didn't involve dealing directly with the party's surprising—and surprisingly durable—front-runner. \\"The circumstances when we started the election were different,\\" Bush told Pat Robertson in an interview at Regent University hours after news of the shakeup broke. \\"I have not met a person that thought that Donald Trump would be the front running candidate at this point. God bless him for his success in that regard, we’ll see how long that lasts. But you have to adapt.” He said his new \\"lean and mean\\" campaign will allow him to do that. \\"Every dollar we can save in overhead is a dollar that goes on television, goes on radio, goes on media, goes on voter outreach,\\" Bush added. Analysts and rival campaigns will view the changes as a desperate act, perhaps the last one, of a man whose campaign has dropped in the polls in recent months and has remained mired in the middle of a crowded field despite a month-long blitz of friendly television ads. None of the changes deal directly with what even many of Bush's supporters say is his main challenge: The burden of trying to convince voters hungry for change to choose a man whose father and brother both served as president. Officials said the changes—the second time the campaign has cuts its payroll this year—will enable them to shift more resources into New Hampshire, where the campaign has the largest operation in the state, and other states where early voters begin casting ballots in February. There will be more volunteers and surrogates for Bush, which the campaign refers to as “friends of Jeb,” on the ground to help in a state that his brother lost in 2000 and his father won in 1988. One Bush adviser told Bloomberg Politics in an interview Friday morning that the team was “unapologetic” about the changes, saying the moves were from a “position of strength.” “This is about winning the race,” the adviser said. “We’re doing it now and making the shifts with confidence. We expect to win.” Bush plans to continue to focus on a core message that argues that he has experience to make the kinds of fundamental changes voters want to see in Washington. The campaign changes reflect that, an adviser said. Get the latest on global politics in your inbox, every day. Get our newsletter daily. The campaign claims to have the most extensive field operation in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada, states with the first four nominating contests. Bush had 10.3 million available for the primary race as of Oct. 1, about the same as U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, but less than U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and Dr. Ben Carson. Right to Rise USA, the super-PAC being run by Mike Murphy, raised 103 million in the first six months of the year. Still, many thought Bush would keep the pole position heading into the 2016 primary calendar. But the former Florida governor and his advisers had little choice but to make the changes to redirect resources and attempt to create a new narrative for the campaign before the Feb. 1 caucuses in Iowa and—more importantly for Bush—the Feb. 9 primary in New Hampshire. In a presidential campaign cycle that has already seen stunning twists and turns, to see the presumed establishment front-runner, whose strength was based in part on his fundraising capacity, have to make these kinds of cuts, is one of the most surprising developments so far. One of Bush's rivals, Carson, who leads in a new Bloomberg Politics/Des Moines Register Iowa Poll, was taken aback in an interview Friday morning that Bush is being forced to make some changes. “This is a little bit surprising, but you know a lot of his money, of course, was super-PAC money as opposed to campaign money,” Carson said in an interview that will air on With All Due Respect today on Bloomberg TV. “That doesn't give you as much flexibility, quite frankly.” The campaign said its internal measures showed that the month-long run of TV advertising is having an impact. “We need to double down and triple down in the early states,” another Bush official said. Bush, who aides said was actively involved in the decision to cut back, will spend less time raising money and more time engaged in retail political events, such as town halls, meet-and-greets, and one-on-one meetings, advisers said. Although Bush's long-time political adviser, Murphy, who now runs the pro-Bush super-PAC backing his candidacy, told Bloomberg Politics recently that Bush's strength in the March contests would earn him the nomination, the changes are an acknowledgement that Bush needs to first improve his standing in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada. Symbolically, the changes turn Bush from an establishment battleship into a more scrappy underdog, making radical alterations in how the campaign operates in order to avoid the existential threat the campaign now faces. When his brother George W. Bush ran for president in 2000, he was the fundraising leader from start to finish and never had to contemplate such draconian cuts. The changes come a week after Danny Diaz, Bush’s campaign manager, sought to ease concerns about the amount of cash being spent by pointing to campaign’s robust operation in states with the earliest primary contests. Polls from Bloomberg Politics this week showed Bush in fifth place in Iowa and a distant third in New Hampshire. (Contributing: Arit John) ||||| (Steve Marcus/Las Vegas Sun via AP) Jeb Bush is shaking up his struggling presidential campaign, ordering across-the-board pay cuts, downsizing his headquarters staff, cutting ties with some consultants and refocusing his efforts on retail campaigning and on-the-ground organizing in the early voting states. Bush's major course correction, first reported Friday by Bloomberg Politics, comes as the onetime front-runner languishes in the single digits in polls and struggles to catch on with Republican voters. The former Florida governor's fundraising slowed over the summer, and his donors and other supporters have grown concerned about his standing in the race. In a statement Friday morning announcing the moves, campaign spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said, \\"We are making changes today to ensure Jeb is best positioned to win the nomination and general election. Jeb is the one candidate with a proven conservative record, bold ideas and the strong leadership needed to fix the problems America faces. We are moving our resources into the states to ensure that voters in primary and caucus states are introduced to his record and vision for the future.\\" The campaign, which entered October with 10.3 million in the bank, is taking significant steps to curtail spending. It is slashing its budget, excluding media and voter contact efforts, by 45 percent from its June plans, and is reducing ties to some consultants to eliminate what the campaign sees as extraneous overhead costs. The campaign also is reducing payroll by 40 percent, including salary cuts for every employee save the most entry-level staffers. Only 25 percent of the staff will remain at the Miami headquarters, with another 25 percent already in early voting states, and the majority of remaining staff offered positions in the states or as part of a ballot access team at a reduced wage. The campaign also will cut travel expenses by 20 percent and overhaul Bush's schedule, shifting focus from fundraising events to make space on the candidate's calendar for more town hall meetings and other retail campaign stops in the early voting states. In a two-page memorandum outlining talking points for supporters, the Bush campaign cast the changes as \\"deft\\" moves to position Bush for the long haul. The campaign is doubling down on its organizing efforts in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, as well as its investments in data and digital programs. The campaign is placing what it calls \\"a special focus\\" on its New Hampshire operation, which already includes 12 paid staffers. The Bush team has long eyed the Granite State's primary as his best opportunity for an early victory. \\"We are in this campaign to win,\\" read the memorandum. \\"We will take every single step necessary to ensure Jeb is the Republican nominee and next President of the United States. We are unapologetic about adjusting our game plan to meet the evolving dynamics of this race to ensure that outcome.\\" Bush plans to adjust his message on the campaign trail to better woo voters, according to the memorandum. The campaign will deliver several direct pitches to voters, including \\"Jeb Can Fix It,\\" arguing that after President Obama's two terms Bush is the only candidate in the 2016 field who can \\"fix\\" what he sees as broken in Washington. Bush also will make an \\"experience vs. experiment\\" argument, comparing his Florida record to his opponents who have less experience in government or who \\"cannot be trusted.\\" Bush has been considered the fundraising leader of the Republican field in large part because of the 103 million he raised in the first six months of this year for his allied super PAC, Right to Rise, which can accept unlimited donations. But Bush has had a harder time raising money for his official campaign, for which donations are capped under federal law at 2,700 per person. The campaign raised 13.4 million in July, August and September — a solid haul, but not enough to maintain the kind of national campaign infrastructure he had been building in Miami and the early voting states. Bush has raised just 5 percent of his primary money from donors who gave him 200 or less so far this year, for a total of 1.2 million in all. Even former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee beat him in small donations, collecting 1.3 million so far, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute. Such a tiny base of grass-roots support can be perilous for a campaign, which needs to be able to rely on a constant infusion of cash as it expands. This is the second round of belt-tightening in Bush's campaign. In August, some top aides had their salaries shaved, and there were other targeted cutbacks to create a more lean operation, as The New York Times first reported, though Friday's announcement is far more sweeping. Two people familiar with the campaign said they were not surprised by the news. \\"This necessary tightening has been in the works for a while,\\" said one, who, along with his colleague, asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak about the changes. The extent of the cuts, hefty for some senior staffers, became evident in the last few days through conversations with campaign advisers grumbling about the cuts. The announcement comes ahead of a quarterly strategy summit with major supporters in Houston this weekend, where top donors will hear updates from senior campaign officials and visit with members of the Bush family, including former president George H.W. Bush and former president George W. Bush.

We have made investments that have allowed us to do what serious, national campaigns must do to be competitive in the primary and general elections, including: o o o o Growing a real ground game in the early primary and caucus states; Building a sophisticated data and digital operation; Rolling out a serious policy agenda; Getting on the ballot in every state in the nation. • It’s no secret that the contours of this race have changed from what was anticipated at the start. We would be less than forthcoming if we said we predicted in June that a reality television star supporting Canadian-­‐style single-­‐payer health care and partial-­‐birth abortion would be leading the GOP Primary. • Ensuring we are in the most competitive position possible in this unpredictable field requires we remain as deft as possible, making strategic decisions quickly and intelligently. • We are in this campaign to win. We will take every single step necessary to ensure Jeb is the Republican nominee and next President of the United States. We are unapologetic about adjusting our game plan to meet the evolving dynamics of this race to ensure that outcome. • In order to achieve this end, the campaign is making aggressive changes to our campaign structure, putting as much money as possible into voter contact, and winning primaries and caucuses. Campaign Structure: • Over the last four months, our team has consistently reviewed our budget and made spending reductions, including: budget cuts by department and salary reductions to senior and mid-­‐level staffers. • Today, we are expanding those reductions in order to maximize our resources where they matter most: voter contact and personnel in the early states to ensure we can be successful in the primaries and caucuses. • To achieve that objectives we are making the following changes: o Reducing payroll costs by 40% this week; o Cutting salaries across the board, with all but the most entry level staff taking cuts; o Downsizing our headquarters staff: 25% is remaining in headquarters, 25% of our staff is already in the states; the vast majority of the remaining staff is being offered a position in the early states or as part of our ballot access efforts at a reduced salary; o Cutting travel costs by 20%; o Eliminating other extraneous overhead costs entirely, cutting 45% of our non media/voter contact budget from our original June planning. • • We continue to have a strong national finance operation that will ensure Jeb remains competitive by every measure, through the primary and onto victory next November. Just last week announced that we had raised more than 13 million for the third quarter with 10 million in the bank, and continue with aggressive fundraising today and moving forward. We already have the most extensive field operations in all four early primary states, and as we now move closer to voting season, we are going to grow the further. o o o o Iowa – 10 paid staffers, 2 offices – Jeb’s ground game is the “best campaign in the bracket.” according to Iowa conservative journalist Craig Robinson. New Hampshire – 12 paid staffers, 1 office – “Jeb grows ground operation, biggest in the state.” South Carolina – 8 paid staffers, 3 offices – Expanded grassroots teams in South Carolina. Nevada – 8 paid staffers, 2 offices – “When you ask voters in NV which campaign they are hearing from, the most common answer is Bush.” • With staff deployments from headquarters, we are placing a special focus on increasing our New Hampshire operation – already the most significant in the field – to ensure it remains that way, from now until February. • Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada can expect to see more visits from Jeb and longer trips. We will use the campaign’s best asset – Jeb Bush – and put him in front of as many voters as possible. Strategic Positioning: Jeb Can Fix It • For these operational changes to be successful, we recognize the need to better emphasize the arguments surrounding Jeb’s record and adjust the campaign’s strategic positioning. • Jeb Can Fix It: We’re going to focus the argument of this campaign around the fact that after seven years of incompetence, corruption and gridlock in Washington, we need a president “Who Can Fix It.” And Jeb is the only person in the field on both sides of the aisle who can make this statement. o Experience vs. Experiment: Jeb is the one candidate with a proven conservative record, bold ideas and the strong leadership needed to fix the problems America faces. We will aggressively drive that message, against opponents who have either created the problem, proven incapable of fixing it or cannot be trusted. Jeb is the one who can do the job. o National Security: Jeb will increase the emphasis on the need for a strong, experienced leader who will rebuild our military and have the resolve to defeat the terrorists. Hillary Clinton’s disastrous tenure as Secretary of State leaves her extremely vulnerable to an electorate looking for the United States to restore its leadership role in the world. o Broken Washington: As governor, Jeb Bush issued more than 2,500 line item vetoes totaling more than 2 billion, which includes millions of dollars in earmarks pursued by Florida legislators. Under the current administration, spending has exploded and the debt has risen to unsustainable levels and Jeb is the only candidate who can credibly argue he will rein it in and turn it around. • The release of Jeb’s e-­‐book in a couple weeks will be another opportunity to revisit his strong leadership in Florida and show that if he could fix it in Florida, he can fix Washington. # ||||| ADVERTISEMENT Click here for the 2020 Primary Schedule The 2016 Presidential primary schedule is finally set.

Answer the above question based on the context below: San Francisco (SF; , Spanish: [sam fɾanˈsisko]; Spanish for 'Saint Francis'), officially the City and County of San Francisco, is a city in, and the cultural, commercial, and financial center of, Northern California. San Francisco is the 13th-most populous city in the United States, and the fourth-most populous in California, with 883,305 residents as of 2018. It covers an area of about 46.89 square miles (121.4 km2), mostly at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula in the San Francisco Bay Area, making it the second-most densely populated large US city, and the fifth-most densely populated U.S. county, behind only four of the five New York City boroughs. San Francisco is also part of the fifth-most populous primary statistical area in the United States, the San Jose–San Francisco–Oakland, CA Combined Statistical Area (9.67 million residents). As of 2017, it was the seventh-highest income county in the United States, with a per capita personal income of 119,868. As of 2015, San Francisco proper had a GDP of 154.2 billion, and a GDP per capita of 177,968. The San Francisco CSA was the country's third-largest urban economy as of 2017, with a GDP of 907 billion. Of the 500+ primary statistical areas in the US, the San Francisco CSA had among the highest GDP per capita in 2017, at 93,938. San Francisco was ranked 14th in the world and third in the United States on the Global Financial Centres Index as of September 2018.San Francisco was founded on June 29, 1776, when colonists from Spain established Presidio of San Francisco at the Golden Gate and Mission San Francisco de Asís a few miles away, all named for St. Francis of Assisi. The California Gold Rush of 1849 brought rapid growth, making it the largest city on the West Coast at the time. San Francisco became a consolidated city-county in 1856. San Francisco's status as the West Coast's largest city peaked between 1870 and 1900, when around 25% of California's population resided in the city proper. After three-quarters of the city was destroyed by... A:","completion":"Based on the context provided and the city's history, most people in San Francisco tend to vote for the Democratic Party. San Francisco is a culturally diverse and progressive city located in Northern California. This region has a historical reputation for being liberal and leaning towards the Democratic Party, as it often supports progressive policies and candidates. In recent elections, San Francisco has demonstrated considerable support for Democratic Party candidates. For instance, in the 2020 Presidential election, Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate, secured 85.4% of the votes in San Francisco, while Republican candidate Donald Trump only received 12.7%. Similarly, in the 2016 Presidential election, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton garnered 85.5% of the votes in San Francisco, while Republican candidate Donald Trump received only 9.5%. This Democratic-leaning trend in San Francisco is also evident in local and state elections. In the 2018 California State Senate elections, Democratic candidate Scott Wiener won 74.9% of the vote in his district, which included parts of San Francisco, while his Republican opponent received only 25.1%. Furthermore, all members of the Board of Supervisors, the legislative body for the City and County of San Francisco, are members of the Democratic Party. Several factors contribute to San Francisco's political leaning. The city has a high proportion of residents with college degrees, who tend to vote Democratic. Additionally, San Francisco has a large LGBTQ+ community, which tends to align with the Democratic Party's progressive stance on social issues. Moreover, the city's diverse ethnic and racial demographics, including a significant Asian and Hispanic population, influence its voting patterns, as these groups have historically exhibited a greater affinity for the Democratic Party in the United States. In conclusion, most people in San Francisco vote for the Democratic Party, due to the city's progressive and diverse nature, as well as its historical inclination towards liberal and Democratic causes. Recent election results at the local, state, and national levels have consistently demonstrated San Francisco's strong support for the Democratic Party."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The epicenter was in Wenchuan County, Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, 80 km west/northwest of the provincial capital of Chengdu, with its main tremor occurring at 14:28:01.42 China Standard Time (06:28:01.42 UTC), on May 12, 2008 lasting for around 2 minutes, in the quake almost 80% of buildings were destroyed. What percentage of buildings were destroyed during the quake?","completion":"During the quake, approximately 80% of the buildings were destroyed. This devastating percentage signifies a major calamity which would have led to extensive damage to both livelihoods and infrastructure. This includes residential homes, commercial properties, and public structures such as schools and hospitals. The debris resulting from this disaster would have rendered many roads unusable, complicating rescue and relief efforts. The high percentage indicates that the buildings probably were not adequately designed to withstand a quake of such intensity. Buildings in active seismic zones usually follow specific architectural and constructional regulations designed to limit damage in the event of an earthquake. These regulations usually include the use of flexible construction materials, reinforcement of structural elements, and strategic architectural planning. However, when we observe such a substantial percentage of destruction, it's likely these regulations were not adequately enforced or maybe were not in place. The earthquake, having a tremendous magnitude of 8.0 on the Ms scale and 7.9 on the Mw scale, struck Wenchuan County, Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture. These magnitude levels are indicative of extremely violent shaking and severe potential for destruction. Moreover, due to the proximity of the epicenter to densely populated areas like Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, the disaster was especially catastrophic. The earthquake didn’t just occur briefly; it lasted approximately 2 minutes. In earthquakes, the duration is a critical factor along with the intensity. This lengthy time duration would have not just resulted in a continued destructive process, but it would also enhance panic and could potentially have caused more injuries and deaths due to accidents associated with the confusion and fear. Recovery and rebuilding following this scale of disaster would have been both time-consuming and extremely costly. It would involve clearing away an enormous quantity of rubble, locating and identifying casualties, providing emergency assistance to survivors, and eventually embarking on a massive reconstruction project to restore the affected areas. This would demand local, national and potentially international involvement and aid. Overall, the figure of 80% destruction presents a stark depiction of devastation and underlines the importance of earthquake preparedness particularly in regions prone to seismic activity. It signifies the human, infrastructural, and economic tragedies that can result from natural disasters like the severe earthquake which took place in Wenchuan County on May 12, 2008."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When you choose a freezer, remember it's probably going to be with you for a long time. So it's important to know which freezer is right for your needs. First, decide if you want an upright or chest model. Uprights are more convenient. Their storage space is more accessible and they take up less floor area. However, chest models are more energy-efficient because less cold air escapes when they are open. If you are buying an upright, you'll have to choose between frostless or manual defrost . Chest freezers are always manual. Frostless freezers automatically defrost at present intervals and remove the water. Manual models must be defrosted by hand every few months or whenever frost pile up to about a quarter of an inch. To help your freezer reach a ripe old age, try to find a spot that's cool, dry, and away fromdrafts . Drafts and heat will raise the freezer's cabinet temperature, which makes it work harder to keep cool. That means wasted energy. That means wasted energy and a shortened life. Dry air is important because highhumidity can cause the freezer to rust outside and frost up inside. With proper care, a freezer can serve you for 15 years or more. Regular cleaning and simple maintenance will help it maintain a zero-degree temperature and keep it smelling fresh and looking almost new. Frostless models requires less care than manual defrost freezers. The inside of a frostless unit should be washed periodically with warm water and baking soda or a mild soap, rinse, and dried. Good habits go a long way toward a freezer that runs efficiently. To get the most from your freezer, check regularly to make sure it's providing a true zero-degree temperature. Keep the freezer at least three-quarters full. The emptier it get, the more energy is wasted. If more than three pounds of food per cubic foot of storage space is added every 24 hours, the resulting high or low temperature can damage the food.

She had presented a talk on black holes in the evening, but was found dead in the morning by the manager of the observatory. She had been shot in the face, but there was no weapon. There is a sock and a jar of moisturizing cream found at the scene. The manager claims that he was out all night with an associate. The sock is traced to Jennifer's boyfriend, who claims he left hurriedly to work on a new theory. Jennifer's home is full of tchotchkes and other old nick-nacks. Mike passes out when she picks up a Florida snow globe, and imagines unique blue marbles similar to one that is on a string around her neck. When she comes to, she talks about the marble, and how she doesn't remember where it came from. She was an orphan, and has always had it. Her co-investigator and supervisor suggest that this looks like \\"The .38 Caliber Killer\\", who killed young women, but hadn't struck in many years. The murderer always exchanged nick nacks with his victims. While doing a more detailed search of the area, Mike finds a gun in a case, and a red scarf she had been having dreams about.

The women said Boko Haram fighters started pelting them when they refused to run away as the army came nearer. A group of nearly 300 women and children was brought out of the vast Sambisa forest to a government camp. The military says it has rescued more than 700 people in the past week in an offensive against the Islamist group. The women said several were killed in the stoning, but they did not know how many.

Image copyright AP Image caption Salamatu Bulama says she was among the among the women stoned by the militants Image copyright Nigeria military Image caption The military says many Boko Haram bases in the Sambisa forest have been destroyed The survivors said that when they were initially captured, the militants had killed men and older boys in front of their families before taking women and children into the forest. Some were forced into marriage. One woman, Lami Musa, 27, said she had avoided that fate. \\"When they realised I was pregnant, they said I was impregnated by an infidel [her husband] and they killed him,\\" she said. 'Skeletal bodies' Ms Musa quoted the militants as telling her that \\"once you deliver in a week's time we will marry you to our commander\\". \\"I delivered at night and we were rescued by the soldiers the following morning,\\" Ms Musa added, in tears. Image copyright AP Image caption Some of the children are severely malnourished Image copyright Reuters Image caption Many are now eating their first proper meal for months Other survivors said the militant Islamists never let them out of their sight - not even when they went to the toilet. \\"They didn't allow us to move an inch,\\" one of the freed women, Asabe Umaru, told Reuters news agency. \\"We were kept in one place. We were under bondage.\\" One woman described how they were fed just one meal a day. \\"We were fed only ground dry maize in the afternoons. It was not good for human consumption,\\" Cecilia Abel told Reuters. \\"Every day, we witnessed the death of one of us and waited for our turn,\\" said Umaru, a 24-year-old mother of two. Some of the children were \\"just little skeletal bodies with flaps of skin that make them look like old people\\", Associated Press reporter Michelle Faul told the BBC after visiting the camp where survivors were staying. A doctor, Muhammad Amin Suleiman, said many severely malnourished babies and children had been put on intravenous drips at a clinic. The women and children travelled for three days on pick-up trucks from the vast Sambisa forest where they were rescued, to the camp in the city of Yola, where they arrived on Saturday night. Chibok girls Through interviews, officials have determined that almost all those rescued are from Gumsuri, a village near the town of Chibok, the Associated Press news agency reports. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Women have also been receiving check-ups at a clinic It does not appear that any of those released are from the group of more than 200 Chibok schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram a year ago in a mass abduction that led to worldwide protests calling for the girls' release. Thousands have been killed in northern Nigeria since Boko Haram began its insurgency in 2009 to create an Islamic state. In February, Nigeria's military, backed by troops from neighbouring countries, launched a major offensive against the Islamist fighters, recapturing most of the territory Boko Haram had taken in the previous year. Their last remaining hideouts are believed to be in the Sambisa forest, which surrounds a reserve of the same name. ||||| YOLA, Nigeria Boko Haram fighters killed older boys and men in front of their families before taking women and children into the forest where many died of hunger and disease, freed captives said on Sunday after they were brought to a government refugee camp. The Nigerian army rescued hundreds of women and children last week from the Islamist fighters in northern Nigeria's Sambisa Forest in a major operation that has turned international attention to the plight of hostages. After days on the road in pickup trucks, hundreds were released on Sunday into the care of authorities at a refugee camp in the eastern town of Yola, to be fed and treated for injuries. They spoke to reporters for the first time. \\"They didn't allow us to move an inch,\\" said one of the freed women, Asabe Umaru, describing her captivity. \\"If you needed the toilet, they followed you. We were kept in one place. We were under bondage. \\"We thank God to be alive today. We thank the Nigerian army for saving our lives,\\" she added. Two hundred and seventy-five women and children, some with heads or limbs in bandages, arrived in the camp late on Saturday. Nearly 700 kidnap victims have been freed from the Islamist group's forest stronghold since Tuesday, with the latest group of 234 women and children liberated on Friday. \\"When we saw the soldiers we raised our hands and shouted for help. Boko Haram who were guarding us started stoning us so we would follow them to another hideout, but we refused because we were sure the soldiers would rescue us,\\" Umaru, a 24 year-old mother of two, told Reuters. The prisoners suffered malnutrition and disease, she said. \\"Every day we witnessed the death of one of us and waited for our turn.\\" Another freed captive, Cecilia Abel, said her husband and first son had been killed in her presence before the militia forced her and her remaining eight children into the forest. For two weeks before the military arrived she had barely eaten. \\"We were fed only ground dry maize in the afternoons. It was not good for human consumption,\\" she said. \\"Many of us that were captured died in Sambisa Forest. Even after our rescue about 10 died on our way to this place.\\" SPECIAL ATTENTION The freed prisoners were fed bread and mugs of tea as soon as they arrived at the government camp. Nineteen were in hospital for special attention, Dr. Mohammed Aminu Suleiman of the Adamawa State Emergency Management Agency told Reuters. The army said troops on patrol on Saturday had discovered 260 women and children in Adamawa state. Some had fled their homes during fighting while others had been abducted but managed to escape from the Islamists. The military also said in a statement it had arrested a supplier of food and fuel to Boko Haram on Sunday morning. Amnesty International estimates the insurgents, who are intent on bringing western Africa under Islamist rule, have taken more than 2,000 women and girls captive since the start of 2014. Many have been used as cooks, sex slaves or human shields. The prisoners freed so far do not appear to include any of more than 200 schoolgirls snatched from school dormitories in Chibok town a year ago, an incident that drew global attention to the six-year-old insurgency. Umaru said her group of prisoners never came in contact with the missing Chibok girls. Nigerian troops alongside armies from neighboring Chad, Cameroon and Niger have won back swathes of territory from the fighters in the last couple of months. Last year, the group exerted influence over an area bigger than Belgium. But a counter-attack launched in January has pushed them into Sambisa, a nature reserve. While the Nigerian army is confident it has the group cornered, a final push to clear them from the area has been curtailed by landmines. President Goodluck Jonathan, who relinquishes power later in May after his election defeat to Muhammadu Buhari, has promised to hand over a Nigeria \\"free of terrorist strongholds\\". Rampant corruption and a failure to stamp out the uprising in the north were factors that cost Jonathan the election won by Buhari, a former military ruler.

While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect.

At first Sally urges her students to comply, but she manages to help the children escape during a rest stop. They make their way to a farmhouse where an elderly couple (with no telephone) offers to hide them until the police can be contacted.

The Joker is a fictional supervillain created by Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson who first appeared in the debut issue of the comic book Batman (April 25, 1940), published by DC Comics. Credit for the Joker's creation is disputed; Kane and Robinson claimed responsibility for the Joker's design, while acknowledging Finger's writing contribution. Although the Joker was planned to be killed off during his initial appearance, he was spared by editorial intervention, allowing the character to endure as the archenemy of the superhero Batman. In his comic book appearances, the Joker is portrayed as a criminal mastermind. The Joker was one of the few popular villains continuing to appear regularly in Batman comics from the Golden Age into the Silver Age, as the series continued during the rise in popularity of mystery and romance comics. In 1951, Finger wrote an origin story for the Joker in Detective Comics #168, which introduced the characteristic of him formerly being the criminal Red Hood, and his disfigurement the result of a fall into a chemical vat. By 1954, the Comics Code Authority had been established in response to increasing public disapproval of comic book content. The backlash was inspired by Frederic Wertham, who hypothesized that mass media (especially comic books) was responsible for the rise in juvenile delinquency, violence and homosexuality, particularly in young males. Parents forbade their children from reading comic books, and there were several mass burnings. The Comics Code banned gore, innuendo and excessive violence, stripping Batman of his menace and transforming the Joker into a goofy, thieving trickster without his original homicidal tendencies. The character appeared less frequently after 1964, when Julius Schwartz (who disliked the Joker) became editor of the Batman comics. The character risked becoming an obscure figure of the preceding era until this goofy prankster version of the character was adapted into the 1966 television series Batman, in which he was played by Cesar Romero. The show's popularity compelled Schwartz to keep the comics in a similar vein. As the show's popularity waned, however, so did that of the Batman comics. After the TV series ended in 1968, the increase in public visibility had not stopped the comic's sales decline; editorial director Carmine Infantino resolved to turn things around, moving stories away from schoolboy-friendly adventures. The Silver Age introduced several of the Joker's defining character traits: lethal joy buzzers, acid-squirting flowers, trick guns, and goofy, elaborate crimes. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What was the Silver Age?","completion":"The Silver Age was a period in comic book history where stories and characters became more light-hearted and fun. During this time, the Joker turned into a goofy, thieving trickster, and many of his famous traits like lethal joy buzzers, acid-squirting flowers, and trick guns were introduced.

Sentence: Al Qaeda attacks america on 9/11","completion":"The sentence \\"Al Qaeda attacks America on 9/11\\" is true. The 9/11 terrorist attacks were a series of four coordinated assaults carried out by al-Qaeda, an Islamic extremist group, on the United States on Tuesday, September 11, 2001. The attacks devastated the nation and had a substantial impact on U.S. foreign and domestic policy. On that fateful day, 19 al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four American passenger planes traveling on domestic routes, with the objective of using them as weapons to target high-profile symbols of American economic and political power. Two of the planes, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, were flown into the North and South towers of the World Trade Center in New York City. Almost 3,000 people died as the two towers collapsed, including a large number of firefighters and other rescue workers who rushed to the scene to help. Another plane, American Airlines Flight 77, was flown into the Pentagon building in Arlington, Virginia, causing significant damage and resulting in the deaths of 189 people, including the 64 passengers on board. The fourth hijacked plane, United Airlines Flight 93, was heading towards Washington, D.C., but crashed into a field in Pennsylvania after passengers attempted to overpower the hijackers. All people on board Flight 93 lost their lives, but their actions potentially saved countless others by forcing the plane to crash short of its intended target. These attacks were the deadliest act of terrorism on U.S. soil and prompted an immediate response from the U.S. government and its allies, including the launch of the War on Terror, which involved military intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as significant changes to domestic security policy, with the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security, the introduction of the USA PATRIOT Act, and the implementation of new airport security measures. In the context of the text mentioned, \\"The Reluctant Fundamentalist\\" by Mohsin Hamid, the novel and subsequent film adaptation explore the life of a Pakistani man who went to the United States for education and career opportunities but was deeply affected by the 9/11 attacks and the American reaction to them. The story highlights the emotional turmoil experienced by many people of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent who were unfairly treated with suspicion and hostility in the aftermath of the attacks, and it serves as a poignant reminder of the complex social and political repercussions that 9/11 has had on individuals and societies around the world."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The premise provided information about two specific types of calls: those from people denied food stamps and those with problems with their landlords. The hypothesis suggests that the only people who call in are those who are bored. These two statements are not logically connected, nor does the premise lead to or support the hypothesis. In order to determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we would need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. Entailment would require that, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true due to a direct connection or logical implication. In this case, however, there is no such connection between the two. The premise provides a sample of the types of calls received and implies that there are people with real difficulties and issues who are looking for assistance. On the other hand, the hypothesis deals with a completely different type of caller, one who is motivated by boredom. This category of caller is not addressed or implied by the premise at all. Furthermore, the hypothesis is a negative statement, stating that the ONLY people who call in are those who are bored. This directly contrasts the premise, which acknowledges that there are callers with genuine issues, such as the denial of food stamps and landlord problems. Because the premise does not lead to or support the hypothesis, the two statements are not related in a way that could be considered entailment. In conclusion, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, and the available option to choose in this case is 3. no. The two statements provided information on different aspects of the topic, and there is no logical connection or implication that would lead from the premise to the hypothesis.

We are able to get the grill we want rolled out to us... with some more supplies, we are off to checkout ! The woman who checked us out, was very nice, but didn't know what she was talking about. I am a Lowe's card holder, and get the 5% off nonsense. She told us that if we got 20 more in items, that we would receive interest free for 6 months. Sounded fine.. what's 20? My husband runs off and gets a fish basket. She rings up the fish basket, and still, no interest free option shows up. She asks other cashiers, and says the amount isn't right. That we needed another 75 odd dollars to get interest free financing. No thanks. So, off we go. With the grill on a dolly, a cart of goodies, and the stroller.

Plot title: Howard the Duck Movie plot: Twenty-seven-year-old Howard the Duck lives on Duckworld, a planet similar to Earth, but inhabited by anthropomorphic ducks and orbited by twin moons. As he is reading the latest issue of Playduck magazine, his armchair begins to quake violently and propels him out of his apartment building and into outer space; Howard eventually lands on Earth, in Cleveland, Ohio. Upon arriving, Howard encounters a woman being attacked by thugs. He defeats them using a unique style of martial arts. After the thugs flee, the woman introduces herself as Beverly Switzler, and decides to take Howard to her apartment and let him spend the night. The following day, Beverly takes Howard to Phil Blumbertt, a scientist who Beverly hopes can help Howard return to his world. After Phil is revealed to be only a janitor, Howard resigns himself to life on Earth and rejects Beverly's aid. He soon applies for a job as a janitor at a local romance spa. Because of unfair treatment, Howard quits and rejoins Beverly, who plays in a band called Cherry Bomb. At the club where Cherry Bomb is performing, Howard comes across their manager, and confronts him when he insults the band. A fight breaks out, in which Howard is victorious. Howard rejoins Beverly backstage after the band's performance and accompanies her back to her apartment, where Beverly persuades him to be the band's new manager. The two begin to flirt, but soon after that they are interrupted by Blumburtt and two of his colleagues, who reveal that a dimensional-jumping device they were inventing was aimed at Howard's planet and transported him to Earth when it was activated. They theorize that Howard can be sent back to his world through a reversal of this same process. Upon their arrival at the laboratory, the device malfunctions when it is activated, raising the possibility of something else being transported to Earth. At this point, Dr. Walter Jenning is possessed by a life form from another alternate dimension. When they visit a diner, the creature introduces himself as a \\"Dark...

He first took interest in singing after his church's Sunday school choir performed \\"Everything Is Beautiful.\\" He received his first guitar at age eight and taught himself how to play it; in the fourth grade, he performed \\"Annie's Song\\" and \\"King of the Road\\" for his class, and later got invited to play for other classrooms in his school. At age fourteen, his parents bought him another guitar, and he learned more songs from his uncle, Sam Lockhart. In early 1994, after \\"Worth Every Mile\\" fell from the charts, Tritt charted at number 21 with a cover of the Eagles' \\"Take It Easy\\". He recorded this song for the tribute album Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles (released through Warner Bros.' Giant Records division), which featured country music artists' renditions of Eagles songs. When filming the music video for this song, Tritt requested that the band, which was on hiatus at the time, appear in it. This reunion inspired the Eagles' Hell Freezes Over Tour, which began that year. His fourth album, Ten Feet Tall and Bulletproof, was released that May. Its lead-off single, \\"Foolish Pride\\", went to number one, and the fourth single, \\"Tell Me I Was Dreaming\\", reached number two. In between these songs were the title track at number 22 and \\"Between an Old Memory and Me\\" (originally recorded by Keith Whitley) at number 11. The album included two co-writes with Gary Rossington of Lynyrd Skynyrd, and guest vocals from Waylon Jennings and Hank Williams, Jr. on the cut \\"Outlaws Like Us\\". The album achieved platinum certification in December of that year, and later became his third double-platinum album. Allmusic reviewer Brian Mansfield said that Tritt was \\"most comfortable with his Southern rock/outlaw mantle\\" on it, comparing \\"Foolish Pride\\" favorably to \\"Anymore\\" and the work of Bob Seger. Alanna Nash praised the title track and \\"Tell Me I Was Dreaming\\" in her review for Entertainment Weekly, but thought that the other songs were still too similar in sound to his previous works. 1995's Greatest Hits: From the Beginning included most of his singles to that point, as well as two new cuts: the Steve Earle composition \\"Sometimes She Forgets\\" and a cover of the pop standard \\"Only You (And You Alone)\\". The former was a top ten hit at number seven, while the latter spent only eight weeks on the country charts and peaked at number 51. Greatest Hits was certified platinum.

Given the question: I am always one to at least finish my shift if that happens then talking to my agency if it is agency work or some higher up boss if not. Never mind employers can ask you to leave at any time. After all, job hunting is a huge inconvenience. There is ONE exception to this rule: NOT GETTING PAID. I am not talking about if accounting messes up and you have to wait an extra day or two to get paid. If you are a good employer, I won’t be happy, but I am understanding. I am talking refusing to pay or being even rumored to be not paying. I am not in the volunteer business for business owners. Only happened once… I thought I had a part timer gig being a waiter at an over-priced tourist trap restaurant in the New Orleans French Quarter. As typical for these type of jobs, you do not get to actually wait tables and get tips till a training period is over. Somehow, I did not get the memo that this place did not have “training” but “auditions”, meaning all that silverware I rolled and floors I mopped and food I ran to tables I was not getting paid for! Add to that, if somehow they did not like me, after a week I would not have a job! Now, I understand actors and actresses go to auditions and not get paid all the time. I’ve known a few amateur actors. But, those auditions do not include showing up for a week to work unpaid so maybe you might get hired from talking to them… And waiters don’t do auditions! I left immediately. I think they owed me 30 bucks for half a day’s work at the minimum wage. Tried to go back threatening labor board and all that, but they would not be intimidated. They said there was no record of me being there and to get off property. I wrote it off to bad experience and started working another place that I had been interviewing with. Much better job.

Question: suppose there is a more need for satellites happens, how will it affect less cracks form in the rocks. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"C: No effect To answer this question, let's think about the process step-by-step and justify our answer: 1. Water seeps into rocks: This event is determined by natural factors, such as rainfall and the permeability of rocks. The need for more satellites does not seem to have any direct influence on this process. 2. The water freezes and thaws: This is determined by temperature changes due to the climate. The need for more satellites does not seem to have any direct influence on this process either. 3. Cracks form in the rocks: As a result of freezing and thawing water, rocks expand and contract, leading to the formation of cracks. Additional factors that can cause cracks to form are pressure from other rocks and exposure to the elements. Again, more satellites are unrelated to these natural processes. 4. Cracks also form when rocks heat up: Rocks can crack due to extreme heat, which can be caused by activities such as volcanic eruptions or forest fires. While satellites may be used to monitor these events, they do not cause or influence the formation of cracks in rocks. 5. The rocks slowly break down: Over time, the processes mentioned previously will cause rocks to break down. This is all part of the natural rock cycle and has nothing to do with the need for more satellites. Based on the analysis of each step in the process, it can be concluded that an increased need for satellites has no direct effect on the formation of cracks in rocks.

When you need to think, let your imagination do the work. There's no need to go into details.;","completion":"(A) Give yourself a break and don't narrow your opportunities down through negative self-talk. Your imagination is as good as anyone else's. One of the surest ways to dampen your imaginative abilities is through persistent negative self-talk. You should try to remove this mental barrier by avoiding telling yourself that you lack imagination. Realize that imagination is inherent in all individuals, and it often requires practice and patience to develop. Start by giving yourself credit for your thoughts and ideas, regardless of how small they might appear. When you begin to acknowledge your imaginative capabilities, you are more likely to develop confidence and improve over time. (B) Instead of solely focusing on the possible inadequacies of your imagination, consider shifting your mindset and recognizing that you do possess imagination, albeit perhaps in need of some nurturing and development. Keep in mind that as with any skill, your imagination can grow and evolve. Intentionally seek out opportunities to engage with new experiences, experiment with different ways of thinking, and challenge yourself to explore unfamiliar territory. By doing this, you will refresh your perspective and stimulate your creative muscles, preventing your thoughts from feeling stale or limited. (C) The possibilities in life are endless; there are so many things. Imagine you are a caterpillar who swots up near some miraculous creature to eventually transform into a butterfly. Taking inspiration from nature, it is important to recognize that the journey of exploration and growth is a continuous process. By comparing yourself to a caterpillar that transforms into a butterfly, you can maintain a sense of wonder and curiosity about your own potential. Engage your imagination by comparing yourself to various creatures or elements in the natural world. This will help you to view your personal journey of self-discovery as an open-ended process full of possibilities and potential transformation. (D) When you need to think, let your imagination do the work. There's no need to go into details. Allow your imagination to take the lead in various aspects of your life by approaching situations with an open mind. Instead of getting bogged down by specifics or overanalyzing, try to maintain a sense of flexibility in your thought processes. This can be particularly helpful when problem-solving and brainstorming, as imaginative thinking allows you to explore unconventional solutions that may initially appear risky or improbable. By cultivating a willingness to think creatively, you will find that your ability to harness the power of your imagination – and overcome the notion that you don't have one – gradually becomes effortless and enjoyable."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Answer this question: who drew the borders in the middle east??","completion":"The borders in the Middle East were largely drawn during the early 20th century by the major imperial powers of the time – primarily Britain and France – through a series of agreements, treaties, and mandates following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the end of World War I. The process of drawing borders and carving out new states reflected competing geopolitical interests, colonial ambitions, and European disregard for the ethnic, religious, and tribal distinctions in the region. One of the key documents in defining the Middle Eastern borders was the 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement, a secret understanding between Britain and France. Designed to divide the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire, the agreement aimed at carving out spheres of influence for both Britain and France. British diplomat Mark Sykes and French diplomat François Georges-Picot proposed dividing the region into areas of direct and indirect control. Essentially, the Sykes-Picot Agreement laid the foundation for what the map of the Middle East looks like today. However, the drawing of the borders was also influenced by the British-promised support for Arab independence, particularly in the 1915-1916 correspondence between Sir Henry McMahon, the British High Commissioner in Egypt, and Hussein bin Ali, the Sharif of Mecca. Encouraging an Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire, the British negotiated Arab independence and the establishment of a unified Arab state. However, the British later backed away from these promises due to competing commitments in the region and their alliance with France. Moreover, the 1917 Balfour Declaration, a letter from the British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Baron Lionel Walter Rothschild, promised the establishment of a \\"national home for the Jewish people\\" in Palestine. This added further complexity to the border drawing process, overlapping with the conflicting territorial aspirations of Arabs and Zionists. After World War I, the drawing of the borders continued during the Peace Conference in Paris, further solidifying British and French control over the region as \\"mandates\\" under the League of Nations. The 1920 Treaty of Sèvres dissolved the Ottoman Empire, but its stipulations for carving out a Kurdish homeland were never implemented. The San Remo Conference in 1920 formalized the allocation of mandates to Britain and France in the Middle East. Under this arrangement, Britain was granted control over Palestine (later including Jordan), Iraq, and the Gulf States, while France received control over present-day Syria and Lebanon. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the borders were continuously adjusted in response to local unrest and negotiations among governing powers. However, the lasting impact of these arbitrary border drawings is still felt in the region today. The borders ignored ethnic, religious, and tribal divisions, creating a legacy of tension, conflict, and political instability in the Middle East. In summary, the borders in the Middle East were drawn primarily by Britain and France after World War I through a series of agreements, treaties, and mandates. The process was marked by conflicting interests, colonial ambitions, and disregard for the region's complex ethnic and religious landscape, which has contributed to the ongoing instability within the region."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In ‘Lila,’ Marilynne Robinson Gives a Prequel to ‘Gilead’ With her flawed but poignant new book, “Lila,” Marilynne Robinson has returned to the central characters in her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, “Gilead” (2004) — the aging minister John Ames and his much younger wife, Lila — and to the themes of alienation and separateness (and the possibility of belonging) that animated her astonishing debut novel, “Housekeeping,” more than 30 years ago. “Gilead,” set in a small Iowa town, took the form of a letter that the dying Ames wrote to his son who was turning 7 — a meditation on their family history, his religious faith and his regrets and hopes. “Lila” — which might well have been titled “Balm in Gilead” — is his wife’s story, chronicling her precarious childhood and youth, and her efforts to come to terms with that legacy of emotional damage. The novel ends with the birth of her son, whom Ames would address, years later, in “Gilead.” Writing in lovely, angular prose that has the high loneliness of an old bluegrass tune, Ms. Robinson has created a balladlike story about two lost people who, after years of stoic solitariness, unexpectedly find love — not the sudden, transformative passion of romantic movies and novels but a hard-won trust and tenderness that grow slowly over time. The novel is powerful and deeply affecting, but also hobbled, at times, by the author’s curious decision to tell the story in the third person, robbing it of the emotional immediacy of “Gilead” and resulting in occasional passages that seem to condescend to Lila, as an uneducated, almost feral creature. Perhaps Ms. Robinson decided to tell the story in the third person out of concern that such an unlettered girl might not have the language for communicating her state of mind, or perhaps it was difficult to find a voice for Lila that could comfortably address the big existential questions of life while remaining authentic and plain-spoken. Lila, we quickly learn, knew abandonment and hardship growing up. She was so neglected by her family that when she was 4 or 5, a kindhearted itinerant worker named Doll snatched her up from her stoop and became her surrogate mother. (They are called “the cow and her calf.”) They travel with a band of other drifters led by a man named Doane, living off the land, taking the occasional farm job and a stint here and there doing gardening and household chores. Doll’s love for Lila is sustaining, but for Lila — as for the sisters in “Housekeeping,” whose mother committed suicide and who feared their eccentric Aunt Sylvie would desert them too — the fear of abandonment always lurks. At one point, after “the Crash,” when jobs are almost impossible to come by, Doll disappears for a couple of days, and Doane and the others try to leave Lila behind on the steps of a church in a no-name town. That time, Doll does come back, but later she gets into a knife fight with a man, and after the sheriff takes Doll away, Lila is truly on her own. She finds herself working in a whorehouse in St. Louis (where she develops a crush on a cad named Mack), and then for a long time she works as a cleaning lady at a hotel, putting aside money from each paycheck to go to the movies, which help sustain her emotionally. In the hands of another author, Lila’s back story might sound sentimental or contrived, but Ms. Robinson renders her tale with the stark poetry of Edward Hopper or Andrew Wyeth (“Christina’s World”), capturing the loneliness of her transient existence. This sense of rootlessness and dislocation will stay with Lila, making her skittish and wary, a wild child, afraid of belonging to anyone or caring too much. After Lila shows up at his church, Ames — whom Lila thinks of as “the old man” — will do his best to try to tame her with kindness and patience, even though she lashes out at him, in the beginning, with defensive anger and righteous pride. “When you’re scalded, touch hurts,” Ms. Robinson writes, “it makes no difference if it’s kindly meant.” Lila was taught by Doll to be leery of the world — to be quiet, to keep questions to herself, to never owe anything to anyone; and she not only misses Doll and their life on the road, but is also reluctant to trust in the kindness of strangers. And even as she finds herself oddly drawn to this “beautiful old man,” whose first wife died in childbirth many years ago, along with their infant, she is scared to leave herself vulnerable to feelings of hope and the dreams of safety and a future. “Gilead” emphasized how smitten the 67-year-old Ames was with Lila — the first experience of passion in his life, and so all-consuming it almost provoked him to make a fool of himself, running after her in the street. Because those feelings are not really explored here, Ames’s instant and unwavering attachment to Lila — especially in the face of her prickly, often hurtful behavior toward him — often seems mystifying in these pages: We are left with the incomplete (and not entirely convincing) suggestion that his unconditional devotion to her is the behavior of a saintly man of faith, who believes that God “looks after the strays.” In fact, it is Lila, questioning a church that might doom Doll and Doane and her other “heathen” traveling companions to a hellfire they don’t deserve, who makes the case for a wider, more encompassing faith that might provide balm for all the “scoundrels who happened to be orphans, or whose mothers didn’t even like them.” There are moments in this novel when Ms. Robinson unnecessarily italicizes and telegraphs Lila’s emotions. Of a knife that Doll gave her, she writes: “Other people had houses and towns and names and graveyards. They had church pews. All she had was that knife. And dread and loneliness and regret. That was her dowry.” Unlike the author’s ungainly 2008 novel, “Home” (which focused on Ames’s best friend and neighbor the Rev. Robert Boughton’s relationship with his troubled son, Jack), however, such lapses are sporadic. And by the end of the novel they’ve been swept away by Ms. Robinson’s moving depiction of Lila’s slow, halting acceptance of Ames’s love and their slow dance toward marital devotion. By its conclusion, the novel has become a haunting parable of the pastor Ames’s understanding of the Calvinist teaching “that people have to suffer to really recognize grace when it comes.” 261 pages.

Offensive line coach Chris Foerster of the 49ers talks with Andrew Tiller (61), Joe Staley (74) and Trent Brown (right) on the sideline during a recent home game against the Cincinnati Bengals, who won 24-14. One last game and 49ers season reaches its merciful end There is actually some good news for the 49ers: Barring overtime, it will all be finished after four more quarters. Yes, the merciful end to the 2015 season is near for a 4-11 team that ranks 31st in total offense, 28th in total defense, owns the league’s worst point differential (minus-152), has had eight losses of at least 14 points and will occupy the NFC West cellar for the first time since 2005. Leave it to plain-spoken left tackle Joe Staley to capture the mood entering the regular-season finale against the Rams on Sunday at Levi’s Stadium: “We have one more game left,” Staley said. “I want to be able to finish it out the right way and then kind of put a (expletive) end to this season.” Staley laughed: “Sorry for my language.” Staley, of course, isn’t alone. The disastrous season has prompted plenty of R-rated chatter, and it could soon inspire plenty of changes. Those edits could start with head coach Jim Tomsula, whose first year at the helm began under difficult circumstances given the wave of personnel losses in the offseason. And the losses kept coming once the real games began. Consider: The 49ers’ top three running backs have combined to miss 28 of 45 games, their top two tight ends — since-traded Vernon Davis and Garrett Celek — have been on the field for just 13 total games, and other key figures such as defensive tackle Glenn Dorsey and safety Antoine Bethea have been on injured reserve for more than a month. In addition, there is the matter of their most important player, quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who was demoted after eight starts. Still, all NFL teams deal with injuries and poorer-than-expected individual performances. In the 49ers’ case, it’s hard to argue that they’ve handled the in-season adversity particularly well. For his part, Staley, 31, the team’s longest-tenured member, was realistic entering 2015, but he didn’t figure on 4-11. As he’s done after each season, he will meet with general manager Trent Baalke and share his thoughts about changes he thinks need to be made. “I don't think you ever expect a season like this,” Staley said. “We knew it was going to be a challenging year. And we knew we didn’t have everybody coming back like we had in years past — the same coordinators, the same players. It was going to be a challenge, regardless. We knew that going in. But we didn’t expect the kind of year we had this year.” Many don’t expect one of those coordinators, Geep Chryst, to return given the performance of an offense averaging a league-worst 14.6 points a game. The 49ers are on pace to score their third-fewest points in a non-strike season since 1978, and they will set a franchise record for sacks allowed if they surrender four Sunday. Tomsula resisted making in-season staff changes, but it was notable that the defensive-minded head coach couldn’t resist an attempt to help the wheezing offense last month. Tomsula acknowledged that he implored the offensive staff to adopt a more aggressive approach before a 24-10 loss at Cleveland on Dec. 13. “I came in and said, ‘Look, I want to throw the ball down the field. I want to hit those middle-range throws,’” Tomsula said. “I kind of forced that, which, in retrospect, I shouldn’t have forced it. That’s the conversation I had with the offensive staff. That was me in there forcing that, ‘Look, let’s get out here, let’s hit those 14- to 19-yard throws. Let’s go after a couple of those.’” That certainly suggests that Tomsula, a defensive-line coach from 2007-14, felt Chryst needed his input, which doesn’t qualify as a ringing endorsement. Similarly, Staley declined to aggressively back Chryst when asked about the importance of staying in the same offense in 2016. “I definitely think there are advantages to being in the same system and having familiarity with it, but it’s also a results-based business,” Staley said. “And we have to do our part to make sure the results are better than what they were this year.” Eric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

They last had a winless division record in 1978. Davis, a rookie fourth-round pick, has 24 yards on 25 carries. Since 1960, only one running back has averaged less than a yard a carry with at least 25 attempts in a season (Donnell Bennett, Chiefs, 2000).

Tillman feels that the most important message for children to receive is simply, \\"You are loved.\\" And it's that message that is the focus of this, her newest book, Wherever You Are: My Love Will Find You. Once again, it is her turn of phrase that most fascinates me: In the green of the grass ... in the smell of the sea ... in the clouds floating by ... at the top of a tree ... in the sound crickets make at the end of the day ... \\"You are loved. You are loved. You are loved,\\" they all say. Phrases encourage children to grow, to try new things, to \\"march to the front\\" of their \\"own parade\\" and assures them that, no matter how far they go or what they do, they will be loved. Though the words alone would convince me to buy, share and recommend this book, Tillman is also a gifted artist and her lovely work makes this book a visual treasure as well.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. There were serious scientific objections to the process of natural selection as the key mechanism of evolution, including Karl von Nägeli's insistence that a trivial characteristic with no adaptive advantage could not be developed by selection. Darwin conceded that these could be linked to adaptive characteristics. His estimate that the age of the Earth allowed gradual evolution was disputed by William Thomson (later awarded the title Lord Kelvin), who calculated that it had cooled in less than 100 million years. Darwin accepted blending inheritance, but Fleeming Jenkin calculated that as it mixed traits, natural selection could not accumulate useful traits. Darwin tried to meet these objections in the 5th edition. Mivart supported directed evolution, and compiled scientific and religious objections to natural selection. In response, Darwin made considerable changes to the sixth edition. The problems of the age of the Earth and heredity were only resolved in the 20th century. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What justification for his objections to the process of natural selection did Karl von Nägel give?","completion":"Karl von Nägeli's justification for his objections to the process of natural selection as the key mechanism of evolution stemmed from his belief that trivial characteristics with no adaptive advantage could not be developed by selection. According to von Nägeli, these seemingly insignificant traits, which did not appear to play a role in an organism's survival or reproduction, were difficult to explain through the process of natural selection alone. Von Nägeli argued that for natural selection to work, traits must be beneficial to the organism, enabling it to survive and reproduce better than individuals without those traits. If a trait provided no apparent advantage, von Nägeli believed that there was no reason for it to be selected and passed on to future generations. This concern highlighted a potential limitation in Darwin's theory of natural selection at the time, as it could not adequately account for the development of these non-adaptive traits. To address von Nägeli's objection, Darwin conceded that these seemingly trivial characteristics could be linked to adaptive characteristics in some way. In other words, a trait that appeared to have no adaptive advantage might be connected to another trait which did provide a benefit to the organism. These connections allowed for the seemingly non-adaptive traits to be maintained and passed on through generations alongside beneficial traits due to the overall advantage obtained by the organisms possessing them. This explanation helped to address some of the concerns raised by von Nägeli and other critics of natural selection. It should be noted, however, that our modern understanding of genetics and the processes underlying inheritance and trait development have evolved significantly since Darwin's time. Today, scientists recognize that traits can be preserved through various mechanisms, such as genetic drift or developmental constraints, which may not always directly relate to an organism's adaptive success. These new insights offer a more comprehensive picture of evolution and contribute to a better understanding of why seemingly trivial traits may persist within populations."},{"prompt":"Teacher:In this task, you will be presented with a question about part-of-speech tag of a word in the question.

Sentence:","completion":"The data you have provided contains three distinct elements related to astronomy, more specifically, space exploration. The first element, '11264 Claudiomaccone,' is an identifier that refers to a specific object present in space. Named after the renowned Italian astrophysicist and space exploration advocate Dr. Claudio Maccone, '11264 Claudiomaccone' is classified as a minor planet within our solar system. This so-called minor planet was officially recognized and designated by the Minor Planet Center, an organization operating under the auspices of the International Astronomical Union. Much like asteroids, minor planets are celestial bodies that orbit the sun but are too small to qualify as planets and too large to fall under the category of meteoroids. Therefore, '11264 Claudiomaccone' is a unique celestial body whirling through our solar system named after an influential scientist in the field. The second element, 'periapsis,' is a term originating from astronomy and space navigation. This concept describes the point within the elliptical, or slightly oval-shaped, orbit of a celestial body where it is closest to its orbital focus or the object it orbits around. Every celestial body moving in an elliptical orbit has a periapsis. For instance, in the scenario where a planet or a minor planet like '11264 Claudiomaccone' orbits the sun, the periapsis would be the point at which this celestial body is nearest to the sun. One of the most common uses of this term is in relation to the Earth's orbit around the sun, which is called perihelion. Lastly, the number '296521000.0 (kilometres),' appears to be providing us with a measurement of distance, more specifically, the distance '11264 Claudiomaccone' at its periapsis. This signifies that at the closest point in its elliptical orbit to its orbital focus, '11264 Claudiomaccone' is approximately 296,521,000 kilometres away. So, this data appears to be detailing a snapshot of '11264 Claudiomaccone' space journey - at the moment when it's closest to the object it is orbiting, it is at a distance of about 296,521,000 kilometres.

So, the equation becomes: 12 = 4*f Now, we need to figure out how many times 'f' should be multiplied by 4 to get the number 12. Imagine you have 12 candies, and you want to split them into groups of 4. You can divide 12 candies into 3 groups of 4. So, f = 3 That's our answer!

Title: Tarantino's finest story--True Romance Review: True Romance is a great movie in the Tarantino tradition. It incorporates great action with an intense love story. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette have amazing chemistry. Brad Pitt delivers one of his finest roles in a cameo as a drugged out, but friendly guy (check out the honey container he offers Christopher Walken, in one of the most awkward but funniest scenes I've seen). Worth seeing over and over again as well for Val Kilmer's cameo as Elvis, who guides Christian Slater and gives him courage throughout the movie. Dennis Hopper also delivers a poignant and sweet performance as Christian Slater's somewhat estranged but loving father. Don't miss this one!!!! Is this product review negative? Choose from: [1].

He owns a driving range in West Texas, where he drinks and hangs out with his pal Romeo Posar and their friends. Dr. Molly Griswold, a clinical psychologist, wants a golf lesson.

During the round, Roy needles Simms about \\"laying up\\" instead of having the nerve to take a 230-yard shot over a water hazard. Simms fires back that Roy's problem is playing recklessly instead of playing the percentages. Roy brags that he could make the shot, and spectators begin making bets among themselves.

Article: Society is the term to describe human beings gathered together by social networks tand power networks. It does not refer to everything everybody thinks or does, but, only refer to those things that everybody depends upon ,for example, public services, governments, and all kinds of communities. A society must keep even the poorest and weakest members willing to help even the richest and strongest, so it is very concerned with citizenship, rights, ethics ( )and time limits. These are basic ways to achieve fairness. If they break down badly, people will think the society is unfair and start taking things from each other, refusing to help each other, or seeing those who have more as cheats. When this happens, it is time for the society to break down or fail. Theft, violence and war are things that can make a society break down. A new society may be formed out of the collapse of an old failed one when people of different kinds reach an agreement about fairness and are willing to live together in harmony again. To adapt to the society, people should make sure that their behavior can be supported by the society, that is to say, there must be some social rules on which citizens base what they do. However, some people take risks that the society will support them when they do whatever they intend to. For instance, they may refuse to obey the law, and count on their fellow society members to free them in a court of appeal, which harms the society. Therefore we need a social contract which sets out rules for the society. One kind of the social contract is a constitution -which allows a jury or court to decide what is right or wrong according to the social rules.

Peter Kirkham, who worked in the Flying Squad which investigates armed robbery, reckons Kim’s valuables will be broken up and sold in London. The terrifying raid happened at her plush Paris apartment this morning. Robbers pretending to be cops stole her £3.5 million engagement ring – and another £5 million worth of jewellery. “It’s the sort of crime you can do in pretty much any city in the world – you don’t need to come to France to nick Kim Kardashian’s stuff.” It is feared that the £3.5million ring could be the 20-carat second engagement ring given to her by husband Kanye West. Kim, 35, was tied up in the bathroom and had a gun held to her head as the raiders snatched her jewels. The reality star was unharmed but “shaken” and fled on a private jet after the raid. Mr Kirkham, who runs his own security consultancy, said the jewels will already be broken up and could end up in London’s Hatton Garden. He said: \\"Most jewellery is broken almost immediately. \\"The pieces tend to be recognisable so they will be broken up unless there is a particular buyer. \\"If it gets sold through Belgium or Amsterdam it could come into London. \\"Hatton Garden is an international market so it's definitely an option.\\" Mr Kirkham believes the robbers were local, adding: \\"It's impossible to say but my guess would a French gang. There are probably organised crime gangs in Paris that are capable. \\"It's not that big. It's not that high-end that I'd expect people to travel internationally to do it. \\"It's a good robbery but it's not a speed-boat-getaway sort of thing.\\" Kim's husband Kanye West raced off stage after leaning of the of incident in the middle of a performance at The Meadows Music and Arts Festival in New York. He has no doubt that the robbery was planned instead of carried out by opportunists. He said: \\"It was definitely planned. I suspect it's an experienced gang who have worked together before. \\"I suspect they knew what they were going to get.\\" And he added the crime should act as a stark warning about the dangers of over-sharing on social media. He said: \\"It might not have been headline news where Kim was staying but I suspect it was anything but a secret. \\"The robbers probably found out via social media.

Perform the operations in order, as instructed: First, we need to concatenate all elements of A from the ith element to the jth element. In our case, i=2 and j=2. Since indices start at 0, the ith element is the 3rd element of A which is '7559', and the jth element is the 3rd element of A which is '7559' as well. 4. Concatenate the elements: Since we only have one element in this range, our concatenated string will be '7559'. 5. Reverse the resulting string: The final step is to reverse the concatenated string.

Clinic counselor Dr. Vinnie Donatti (Alan King) explains that the clinic has a 100% success rate due to a uniquely persuasive method: every time Dick smokes a cigarette, horrors of increasing magnitude will befall his wife and child. Using the tomcat that Donatti's assistant Junk has caught in the street, Donatti demonstrates the first of these horrors: the cat is locked in a cage and tormented with electric shocks. Donatti explains that if his new client should be caught with a cigarette, Dick's wife Cindy will be subjected to the same shocks while he is forced to watch. For subsequent infractions, his young daughter afflicted with Down Syndrome will be subjected to the shocks, then his wife raped, and after the fourth infraction, they give up (i.e. kill him). Not wanting to worry them, Dick hides the looming threat from his family. That night, Dick is angered by the methods Quitters uses and notices an undisposed pack of cigarettes in his desk. He prepares to smoke it, but notices a set of feet in his closet, realizing Quitters Inc. is serious about their threat to ensure he is not smoking. The following day, Dick visits his daughter (also played by Drew Barrymore) and gives her a doll. Donatti is also at the school, warning Dick that if he strays the only thing his daughter would understand is that someone is hurting her because her father misbehaved.

(Lo Sai Hung/AP) Like a shot of adrenalin, Hong Kong quickens the pulse. Skyscrapers march up jungle-clad slopes by day and blaze neon by night, across a harbour criss-crossed by freighters and motor junks. Hong Kong can overwhelm but offers fantastic experiences, especially to visitors who are willing to step out of their comfort zone. See The Peak Tram rises above skyscrapers, departing from the lower terminus and climbing to the 552-metre Victoria Peak. On clear days and at night, the view from the top is amazing (7am-midnight, every 15 minutes; £3). The largest of Hong Kong’s Man Mo temples was the hub of civil life on the island in the 19th century. The Taoist temple was built in 1847 by Chinese merchants and was dedicated to the gods of literature, ‘man’, and of war, ‘mo’ (24-126 Hollywood Rd, Sheung Wan; 8am-6pm; free). Hong Kong’s first heritage trail, the Ping Shan, includes the territory’s oldest pagoda, a magnificent ancestral hall and temples. All were built by the Tang clan, the most powerful of the five clans that settled in the New Territories around the 11th century (West Rail Tin Shui Wai station, exit E; 10am-1pm and 2pm-5pm; free). Temple Street Night Market is Hong Kong’s liveliest. Aside from the clothes, watches and footwear on offer, it’s worth a visit for the smells and tastes of the open-air street stall and for the occasional Cantonese opera shows. Night owls should try the fruit market, open from midnight until dawn (Man Ming Lane; 6pm-midnight). Picturesque Tai O, on Lantau island, is one of the oldest fishing villages. It is famous for its stilt houses, rope-tow ferry and temple dedicated to the god of war, Guan Yu. Reach it by bus 1 from the Mui Wo ferry point. Eat and drink Dah Wing Wah is the place to go for the village cuisine of the northern New Territories. Local ingredients are sourced from small farms and food producers. Try the lemon-steamed mullet and smoked oysters (00 852 2476 9888; 2nd fl, Koon Wong Mansion, 2-6 On Ning Rd, Yuen Long; lunch and dinner; mains from £3). Tung Po Seafood Restaurant has revolutionised hawkerstyle cooking. Its novel menu has featured items such as steamed glutinous rice with duck jus.

Famous tea house Luk Yu is known for its dim sum (available from 7am-5pm) and Cantonese dishes. The delectable food and elegant furnishings make up for the cavalier service (00 852 2523 5464; 24-26 Stanley St, Central; lunch and dinner; mains from £8). Ye Shanghai means ‘Shanghai nights’ and its interior is romantic. The Shanghainese food, lighter than traditional Cantonese dishes, is Michelin-starred (00 852 2376 3322; 6th fl, Marco Polo Hotel, Harbour City, Kowloon; lunch and dinner; mains from £12). The atmosphere at T’ang Court is plush, the service impeccable and the food divine. Try sautéed prawns with deep-fried taro puffs (00 852 2375 1133; Langham Hotel, 8 Peking Rd, Tsim Sha Tsui; lunch and dinner; mains from £30). Sleep Hop Inn has a youthful vibe and nine small but artful rooms, each featuring illustrations by a Hong Kong artist. Three rooms have no windows, but the art on the walls makes this seem like less of a problem (00 852 2881 7331; Flat A, 2nd fl, Hanyee Bldg, 19-21 Hankow Rd, Tsim Sha Tsui; from £40). Given its location in the Central Business District, Ice House is excellent value. It’s styled in contemporary fashion with lots of white and colourful, contrasting bedspreads and accessories. Each room has a kitchenette and a work area (00 852 2836 7333; 38 Ice House St, Central; from £80). Many of the handsomely proportioned rooms at the Hyatt Regency Hong Kong, Tsim Sha Tsui feature harbour views. They are modern, with bamboo flooring, king-size beds and large picture windows.

Translate to English","completion":"It is also necessary to recall that the EU must implement policies that ensure that measures aimed at addressing environmental concerns also take into consideration the interests of the inhabitants of the Arctic region, including those of indigenous populations, in protecting and developing the region. Translation: We must also remember that the European Union (EU) has the responsibility to implement policies that make sure that any actions taken with the goal of resolving environmental concerns also consider the interests of those living in the Arctic region. This includes considering the interests of indigenous populations who wish to protect and develop the region. The Arctic region is home to diverse ecosystems, abundant wildlife, and unique cultures. However, the region is facing serious challenges caused by climate change, such as melting sea ice, rising sea levels, and loss of biodiversity. These challenges not only have a direct impact on the local environment and communities but also global implications, such as changing weather patterns and increased carbon emissions due to the melting permafrost. To address these environmental concerns, the European Union must develop and implement effective policies that can help protect and preserve the Arctic environment while promoting sustainable development. These policies should be based on comprehensive scientific research and close collaboration with Arctic stakeholders, including governments, organizations, and local communities. Moreover, the EU's policies should also take into account the interests of the Arctic inhabitants, particularly indigenous populations. Indigenous people have lived in harmony with the Arctic environment for thousands of years, and their knowledge, culture, and traditions are closely connected to the region's ecosystems. These communities have the right to maintain their way of life and participate in the decision-making processes that affect their environment and future. Therefore, the EU should focus on the following aspects while addressing the environmental concerns in the Arctic region: 1. Encouraging and supporting scientific research in the region to better understand the changing dynamics of the Arctic ecosystems and their global implications. 2. Promoting dialogue and cooperation among Arctic stakeholders, including governments, organizations, and local communities, to develop effective and sustainable policies that can help mitigate the impacts of climate change on the region's environment and inhabitants. 3. Ensuring that indigenous communities are meaningfully included in policy development and decision-making processes related to the Arctic environment and its future. This could involve supporting capacity-building initiatives for indigenous organizations, engaging in consultations with indigenous leaders, and acknowledging the value of traditional knowledge in shaping policies. 4. Adopting a precautionary approach in the development and implementation of policies and projects in the Arctic region. This means taking into consideration the potential long-term impacts of any planned actions on the environment, ecosystems, and local communities. 5. Promoting the sustainable development of the Arctic region by investing in clean energy sources, sustainable infrastructure, and resource-efficient technologies that can reduce the environmental footprint while fostering economic growth and social development. In conclusion, addressing environmental concerns in the Arctic region is a complex and challenging task, requiring the European Union to develop and implement comprehensive policies that consider not only the preservation of the environment but also the interests of the inhabitants, including indigenous populations. By promoting collaboration, research, and sustainable development, the EU can play a significant role in protecting and developing the Arctic region while respecting the interests and rights of its inhabitants."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the individual whose holdings included a church and priest, as well as 8 mills, 1 acre of woodland, 320 acres of meadow and 330 acres of marsh? The Sleaford area has been inhabited since the late Iron Age; people settled around the ford where a prehistoric track running northwards from Bourne crossed the River Slea. A large hoard of coin moulds belonging to the Corieltauvi tribe have been uncovered in this area and dated to the late Iron Age. It was occupied by the Romans, and then by the Anglo-Saxons. The place-name Slioford first appears in 852, meaning \\"crossing over a muddy stream\\", in reference to the Slea. The settlement around the crossing came to be known as \\"Old\\" Sleaford in 13th-century sources to distinguish it from developments further west, around the present-day market place, which came to be known as \\"New\\" Sleaford. The origins of New Sleaford are not clear, leading to a theory that it was planted by the Bishop of Lincoln in the 12th century as a means of increasing his income, hence the epithet \\"New\\". The town's compass-point layout, the 12th-century date of St Denys' stonework and other topographical features offer evidence for this theory.A speculative reassessment of Domesday Book (1086) material suggests that St Denys' origins may be earlier. Two manors called Eslaforde (Sleaford) were recorded in the Domesday Book, one held by Remigius, Bishop of Lincoln, the other by Ramsey Abbey. The Bishop succeeded a Saxon thegn, Bardi, and held 11 carucates with 29 villeins, 11 bordars, 6 sokemen, a church and priest, as well as 8 mills, 1 acre of woodland, 320 acres (130 ha) of meadow and 330 acres (130 ha) of marsh. Ramsey Abbey had been granted land in Sleaford and surrounding villages before the Norman Conquest of England; in Domesday its fee consisted of 1 carucate, 1 sokeman, 2 villeins and 27 acres of meadow. It was sokeland of the abbot of Ramsey's manor of Quarrington, where he held two churches. There is no evidence for a second church at Quarrington, which suggests that the record is alluding to one in another of the abbot's manors for which Quarrington was an estate centre.

At the age of 4, she discovers the local library and walks there every day to read while her father is at work, her mother is playing bingo, and her older brother, Michael (Brian Levinson), is at school. At age six-and-a-half, Matilda begins to lose patience with her parents, expressing a desire to go to school. In retaliation for her father constantly berating her, she adds hydrogen peroxide to his hair tonic, turning his hair an unhealthy blonde. He takes his children to his workshop, where he reveals that the cars he sells are faulty. Matilda accuses him of being dishonest and he belittles her, so she responds by putting super glue on his hat, forcing Zinnia to cut it off of his head. She reads a borrowed library copy of Moby-Dick, which Harry rips up while her family is watching television. When he forces her to watch with them, she becomes increasingly angry and causes the television set to suddenly explode.

The first murder investigation began when the stabbed and burnt body of Jamie Dack, 22, was found dumped in a bin at Empress Road Industrial Estate in Southampton at about 03:10 BST on Easter Sunday. Less than 48 hours later, in the early hours of Tuesday, another man's body was discovered in a burnt-out car in Chilworth. 'Highly unusual' A third murder investigation was sparked when a man, aged in his 20s, died following a fight in Waterlooville early on Thursday morning. Mr Marshall said: \\"It's highly unusual to have these incidents in such a short space of time, they're not connected to each other and sometimes in policing this happens, events happen over a short space of time. \\"To put it into context, in my first full year as chief constable we dealt with 18 murders in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.

We have been absolutely stretched but to our advantage the Easter period is quiet which has allowed us to move in resources from other areas.\\" He described murder as \\"very rare\\" in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight and stressed crime had been going down for five years, with the murder rate falling significantly. Post-mortem tests showed the body found in the burnt-out car in Chilworth Drove was a young adult, although his identity is still not clear. Police believe he was dead before the blaze took hold. Mr Marshall said detectives were appealing for sightings of the silver Mercedes coupe hatchback car in the area on Monday. A 23-year-old man is being questioned on suspicion of murder in connection with the death. The identity of the victim who died in Waterlooville victim has not been released. Murder suspect Sean Bailey, 28, is still at large in connection with the death. Mr Marshall said: \\"We are looking for Sean Bailey at the moment.

If the bones are put underground more quickly, it can lead to the formation of more fossils.

Please answer the following question: I showed up at the address on Columbine's invitation just before eleven; it was a converted warehouse in an industrial zone on the city's north side. Since it was a Saturday night, everything else was empty for miles. The parking lot was filled with sports cars, hybrids, and shiny suburban tanks. The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance. The first thing I noticed as I approached was the beefy refrigerator in a rented tux blocking the doorway. The second thing was the surveillance camera perched on the wall above his head. I had stopped home and changed first, so I was sure I was dressed mostly appropriately for some rich faux-hipster art party - charcoal gray pinstripe jacket over a TV on the Radio t-shirt, skinny cuffed jeans, Docs, and a black fedora. I certainly didn't look any worse than the other idiots I saw filing in and out of the door. I even had an invitation. So I was fairly confident I'd be able to gain admission to this thing without incident. \\"No, absolutely not,\\" the doorman said, pressing a meaty palm into my chest. \\"I was invited!\\" I said, exasperated. \\"I have documentation.\\" I waved the rave card in front of his face. \\"No dice.\\" I stepped aside to let a couple of aging goths through the door and wondered for a moment if the doorman somehow knew who I was. Then I noticed the ear piece he was wearing and my eyes darted back to the surveillance camera. \\"Motherfucker,\\" I spat and raised both arms to flip off the camera.

Nationality: He is a German footballer, which indicates that he has either been born and raised in Germany or has chosen to represent Germany in international football competitions. 3. Playing Position: Felix Dausend plays as a striker in football. Strikers are usually responsible for scoring goals and are typically the most forward players in their team's formation. This reveals that he is likely a skillful and agile player with a talent for scoring or assisting in goals. 4. Current Club: He plays for Borussia Neunkirchen. This provides insight into his current profession, as well as the country and league in which he plays. Borussia Neunkirchen is a football club based in Neunkirchen, Saarland, Germany, which currently competes in the Saarlandliga, a sixth-tier German football league.

A:","completion":"No, the given statement, \\"It is a record in digital format that is theoretically capable of being shared across different health care settings.\\" is not a reasonable answer to the question: \\"What percent of providers have electronic health records?\\" The statement provided simply defines what electronic health records are, but does not address the percentage of providers who actually use them. To answer the question properly, we would need to gather statistical data on the use of electronic health records among healthcare providers. Here's a possible response based on available data: According to the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), as of 2017, approximately 86% of office-based physicians have adopted an electronic health record (EHR) system in the United States. It is important to note that these statistics may vary depending on the source and the specific criteria used to define EHR adoption. Furthermore, hospital adoption of EHR systems has increased significantly over the past decade. As of 2017, 96% of non-federal acute care hospitals were using EHRs, according to the ONC. Globally, EHR adoption rates may vary depending on factors such as the availability of financial and technical resources, government policy, and the existing healthcare infrastructure in a particular country or region. In summary, although \\"It is a record in digital format that is theoretically capable of being shared across different health care settings.\\" accurately describes electronic health records, it does not adequately answer the question about the percentage of providers using such systems.

In western countries red is a symbol of martyrs and sacrifice, particularly because of its association with blood. Beginning in the Middle Ages, the Pope and Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church wore red to symbolize the blood of Christ and the Christian martyrs. The banner of the Christian soldiers in the First Crusade was a red cross on a white field, the St. George's Cross. According to Christian tradition, Saint George was a Roman soldier who was a member of the guards of the Emperor Diocletian, who refused to renounce his Christian faith and was martyred. The Saint George's Cross became the Flag of England in the 16th century, and now is part of the Union Flag of the United Kingdom, as well as the Flag of the Republic of Georgia.

Tonight, 9 o'clock, CBS. 1 STAR Everything you need to know about tonight's CBS telemovie, \\"Crime in Connecticut: The Story of Alex Kelly\\" (at 9), occurs during the closing credits, after the dismally dull docudrama itself is all but over. First there's a brief return appearance by Cassidy Rae, who, in this dramatization of a well-known 1986 Connecticut criminal case, stars as a 16-year-old who accuses her preppy teen neighbor of rape, then spends the next decade pursuing justice after he skips bail and flees the country before the trial. Rae appears at the very end, out of character, to deliver a national public-service announcement offering a toll-free number for victims of sex crimes to seek confidential aid. Those few seconds of airtime are more instructive, and certainly more justifiable, than the two hours preceding it. Then, at the end of the closing credits, comes the copyright date noting when this particular Canadian-made telemovie was completed. That means CBS has kept this film on the shelf for more than a year and, when finally scheduling it, threw it onto its prime-time schedule on a slow night, midway through a slow TV month, with equally little promotion and conviction. If that doesn't send out signal flares that \\"Crime in Connecticut\\" is a waste of time, I don't know what does. Rather than rely purely on deduction, however, I watched this telemovie, and can say with authority that the advance warning signs were right. The Kelly family tried, and failed, to stop CBS from showing this dramatization which makes sense, because from the very first frame, and certainly including the rape scene, writer Graham Flashner and director Ted Kotcheff adhere loyally to the victim's side of the story. \\"You're gonna make love to me, or I'll kill you,\\" Matthew Settle as Kelly growls at Rae's Carrie Roberts, and his younger neighbor fearfully complies. \\"Crime in Connecticut\\" spends nearly an hour explaining how the title character fled the country. After that, it's a slow march to justice, with the boy's mother, played by Margot Kidder, blindly supportive most of the way. (Kelly was convicted of rape in 1997 and given a 16-year prison term.) The events recounted in this telemovie are dramatic, but the way they're acted, written and directed is not. Even the trial scenes are edited and performed wearily, and not even Kidder manages to break through the sheen of boredom.

Movie title: Alien vs. Hunter Movie plot: A journalist named Lee Custler (William Katt) is out jogging when a flying object passes behind him and crashes. Sheriff Joel Armstrong (Collin Brock) picks him up and they go to check it out. They find an abandoned caravan close to where the object crashed. As they discover the object and realize it is a spaceship, an Alien emerges. The Alien then chases them, after which Lee flees to the car. However Armstrong makes a stand, trips, falls and is killed by the Alien that then leaves. A terrified Tammy finds Lee and they call the local authorities but their car is destroyed by the Alien. They run to a local cafÃ© where they meet Hilary, Javier, Figgus and Marcy who do not believe them. Together they go back where they find Garrison wounded and the other passenger gone. Garrison says that everyone else died. The Alien then appears and kills Marcy, and while the others flee it fights a cyborg-like Hunter. The group decides to go to Valentines, the local hunter, through the sewers. All except Javier, who is killed by the Alien, make it to Valentine's and his daughter Freckle's house where they call for the support of a local paramilitary team. Valentine attempts to kill the Hunter, only to be nearly killed instead, but he makes it alive. The group then splits up: Valentine and Lee go to meet the paramilitary force while Tammy, Hillary, Freckles, Garrison and Figgus try to escape through a set of tunnels. Garrison gets lost in the tunnels and killed by the Alien but the others make it to the hunterâs ship to their dismay. There they find a second Alien that's nearly dead and figure out that to get rid of the Hunter they need to kill the Alien and take a ray gun from the ship. Lee and Valentine find Two Fingers, Marty and Styles, the paramilitary force, and go to find T and Lexin who are in the woods. But they are already dead and the Hunter kills Marty, and kicks Styles away flying right near the Alien who kills both him and Valentine, who tries to save him. The few survivors meet and while they try to think of... A:","completion":"In the movie \\"Alien vs. Hunter,\\" Sheriff Joel Armstrong and Lee Custler realize that the crashed object is actually a spaceship. This discovery leads to a series of terrifying events, as an alien creature emerges from the spaceship and begins to attack the people in the area. As the story unfolds, an additional threat is introduced in the form of a cyborg-like Hunter, who is engaged in a violent conflict with the Alien. The remaining human characters must then navigate the dangerous situation, forming alliances and using their wits to survive the deadly creatures that have invaded their town. Throughout the course of the film, the characters face numerous challenges and losses, both in terms of personal safety and the lives of their friends and loved ones. In an effort to end the threat posed by the Alien and the Hunter, they devise a plan to kill the Alien, as they have deduced that the Hunter will only leave once its mission is complete. Gaining access to the Hunter's ship, the group manages to acquire a ray gun, which they intend to use in their battle against the Alien. Meanwhile, Lee and Valentine join forces with a local paramilitary force to confront the Hunter and any remaining Aliens in the area. As the film reaches its climax, each of the remaining characters must face the deadly creatures in a final, bloody showdown. During the course of these confrontations, several members of the group are killed, but the survivors ultimately prevail by successfully eliminating the Alien threat and, as a result, forcing the Hunter to leave the town. While the town and its survivors are left to mourn their losses and attempt to rebuild their shattered lives, the overall message of the movie underscores the resilience and courage of the human spirit when confronted with unknown and deadly adversaries. In summary, Sheriff Joel Armstrong and Lee Custler, along with other characters in the film, discover that the crashed object that began the terrifying chain of events is a spaceship carrying an alien creature and its powerful, cyborg-like Hunter adversary. The main conflict of the movie revolves around the struggle between the humans caught in this deadly scenario and their attempts to survive and overcome these otherworldly threats. The ultimate resolution is achieved when the remaining characters manage to eliminate the Alien, thereby forcing the Hunter to withdraw and leave the town in relative peace."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: CONTEXT: 1 de enero de 2017 Tres personas vestidas de Papá Noel entraron esta noche en una discoteca famosa de Estambul y abrieron fuego contra los clientes, causando al menos 35 muertos y 40 heridos. El ataque tuvo lugar en el club Reina, situado en la orilla del Bósforo, un conocido lugar de ocio de la sociedad de Estambul. El gobernador de Estambul, Vasip Sahin, declaró a la prensa que el ataque ha dejado 35 muertos y 40 heridos, informó la cadena NTV. Los atacantes abrieron fuego con armas automáticas de manera indiscriminada desde la puerta del local, matando al policía de guardia, y luego entraron en el local, en el que se hallaban unas 800 personas celebrando la Nochevieja. Los testigos del ataque aseguraron que los atacantes gritaban consignas en árabe. La policía ha desplazado numerosos agentes al lugar para registrar el local, además de numerosas ambulancias, y se realizan esfuerzos para salvar a numerosos clientes del club que se le lanzaron al Bósforo presas del pánico. La televisión turca ha publicado imágenes que muestran los vehículos blindados de la policía estacionados frente al lugar de los hechos, a donde también se han enviado ambulancias para asistir a los lesionados. Por el momento se desconoce las causas del ataque, del que nadie se ha responsabilizado. Turquía en los últimos meses ha sido blanco de una serie de atentados terroristas reivindicados tanto por el grupo terrorista EIIL (Daesh, en árabe) como por las guerrillas kurdas secesionistas, como el Partido de los Trabajadores del Kurdistán (PKK, en kurdo).

Please answer the following question: Information: - Inflammation (from Latin \\"inflammatio\\") is part of the complex biological response of body tissues to harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants, and is a protective response involving immune cells, blood vessels, and molecular mediators. The function of inflammation is to eliminate the initial cause of cell injury, clear out necrotic cells and tissues damaged from the original insult and the inflammatory process, and to initiate tissue repair. - Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; also icosapentaenoic acid) is an omega-3 fatty acid. In physiological literature, it is given the name 20:5(n-3). It also has the trivial name timnodonic acid. In chemical structure, EPA is a carboxylic acid with a 20-carbon chain and five \\"cis\\" double bonds; the first double bond is located at the third carbon from the omega end. - The blood vessels are the part of the circulatory system that transports blood throughout the human body. There are three major types of blood vessels: the arteries, which carry the blood away from the heart; the capillaries, which enable the actual exchange of water and chemicals between the blood and the tissues; and the veins, which carry blood from the capillaries back toward the heart. The word \\"vascular\\", meaning relating to the blood vessels, is derived from the Latin \\"vas\\", meaning vessel. A few structures (such as cartilage and the lens of the eye) do not contain blood vessels and are labeled. - Eicosanoids are signaling molecules made by the enzymatic or non-enzymatic oxidation of arachidonic acid or other polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that are, like arachidonic acid, 20 carbon units in length. They are a sub-category of oxylipins, i.e. oxidized fatty acids of diverse carbon units in length but are further distinguished from other oxylipins by their overwhelming importance as cell signaling molecules. Eicosanoids function in diverse physiological and pathological systems including those: mounting or inhibiting inflammation, allergy, fever and other immune responses; influencing the abortion of pregnancy and normal childbirth; contributing to the perception of pain; regulating cell growth; controlling blood pressure; and modulating the regional flow of blood to tissues. In performing these tasks, eicosanoids most often act as autocrine signaling agents to impact their cells of origin or as paracrine signaling agents to impact cells near to their cells of origin. However, they can also act as endocrine agents to control the function of distant cells. - Enzymes are macromolecular biological catalysts. Enzymes accelerate, or catalyze, chemical reactions. The molecules at the beginning of the process upon which enzymes may act are called substrates and the enzyme converts these into different molecules, called products. Almost all metabolic processes in the cell need enzymes in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life. The set of enzymes made in a cell determines which metabolic pathways occur in that cell. The study of enzymes is called \\"enzymology\\". - Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase, also known as ALOX5, 5-lipoxygenase, 5-LOX, or 5-LO, is a non-heme iron-containing enzyme (EC 1.13.11.34) that in humans is encoded by the \\"ALOX5\\" gene. Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase is a member of the lipoxygenase family of enzymes. It transforms EFA substrates into leukotrienes as well as a wide range of other biologically active products. ALOX5 is a current target for pharmaceutical intervention in a number of diseases. - Leukotriene B4 is a leukotriene involved in inflammation . It is produced from leukocytes in response to inflammatory mediators and is able to induce the adhesion and activation of leukocytes on the endothelium , allowing them to bind to and cross it into the tissue . In neutrophils , it is also a potent chemoattractant , and is able to induce the formation of reactive oxygen species and the release of lysosomal enzymes by these cells . It is synthesized by leukotriene - A4 hydrolase from leukotriene A4 . - Essential fatty acids, or EFAs, are fatty acids that humans and other animals must ingest because the body requires them for good health but cannot synthesize them. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - Leukotrienes are a family of eicosanoid inflammatory mediators produced in leukocytes by the oxidation of arachidonic acid (AA) and the essential fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) by the enzyme arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase. - Arachidonic acid (AA, sometimes ARA) is a polyunsaturated omega-6 fatty acid 20:4(-6). It is structurally related to the saturated arachidic acid found in Cupuaçu butter (\\"L. arachis\\" peanut). Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'has part' with the subject 'leukotriene b4'.

The Qin unified the Chinese Warring States by conquest, but their empire became unstable after the death of the first emperor Qin Shi Huangdi. Within four years, the dynasty's authority had collapsed in the face of rebellion. Two former rebel leaders, Xiang Yu (d. 202 BC) of Chu and Liu Bang (d. 195 BC) of Han, engaged in a war to decide who would become hegemon of China, which had fissured into 18 kingdoms, each claiming allegiance to either Xiang Yu or Liu Bang.

This 1984 version of the Dickens' classic \`A Christmas Carol,' directed by Clive Donner, stars George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge. By this time around, the challenge for the filmmaker was to take such familiar material and make it seem fresh and new again; and, happily to say, with this film Donner not only met the challenge but surpassed any expectations anyone might have had for it. He tells the story with precision and an eye to detail, and extracts performances from his actors that are nothing less than superlative, especially Scott. One could argue that the definitive portrayal of Scrooge-- one of the best known characters in literary fiction, ever-- was created by Alastair Sim in the 1951 film; but I think with his performance here, Scott has now achieved that distinction. There is such a purity and honesty in his Scrooge that it becomes difficult to even consider anyone else in the role once you've seen Scott do it; simply put, he IS Scrooge. And what a tribute it is to such a gifted actor; to be able to take such a well known figure and make it so uniquely his own is quite miraculous. It is truly a joy to see an actor ply his trade so well, to be able to make a character so real, from every word he utters down to the finest expression of his face, and to make it all ring so true. It's a study in perfection. The other members of the cast are splendid as well, but then again they have to be in order to maintain the integrity of Scott's performance; and they do. Frank Finlay is the Ghost of Jacob Marley; a notable turn, though not as memorable, perhaps, as the one by Alec Guinness (as Marley) in the film, \`Scrooge.' Angela Pleasence is a welcome visage as the Spirit of Christmas Past; Edward Woodward, grand and boisterous, and altogether convincing as the Spirit of Christmas Present; and Michael Carter, grim and menacing as the Spirit of Christmas Yet To Come. David Warner hits just the right mark with his Bob Cratchit, bringing a sincerity to the role that measures up well to the standard of quality set by Scott's Scrooge, and Susannah York fares just as well as Mrs. Cratchit. The real gem to be found here, though, is the performance of young Anthony Walters as Tiny Tim; it's heartfelt without ever becoming maudlin, and simply one of the best interpretations-- and the most real-- ever presented on film. The excellent supporting cast includes Roger Rees (Fred Holywell, and also the narrator of the film), Caroline Langrishe (Janet Holywell), Lucy Gutteridge (Belle), Michael Gough (Mr. Poole) and Joanne Whalley (Fan). A flawless presentation, this version of \`A Christmas Carol' sets the standard against which all others must be gauged; no matter how many versions you may have seen, watching this one is like seeing it for the first time ever. And forever after, whenever you think of Scrooge, the image your mind will conjure up will be that of George C. Scott. A thoroughly entertaining and satisfying experience, this film demands a place in the annual schedule of the holiday festivities of every home. I rate this one 10/10. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is highly positive and praiseful.

Captured Moments by Will Shetterly I remember Papa's stopbox, a teal blue Tiempo Capturado that Mama brought home for his birthday. It was huge and inefficient, and she should never have spent so many pesos on a toy, but Papa would not let her return it. He used it to preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter. Mama kept her mink jacket, a family hand-me-down, safe from time in a stopbox, and lent the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection. Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it. When my father died, a year after my mother, my sisters and I cleaned out their apartment. We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes. I took mine home, where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play. One night when I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone, I used my own capturador, a sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora, to undo the stopbox. Bringing my face close to the shoes, I breathed deeply of air that my parents had trapped while closing up that symbol of their love for me.

There are differing opinions as to how much, and what type, of rubato is appropriate for his works. Charles Rosen comments that \\"most of the written-out indications of rubato in Chopin are to be found in his mazurkas ... It is probable that Chopin used the older form of rubato so important to Mozart ... [where] the melody note in the right hand is delayed until after the note in the bass ...

Movie title: The Right Stuff Movie plot: In 1947, the Muroc Army Air Field in California has test pilots fly high-speed aircraft such as the rocket-powered Bell X-1, but they die as a result. After another pilot, Slick Goodlin, demands 150,000 to attempt to break the sound barrier, war hero Captain Chuck Yeager receives the chance to fly the X-1. While on a horseback ride with his wife Glennis, Yeager collides with a tree branch and breaks his ribs, which inhibits him from leaning over and locking the door to the X-1. Worried that he might not fly the mission, Yeager confides in friend and fellow pilot Jack Ridley. Ridley cuts off part of a broomstick and tells Yeager to use it as a lever to help seal the hatch to the X-1, and Yeager becomes the first person to fly at supersonic speed, defeating the \\"demon in the sky\\". Six years later, Muroc, now Edwards Air Force Base, still attracts the best test pilots. Yeager (now a major) and friendly rival Scott Crossfield repeatedly break the other's speed records. They often visit the Happy Bottom Riding Club run by Pancho Barnes, who classifies the pilots at Edwards as either \\"prime\\" (such as Yeager and Crossfield) that fly the best equipment or newer \\"pudknockers\\" who only dream about it.

Title: The Philadelphia Experiment Movie plot: In 1943 United States Navy sailors David Herdeg (Michael ParÃ©) and Jim Parker (Bobby Di Cicco) are assigned to the destroyer escort USS Eldridge during a project to make it invisible to radar. The ship is in Philadelphia harbor, filled with equipment from a team led by James Longstreet (Eric Christmas). During the experiment the equipment begins malfunctioning. Observers simply see the ship disappear but sailors on board experience a bizarre and disorienting phase shift.

Instead of landing in Philadelphia harbor during the daytime, David and Jim land during the night in a small desert town, which then disappears as well, leaving them in the dark open desert. They are startled by the appearance of bright light in the sky - it's a military helicopter with a spotlight looking for intruders. They escape into the desert and eventually find their way to a diner the next day.

The characters and actors are likable, realistic and present fine performances. Most important, I believe, is that Dennis Quaid knows how to grip and throw a baseball.

So many earlier baseball movies, even where the stories might be interesting, presented such a lack of baseball ability on the part of the leads, they were ludicrous in this respect. In \\"The Stratton Story\\" and \\"Strategic Air Command,\\" Jimmy Stewart looked about as believable as a professional baseball player, as your overweight, non-athletic, elderly uncle in the softball game at the family reunion. Other virile and physically robust stars (e.g., Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig; Robald Reagan as Grover Cleveland Alexander; and Dan Dailey as Dizzy Dean) also exhibited a degree of baseball ability that would put them in the late rounds while \\"choosing-up\\" for a game at the Sunday picnic (even if coed, and even if your uncle were involved). The scenes of Quaid's high school team he coached, the ones where he attends his tryout with the Devil Rays, and those with him playing in two minor leagues and in the American League, all ring true. The participants are believable and capable. In addition, he is an engaging actor who always delivers a talented and appropriate characterization (except, to a degree, some of his \\"over-the-top\\" scenes, and his forced accent, in his portrayal of Jerry Lee Lewis).

Those in the group range from the well-known like former Vice President Joe Biden and 2016 contender Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to a younger, less recognizable contingent that includes California Senator Kamala Harris and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Several potential Democratic presidential contenders spoke about the party's future at a recent conference in Washington hosted by the Center for American Progress, a Democratic-leaning public policy institute in Washington.

We look at the possible answers and determine their relevancy to the question. Step 2: Evaluate each option 1. annoyance - This could be a possible reaction to the situation, as some people may be annoyed by the spread of gossip or information that doesn't interest them. However, it doesn't encompass the full scope of the potential outcome. 2. notoriety - This is the most relevant answer, as it directly describes a person becoming well-known for their actions, which is a clear consequence of telling many people about their escapades. 3. emotional distress - It is possible that the person in question could experience emotional distress as a result of their exploits being talked about, but this is not a definitive outcome and may vary depending on the context. 4. religion - This answer has little to no connection to the question, as the spread of information about someone's actions is not specifically linked to religious beliefs or practices. 5. riot - While spreading information about someone's actions could potentially lead to a riot in extreme circumstances, it is not the most common or expected outcome, so it is less aligned with human common sense.

The United States Congress enacted the Securities Act of 1933, also known as the 1933 Act, the Securities Act, the Truth in Securities Act, the Federal Securities Act, or the '33 Act, Title I of Pub. L. 73-22, 48 Stat. 74, codified at 15 U.S.C. § 77a et seq.), was enacted by the US Congress on May 27, 1933, during the Great Depression, after the stock market crash of 1929. Legislated pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Clause of the Constitution, it requires every offer or sale of securities that uses the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce to be registered with the SEC pursuant to the 1933 Act, unless an exemption from registration exists under the law. The term \`\`Means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce'' is extremely broad, and it is virtually impossible to avoid the operation of the statute by attempting to offer or sell a security without using an \`\`instrumentality'' of interstate commerce. Any use of a telephone, for example, or the mails would probably be enough to subject the transaction to the statute. is the securities act of 1933 still in effect?","completion":"Yes, the Securities Act of 1933 is still in effect. The Act was enacted following the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression to protect investors and restore confidence in the financial markets. Over the years, it has undergone various amendments and refinements but remains a critical framework governing securities law in the United States. The primary objectives of the Securities Act of 1933 are to: 1. Require companies to disclose relevant financial and non-financial information to potential investors, enabling them to make informed investment decisions. 2. Prevent fraud and misrepresentation in the issuance of securities, which was commonplace prior to the enactment of the legislation. 3. Regulate the primary market of securities, where the issuance and distribution of new securities take place. The requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 include mandatory registration of securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) unless an exemption applies. This disclosure process involves filing a registration statement that includes detailed information about the issuing company, its management, financial condition, and the securities being issued. The SEC reviews the registration statement for compliance with the disclosure requirements and, once satisfied, declares it effective, after which the company is free to offer and sell the securities. There are several exemptions from the registration requirements, such as private placements made under Regulation D, intrastate offerings, and securities issued by the government, among others. Companies issuing securities under these exemptions are subject to specific rules and requirements, but the process is less burdensome compared to the full registration process. In addition to the original 1933 Act, other legislation has been enacted to enhance the regulation of securities markets, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. These acts, along with the 1933 Securities Act, constitute the foundation of securities law in the United States, which is continuously updated and refined to adapt to evolving financial markets and practices. In conclusion, the Securities Act of 1933 remains in effect as an essential aspect of the US securities law. Its focus on ensuring financial transparency and investor protection has contributed significantly to the stability and growth of the US financial markets."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The command to be classified is: \\"round_eq { avg { all_rows ; us viewers ( millions ) } ; 2.46 }\\" Before classifying the command, it's important to understand what it's doing. Breakdown of the command: 1. \\"avg\\": This operation is calculating the average of the values under the \\"us viewers (millions)\\" column for all rows. 2. \\"round_eq\\": This operation is checking if the average calculated in the first step is approximately equal to 2.46, considering a certain tolerance. Now, we can classify this command: Using the given definitions, the command falls into the \\"Aggregation\\" category. This is because it is figuring out an average value for the \\"us viewers (millions)\\" column, which is then involved in a comparison to another value (2.46 in this case). \\"Aggregation\\" is about describing the sum or average value over a single column, in a certain scope of rows - in this case, it's the entire table (\\"all_rows\\").

Continue writing the following text. The doctor operated on the pancreas but not the liver because the","completion":"patient was suffering from pancreatitis, a condition that required immediate attention to alleviate inflammation and prevent further complications. Pancreatitis is an ailment where the pancreas, an essential organ located behind the stomach, becomes inflamed due to various factors such as gallstones, excessive alcohol consumption, or autoimmune disorders. The pancreas plays a critical role in the digestive process by producing insulin to regulate blood sugar levels and enzymes that aid in breaking down food. The doctor's primary focus was on addressing the pancreatitis because if left untreated, it could lead to severe complications such as persistent pain, malnutrition, and, in extreme cases, organ failure or death. The inflammation of the pancreas causes the release of digestive enzymes, which begin to attack the pancreas itself, leading to damage and, occasionally, infection. As a result, the pancreas must be treated swiftly to prevent irreversible damage and restore normal function. Though the liver is another vital organ that contributes significantly to our overall health, in this instance, it was not the primary concern for the medical team. The liver performs various essential functions, including detoxification of harmful substances, metabolism, and producing bile to help digest fat. While certain diseases and conditions can negatively affect the liver, such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, or fatty liver disease, these were not the immediate concern for the patient in this case. The doctor carefully studied the patient's medical history, symptoms, and test results to rule out any liver-related issues before proceeding with the surgery. With a higher priority placed on addressing the pancreatitis, the surgeon developed a plan tailored to the patient's unique needs, factoring in the severity and underlying cause of the pancreatitis. The medical team closely monitored the patient's condition during surgery to ensure that they did not inadvertently contribute to any further complications. Treating pancreatitis may involve various surgical procedures, including the removal of the gallbladder, drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts, or clearing blocked ducts. In this patient's case, after determining the most appropriate surgical approach, the doctor successfully operated on the pancreas, resulting in a significant reduction in inflammation, alleviation of pain, and substantial improvement in the patient's overall wellbeing. While the liver was not operated on or treated, the medical team nevertheless monitored its function closely during the treatment process and will continue to do so in the patient's future check-ups. Regular screenings and follow-ups will help ensure that the liver remains healthy and functioning optimally, and any potential issues can be detected and addressed early before they escalate into more severe and challenging problems. In conclusion, the doctor decided to operate on the pancreas and not the liver because the patient's primary issue was pancreatitis. Their actions aimed to treat the patient's immediate concerns effectively, prevent further complications, and pave the way towards a full recovery and a healthy life. The importance of addressing the pancreatitis first demonstrates the principle of triage, where medical professionals prioritize the most critical and time-sensitive issues to achieve the best possible health outcomes for their patients."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Chinatown is a 1974 American neo-noir mystery film, directed by Roman Polanski from a screenplay by Robert Towne, starring Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. The film was inspired by the California Water Wars, a series of disputes over southern California water at the beginning of the 20th century, by which Los Angeles interests secured water rights in the Owens Valley. The Robert Evans production, a Paramount Pictures release, was the director's last film in the United States and features many elements of film noir, particularly a multi-layered story that is part mystery and part psychological drama. Can we conclude that is the movie chinatown based on a true story?","completion":"While the movie \\"Chinatown\\" is not based on a specific true story, it is heavily inspired by historical events and real-life situations that occurred in California during the early 20th century. The film uses the California Water Wars as a backdrop and combines elements of fiction and reality to create a complex narrative that addresses themes such as corruption, greed, and power. The California Water Wars were a series of conflicts and controversies over water rights and resources in Southern California, specifically in the Owens Valley. Los Angeles, a rapidly growing city at the time, sought access to water sources to meet its increasing demand. Under the supervision of water department superintendent William Mulholland, the city obtained water rights to the Owens Valley, leading to the construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913. These events deeply impacted the Owens Valley communities, as their water resources were significantly reduced or depleted. This struggle over water rights, as well as the corruption and political maneuvering that accompanied it, serves as the primary inspiration for the film. \\"Chinatown\\" blends fiction with these historical events to create a unique and powerful narrative. The main protagonist, J.J. Gittes (played by Jack Nicholson), is a private investigator who becomes entangled in a web of deceit, betrayal, and murder as he uncovers a vast conspiracy surrounding the misappropriation of water resources in southern California. However, it is important to note that the characters and specific events depicted in \\"Chinatown\\" are not direct representations of historical figures and occurrences. For example, the film's villain Noah Cross (played by John Huston) is a character inspired by real-life individuals involved in the California Water Wars but is not a representation of a specific person. Similarly, the character of Evelyn Mulwray (played by Faye Dunaway) is not based on a real individual, but her last name, Mulwray, appears to be an homage to William Mulholland. In conclusion, while \\"Chinatown\\" is not based on a particular true story, it is heavily influenced by the real-life events that took place during the California Water Wars. The film skillfully intertwines fact and fiction, incorporating historical context and elements of noir to create an engaging and complex mystery that continues to resonate with audiences today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I heard that Casey drew Skylar's attention to the fact in order to protect her. And I was wondering How would Casey feel afterwards? The answer is:","completion":"To determine how Casey would feel after drawing Skylar's attention to the fact in order to protect her, I will follow these steps: 1. Analyze the situation and the relationship between Casey and Skylar. 2. Consider the possible emotions and thoughts that Casey might have after taking action. 3. Determine the most likely emotion or state of mind for Casey after the action. Step 1: Analyzing the situation and relationship - Casey and Skylar seem to have a relationship where they care for each other since Casey took action to protect Skylar. - The fact that Casey felt the need to protect Skylar signifies that either Skylar was in potential danger or in a vulnerable situation, and Casey wanted to help her out of that situation. Step 2: Considering possible emotions and thoughts for Casey - Relief: Casey might feel relief after successfully drawing Skylar's attention to the fact, which has protected her from harm or danger. - Concern: Despite having protected her, Casey might still feel concerned about the situation and express interest or anxiety about Skylar's well-being. - Pride: Casey could experience pride for having acted on their intuition and successfully ensuring Skylar's safety. - Happiness: Casey could feel happy knowing that their action made a positive impact on Skylar's life. Step 3: Determining the most likely emotion or state of mind for Casey after the action Taking into consideration the situation and the range of emotions that Casey could experience, it is most likely that Casey would feel a combination of relief, concern, and happiness. Relief and happiness would stem from successfully protecting Skylar and contributing positively to her well-being, while concern would be due to the nature of the situation and the possible continuation of any related issues. So, the answer is: Casey would most likely feel a mixture of relief, concern, and happiness after drawing Skylar's attention to the fact in order to protect her."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His mother, Margaret Mary \\"Peggy\\" (née Burns; 2 October 1913 – 2 April 2001), was born at Shorncliffe Army Camp near Cheriton, Kent. Her paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants who had settled in Manchester. She worked as a waitress at a cinema in Royal Tunbridge Wells. His father, Haywood Stenton \\"John\\" Jones (21 November 1912 – 5 August 1969), was from Doncaster, and worked as a promotions officer for the children's charity Barnardo's. The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road, on the boundary between Brixton and Stockwell in the south London borough of Lambeth. Bowie attended Stockwell Infants School until he was six years old, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child—and a defiant brawler.In 1953, Bowie moved with his family to Bromley. Two years later, he started attending Burnt Ash Junior School. His voice was considered \\"adequate\\" by the school choir, and he demonstrated above-average abilities in playing the recorder. At the age of nine, his dancing during the newly-introduced music and movement classes was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations \\"vividly artistic\\" and his poise \\"astonishing\\" for a child. The same year, his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American 45s by artists including the Teenagers, the Platters, Fats Domino, Elvis Presley, and Little Richard. Upon listening to Little Richard's song \\"Tutti Frutti\\", Bowie would later say that he had \\"heard God\\".Bowie was first impressed with Presley when he saw his cousin dance to \\"Hound Dog\\". By the end of the following year, he had taken up the ukulele and tea-chest bass, begun to participate in skiffle sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile, his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and Chuck Berry—complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists—to his local Wolf Cub group was described as \\"mesmerizing ... like someone from another... answer the following question: What is the real name of the person whose father brought home a collection of American 45s?

You know how when we do bad things, we get punished, like being sent to bed without dessert? In this case, a lady named Carla Hughes did something very, very bad. On a certain Tuesday, some people got together to decide if she deserved a timeout. These people are called a jury, kind of like when your teacher decides if you've been naughty or nice. These jurors said that Carla Hughes was very naughty. Here's what she did: In 2006, she hurt another lady named Avis Banks, who was going to have a baby in four months (that's like waiting for Christmas to come twice!). Carla didn't just hurt Avis, she hurt her really bad and Avis couldn't survive. It was just like when a villain hurts a superhero in a movie, but sadly this was real, not a movie. But why did Carla do this? Prosecutors, who are like detective mummy and daddy trying to find out why the cookie jar is empty, said Carla did this because she liked Avis's fiance. You know how in some stories, a person might do mean things because they want someone else's toys? This was kind of like that. But in this case, the 'toy' was a man named Keyon Pittman. Here's another interesting thing: Carla and Keyon were both teachers at a school. Yes, just like Ms. Rachel who teaches you how to count and Mr. Paul who reads you stories!
