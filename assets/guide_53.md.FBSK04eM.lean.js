You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: Reflections generally affect polarization. For radio waves, one important reflector is the ionosphere which can change the wave's polarization. Thus for signals received following reflection by the ionosphere (a skywave), a consistent polarization cannot be expected. For line-of-sight communications or ground wave propagation, horizontally or vertically polarized transmissions generally remain in about the same polarization state at the receiving location. Matching the receiving antenna's polarization to that of the transmitter can make a very substantial difference in received signal strength. Question: What reflector can change the waves polarization?","completion":"The reflector that can change the wave's polarization, according to the given article, is the ionosphere. The ionosphere, a layer of the Earth's atmosphere filled with ions and free electrons, has significant effects on radio wave propagation. One of these effects is the ability to change the polarization of waves. This means that it alters the plane in which the electric field of the radio wave vibrates. This reflection-induced change in polarization is a critical consideration for radio signals that depend on ionospheric reflection, also known as skywave propagation. Such signals cannot retain a consistent polarization after their reflection off the ionosphere because the ionosphere's electron density varies both temporally and spatially, leading to these inconsistent polarization effects. Thus, the wave's polarization that was initially set when the wave was transmitted may not be the same when the wave reaches its receiving point after bouncing off the ionosphere. In contrast, for the line-of-sight communication or ground wave propagation where direct paths are involved, the original polarization of transmitted waves - whether horizontal or vertical - is generally maintained at the receiving location. This is due to the lack of reflection surfaces that could potentially alter the wave's polarization status. Polarization is a significant parameter in antenna design and signal propagation, as the matching of the receiving antenna's polarization to that of the transmitter's can make a tremendous difference in received signal strength. Therefore, understanding the behaviour of polarization upon reflection, particularly from the ionosphere for radio signals, is significant in the field of telecommunications and radio signal propagation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Well, I'm not a famous film star, but I do work for a film studio, and I do meet famous actors every day. I'm a Foley artist--I make the sounds that are added to films after they have been filmed. Why does this need to be done? Well, if actors are filming a fight scene, you can't expect them to really hit each other or break each other's bones, so Foley artists have to find suitable sound. If you come into my studio and find me throwing wet towels at the wall and breaking carrots in half, don't worry. I'm just recording a fight scene. When my kids were little, they loved our Christmas films because we always needed to record the sound of children walking on snow. It doesn't often snow in California, so I had to create the sound in the studio. I used to cover part of studio floor with salt crystals and pour thick flour over the top. Then I brought my kids and their friends to the studio so that I could record them walking in the \\"snow\\". After the recording, they never wanted to leave; they stayed and played, they got \\"snow\\" in their shoes, on their clothes, even in their hair! These days studios use computers to create such common sounds as footsteps on snow. Some Foley artists see computers as a threat but I welcome the new technology. A lot of \\"everyday\\" sounds used to take a whole day to create, so there was a lot of pressure to get everything done on time. With computers, there's a lot less stress and I can devote more of my time to creating unusual sound effects. As long as people keep coming up with new ideas for films, studios will need Foley artists to come up with the sounds for them. Question: Most modern studios _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"use computers for everyday sounds\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the answer is \\"use computers for everyday sounds.\\" Most modern studios have adopted the use of computers and technology to create everyday sounds, making the process more efficient and less time-consuming for Foley artists. This allows them to focus on creating unique and more complex sound effects required for films."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Translate this to English?","completion":"Now is the time to join Presidents Obama and Medvedev in implementing disarmament. This statement expresses a viewpoint that demonstrates the need for collaboration between nations, particularly the United States and Russia, in the area of disarmament. The mention of Presidents Obama and Medvedev reflects the time when both leaders played an essential role in furthering the dialogue around reducing their countries' nuclear stockpiles and promoting global security. During the period when Barack Obama served as the President of the United States (2009-2017) and Dmitry Medvedev as the President of Russia (2008-2012), both leaders had emphasized the significance of disarmament initiatives. Under their leadership, the two nations signed the New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) in 2010, which aimed to further reduce strategic arms in both the United States and Russia. The New START treaty has been a crucial step towards promoting a more secure and peaceful international environment. It has limited the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads and implemented verification mechanisms that have been mutually beneficial for both countries. Additionally, this treaty has contributed to a more transparent and predictable relationship between the United States and Russia, enhancing trust and cooperation in global nuclear disarmament efforts. Disarmament is an essential component of global security, as it seeks to reduce the number of weapons and threats posed by their existence. By joining Presidents Obama and Medvedev in implementing disarmament, nations can work together in achieving a more secure and stable international atmosphere. This action would involve collaboration, negotiation, and a shared responsibility for the establishment and maintenance of a peaceful world. Cooperation between nations in the area of disarmament can positively impact the overall progress towards global nuclear disarmament by reinforcing international norms and strengthening existing treaties and frameworks. This joint effort can also potentially lead to further strides in other areas of global security, such as preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and materials to states and non-state actors, and responding to emerging security threats such as cyber warfare and terrorism. In conclusion, the statement stresses the importance of joining forces with Presidents Obama and Medvedev in implementing disarmament as a means of promoting international peace, stability, and security. The collaboration between nations, particularly between the United States and Russia, demonstrates a commitment to fostering a safer global environment, reducing the threats posed by nuclear weapons, and contributing to a more secure and peaceful future for all."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? You may want to start with a blog in a subject of your choice. In order to become an affiliate and participate in affiliate marketing, you need to have a website with significant traffic. Many affiliate marketers start by creating content and posting affiliate links on their page. You'll have to make sure the website is yours and doesn't ban affiliate marketing by agreement with the hosting service. See how to make a website for more information. You will need to cultivate the ability to start new websites, buy domain names, host pages and make landing pages. These skills will become important as you begin CPA marketing. PPC advertising allows you to drive traffic to your site by placing ads on other, relevant websites. You pay the ad provider a small amount for each time a web user clicks through your ad to your website. You can learn how this works through YouTube videos, online tutorials or by trial and error. Set up an account in Google AdWords and Microsoft adCenter, and pay for some ads that drive traffic to your website, in order to practice while you learn. Pay-per-click advertising can get expensive quickly, especially in a keyword bidding war (when another website or websites also wants to advertise for the same keywords). You also run the risk of routinely paying for clicks that don't lead to sales for you. Always analyze these risk before getting started in PPC. The best way to become a CPA marketer is to learn how to drive traffic to websites. The following are ways that people learn to drive traffic. Practice creating and promoting fan pages and groups on Facebook. If you know how to get \\"likes,\\" then you are on your way to driving traffic to a lead landing page. This usually takes a passion for staying in touch with followers and trying new creative social media strategies. Practice creating videos and YouTube channels. If you are an expert in a field or you can call on other people to create creative or instructive videos, this content grabs attention. Once you have traffic, you can post links to landing pages where you can gather lead information. Learn how to make and buy Internet ads. If you have graphic design skills and you don't want to create content on a blog or YouTube, then this may be the best option for you. You can find prime ad spaces, through services like BuySellAds, and purchase the ad space for a period of time. If the ad is targeted successfully, people will click on the link and type in their information, giving you leads. You will need to subtract the cost of the ad in order to figure out your return on investment. Become adept at using PPC advertising to get traffic to your landing page. Similar to buying ad space, you will need to bid on keywords in order to place the link to your landing page where you will get noticed. If you have a lot of experience with search engine advertising, this may be the best option for you. Use all of the methods you have learned to try to increase traffic to your website. You'll want to try to bring on a specific type of traffic that is marketable to CPA networks. This type of traffic, that you can turn into leads for your advertisers, is called \\"targeted traffic.\\" It involves targeting a certain need or type of person and offering what they need or or are looking for. You will not be able to gather leads if you don't know how to bring specific people to your website. For example, you might have a blog or website that reviews phone cases. You would want to target people searching for things like \\"best iPhone cases\\" or \\"durable phone cases.\\" Summary:","completion":"This article talks about how to become a CPA marketer by making a website, creating content, learning skills like making ads and using PPC advertising, and trying different ways to bring people who want certain things to your website, so you can help advertisers find new customers."},{"prompt":"Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.

Original sentence: \\"A white dog is airborne whilst catching a green toy.\\" Components: \\"white dog\\", \\"airborne\\", \\"catching\\", \\"green toy\\" Step 2: Analyze the given sentence to see if it contains the same main components as the original sentence, minus any qualifiers that do not change the meaning. Given sentence: \\"A white dog is catching a green toy.\\" Components: \\"white dog\\", \\"catching\\", \\"green toy\\" Step 3: Compare the components of the given sentence to the components of the original sentence. Both sentences have the components \\"white dog\\", \\"catching\\", and \\"green toy\\". The original sentence also has the component \\"airborne\\", which describes the position of the white dog. Step 4: Determine if the removal of the qualifier \\"airborne\\" changes the meaning of the action \\"catching\\". While the original sentence specifies the position of the white dog (airborne), the action of the dog catching the green toy is still happening in both sentences.

You are given a new situation: Greg was studying behavior of different organisms. He noticed that some organisms were showing inquiline behavior. He noted that behavior as case A. Then he noticed some other organisms didn't show any inquiline behavior. He noted that behavior as case B. He was astonished by the complicated interactions among organisms. and a hint : Ants form symbiotic associations with a range of species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi. They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this ant mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving Batesian mimicry, where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show Wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines. Please answer this question : Would case A see greater or smaller opportunity for food sources than case B? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, let's first recap the information given: Case A: Organisms showing inquiline behavior Case B: Organisms not showing inquiline behavior Now, let's analyze the hint regarding ants and their symbiotic associations: 1. Ants form various symbiotic associations with other species, including inquilines. 2. Inquilines may bear close resemblance to ants and can access resources within the ant nests. 3. The nature of mimicry in inquilines varies, with some using it to reduce predation risk, and others exhibiting Wasmannian mimicry, which is specific to inquilines. Considering this information, we can make the following comparisons: In case A, organisms exhibit inquiline behavior and can gain access to the resources within ant nests, such as food and shelter. As a result, they would likely have more opportunities for food sources, as they can benefit from the resources within the nest. In case B, organisms do not show inquiline behavior and will rely on their own foraging and resource acquisition, without the added advantage of accessing ant nest resources. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that Case A, with organisms showing inquiline behavior, would see greater opportunities for food sources compared to Case B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Ben and Me Context: The film begins with a tour group in the present day, but quickly moves to the 16th century. Quickly tracing a mouse family's history in England, we see how the family was forced to go to America due to an excess of cats.In America, the film then focuses on Amos, a 1740s mouse living in a Philadelphia church. His attempts to land a job lead him to Benjamin Franklin's printing shop. He helps Franklin erase his debts, create a successful newspaper, invent new devices, and even helps make him more popular and respected with the people of the city.After Franklin involves Amos, without his permission, in the famous kite electricity experiment that nearly kills him, Amos is outraged and leaves him. Franklin's attempts to work alone prove disastrous such as a failed diplomatic mission to the King that pushes the colonies to open armed revolt.They finally reconcile in 1776 when Franklin begs Amos to return and agrees to sign a contract drafted by the mouse for more considerate treatment. Furthermore, as Franklin examines the agreement, Thomas Jefferson arrives to ask for help for the beginning of the Declaration of Independence he is writing. Amos insists that Franklin read his own agreement out loud at that moment and its wording inspires Jefferson to create an appropriate opening to his own piece.The movie ends with a return to the tour group in the present.

Kate's immediate engagements are cancelled, and experts don't expect her to make another public appearance until Christmas Day. But she certainly made the most of today's appearance, the Telegraph notes, with her hair perfect, her clothing impeccable, her bouquet of roses classily hiding her tummy, and her makeup doing its absolute best although still failing to hide her \\"puffy eyes,\\" writes Belinda White. Sadly, the Daily Beast reports that Kate and William will spend much of her pregnancy apart, as the prince must return to his RAF base in Wales. Their baby is rumored to be due in June. Article:","completion":"Title: Duchess of Cambridge Discharged from Hospital, Returns to Kensington Palace for Rest The Duchess of Cambridge, formerly known as Kate Middleton, left the King Edward VII Hospital in London today in great spirits, accompanied by her husband, Prince William. The Duchess was admitted to the hospital to receive treatment for hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of morning sickness. After a three-night stay, Kate was seen smiling and stated that she's \\"feeling much better.\\" Hyperemesis gravidarum is a rare and severe form of morning sickness, affecting only around 1-2% of pregnant women. It can lead to extreme nausea, vomiting, and dehydration, posing risks to both mother and baby. In some cases, it can last throughout the entire pregnancy, but for many women, the symptoms tend to subside after the first trimester. Prince William offered his unwavering support as he accompanied his wife on her exit from the hospital. Despite the London hospital falling victim to a prank call earlier in the week, St. James's Palace issued a statement expressing the couple's gratitude to the hospital staff. The statement read, \\"The Duchess of Cambridge... will now head to Kensington Palace for a period of rest,\\" as reported by the Telegraph. With her immediate engagements canceled, experts predict that Kate's next public appearance may not be until Christmas Day. Nonetheless, the Duchess made a strong impression with her stylish and immaculate appearance upon leaving the hospital. Her neatly styled hair, impeccable clothing, and a bouquet of roses tastefully concealing her tummy all showcased her resilience and poise during this challenging time. Despite some signs of fatigue, such as her slightly puffy eyes, Kate remained radiant. In the coming months, it is reported that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will face considerable time apart due to Prince William's commitments at the RAF base in Wales. The prince's military duties often require him to be stationed away from home, making it difficult for the couple to be together during much of Kate's pregnancy. The royal baby is rumored to be due in June, sparking anticipation and excitement across the nation and the world. As the Duchess returns to Kensington Palace for rest and recuperation, the world eagerly awaits the arrival of the newest member of the British royal family. Despite overcoming this initial obstacle, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge continue to showcase their love and support for one another, providing a strong foundation as they embark on their journey towards parenthood."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \\"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club.

Write an article based on this summary: A train struck a Land Rover on the railway line between Ely and Cambridge, prompting an investigation.","completion":"Title: Investigation Underway After Train Strikes Land Rover on Railway Line Between Ely and Cambridge Introduction A shocking incident occurred on the railway line between Ely and Cambridge when a train collided with a Land Rover, causing significant disruption to rail services and calling for a thorough investigation. In this article, we will provide an overview of the situation, examine the consequences of the event, and outline the steps being taken in response. Incident Details The collision took place on a railway crossing, with a train coming into contact with a Land Rover that had somehow become stranded on the tracks. The exact circumstances remain unclear, but initial reports suggest that the vehicle had attempted to traverse the crossing when it became immobilized, effectively placing it in the path of the oncoming train. Luckily, no injuries were reported in the incident. Consequences and Disruption The force of the impact resulted in damage to both the train and the Land Rover. Passengers on board the train experienced a sudden, forceful jerk as the train came to an abrupt halt. Thankfully, emergency services were quick to respond to the scene and were able to assist the passengers safely disembarking the train. Rail services along the line were disrupted as the damage was assessed, and the removal of the wreckage commenced. Passengers traveling between Ely and Cambridge faced delays and cancellations, forcing many to seek alternative forms of transportation to reach their destinations. Investigation and Response An immediate investigation was launched by local authorities and railway operator to uncover the cause of the incident and determine whether any violations or failures contributed to the collision. Part of this investigation includes examining the state of the railway crossing equipment and signaling systems at the scene to ascertain whether they were functioning properly at the time of the incident. The authorities are also interviewing witnesses and reviewing available surveillance footage to reconstruct the events leading up to the collision. This information will be invaluable in determining whether any negligence or safety violations occurred on the part of the Land Rover driver, and if any measures can be implemented to prevent similar incidents in the future. Further, the railway operator, in coordination with local authorities, will be examining their own safety procedures to ensure that railway crossings remain secure and that appropriate warnings are provided to road users. This assessment may lead to improvements in railway crossing infrastructure and further safety investments. Conclusion While it is fortunate that no one was injured in this collision between a train and a Land Rover on the railway line between Ely and Cambridge, it serves as a stark reminder of the potential dangers surrounding railway crossings. As the investigation continues, it is hoped that lessons can be learned and steps taken to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future. The safety of passengers, motorists, and rail staff is of paramount importance, and all parties involved must work together to minimize risk and enhance safety protocols on our railways."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Gerald Clamson is a bank examiner who loves fishing on his annual two-week holiday. Unfortunately, one day at the ocean he reels in Syd Valentine (also played by Lewis), an injured gangster in a scuba diving suit. Syd tells Gerald about diamonds he has stolen from the other gangsters and hands him a map. Gerald escapes as frogmen from a yacht machine-gun the beach. They swim ashore, locate Syd and gun him down. Their leader Thor ensures Syd's demise by firing a torpedo from his yacht that goes ashore, blowing a crater into the beach. As the police ignore Gerald's story, Gerald heads to the Hilton Inn in San Diego where Syd claimed the diamonds were hidden. There he meets Suzie Cartwright, an airline stewardess. While searching for the diamonds, he needs to avoid the hotel staff after inadvertently hurting the manager. Gerald disguises himself as a character noticeably similar to Professor Julius Kelp from The Nutty Professor, while trying to stay one step ahead of the other gangsters who are on his tail, as well as the hotel detectives led by the manager—all the while courting Suzie.

Process: - Dead organic material accumulates on the bottom of oceans, riverbeds or swamps, mixing with mud and sand - Over time, more sediment piles on top - The resulting heat and pressure transforms the organic layer into a dark and waxy substance known as kerogen - Left alone, the kerogen molecules eventually crack - The molecules break up into shorter and lighter molecules composed almost solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms - It will turn into either petroleum or natural gas - Question: suppose more sediments pile on top happens, how will it affect LESS oil. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"Less oil. The accumulation of more sediments on the already existing layer of organic material and kerogen can affect the production of oil in various ways. The process of oil formation is complex, and it depends on a delicate balance of factors such as temperature, pressure, and time. A deeper understanding of these factors and how they interact can help explain why piling more sediments on top of the existing layers can result in less oil production. 1. Temperature: The transformation of kerogen into oil requires a specific temperature range. This is generally between 90°C and 150°C (194°F and 302°F). When more sediments accumulate on the organic layer, the increased pressure and insulation can cause the temperature to rise beyond this range. If the temperature exceeds the optimal range, it can cause the kerogen to turn into natural gas or remain trapped as a solid, resulting in less oil production. 2. Pressure: Increased pressure due to more sediments can also negatively impact oil formation. The ideal pressure range for oil generation is typically 1-2 kilobars. Too much pressure can cause the organic material to not break down into the desired oil molecules. Under extreme pressure, the solid kerogen may convert directly into natural gas or become trapped within the rock, leading to less oil production. 3. Time: The process of oil formation requires millions of years to complete. The gradual buildup of sediments on top of organic material acts as a driving force for the transformation of kerogen into oil. However, if more sediments accumulate too quickly, it can disrupt the natural balance of temperature and pressure, ultimately influencing the rate at which the kerogen turns into oil. A shorter duration under optimal conditions can lead to incomplete conversion of kerogen, resulting in less oil production. 4. Migration: Finally, the ability of oil to migrate from the source rock to reservoir rocks is critical for the accumulation of oil and natural gas reserves. When more sediments pile on top of the kerogen layer, it can limit the ability of the oil to migrate upwards through porous rock layers. This trapped oil may remain within the source rock, causing less oil to accumulate in reservoir rocks. In summary, when more sediments pile on top of existing kerogen layers, it may result in less oil by changing the temperature, pressure, and migration conditions necessary for optimum oil generation and accumulation. These changes can cause incomplete conversion of kerogen into oil or a tendency for the organic material to turn into natural gas or remain trapped within the rock. This perturbation can significantly affect the quantity of oil available for extraction and commercial use."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid.

As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding Bin Laden.\\" I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he'd help us get Bin Laden and deal with another issue or two.\\" The U.S. effort continued.

Answer: Now, it is possible for an individual to use a variety of services to host an Internet-based talk-radio show without carriage by a traditional radio station. Question: when did talk radio begin in the U.S.?","completion":"The given answer does not provide a correct response to the question about when talk radio began in the U.S. To answer the question: Talk radio in the U.S. has its origins in the 1920s. The early days of radio broadcasting primarily featured news, music, and entertainment programs. However, by the 1930s and 1940s, some U.S. radio stations started to incorporate more talk-based content, such as interviews and discussions on various topics. One of the pioneers in talk radio programming was Joe Pyne, whose show started in 1945 at local station WILM in Wilmington, Delaware. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, talk radio continued to evolve, expanding to address various political and social issues. The format gained more prominence in the mid-1960s due to the Fairness Doctrine, a now-defunct FCC policy that required broadcasters to present all sides of a controversial issue. This led to more debate and opinion-based programming. In summary, the beginnings of talk radio in the U.S. can be traced back to the 1920s, but it developed and became more prominent over the next few decades, particularly in the mid-1960s."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

In other words, it is a generalizing statement about how we expect people to behave in society.

Hypothesis: Two men are playing chess. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","completion":"No, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The premise and the hypothesis describe two distinct and separate situations involving different games. Let's break down the premise and hypothesis to understand why they don't support each other: Premise: \\"Two men enjoying a game of pool.\\" In this statement, we learn that there are two men who are actively participating in and enjoying a game of pool, also known as billiards. Pool is a type of cue sport that involves hitting balls with a cue stick on a pool table. The objective of the game is to pocket all the balls in a predetermined order or ahead of one's opponent, depending on the type of pool being played. Some common variations of pool include eight-ball, nine-ball, and straight pool. Hypothesis: \\"Two men are playing chess.\\" In this statement, we are given a hypothesized situation where two men are engaged in a game of chess, which is not related to pool. Chess is a two-player turn-based board game that is played on a chessboard made up of 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid. The objective of chess is to checkmate the opponent's king, which entails positioning one's pieces in a way that the opponent's king is under threat of capture and there is no legal move available to prevent it. Now that we have a clear understanding of both the premise and the hypothesis, it becomes evident that they are describing two separate scenarios involving different games. The fact that the premise is true and the men are playing pool provides no evidence or support to conclude that they are also playing chess simultaneously or instead of pool. In sum, the truth of the premise does not have any bearing on the validity of the hypothesis, as the two situations described are unrelated and involve different games. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true simply because the premise is true."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"The premise does not entail the hypothesis. Let's break down both statements and understand why there is no direct entailment between the two. Premise: \\"They continued their duel, piercing, parrying, dodging, spinning.\\" This statement describes an ongoing duel, presumably between two or more individuals. They are actively engaging in a battle, showcasing various combat techniques such as piercing (presumably with weapons), parrying (deflecting or countering an opponent's attack), dodging (avoiding attacks), and spinning (making agile body movements, possibly to confuse, avoid, or strike the opponent). The premise indicates an intense, active conflict between the subjects. Hypothesis: \\"They all decided not to fight.\\" In contrast, the hypothesis suggests a completely opposite scenario to the one described in the premise. Here, the individuals involved have made a conscious decision to cease fighting or engaging in combat. It could imply a peaceful resolution or an agreement to end hostilities between the parties. Entailment occurs when the truth of one statement guarantees the truth of another statement. In this case, the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis; in fact, the two statements describe conflicting situations - one in which the individuals are engaged in a heated duel and another where they decide to stop fighting altogether. Thus, we can conclude that the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as the ongoing duel described in the premise does not guarantee or imply the subjects' decision to stop fighting in the hypothesis. The premise and hypothesis describe two separate, opposing scenarios, and the truth of one does not ensure the truth of the other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

They wanted to grow bigger and become even more powerful. To do this, they needed to take over a city called Constantinople. Constantinople had big, strong walls all around it to keep it safe. These walls made it very hard for anyone to get inside the city. The people in the Ottoman Empire, led by their very smart leader, Sultan Mehmed II, had to come up with a way to break through those strong walls. They knew they needed something big and powerful to do it. One day, the Sultan heard about a man named Orban, who was very good at building big and powerful machines called cannons. Cannons were like giant metal tubes that could shoot huge, heavy balls really far and really fast. Sultan Mehmed II talked to Orban, and asked him to build a really really big cannon. Orban agreed, and he built the biggest cannon anyone had ever seen. It was so big that it took many strong men and horses just to move it! When the cannon was ready, the Ottoman Empire brought it to Constantinople and used it to try to break down the walls. They shot big, heavy balls at the walls over and over again. The people in Constantinople were scared, because they had never seen anything like it. With the help of this huge cannon, the Ottoman Empire was able to make holes in the strong walls of Constantinople. Eventually, they were able to break through and take over the city! So, the key factor in the Ottoman Empire taking over Constantinople was the giant cannon made by Orban. This weapon helped them break down the strong walls and win the battle. And this is how the city of Constantinople became part of the Ottoman Empire, which grew even bigger and more powerful."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please write a short summary for the following article: The GOP’s anti-Hagel crusade: Was it worth it? Chuck Hagel made the penultimate step toward becoming the next defense secretary Tuesday, with his nomination overcoming a procedural vote that it failed to get past two weeks ago. For all intents and purposes, that means Hagel will be confirmed shortly. But not for lack of trying by GOP senators, who invested plenty of time and political will in trying to upend the nomination of their former Republican colleague. So with the battle now all but over, it begs the question: Was it worth it? Former Nebraska senator Chuck Hagel. (Reuters) There are compelling cases to be made on both sides: Why it wasn’t worth it At the end of the day, any legislative maneuvering needs to be judged on whether it succeeded. And in this case, barring something out of left field before the final vote, Hagel will become the next defense secretary. In other words: The GOP lost. Republicans quite simply weren’t able to land that final knock-out blow that they were hoping for, and now they’ve got a guy they really don’t like headed for one of the top Cabinet posts in the Obama administration. In addition, by delaying Hagel’s nomination with a filibuster — something that had never been done to a defense secretary nominee (even if Republicans tried in vain to argue that it wasn’t actually a filibuster) — Republicans have set a precedent. If and when they return to the White House, Democrats now have a new weapon with which to hold up GOP Cabinet nominees, if they decide to use it. The reason senators are so reticent to alter their chamber’s rules is they know it will also apply when the majority/minority roles are reversed. That’s why we still have the filibuster, even though Democrats would love to legislate in the majority without it. And finally, Republicans failed to put up a totally united front against Hagel, with a couple senators supporting his nomination even before the filibuster, and several more voting with Democrats to override the filibuster. The administration can now credibly make the case that Hagel had bipartisan support — something Republicans would have liked to avoid. Why it was worth it Despite the unprecedented nature of the filibuster and the Democratic criticism of their effort against a decorated war hero, Republicans likely will pay no major political price for their tactics. This is for two reasons: 1) The American people quite simply weren’t all that interested. Even though the Hagel drama was big news in Washington, it was met by the American people with a collective yawn. Even as of last week, a Pew poll showed that half of Americans said they didn’t know enough about Hagel to rate him favorably or unfavorably. Despite the dicey electoral gambit to delay Hagel’s nomination, there has been little backlash against Republicans for doing it — at least as far as we can tell right now. And 2) Nobody is going to mourn much for Chuck Hagel. The fact is that this is a guy without a political home. He is a former Republican senator who alienated his own party with his vehement criticism of the Iraq war and also is seen as a political interloper who hasn’t built up a whole lot of good will with Democrats. His past criticisms of the “Jewish lobby” and a gay ambassador nominee, while not enough to derail his nomination, were enough to ensure that even his supporters weren’t all that enamored of him. And Republicans were able to bring his numbers down a little, with Pew showing his unfavorable rating rising from 18 percent in January to 28 percent last week (his favorable rating also rose slightly, from 18 percent to 22 percent, over that span). In the end, the Hagel nomination will amount to little more than an inside baseball political game. Republicans effectively registered their concerns and have, for the second time this year, either thwarted one of President Obama’s likely Cabinet picks (Susan Rice) or served notice that they won’t be steamrolled into supporting divisive nominees (Hagel). The battle isn’t over, and some Republicans are also making noise about holding up the nominations of Jack Lew for treasury secretary and John Brennan for CIA director. The Hagel situation suggests that, even though they may not succeed, there’s not a whole lot of downside to trying.","completion":"The GOP's anti-Hagel crusade questions whether the Republican senators' time and political will was worth trying to upend the nomination of their former Republican colleague, Chuck Hagel, for defense secretary. There are arguments to be made on both sides as to whether it was worth it or not. On one hand, Hagel's nomination was not stopped, which means GOP lost, and by delaying the nomination with a filibuster, Republicans have set a precedent that could be used against them in the future. Furthermore, their failure to present a united front on the matter allowed the administration to claim Hagel had bipartisan support. On the other hand, Republicans likely won't face any significant political consequences for their tactics against Hagel's nomination. The American public wasn't fully engaged with the issue, and there seems to be little backlash against the GOP for their actions. Additionally, Chuck Hagel, a former Republican senator with no firm political home, is not a widely popular figure. This nomination battle will not have a significant impact in the long run, but it did serve to show that Republicans won't be easily pushed into supporting divisive nominees."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The relative clause (\\"who grows peaches\\") is placed after \\"her\\" instead of directly after a noun which it modifies. 3. Clarity: The sentence can be understood but seems slightly awkward due to the positioning of the relative clause. To improve the linguistic integrity of the sentence, I would revise it as follows: \\"I met the woman who grows peaches.\\" This revision addresses the issues with syntax and clarity by placing the relative clause directly after the noun it modifies and replacing \\"her\\" with the noun \\"woman,\\" making the sentence more natural and easier to understand."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

With its latest flagship device, HTC is taking this a step further by allowing the phone to be operated with a squeeze. HTC Vive's £200 wireless upgrade kit launches spring 2017 VR HTC Vive's £200 wireless upgrade kit launches spring 2017 Advertisement The Taiwanese firm has launched the HTC U11 with a feature dubbed Edge Sense. It says by giving the 5.5-inch phone a \\"squeeze\\", it's possible to use the phone's apps, camera, and more. The squeeze function, which works on the edges of the device, operates in two ways. Pressure sensors on the phone are located below the volume buttons on the sides of the device. A short squeeze can be configured to open an app, while a long squeeze can launch Google's Assistant or Amazon's Alexa. HTC Read next HTC launches a new platform for the Vive Standalone VR headset, no PC required HTC launches a new platform for the Vive Standalone VR headset, no PC required We've yet to see the squeeze function in action but HTC is promising a wide range of customisation from the new phone interaction. Its promotional materials, published around the phone's launch, say it is possible to take photos with the 12MP rear camera and 16MP front camera; launch a text message with a squeeze, and use the phone's voice recognition to send messages. \\"Before, it was a hassle to reach these features, but we simplified it into a single motion,\\" HTC says. HTC Setting aside this apparent time-saving gimmick, the HTC U11 is being launched in five colours and measures 153.9 x 75.9 x 7.9mm, making it around 5mm shorter than the iPhone 7 Plus and 6mm shorter than the Samsung Galaxy 8 Plus. Four of the HTC's colours – silver, blue, black and white – will be available in the UK when the phone launches in June and the red variation will come later this year. The HTC U11 will go on sale for £649 at launch from Carphone Warehouse, EE, O2, Amazon, Very.co.uk, Argos and the Taiwanese company itself. Advertisement Inside the smartphone is a 3000mAh battery, 64/128GB of storage, a Snapdragon 835 processor (up to 2.45 Ghz), and 4/6GB of RAM, depending on the specifications you select. There's also the usual array of NFC, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi support as well as a fingerprint sensor, light sensor, proximity sensor, magnetic sensor, and gyroscope. HTC Four microphones built into the device are used for audio recording and a 'liquid glass surface' makes the silver HTC U11, at least from pictures, to be one of the shiniest, most reflective phones on the market. Advertisement At its launch, the device will run Android 7.1, the latest version of the Google-owned operating system. The version of Nougat has support for Google's Daydream VR and circular Android icons. HTC also claims the U11 is the first smartphone to be able to use a \\"hands-free wake word\\" to access Amazon's AI assistant, Alexa. The 'always-on' voice commands allow the phone to be listening for the trigger word which then launches the digital assistant when called upon. Google and Apple both have similar features with their 'Okay, Google' and 'Hey Siri' commands. Expand your mind with WIRED's pick of the best podcasts ||||| But this is all table stakes for a modern, high-end smartphone. With the U11, the real magic starts when you turn up the pressure. The U11's hallmark feature is Edge Sense, which relies on pressure sensors embedded in the phone's sides. They can detect minute changes in how firmly you grip your phone, and -- more importantly -- can be used to trigger shortcuts and app actions. Let's say you're wearing gloves and feel the sudden, overbearing urge to take a selfie. You could give the U11 a quick squeeze to launch the camera, and another to snap a photo. With the \\"advanced\\" mode enabled, you can even set up different shortcuts for quick squeezes and longer squeeze-and-holds. Having the pressure-sensitive equivalent of some convenience keys is neat, but after seeing more nuanced controls in the HTC Ocean videos leaked a while back, we're left with three words: \\"Is this it?\\" Don't get us wrong: the pressure sensing worked well enough, but we're not sold on its utility just yet. HTC is also working on what could generously be described as \\"AI overload.\\" Check it out: the U11 will ship with Google's Assistant onboard, and will get Alexa via software update shortly after launch. HTC says that, thanks to the Snapdragon 835, the U11 can listen for and respond to different wake words -- that is, it should never confuse an \\"OK, Google\\" with a question for Alexa. Even better, you won't need an app running in the foreground like you did with the Alexa experiece on Huawei's Mate 9. We don't know when Motorola's Alexa efforts will be revealed, but it seems like Alexa on the U11 is the version to beat. Beyond those two, the U11 will also come with HTC's own Sense Assistant, which is meant to chew on your schedule and behavior to offer suggestions like when to bring an umbrella to work. Yeah, that's right: the U11 can have up to three virtual assistants working at the same time. We weren't kidding about overload. For some, though, the U11's audio chops might be the game-changer. There's more space inside the phone for a speaker chamber, which makes audio sound far louder and richer than on the HTC 10. (In fact, HTC product planning AVP Nigel Newby-House cranked up the U11's volume all the way outside a crowded conference room in our office, and the people inside were getting noticeably pissed by the din.) And while there's no headphone jack, at least HTC is using Type-C to add to the audio experience. Remember how the U Ultra's USonic earbuds used a sonar-like pulse to intepret the contours of your ear and tune your tunes accordingly? The U11's earbuds do that too, but they also pack-in active noise cancellation without the need for bulky battery module. They draw power from your phone's battery, which is both good and bad: you'll never have to remember to charge your headphones before a flight, but you can bet it'll impact your battery life somewhat. We'll withhold our judgment on the U11 until we've played with final US units, but we're cautiously optimistic about this thing's chances. The fact that it has a competitive set of guts is reassuring, especially when these slices of silicon are potent enough to deliver near-seamless performance. Still, when the marquee feature -- that pressure-sensing business -- seems to boil down into a minor convenience, we have to wonder if HTC's focus on thoughtful, clever features is starting to waver. ||||| You can’t really blame HTC for embracing a gimmick. A rough couple of years for the smartphone maker warrants some experimentation to help set its devices apart from myriad other Android manufacturers. Edge Sense, sadly, however, is not going to be that technology. The company teased the handset’s squeezable sides in a handful of short web videos, and now that the U 11 has been officially unveiled, we can confirm that the flagship’s most compelling feature isn’t really all that compelling in its current form. The feature uses sensors built into the sides of the phone to detect pressure as the user squeezes the phone. At present, actual applications for the tech mean that it essentially doubles as something akin to the convenience key that BlackBerry has sported for ages. Basically, you assign functionality to it, so it can, say, launch your favorite app. In a briefing ahead of this morning’s launch in Taiwan, VP of Product Planning, Nigel Newby-House suggested that this is just the first glimpse into future functionality for Edge Sense — and certainly there’s a lot to be done with a new set of on-board sensors. As it stands, however, Edge Sense is really much more than a glorified button with the addition of an actual new physical button like Samsung did with the devoted Bixby key on the S8. It probably speaks a bit to the unfulfilled promise of the feature that Newby-House opted not to lead with this feature in our conversation. Most of the talk about the device centered around design decision. And it’s true — the U11 is a good-looking phone, borrowing some cues from the recently announced Ultra. In fact, the company seems to consider the Ultra something of a dry run for the new flagship — or at the very least, a way of introducing the new product line and design language. Probably something you don’t want to hear if you shelled out the 750 for the handset in the last couple of months. The company calls it Liquid Design — a nod to the curvature and the notion that dipping it in liquid would fill in the sorts of gaps you usually get when two different surfaces are juxtaposed. Not the most straightforward idea, but it sounds nice, so fine. And while it looks pretty good, as well, it’s not exactly unique, bringing to mind other flagships like the S8, particularly given the use of a reflective metallic paint job. The screen is 5.5-inches, the same size you’ll get on the iPhone 7 Plus. The company says it flirted with the idea of switching up the aspect ratio like LG and Samsung have with their newest flagships (and, according to rumors, like Apple is planning on the 8), but opted to stick with 16:9 for “software reasons” — in other words, it didn’t want to deal with having to rejigger everything on that end. That said, it’s still entertaining the possibility of jumping on the tall phone ship for future devices. The company has already been on the anti-headphone jack train for a little bit. The Ultra found the company planting its flag on that beach. “The headphone jack is going away,” Newby-House told me matter-of-factly. “Let’s just get on with it.” Of course, not everyone concurs, and other companies haven’t aligned themselves with Apple as quickly as many analysts expected. Even Motorola, which joined the part with the Moto Z, appears as if it’s regretting that move. That said, the company is still committed as ever to audio — a welcome change from most companies, for whom audio is a fifth- or sixth-tier priority. The phone features a new version BoomSound, one of the better audio systems presently on handsets — though, weirdly, the company opted against dual front-facing speakers in order to accommodate a fingerprint sensor, even as more and more companies are moving biometrics to the back of the device. The phone also ships with company’s proprietary USonic earbuds, which sport active noise canceling. The most interesting piece of the audio puzzle, however, is the fact that there are four microphones in the handset. This is largely based on a newfound interest in other people’s smart assistants (though it’s got some positive implication for video recording, as well). HTC has worked directly with Qualcomm to design a device capable of responding to two different wake words for two different assistants — neither of which are the in-house one it announced along with the Ultra. Instead, the company is embracing both Assistant and Alexa. The company says it sees advantages to both and doesn’t want to play favorites. Fair enough. There’s certainly a lot to be said for putting the ultimate decision in the hands of the user. That said, this doesn’t seem to bode well for the company’s faith in its own Sense Companion. And while it says this doesn’t preclude it from going full-on Bixby in the future, it currently views its own play as more of a supplement to Assistant and Alexa. “We’ve never envisioned Companion as a wake word-type assistant,” says Newby-House. The company is more focused on using it to enhance its own software offerings, likely because it simply isn’t robust enough to be considered a standalone. That said, the company’s getting pretty close to a shit-or-get-off-the-pot moment here. The whole idea of a smart assistant has created a single unified experience — having an assistant designed to work with other assistants kind of flies in the face of all of that. Oh, and Alexa isn’t shipping with the device out of the box. The company says the functionality should arrive within a month. This is kind of par for the course, at this point. Huawei ran up against a similar roadblock. Part of the issue is the fact that companies have to work directly with Amazon to customize the experience. When it does arrive, it will be in the form of an over-the-air update. It will also be in the box for devices later. When that functionality does arrive, however, it will bring more traditional functionality. Calling, texting and the like will come down the road. ||||| Want to launch the camera on the HTC U11? Just squeeze. When the phone's pressure-sensitive sides register your tightened grip, it'll open the app you've programmed in. Say you've squeezed the camera app open. You can squeeze again to take a picture. A long squeeze might open and close the flashlight, or toggle Wi-Fi or a voice recording. Or another app of your choice. What's going on is an entirely new way to interact with a phone. Called Edge Sense, this feature marks the first time any phonemaker has used touch like this. For HTC, a company that has itself felt the squeeze from larger rivals such as Samsung, Apple and LG, the U11's grippy new feature presents an opportunity to step out of others' shadows with an industry first. Giving a phone pressure-sensitive sides is an incredibly interesting innovation, and one that raises a lot of questions: is this a natural way to open shortcuts, or is it better suited to some other task? Will it be accurate or will mispresses abound? Is it a useless gimmick, or the start of exciting things to come? I don't have an answer to that yet, but after my brief time with the phone, I did try out many of the launch options, and I like that an animation of squeezed-in sides lets you know the feature's working. I found the motion easy to execute, but I did sometimes long-squeeze when I meant to short-squeeze. I think muscle memory will take care of that down the road. I also think this method of app-launching would only be useful for the apps I open all the time (which takes that voice recorder out of the running). The bigger question for HTC is if the U11's fresh look and feel, and high end specs are enough to make a dent in Samsung and Apple's overwhelming lead -- squeeze feature or no. From what I've seen of the U11 so far, its premium hardware stands the best chance of any HTC phone in quite awhile. The rest will come down to performance, and how well HTC can gets its phone in front of buyers. Price and release date In the US, the HTC U11 sells for 649 -- you'll be able to pick it up in sapphire blue, amazing silver and brilliant black. Buy the unlocked version from htc.com, and AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon carrier versions from Amazon. The phone will arrive on your doorstep in June. You'll also be able to buy the blue and black HTC U11 from Sprint. The phone goes on sale June 9, but early preorders will also get you two Amazon Echo (129.00 at Adorama) Dot (29.95 at Amazon.com) speakers. It'll cost 0 down and29 per month for 24 months, for a grand total of 696. It's too soon to say how the U11 performs compares to the Galaxy S8 (578.95 at Amazon.com) and LG G6, and if buyers connect with its glass design and squeeze effects. Gorgeous glass design, advanced processor and everything else The Big Squeeze sure is attention-grabbing, but it's really one small feature in what's shaping up to be a pretty good package. Enlarge Image Josh Miller/CNET You get a 5.5-inch display with a QHD, or 2,560x1,440-pixel resolution (same as the Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6), so there's plenty of screen to interact with. Then there's the body itself. The U11 refines the gorgeous \\"melted\\" glass design of the U Ultra (390.00 at Amazon.com). It really does look like pools of liquid. It's striking. It's also highly reflective and smudges up quickly. The phone meets a water-resistant rating of IP67, which helps keep water away for up to 30 minutes and 3 feet (1 meter). I like that the 12-megapixel rear camera sits flush on the design; it's good that the lens doesn't poke out. If you follow camera specs, the U11 uses dual-pixel autofocus technology rather than laser autofocus (this should help it focus faster), and has an aperture of f1.7 (versus f1.8 on the HTC 10 (384.99 at Amazon.com)). Your front-facing camera is a 16-megapixel wide-angle lens (150 degrees). Camera images seemed completely usable in my quick tests, but I didn't have the time to really dig deep into setting or image quality. Other things to know going in: There's no headset jack, so you'll need to plug the included earbuds into the USB-C port. HTC includes an adapter if you prefer to use your own headphones. Google Assistant is on board. Amazon Alexa assistant will launch with a wake word. (HTC will add this about a month after the U11 goes on sale.) Audio quality so far seems loud, clear and rich. The Edge Sense squeeze feature is pressure sensitive and will work underwater and through some cases. HTC will also make a model in solar red (expect it to sell in select regions). ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Taiwanese smartphone manufacturer HTC has unveiled its new flagship smartphone, the U11, a touch-sensitive device that can be operated with a squeeze.

The ISIS militants appear to have no limits to their terror tactics, which have included mass executions, beheadings, and even public crucifixions. The world has watched in horror as videos of these brutal acts have surfaced, demonstrating the extent of their ruthlessness. As I spoke with the terrified refugees fleeing Mosul, their stories painted a harrowing picture of life under ISIS rule. The militants have imposed a strict version of Sharia law, leading to the brutal punishment of those failing to adhere to their regulations. Women who do not wear the full veil have been flogged, while men have been executed for simply watching soccer games. It is not just the appalling human rights abuses that make life in Mosul unbearable; the economic situation has also deteriorated significantly since the ISIS takeover. With strict controls in place, the once thriving marketplace has now become a shadow of its former self, as many traders have either fled or have been unable to operate due to the restrictive policies. The bravery of those willing to stand up against ISIS cannot be overstated. Within Mosul, there are secret networks of resistance fighters and activists working to undermine the group's stranglehold on the city. These individuals risk their lives daily, and in doing so, they provide the world with valuable information about the situation within Mosul's borders. For now, the fight against ISIS continues, as Iraqi forces and their allies work tirelessly to liberate the city and bring an end to the extremists' horrifying reign. The United Nations, NGOs, and other international actors will continue to do their best to provide assistance to those affected by this violence, but only through a concerted and united effort can the threat of ISIS be truly eliminated.

Test cricket is the longest format of cricket, played over five days, and is considered the ultimate test of players' skills and mental endurance.

Question: Who directed Roujin Z? Movie title: Roujin Z Movie plot: Roujin Z is set in early 21st century Japan. A group of scientists and hospital administrators, under the direction of the Ministry of Public Welfare, have developed the Z-001: a computerized hospital bed with robotic features.[2][3] The Z-001 takes complete care of the patient: it can dispense food and medicine, remove excretory waste, bathe and exercise the patient lying within its frame. The bed is driven by its own built-in nuclear power reactorâand in the event of an atomic meltdown, the bed (including the patient lying within) would become automatically sealed in concrete.[4] The first patient to be \\"volunteered\\" to test the bed is a dying widower named Kiyuro Takazawa. He is an invalid who is cared for by a young nursing student named Haruko.[5] The electronic elements within the Z-001 somehow manage to transcribe Takazawa's thoughts through Haruko's office computer, and he uses the communication to cry for help.[4] Although she objects to such treatment of elderly patients, Haruko begrudgingly seeks the aid of a group of computer hackers in the hospital's geriatric ward to create and install a vocal simulation of Takazawa's deceased wife in the Z-001.[2][3] However, once Takazawa wishes to go to the beach, the Z-001 detaches itself from its moorings and escapes from the hospital with the man in its grasp.[2][6] Haruko's fears are then justified, as it is discovered that the bed is actually a government-designed, experimental weapons robot.[3][5] A:","completion":"Hirotoshi Ishii directed the movie Roujin Z.

Frustration: The tweet seems to express a sense of frustration due to the inability to sleep at 4 AM. Having trouble sleeping, especially at such a late hour, indicates that the person may be experiencing difficulty in their life or struggling with their thoughts. The frustration could stem from knowing that they should be asleep and that this disturbance may affect their usual daily routine and productivity. 2. Restlessness: The mention of not being able to sleep implies a sense of restlessness. It is quite possible that the individual may be dealing with anxiety, stress, or other contributing factors that make it difficult for them to fall asleep or stay asleep. Moreover, the restlessness could lead to exhaustion, annoyance, and other negative feelings that can have a significant impact on their mood and overall well-being. 3. Despair: When viewed through a more emotional lens, the tweet might also convey a sense of despair or hopelessness. Not being able to sleep at 4 AM might mean that the person is dealing with overwhelming feelings or facing certain situations they do not know how to handle, which could lead to sleepless nights. Despair can manifest itself in such situations where the individual feels powerless or overwhelmed. Taking all these emotions into account, it is crucial to mention that the sentiment of the tweet is undeniably negative. It highlights a struggle the person is going through and offers a glimpse into their emotional state, which could be a cry for help or simply venting frustration. Regardless of the exact emotion, it is clear that the individual is experiencing a distressing situation that disrupts their sleep pattern, and consequently, their mental and physical well-being."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The figure is expected to rise by 12% in 2015 to about Â£1 in every Â£4 spent by Britons. An SMMT spokesperson said: \\"Van registrations have risen consistently over the past two years, mainly as a result of steadily increasing business confidence and a range of attractive finance deals. The move towards online shopping and home deliveries is an important contributor to this growth - particularly that of large vans.\\" Ford accounted for more than a fifth of van sales in the quarter, with the mid-sized Transit Custom the most popular on 12,627 sales. The Vauxhall Vivaro was in second place on 7,449 sales, with the Volkswagen Transporter third on 5,765 units. Ford also took sixth place with the long-wheelbase Transit model, which sold 5,276 units, and the small Transit Connect variant in eighth place with 4,096 sales.

Question: How did the pamphlet leak to a newspaper editor ? Title: Attack of the Killer Tomatoes Movie plot: The film opens with a scroll saying that when Alfred Hitchcock's film The Birds (1963) was released, audiences laughed at the notion of birds revolting against humanity, but when an attack perpetrated by birds occurred in 1975, no one laughed. This is followed by a pre-credits sequence of a tomato rising out of a woman's garbage disposal unit. Her puzzlement turns into terror as the tomato draws her into a corner. Following the credits, the police investigate her death. One officer discovers that the red substance she is covered with is not blood, but tomato juice. A series of attacks perpetrated by tomatoes occur (including a man dying by drinking tomato juice made from a killer tomato, a boy heard being gobbled up by a killer tomato, and a sequence where the tomatoes attack innocent swimmers, in a parody of Jaws). While the President's press secretary Jim Richardson tries to convince the public that there is no credible threat, the president puts together a team of specialists to stop the tomatoes led by a man named Mason Dixon. Dixon's team includes Sam Smith, a disguise expert who is seen at various points dressed as, among other things, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Adolf Hitler; Navy diver Greg Colburn; Olympic swimmer Gretta Attenbaum; and parachute-toting soldier Wilbur Finletter. Smith is sent out to infiltrate the tomatoes at a campfire, eventually blowing his cover while eating a hamburger and asking if anyone could \\"pass the ketchup.\\" Colburn and Gretta are sent to sectors, while Finletter stays with Mason. Meanwhile, the president sends Richardson to the fictitious ad agency \\"Mind Makers,\\" where executive Ted Swan spends huge amounts of money to develop virtually worthless ploys including a bumper sticker with \\"STP\\" for \\"Stop Tomato Program\\" on it, a satirical reference to both the real \\"whip inflation now\\" campaign with its widely ridiculed \\"WIN\\" slogan and STP motor oil decals and bumper stickers which were commonplace in the 1970s.

Background: During respiratory viral infections host injury occurs due in part to inappropriate host responses. In this study we sought to uncover the host transcriptional responses underlying differences between high-and lowpathogenic infections. Results: From a compendium of 12 studies that included responses to influenza A subtype H5N1, reconstructed 1918 influenza A virus, and SARS coronavirus, we used meta-analysis to derive multiple gene expression signatures. We compared these signatures by their capacity to segregate biological conditions by pathogenicity and predict pathogenicity in a test data set. The highest-performing signature was expressed as a continuum in low-, medium-, and high-pathogenicity samples, suggesting a direct, analog relationship between expression and pathogenicity. This signature comprised 57 genes including a subnetwork of chemokines, implicating dysregulated cell recruitment in injury. Conclusions: Highly pathogenic viruses elicit expression of many of the same key genes as lower pathogenic viruses but to a higher degree. This increased degree of expression may result in the uncontrolled co-localization of inflammatory cell types and lead to irreversible host damage.","completion":"Task: Generate a suitable title for a research paper based on the given paragraph.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many years passed between Mingyi Nyo declaring independence from Ava and Ava falling to the Confederation and Prome?","completion":"Title: Journey Through Time: The Fall of Ava and the Rise of Independent Taungoo Introduction The fall of Ava and the rise of independent Taungoo were important events that shaped the political and historical landscape of modern-day Myanmar. However, understanding the timeline of these significant occurrences requires a deep-dive into history. In this article, we will explore the years that passed between Mingyi Nyo declaring independence from Ava and the eventual fall of Ava to the Confederation and Prome. Background Before we delve into the main question, it's crucial to lay down the historical context that led to these events. Ava, also known as Inwa, was a royal capital in Upper Burma from the 14th to 19th centuries. It served as the administrative center for numerous Burmese dynasties, primarily the Toungoo and Restored Taungoo Dynasties. Taungoo, on the other hand, was a small vassal state located in Lower Burma, which eventually became an important regional power in its own right. The rise of Taungoo allowed it to play substantial roles in the formation and expansion of the Burmese Empire. 1. Mingyi Nyo Declares Independence In 1510, Mingyi Nyo, then the ruler of Taungoo, declared independence from the kingdom of Ava. As a regional power, Taungoo had been under Ava's suzerainty for a long time. Still, its ultimate goal was independence and expanding its territories. Deciding it was time to stand on its own, Mingyi Nyo, the founder of the Taungoo Dynasty, set his sights on establishing a powerful and distinct kingdom. Step 1: Identifying the year Mingyi Nyo declared independence - 1510. 2. Fall of Ava to Confederation and Prome The downfall of the once-great Ava kingdom came several decades after Taungoo's independence. In 1527, the Confederation, an alliance of various Shan states, and Prome, a then-independent city-state, besieged and sacked Ava, which led to its eventual collapse. Step 2: Identifying the year Ava fell to Confederation - 1527. Calculating the Years Passed Now that we have the crucial dates – 1510 for Mingyi Nyo's declaration of independence and 1527 for Ava's fall to the Confederation – we can calculate the duration between these two events. Subtracting the year of independence from the year of Ava's fall gives us the number of years passed: 1527 - 1510 = 17 years Conclusion A total of 17 years passed between Mingyi Nyo declaring Taungoo's independence from Ava and the fall of Ava to the Confederation and Prome. This period signified a time of significant change within the landscape of the Burmese territories. It marks the beginning of the Taungoo Dynasty's rise to prominence and the decline of the powerful Ava Kingdom."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: You are given an original reference as well as a system reference.

The wood in fireplaces has chemical energy. The energy is released as heat and light when the wood burns. Most living things get their energy from food. When food molecules are broken down, the energy is released. It may then be used to do work, like playing ball or studying science. If you have ever heard, \\"Eat a good breakfast\\", thats why. You need energy to do things during the day. To do those things you need energy. You get your energy from the food you eat. That energy is stored in your body until you need it. How did you get to school today? If you walked, you used chemical energy from the food you ate. What if you rode the bus or were driven in a car? Where did that energy come from?

Article: This image illustrates how the study participants learned about the habitat and the diet of eight animals, such as the cytar (not its real zoological name). The set of habitat brain regions (A-green) and diet (B-red and blue) regions where the new knowledge was stored. (L refers to left hemisphere of the brain.) Courtesy of Carnegie Mellon University Cutting-edge brain imaging technology has offered the first glimpse into how new concepts develop in the human brain. The research, carried out at Carnegie Mellon University and published in Human Brain Mapping, involved teaching people a new concept and observing how it was coded in the same areas of the brain through neural representations. The \\"olinguito\\" -- a largely fruit-eating carnivore species that lives in rainforest treetops, newly discovered in 2013 -- was initially used as a concept. Marcel Just, a professor of cognitive neuroscience in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, commented: \\"When people learned that the olinguito eats mainly fruit instead of meat, a region of their left inferior frontal gyrus -- as well as several other areas -- stored the new information according to its own code.\\" The findings revealed that this new knowledge of the olinguito was encoded in exactly the same parts of the brain by everyone who learned it, indicating that the brain may operate its own kind of universal filing system. In the latest research, 16 study participants were taught information about the diet and dwelling habits of eight extinct animals, in order to study the growth of the neural representations of these concepts in their brains. Drawing on the previous findings, the team predicted where this new knowledge would be stored. Just and Andrew Bauer, lead author of the study, then used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to monitor these concepts emerging in the brain, and found that each new concept developed its own \\"unique activation signature\\". This allowed a computer program to effectively work out which of the eight animals a participant was thinking about at any given time -- essentially allowing the scientists to read their minds. Don't miss Interestingly, the animals with close similarities (such as habitat) had closely matched activation signatures, and once a property of an animal had been learned, it stayed intact in the brain even after new ones had been taught -- providing a new insight into the neural durability of the things we learn. Bauer commented: \\"Each time we learn something, we permanently change our brains in a systematic way. It was exciting to see our study successfully implant the information about extinct animals into the expected locations in the brain's filing system.\\" It's hoped that the research may be able to help shape future teaching methods in schools, and also give a clearer picture of how knowledge is \\"lost\\" as a result of serious brain injuries and conditions such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease. ||||| Thanks to Carnegie Mellon University advances in brain imaging technology, we now know how specific concrete objects are coded in the brain, to the point where we can identify which object, such as a house or a banana, someone is thinking about from its brain activation signature. Now, CMU scientists are applying this knowledge about the neural representations of familiar concepts by teaching people new concepts and watching the new neural representations develop. Published in Human Brain Mapping, the scientists have - for the first time - documented the formation of a newly learned concept inside the brain and show that it occurs in the same brain areas for everyone.This image illustrates how the study participants learned about the habitat and the diet of eight animals, such as the cytar (not its real zoological name).

Credit: Carnegie Mellon University Thanks to Carnegie Mellon University advances in brain imaging technology, we now know how specific concrete objects are coded in the brain, to the point where we can identify which object, such as a house or a banana, someone is thinking about from its brain activation signature. Now, CMU scientists are applying this knowledge about the neural representations of familiar concepts by teaching people new concepts and watching the new neural representations develop. Published in Human Brain Mapping, the scientists have—for the first time—documented the formation of a newly learned concept inside the brain and show that it occurs in the same brain areas for everyone. This novel research merges brain science and instructional innovation, two of Carnegie Mellon's university-wide initiatives—BrainHub, which focuses on how the structure and activity of the brain give rise to complex behaviors, and the Simon Initiative, which aims to measurably improve student learning outcomes by harnessing decades of learning science research. Marcel Just, a leading neuroscientist, pointed to the Smithsonian Institute's 2013 announcement about the olinguito, a newly identified carnivore species that mainly eats fruits and lives by itself in the treetops of rainforests, as an example of the type of new concept that people learn. 'Millions of people read the information about the olinguito and in doing so permanently changed their own brains,' said Just, the D.O. Hebb University Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience in CMU's Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences. 'Our research happened to be examining this process precisely at that time in a laboratory setting. When people learned that the olinguito eats mainly fruit instead of meat, a region of their left inferior frontal gyrus—as well as several other areas—stored the new information according to its own code.' Just added, 'The new knowledge gained from the Smithsonian's announcement became encoded in the same brain areas in every person that learned the new information, because all brains appear to use the same filing system.' For the study, Andrew Bauer, a Ph.D. student in psychology, and Just taught 16 study participants diet and dwelling information about extinct animals to monitor the growth of the neural representations of eight new animal concepts in the participants' brains. Drawing on previous findings, the research team knew 'where' to expect the new knowledge to emerge in the brains of their participants. Information about dwellings and information about eating have each been shown to reside in their own set of brain regions, regions that are common across people. Over the course of an hour, the study participants were given a zoology mini-tutorial on the diets and habitats of the animals, while the scientists used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to monitor the emergence of the concepts in the participants' brains. As the new properties were taught, the activation levels in the eating regions and the dwelling regions changed. One important result was that after the zoology tutorial, each one of the eight animal concepts developed its own unique activation signature. This made it possible for a computer program to determine which of the eight animals a participant was thinking about at a given time. In effect, the program was reading their minds as they contemplated a brand-new thought. But even though the animals had unique activation signatures, the animals that shared similar properties (such as a similar habitat) had similar activation signatures. That is, a resemblance between the properties of two animals resulted in a resemblance between their activation signatures. This finding shows that the activation signatures are not just arbitrary patterns, but are meaningful and interpretable. 'The activation signature of a concept is a composite of the different types of knowledge of the concept that a person has stored, and each type of knowledge is stored in its own characteristic set of regions,' Just said. Another important result was that once a property of an animal was learned, it remained intact in the brain, even after other properties of the animal had been learned. This finding indicates the relative neural durability of what we learn. 'Each time we learn something, we permanently change our brains in a systematic way,' said Bauer, the study's lead author. 'It was exciting to see our study successfully implant the information about extinct animals into the expected locations in the brain's filing system.' Just believes that the study provides a foundation for brain researchers to trace how a new concept makes its way into the brain from the words and graphics used to teach it, foreshadowing a capability to assess the progress in learning a complicated concept like those in a high-school physics lesson. fMRI pattern analyses could diagnose which aspects of a concept students misunderstand (or lack), in a way that could guide the next iteration of instruction. The results from this study also indicate that it may be possible to use a similar approach to understand the 'loss' of knowledge in various brain disorders, such as dementia or Alzheimer's disease, or due to brain injuries. The loss of a concept in the brain may be the reverse of the process that the study observed.

But photos of the Parisian preteen, whose lanky body and gap-toothed pout bring to mind full-grown size-zero magazine cover girls, have reignited the debate over the sexualization of young girls. Wearing makeup, high heels and haute couture, Blondeau looks a far cry from a typical 10-year-old. Even in childish smocks and cotton tees, her expressions are oddly adult -- a product, perhaps, of living half her young life in the fashion world (she reportedly hit the runway for Jean-Paul Gauthier at age 5). And some say Blondeau's grown-up beauty is giving other young girls unhealthy ideas about how they should look. \\"We don't want kids to grow up too fast,\\" said Shari Miles-Cohen, senior director of women's programs for the American Psychological Association. \\"We want them to be able to develop physically, emotionally, psychologically and socially at appropriate rates for their age.\\" French Vogue provocatively poked at this principle, running photos of Blondeau and two other tweens playing designer dress-up captioned with, \\"Quel maquillage à quel âge?\\" -- What makeup at what age? But a shot of Blondeau wearing a red dress and stilettos lying on a tiger skin rug had critics crying foul. \\"This isn't edgy. It's inappropriate, and creepy, and I never want to see a nine-year-old girl in high-heeled leopard print bedroom slippers ever again,\\" wrote Chloe Angyal, editor of Feminsting.com. Sexualized images can have lasting effects on the young girls who see them. An APA taskforce found that sexualization by the media affects how girls think about femininity and sexuality, promoting \\"appearance and physical attractiveness\\" as key values. It's also linked to low self-esteem, eating disorders and depression. \\"The research clearly shows that the fashion industry affects girls and women's images of themselves and their self-esteem if they do not meet the industry 'image' that is currently in vogue,\\" said Paul Miller, associate professor of psychology at Arizona State University in Phoenix. \\"Even the very young are quite conscious of media images of what is 'pretty' and desirable.\\" In a photo not affiliated with Vogue, Blondeau poses topless on a bed with a young male playmate propositioning a pillow fight. And in another, she wears hip-slung jeans and no top with beaded necklaces covering her would-be breasts. Many in the industry have defended the work as art. Others say it crosses a line. \\"Any creepy child pornographer could plead 'artistic license,'\\" said Miller. Thylane Loubry Blondeau's grown-up look is creating a stir. Blondeau is not the first mini model to stir up the sexualization debate. In 2007, a 13-year-old Dakota Fanning posed in a controversial campaign for Marc Jacobs. Now 13-year-old Elle Fanning has followed in her sister's footsteps as the face of Jacobs' Fall 2011 campaign. The controversy extends to pint-sized pageant queens and prospective pop stars, too. A YouTube video of 8- and 9-year-olds dancing to Beyonce's \\"Single Ladies\\" spurred a similar uproar last year. \\"People have always admired young ballerinas in scanty costumes, but those performances weren't explicitly sexual,\\" Vivian Friedman, child psychologist and professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, told ABC News at the time. \\"There was an aesthetic that didn't remind you of being in bed.\\" Photos of Blondeau, some in pink tutus and others in bed, illustrate the disparity. \\"[The photos] clearly create an image of the girl as an adult woman, both in the clothing, the postures and emotional content of the images,\\" said Miller. \\"The message is that very young girls can be dressed and viewed as young adult women.\\" ||||| Blonde lady from Romania mature on home alone cam.

Movie title: True Grit Movie plot: Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld), the narrator and protagonist, explains that her father was murdered by Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin) when she was 14 years old. While collecting her father's body in Fort Smith, Arkansas, Mattie asks the local sheriff about the search for Chaney. He tells her that Chaney has fled with \\"Lucky\\" Ned Pepper and his gang into Indian Territory, where the sheriff has no authority, so she inquires about hiring a Deputy U.S. Marshal. The sheriff gives three recommendations, and Mattie chooses Rooster Cogburn. Cogburn initially rebuffs her offer, not believing she has the money to hire him. She raises the money by aggressively horse-trading with Colonel Stonehill. Texas Ranger LaBoeuf arrives in town after pursuing Chaney for the murder of a Texas State Senator. LaBoeuf proposes to team up with Cogburn, but Mattie refuses his offer. She wishes Chaney to be hanged in Arkansas for her father's murder, not in Texas for killing the senator. Mattie also insists on traveling with Cogburn but he leaves without her, having gone with LaBoeuf to apprehend Chaney and split the reward. After being refused passage on the ferry that conveyed Cogburn and LaBoeuf, Mattie crosses the river on horseback. LaBoeuf expresses his displeasure by birching Mattie with a stick, but Cogburn eventually allows Mattie to accompany them. After a dispute over their respective service with the Confederate States of America, Cogburn ends their arrangement and LaBoeuf leaves to pursue Chaney on his own. Cogburn and Mattie meet a trail doctor who directs them to an empty dugout for shelter. They find two outlaws, Quincy and Moon, and interrogate them.

After joining forces with Deputy U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn and Texas Ranger LaBoeuf, Mattie relentlessly pursues Chaney in an attempt to bring him to justice for her father's murder. Mattie's determination and courage play significant roles in the story, as she overcomes numerous obstacles and challenges along the way. Towards the end of the movie, the trio of Mattie, Rooster, and LaBoeuf manage to track down the Pepper gang, with whom Chaney has been hiding. During a confrontation with the outlaws, Mattie manages to shoot Chaney, significantly wounding him. This gunshot dramatically alters the course of events, as it allows Rooster and LaBoeuf to gain the upper hand in their battle against the Pepper gang. The fact that Mattie is the one to shoot and wound Chaney is crucial to the movie's plot and her character development. It shows her relentless pursuit of justice and her determination to personally see that her father's killer is held accountable for his actions. Mattie's bravery and strong-willed nature ultimately propel the story forward and create a powerful connection between her and the audience. In conclusion, the person Mattie shoots and wounds in True Grit is none other than Tom Chaney, the man responsible for her father's murder. Through sheer determination and unwavering courage, Mattie becomes a key player in bringing Chaney to justice and avenging her father's death. This event adds depth to the film's narrative and highlights Mattie's strong character, making her one of the most memorable figures in cinematic history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is revealed that MuÃ±ez is set to return to England as a Tottenham Hotspur player under a two-year contract, along with Liam, who re-signs for Newcastle United, the original club of both ex-Real players. The film goes on to depict the World Cup from the English perspective. Liam scores against Sweden (2-2), assisted by a header from Charlie, and England qualify for the knock-out stages. However, in the match against Ecuador, Charlie is injured, and later collapses in the changing room. He is rushed to hospital, and dies on the way from an aneurysm (from the car accident). England crash out of the quarter-finals against Portugal as Liam misses a crucial penalty against Portuguese keeper Ricardo while Cristiano Ronaldo converts. Liam later proposes June to marry him. Santiago Munez is the Best Man. During his wedding speech he remembers Charlie and his eyes get teary.

Surprisingly, each of these carries the same risk, which is very low.However, what about flying compared to working in the chemical industry? Unfortunately, the former is 65 times riskier than the latter! In fact the accident rate of workers in the chemical industry is less than that of almost any of human activity, and almost as safe as staying at home. The trouble with the chemical industry is that when things go wrong they often cause death to those living nearby.It is this that makes chemical accidents so newsworthy.Fortunately, they are extremely rare.The most famous ones happened at Texas City (1947), Flixborough (1974), Seveso (1976), Pemex (1984) and Bhopal (1984). Some of these are always in the minds of the people even though the loss of life was small.No one died at Seveso, and only 28 workers at Flixborough.The worst accident of all was Bhopal, where up to 3,000 were killed.The Texas City explosion of fertilizer killed 552.The Pemex fire at a storage plant for natural gas in the suburbs of Mexico City took 542 lives, just a month before the unfortunate event at Bhopal. Some experts have discussed these accidents and used each accident to illustrate a particular danger.Thus the Texas City was caused by tons of ammonium nitrate, which is safe unless stored in a great quantity.The Flixborough fireball was the fault of management, which took risks to keep production going during essential repairs.The Seveso accident shows what happens if the local authorities lack knowledge of the danger on their doorstep.When the poisonous gas drifted over the town , local leaders were incapable of taking effective action.The Pemex fire was made worse by an overloaded site in an overcrowded suburb.The fire set off a chain reaction of exploding storage tanks.Yet, by a miracle, the two largest tanks did not explode.Had these caught fire, then 3,000 strong rescue team and fire fighters would all have died.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Sir Edward William Elgar, 1st Baronet (2 June 1857 - 23 February 1934) was an English composer, many of whose works have entered the British and international classical concert repertoire. Among his best-known compositions are orchestral works including the Enigma Variations, the Pomp and Circumstance Marches, concertos for violin and cello, and two symphonies. He also composed choral works, including The Dream of Gerontius, chamber music and songs. He was appointed Master of the King's Musick in 1924. Elgar was contemptuous of folk music and had little interest in or respect for the early English composers, calling William Byrd and his contemporaries \\"museum pieces\\". Of later English composers, he regarded Purcell as the greatest, and he said that he had learned much of his own technique from studying Hubert Parry's writings. The continental composers who most influenced Elgar were Handel, Dvorak and, to some degree, Brahms. In Elgar's chromaticism, the influence of Wagner is apparent, but Elgar's individual style of orchestration owes much to the clarity of nineteenth-century French composers, Berlioz, Massenet, Saint-Saens and, particularly, Delibes, whose music Elgar played and conducted at Worcester and greatly admired. Elgar began composing when still a child, and all his life he drew on his early sketchbooks for themes and inspiration. The habit of assembling his compositions, even large-scale ones, from scraps of themes jotted down randomly remained throughout his life. His early adult works included violin and piano pieces, music for the wind quintet in which he and his brother played between 1878 and 1881, and music of many types for the Powick Asylum band. Diana McVeagh in Grove's Dictionary finds many embryonic Elgarian touches in these pieces, but few of them are regularly played, except Salut d'Amour and (as arranged decades later into The Wand of Youth Suites) some of the childhood sketches. Elgar's sole work of note during his first spell in London in 1889-91, the overture Froissart, was a romantic-bravura piece, influenced by Mendelssohn and Wagner, but also showing further Elgarian characteristics. Orchestral works composed during the subsequent years in Worcestershire include the Serenade for Strings and Three Bavarian Dances. In this period and later, Elgar wrote songs and partsongs. W. H. Reed expressed reservations about these pieces, but praised the partsong The Snow, for female voices, and Sea Pictures, a cycle of five songs for contralto and orchestra which remains in the repertory. Elgar's principal large-scale early works were for chorus and orchestra for the Three Choirs and other festivals. These were The Black Knight, King Olaf, The Light of Life, The Banner of St George and Caractacus. He also wrote a Te Deum and Benedictus for the Hereford Festival. Of these, McVeagh comments favourably on his lavish orchestration and innovative use of leitmotifs, but less favourably on the qualities of his chosen texts and the patchiness of his inspiration. McVeagh makes the point that, because these works of the 1890s were for many years little known (and performances remain rare), the mastery of his first great success, the Enigma Variations, appeared to be a sudden transformation from mediocrity to genius, but in fact his orchestral skills had been building up throughout the decade. by which titles?","completion":"Elgar's best-known compositions are \\"orchestral works including the Enigma Variations, the Pomp and Circumstance Marches, concertos for violin and cello, and two symphonies.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Be Responsible Given the context provided, Taylor has already informed Ash's mom about the bad grades she had gotten. As a result, the next step Taylor would likely want to take is to be responsible. This could involve various actions, such as acknowledging the consequences of their poor academic performance, seeking ways to improve their grades, and learning from the experience to prevent similar issues in the future. In order to be responsible, Taylor may want to consider the following steps: 1. Reflect and learn: Taylor should take time to reflect upon the reasons for her bad grades, such as inconsistent study habits or a lack of understanding of the subject matter. This self-awareness will help her identify the areas that need improvement, thereby enabling her to avoid making the same mistakes in the future. 2. Create an action plan: Once Taylor has identified the root causes of her poor academic performance, she should develop a plan to address these issues. This may involve setting specific goals, such as dedicating more time for studying, seeking additional resources or tutoring, and staying organized to manage her school tasks efficiently. 3. Communicate with teachers and parents: Taylor should be open and honest with her teachers and parents about her struggles and the steps she is taking to improve her academic performance.

Background: Kimberley Ann \\"Kim\\" Deal (born June 10, 1961) is an American singer, songwriter and musician, best known as the former bassist and backing vocalist of the alternative rock band Pixies, and the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist for The Breeders. Deal joined Pixies in January 1986 as the band's bassist, adopting the stage name Mrs. John Murphy for the albums Come on Pilgrim and Surfer Rosa. Following Doolittle and The Pixies' hiatus, she formed The Breeders with Tanya Donelly, Josephine Wiggs and later introduced her identical twin sister Kelley Deal. The Pixies broke up in early 1993, and Deal returned her focus to The Breeders, who released the platinum-selling album Last Splash in 1993. Context: Deal became the bassist and backing vocalist for Pixies in January 1986, after answering an advertisement in the Boston Phoenix that said, \\"\\"Band seeks bassist into Husker Du and Peter, Paul and Mary. Please - no chops.\\" Deal was the only person to call them, even though her main instrument was guitar. She borrowed her sister Kelley's bass guitar to use in the band. To complete the lineup, she suggested they hire David Lovering as drummer, a friend of her husband, whom she met at her wedding reception. For the release of the band's first recording Come on Pilgrim (1987), Deal used the nom de disque \\"Mrs. John Murphy\\" in the liner notes. She chose the name as an ironic feminist joke, after conversing with a lady who wished to be called only by her husband's name as a form of respect. For Surfer Rosa (1988), Deal sang lead vocals on the album's only single, \\"Gigantic\\" ( sample ), which she co-wrote with Black Francis. Doolittle followed a year later, with Deal contributing the song \\"Silver\\" and appearing on slide guitar. By this time, however, tensions began to develop between her and Francis, with bickering and standoffs between the two marring the album's recording sessions. This led to increased stress between the band members. Murphy commented that during the sessions, it \\"went from just all fun to work\\". Exhaustion, from releasing three records in two years and constant touring, contributed to the friction, particularly between Francis and Deal. The tension and exhaustion culminated at the end of the US \\"Fuck or Fight\\" tour, where they were too tired to attend the end-of-tour party. The band soon announced a hiatus. Question: Why was this bad Answer:","completion":"This was bad because when the members of the band, like Kim Deal and Black Francis, started to argue and not get along, it made it hard for them to work together and make good music. They were also very tired from making so many songs and going on tours, which made them feel even more upset. This led to the band taking a break, and the people who loved their music had to wait for them to come back together and make more songs. It's important for people in a band to get along and work well together, so they can make great music for everyone to enjoy."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Moments after the summit between Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un concluded, VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren and I spent a few minutes with the U.S. president and his secretary of state, at the Capella. Trump was elated and within the hour would make a surprising announcement suspending \\"provocative\\" joint U.S.-South Korean drills on the Korean peninsula. \\"We had a great chemistry,\\" the president, speaking to Van Susteren, said of himself and Kim. \\"We will do business.\\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told us, \\"it's a great day.\\" The president has essentially handed off to Pompeo the hard work of turning a sparse declaration on denuclearization into something truly transformative. Many will question whether Pompeo, who a decade ago was running an oilfield equipment company, is truly the man for the task. In Pompeo's background, however, are indications of his capabilities: First in his class at the U.S. Military Academy, time served on the House of Representative's intelligence committee, a brief stint as director of the Central Intelligence Agency and two meetings with Kim in Pyongyang. Perhaps he is now as astute as any American official on piecing together the Pyongyang puzzle. This correspondent — an observer of the Korean peninsula over five decades, resident in Seoul for several years and once given the opportunity to frankly converse for a week (in 2013) in the North with KPA officers — has gleaned some insight into the world's most reclusive state. Rarely can any collection of a few hundred words adequately encapsulate the geo-political conundrum. It is...

Take all of your calculated returns and add them together. Then, divide by the number of returns you are using, n, to find the mean return. This represents the average return over the time period you are measuring. Specifically, the mean, m, is calculated as follows: m =(R1+R2+...Rn)/(n). For example, imagine that you had 5 periods that had calculated returns of 0.2, -0.1, -0.3, 0.4, and 0.1. You would add these together to get 0.3 then divide by the number of periods, n, which is 5. Therefore, your mean, m, would be 0.3/5, or 0.06. For every return, Rn, a deviation, Dn, from the mean return, m, can be found. The equation for finding Dn can be expressed simply as Dn=Rn-m. Complete this calculation for all returns within the range you are measuring. Using the previous example, you would subtract your mean, 0.06, from each of the returns to get a deviation for each. These would be: D1=0.2-0.06, or 0.14 D2=-0.1-0.06, or -0.16 D3=-0.3-0.06, or -0.36 D4=0.4-0.06, or 0.34 D5=0.1-0.06, or 0.04 Your next step is to find the mean variance of the returns by summing the squared individual deviations from the mean of the returns. The equation for finding the variance, S, can be expressed as: S=(D1^2+D2^2+...Dn^2)/(n-1). Again, sum the squares of the deviations, Dn, and divide by the total number of variances minus 1, n-1, to get your mean variance. First, square your deviations from the last step. These would be, in order: 0.0196, 0.0256, 0.1296, 0.1156, 0.0016. Sum these numbers to get 0.292. Then, divide by n-1, which is 4, to get 0.073. So, S=0.073 in the example. The volatility is calculated as the square root of the variance, S. This can be calculated as V=sqrt(S). This \\"square root\\" measures the deviation of a set of returns (perhaps daily, weekly or monthly returns) from their mean. It is also called the Root Mean Square, or RMS, of the deviations from the mean return. It is also called the standard deviation of the returns. In the example, this would just be the square root of S, which is 0.073. So, V=0.270. This number has been rounded to three decimal places. You may choose to keep more decimals to be more accurate. A stock whose price varies wildly (meaning a wide variation in returns) will have a large volatility compared to a stock whose returns have a small variation. By way of comparison, for money in a bank account with a fixed interest rate, every return equals the mean (i.e., there's no deviation) and the volatility is 0. Summary:","completion":"1. Calculate the mean return (m) by adding all the individual returns (Rn) and dividing by the total number of returns (n): m = (R1+R2+...Rn)/(n). 2. Calculate the deviation (Dn) for each return by subtracting the mean return (m) from each return (Rn): Dn = Rn - m. 3. Find the mean variance (S) by summing the squared deviations (Dn^2) and dividing by (n-1): S = (D1^2+D2^2+...Dn^2)/(n-1). 4. Calculate the volatility (V) as the square root of the variance (S): V = sqrt(S). In the provided example, the mean return is 0.06, the mean variance is 0.073, and the volatility is 0.270. Volatility represents the level of variation in returns and can be used to assess the risk of an investment. A stock with a higher volatility has more price fluctuation, while a lower volatility indicates more stable returns."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Suede is variety of what?","completion":"Suede is a variety of leather. It is a type of leather that is made from the underside of the animal skin, usually from calves, lambs, pigs, goats, or deer. Suede is created through a process that splits the hide to produce the soft, napped surface that is characteristic of this material. The name \\"suede\\" is derived from the French term \\"gants de Suède,\\" which means \\"gloves from Sweden,\\" as it was originally utilized for creating gloves. The distinct features of suede come from its unique production process. Compared to full-grain leather, which is made from the outer side of the animal hide and has a smooth surface, suede has a soft, velvety texture that is obtained after the hide is sanded or buffed to raise the fibers on the surface. This results in a plush, delicate surface that has a higher level of breathability as compared to other types of leather. While the softness and pliability of suede make it a popular choice for various items like shoes, gloves, handbags, jackets, and upholstery, it also has some drawbacks. Suede is more susceptible to stains, water damage, and wear than other leather types due to its porous nature and delicate surface. Therefore, suede products require additional maintenance and care to preserve their appearance and condition. To protect and prolong the life of suede items, it is important to follow proper care guidelines. These include: 1. Handling with clean hands: As suede can easily absorb oil and dirt, it is crucial to handle it with clean hands to avoid staining the material. 2. Using a suede brush: Regularly brushing suede items with a soft-bristle suede brush can help maintain the material's napped surface and remove dust and dirt. Always brush in the direction of the nap to prevent damage. 3. Protecting from moisture: Using a spray-on suede protector can help shield the material from water damage and stains. It is vital to follow the manufacturer's instructions and test a small, inconspicuous area of the suede before applying the product. 4. Storing in a cool, dry place: Suede should be kept away from direct sunlight, heat, and moisture to prevent fading, discoloration, and damage. 5. Addressing spills and stains promptly: When a spill occurs, it is essential to blot it immediately with a clean, dry cloth to prevent it from setting in. For more difficult stains, it may be necessary to consult a professional cleaner who specializes in suede care. Overall, suede is a luxurious and unique variety of leather with a soft, velvety texture that is highly sought after for a variety of products. However, to maintain its beauty and longevity, it requires specific care and attention to prevent damage from stains, water, and wear."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- A nonprofit group founder became the third person to accuse San Diego Mayor Bob Filner of sexual harassment, telling CNN Wednesday that he tried to kiss her at least four times during a business meeting at a restaurant when he was a congressman. Filner couldn't be immediately reached for comment. He has recently responded to other accusations of sexual harassment in recent weeks by asserting he will eventually be vindicated, but he acknowledged he needs \\"help\\" and has been \\"clearly doing something wrong.\\" Morgan Rose met with Filner in April 2009 at a Marie Callender's Restaurant & Bakery across the street from Filner's congressional office in Chula Vista, California, she told CNN.","completion":"Rose, who founded a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving child welfare, said she had arranged the meeting with Filner to discuss strategies for preventing child abuse, particularly in military families within Filner's congressional district. According to Rose, the then-congressman seemed genuinely interested in her cause at first, and they spent some time discussing the issue and potential solutions. However, the tone of the meeting shifted dramatically when Filner allegedly became increasingly insistent on his attempts to kiss Rose despite her clear discomfort and objections. \\"He tried to move my face towards his to intimidate me,\\" Rose said. \\"I kept pulling back and trying to focus on the discussion at hand, but he just wouldn't let up.\\" Feeling threatened and ashamed by Filner's inappropriate behavior, Rose managed to end the meeting and leave the restaurant. She later confided in friends and family about what had happened, but hesitated to come forward publicly for fear of retribution that might impact her nonprofit's work. The allegations against Filner have sparked widespread condemnation from both political parties and intensified calls for his resignation as mayor of San Diego. In addition to the three accusers who have come forward publicly, several other women have reportedly made anonymous claims of harassment against Filner. Members of the San Diego City Council have expressed concern over the mounting allegations and called for an independent investigation into Filner's conduct. \\"These allegations are deeply troubling, and an investigation is certainly warranted,\\" said Councilmember Barbara Bry. \\"We must ensure that such behavior has no place in the halls of government.\\" In response to the earlier allegations, Mayor Filner vowed to seek professional help for his behavior, stating, \\"I need help with my personal interactions, and I am seeking guidance from professionals on how to conduct myself properly and respectfully.\\" As the investigation into Mayor Filner's actions continues, the outcome remains uncertain. Should more evidence of harassment surface, Filner may face not only political backlash but also potential legal consequences for his actions. It is yet to be seen whether Filner's claims of eventual vindication will hold true. However, the growing number of accusations underscores the importance of addressing sexual harassment in the workplace and creating an environment where such behavior is not tolerated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As Christian narrates, the film flashes back to one year earlier upon Christian's move to the Montmartre district of Paris to become a writer among members of the area's Bohemian movement. He soon encounters that his neighbours are a loose troupe of performers led by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo). Toulouse-Lautrec and the others ask for Christian's help, and his writing skills allow them to finish their proposed show, \\"Spectacular Spectacular\\", that they wish to sell to the owner of the Moulin Rouge, Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent).

Summarize: An international team detected the light display around a brown dwarf about 18 light years away in the Lyra constellation. They say the luminous glow looks like the northern lights, but is up to a million times brighter and more red than green in colour. The findings are reported in the journal Nature. Dr Stuart Littlefair, an astronomer from the University of Sheffield, said: \\"This is the first time that we have confirmed we are seeing auroras on brown dwarfs.\\" Charged interaction Shimmering auroras are some of the Earth's most dazzling displays. This luminous glow can also appear around all the planets in our Solar System. They are caused when charged particles from the Sun interact with the atmosphere. But the illuminated brown dwarf, an object which is too small to have become a star but too massive to be a planet, lies further out in the galaxy. Called LSR J1835, it was observed using the Very Large Array radio telescope and the Hale and Keck optical telescopes. The scientists watched the object as it rapidly rotated, and observed how the light varied. \\"The brightness changes are consistent with what you would expect from auroras,\\" said Dr Littlefair. The dwarf's aurora is mainly red in colour because the charged particles are mainly interacting with hydrogen in its atmosphere. On Earth, the greenish glow is caused as the electrons from the Sun hit oxygen atoms. However, scientists are puzzled about how the light show is being generated. The brown dwarf is a sort of failed star itself, and has no other star like the Sun nearby to blast it with charged particles. \\"It is possible material is being stripped off the surface of the brown dwarf to produce its own electrons,\\" said Dr Littlefair. Another option is an as-yet-undetected planet or moon around the dwarf is throwing off material to light it up. Some of Jupiter's auroras are produced in this way, as charged particles are emitted from volcanoes on its moon Io. The discovery is also helping scientists to better understand brown dwarfs. There is some debate over whether they are more star-like in their nature, or whether they have planetary attributes. \\"If you are working in brown dwarfs, it matters whether you think of them as small stars or big planets,\\" said Dr Littlefair. \\"We already known from observations of brown dwarfs that they have clouds in the atmosphere. Now we know they also show auroras, it is yet more reason to consider brown dwarfs as scaled-up versions of planets rather than scaled-down version of stars.\\" Follow Rebecca on Twitter. Summary:","completion":"An international team of scientists has detected an aurora, similar to Earth's Northern Lights, around a brown dwarf 18 light years away in the Lyra constellation. The luminous glow is up to a million times brighter and more red than green in color compared to the Northern Lights on Earth. This discovery, reported in the journal Nature, marks the first time that auroras have been confirmed on brown dwarfs, which are objects too small to become stars but too massive to be planets. The aurora's red color is due to charged particles interacting with hydrogen in the brown dwarf's atmosphere. However, scientists are unsure how the light show is being generated, as the brown dwarf does not have a nearby star to provide charged particles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She wasn't out chasing butterflies or climbing a tree, but resting snugly in her basket. One morning, as the sun was just starting to wake up, Esther's owner was getting ready for work. He found her in her basket not feeling very well. It appeared that poor Esther was wounded. She had been hurt very close to her lung - so close, it was almost like the width of a game of darts! Darts are small pointed things that people throw at a target in a game. In this situation, 'Dart' is being used to explain how close the hurt was to Esther's lung. It simply means that the wound was very very close to hurting her lung. Seeing Esther in pain, her owner quickly rushed her to those nice people who look after animals when they're ill - the veterinarians, or vets for short. These vets decided they needed to operate straight away to get Esther feeling better. Operating is just a fancy word for doing special doctor stuff to help fix Esther's hurt. The good news is, after the operation, the vets have said Esther should get completely better. That's what we call a full recovery. So, even though Esther had a big fright, she was very brave and is now on her way to feeling her old self again. Now, here comes the mystery part of our story. The Police in Kent - they're the people who make sure everyone is safe and following the rules - are looking into what happened to Esther on February 25th. They want to find out how she got hurt and make sure it doesn't happen to any other cuddly cats. So, let's all cross our fingers and toes, and send our warmest wishes to brave little Esther for a speedy recovery. Her adventure was very scary, but remember, she's going to be okay in the end.

You are presented with the question \\"Fall begins as deciduous trees lose their leaves when?\\" and the following answer choices: - It becomes dormant - Plant growth is reduced - in the autumn season - deforestation - Physical weathering - in the winter season - in the spring season - in the freezing season Now knowing that the color of leaves on deciduous trees usually changes in the autumn season and fall colors begin as deciduous trees lose their leaves, choose the best answer. A:","completion":"In the autumn season The process of deciduous trees losing their leaves primarily occurs during the autumn season. Deciduous trees, which include maple, oak, and elm, have evolved to shed their leaves as a survival mechanism in response to changes in their environment. As the daylight hours decrease and the temperatures begin to cool, certain cues trigger a chemical process in the tree to conserve energy and prepare for the upcoming winter. The cause of this foliage change can be attributed to several factors, primarily the reduction in sunlight and cooler temperatures. The tree's chlorophyll - the green pigment responsible for photosynthesis - starts to break down, revealing other pigments such as carotenoids and anthocyanins, which produce the signature hues of yellow, orange, and red. These pigments, along with a decrease in water and nutrient availability, play a part in the spectacular display of fall colors seen in deciduous forests. Once the chemical changes have taken place and the leaves have lost their connection to the tree, they eventually fall to the ground due to gravity and wind. This process is known as abscission, and it allows the tree to conserve energy and water over the winter months when resources are more scarce. The fallen leaves also contribute important nutrients back into the soil through the process of decomposition, providing a natural fertilizer for the tree when it starts growing again in the spring. Autumn, therefore, is the correct answer to the question \\"Fall begins as deciduous trees lose their leaves when?\\" because it is the season when this process predominantly takes place. The other options, such as dormancy, reduced plant growth, deforestation, physical weathering, and other seasons, do not accurately account for the specific time frame or the mechanisms behind deciduous trees shedding their leaves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dawn marries Gator whose aunt Ida (Edith Massey) badly wishes that her nephew was gay (Gator is generally tolerant of homosexuality but is adamantly straight) and Ida therefore loathes Dawn. When the marriage fails Dawn has Gator fired and the Dashers enlist Dawn to model in their photographic exploration of \\"crime and beauty\\". Gator leaves to work in the auto industry. Ida blames Dawn and exacts revenge by throwing acid in Dawn's face. The thrilled Dashers continue to court the scarred Dawn discouraging her to have corrective cosmetic surgery and continue to use her as a grotesquely made-up model. The Dashers kidnap Ida, keeping her caged in Dawn's home as a gift to Dawn, encourage Dawn to chop off Ida's hand, and get Dawn hooked on the drug Liquid Eyeliner. Taffy is distraught over these events and finally convinces Dawn to reveal the identity of Taffy's father. Taffy finds her father living in a dilapidated house and drinking excessively.

Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators. Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] Paragraph: Two coastal Canadian towns, Hammond and Soundville decided to start sand mining to bring more money to their budgets.

As Mollett left the house he saw two men walking down the road away from the sweep before the hall door, and as he passed them he recognised one as the young gentleman of the house. He also saw that a horse followed behind them, on the grass by the roadside, not led by the hand, but following with the reins laid loose upon his neck. They took no notice of him or his car, but allowed him to pass as though he had no concern whatever with the destinies of either of them. They were Herbert and Owen Fitzgerald. The reader will perhaps remember the way in which Owen left Desmond Court on the occasion of his last visit there. It cannot be said that what he had heard had in any way humbled him, nor indeed had it taught him to think that Clara Desmond looked at him altogether with indifference. Greatly as she had injured him, he could not bring himself to look upon her as the chief sinner. It was Lady Desmond who had done it all. It was she who had turned against him because of his poverty, who had sold her daughter to his rich cousin, and robbed him of the love which he had won for himself. Or perhaps not of the love--it might be that this was yet his; and if so, was it not possible that he might beat the countess at her own weapons? Thinking over this, he felt that it was necessary for him to do something, to take some step; and therefore he resolved to go boldly to his cousin, and tell him that he regarded Lady Clara Desmond as still his own. What are the answers to this following set of questions: 1. What did the man see as he left? 2. Where? 3. How many were there? 4. Did he recognize any of them? 5. As whom? 6. Did they see him? 7. Did they pay attention to him? 8. What were their names? 9. Did they obstruct his passage? 10. What was the name of the man who passed them? 11. Where had Owen departed from? 12. Did the events of his last visit, teach him humility? 13. Who did he blame for his injury? 14. Why had she turned on him? 15. What had she done with her female child? 16. What did he think he had stolen from him? 17. Did he feel he needed to take action? 18. To whom did he intend to talk? 19. What was he going to say to him? 20. What had followed the men as they left the house? Numbered answers:","completion":"1. The man saw two men walking down the road, and a horse following them. 2.

Question: Question: \\"Which compounds is used by cypress to be against insects, terpenes or rosin?\\" Context: \\"Aside from the lignocellulose, wood consists of a variety of low molecular weight organic compounds, called extractives.

Milo's dog, The Phantom Tollbooth's 'watchdog'? What is the answer?","completion":"The Phantom Tollbooth is a children's fantasy adventure novel written by Norton Juster and illustrated by Jules Feiffer, which was first published in 1961. The story revolves around a young boy named Milo who is bored with his life and unexpectedly receives a magic tollbooth that takes him on a journey to a fantastical realm. One of the key characters in this enchanting world is Tock, a dog commonly referred to as the 'watchdog.' Tock's name is a play on words, a pun of sorts, as Tock is not an ordinary dog, but a watchdog in the most literal sense. Along with having a dog's body, Tock has an alarm clock built into his torso, which signifies the importance of time to his character. This combination of features makes him unique and well-suited for his role in the story. As Milo embarks upon his magical journey, he meets Tock early on, and the two become close companions throughout their adventures. Tock joins Milo as they explore the various regions within the Kingdom of Wisdom, including memorable locations like Dictionopolis, where they learn about the power and importance of words, and Digitopolis, where numbers and mathematics reign supreme. Tock's purpose in the story is not only to assist Milo in navigating the kingdom but also to provide guidance, wisdom, and friendship throughout their journey. The character of Tock stands as a symbol of the importance of time and making the most of it. He frequently reminds Milo about the value of utilizing time wisely and not wasting it, which is a central theme within the novel. Through Tock, the novel teaches valuable lessons about the significance of time management, curiosity, problem-solving, and exploration. The adventures of Milo and Tock serve as an important reminder that imagination and learning can transform the mundane aspects of life into something thrilling and meaningful. In this way, Tock, the literal watchdog, is not only an entertaining character but also an educational figure that helps readers understand the importance of being present and maximizing their full potential. Overall, Tock from The Phantom Tollbooth is a purposeful and multidimensional character, representing the importance of time management, exploration, and intellectual discovery. As the watchdog in the story, Tock's unique physical appearance, as well as his role as Milo's companion and guide, make him an essential and memorable character in Norton Juster's classic children's novel."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

To further elaborate on this, let's analyze the context, factors, and reasons why this might be the case. Firstly, it is important to understand the context in which this statement is being made. The person might be referring to a specific market, region, or time period in which the real estate sector experienced a significant decline in value. For example, the period following the global financial crisis of 2007-2008 saw a significant drop in real estate prices in various regions. In some cases, property values still have not fully recovered to their pre-crisis levels. There are several factors and reasons which might explain why real estate hasn't fully recovered to its previous value: 1. Economic factors: The overall health of the economy has a direct impact on the real estate market. If the economy is experiencing slow growth, high unemployment, or financial instability, it could take longer for real estate values to recover. 2. Government policies: Government policies can have a significant impact on the real estate market. Some policies, such as regulations and taxes, can lower demand for property and keep prices from rebounding to previous levels. 3. Supply and demand: The balance between the number of properties available for sale and the number of potential buyers plays a crucial role in determining the market value of real estate. An oversupply of properties, or a lack of demand, could prevent real estate values from recovering fully. 4. Demographics and social trends: Shifts in population, such as a decline in the birth rate, lower immigration, or an increase in households downsizing, can lead to reduced demand for real estate and, consequently, stable or declining property values. 5. Psychological factors: Consumer sentiment and confidence in the real estate market are important factors in the recovery of property values. If people are anxious about the market's overall health or the potential for another downturn, they may be more cautious about investing, which in turn contributes to a slower overall recovery. 6. Market-specific factors: Local factors, such as changes in industry or employment levels, can have a significant impact on real estate values. If a region has experienced a decline in important industries or significant job losses, it may take longer for real estate values to return to previous levels. It is important to note that an overall statement, such as \\"real estate hasn't recovered to its previous value,\\" might not be accurate for every market, region, or property type. Some real estate markets might have experienced a complete recovery or even exceeded their previous value, while others may still be struggling. To conclude, the statement \\"Real estate hasn't recovered to its previous value\\" suggests that property values in the mentioned context have not yet returned to their previous level. Factors such as economic conditions, government policies, supply and demand, social trends, and local market dynamics might contribute to the slower recovery in certain regions or property types. However, it is crucial to recognize that this observation might not be universally accurate, as recovery rates and property values differ across regions and categories of real estate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Parliament's environmental committee approved resolution urging Spain to carry out the Great Ape Project (GAP), designed by scientists and philosophers who say our closest genetic s deserve rights limited to humans. \\"This is a historic day in the struggle for animal rights and in defense of our evolutionary comrades, which will doubtless go down in the history of humanity,\\" said Pedro Poza, Spanish director of the Great Ape Project. The new resolution has cross-party support and it is thought they will become law within a year, making Spain the first nation to extend legal rights to apes. Under the new law, potential experiments on apes in Spain will be forbidden. \\"We have no knowledge of great apes being used in experiments in Spain, but there is currently no law preventing that from happening,\\" Poza said.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean border guards arrested an American man who they believe was attempting to swim across the border into rival North Korea, a South Korean defense official said Wednesday. The man was arrested Tuesday night at a river near the Korean Demilitarized Zone, part of a restricted military area, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to office policy. He said investigators are questioning the man about the purpose of his apparent attempt to enter North Korea but gave no further details. Yonhap news agency, citing an unidentified government source, reported the man was in his late 20s or early 30s and told investigators that he tried to go to North Korea to meet leader Kim Jong Un. He was caught by South Korean marines while lying on the shore of the river after swimming north, the report said. Last year, South Korean soldiers shot and killed a man with a South Korean passport who officials said ignored warnings to return the South after trying to go to North Korea via a river that runs through the border. There have been occasional cases of Americans being arrested in North Korea after allegedly entering the country illegally from China, but an American trying to go to North Korea from South Korea is unusual. In 1996, American Evan C. Hunziker entered the North by swimming across the Yalu River, which marks the border with China. Hunziker, who apparently made the swim on a drunken dare, was accused of spying and detained for three months. Hunziker, then 26, was eventually freed after negotiations involving a special U.S. envoy. The North Koreans wanted to slap Hunziker with a 100,000 criminal fine but eventually agreed on a 5,000 payment to settle a bill for a hotel where he was detained. North Korea is currently holding three Americans and the country's Supreme Court on Sunday sentenced one of them to six years of hard labor for illegally entering the country to commit espionage. The Korean Peninsula remains in a technical state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea to deter potential aggression from North Korea. About 27,000 North Koreans have defected to South Korea to avoid poverty and political suppression since the end of the Korean War. A few South Koreans have previously tried to defect to the impoverished, authoritarian country, but such cases are rare. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| A:","completion":"Part #1: Summarize news articles separated by special token \\"|||||\\".

The father, a therapist, is skeptical of the psychiatric care she is receiving and takes it upon himself to treat her personally with psychotherapy. But it is not successful, and so when she reveals that her second greatest fear is nature, he decides to try exposure therapy. They hike to their isolated cabin in a woods called Eden, where she spent time with Nic the previous summer while writing a thesis on gynocide. He encounters a doe which shows no fear of him, and has a stillborn fawn hanging halfway out of her. Chapter Two: Pain (Chaos Reigns)[edit] During sessions of psychotherapy, she becomes increasingly grief stricken and manic, often demanding forceful sex to escape the pain. The area becomes increasingly sinister to the man, including acorns rapidly pelting the metal roof, awakening with a hand covered in swollen ticks, and finding a self-disemboweling fox that tells him, \\"chaos reigns.\\" Chapter Three: Despair (Gynocide)[edit] In the dark attic the man finds the womanâs thesis studies: terrifying pictures of witch-hunts, and a scrapbook in which her writing becomes increasingly frantic and illegible.

The man is repulsed by this and reproaches her for buying into the gynocidal beliefs she had originally set out to criticize. In a frenzied moment, they have violent intercourse at the base of an ominous dead tree, where bodies are intertwined within the exposed roots.

(CNN) -- Japan's prime minister conceded defeat in parliamentary elections Sunday, signaling the return to power of the Liberal Democratic Party and ending the brief rule of the disappointing upstart Democratic Party of Japan. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday. The LDP is inheriting a struggling economy, regional tensions and questions over Japan's role in Asia. \\"The economy is at the bottom. It's our first mission to turn it around,\\" Abe said.

Elena told her parents about the sign. \\"I read about the park in the newspaper,\\" said Elena's father. \\"The city wants volunteers to help clean the area. Then the city will build a soccer field and a playground. But the paper didn't mention a jogging trail.\\" \\"Well, perhaps if I help clean up the lots, they'll put in a jogging trail,\\" said Elena. On Saturday Elena went to the lots. Many adults were working there. Some were picking up rubbish. Some were moving rocks. Elena looked around. She could carry rubbish, and she could move rocks. So she went to the area every week to do volunteer work. She told everyone she was glad to help build the park. She explained that she hoped the park would have a jogging trail. Then everyone knew her and her jogging trail. Soon the volunteers cleared the lots. The city could start building. The mayor gave a speech. He showed a drawing of the new park. He told them about the soccer field. There would be picnic tables. There would be a playground. The park would even have basketball courts. But there was no sign of a jogging trail. The mayor thanked the volunteers. Then he asked if they had any suggestions. The volunteers said they wanted to build a jogging trail around the park. They told the mayor how helpful Elena had been and how she wanted a jogging trail. The mayor then said, \\"A jogging trail won't be hard to build. Let's do it!\\" Everyone clapped and cheered. Why did Elena want to help clean the lots? A) Because she wanted to play on the playground. B) Because she wanted her name in the newspaper. C) Because she wanted the city to build a jogging trail.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who reproduced a scene from Martin Schongauer's engraving Flight into Egypt? is inside the article: Little is known for certain of the life of Hieronymus Bosch or of the commissions or influences that may have formed the basis for the iconography of his work. His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history. Although Bosch's career flourished during the High Renaissance, he lived in an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been familiar with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.José de Sigüenza is credited with the first extensive critique of The Garden of Earthly Delights, in his 1605 History of the Order of St. Jerome. He argued against dismissing the painting as either heretical or merely absurd, commenting that the panels \\"are a satirical comment on the shame and sinfulness of mankind\\". The art historian Carl Justi observed that the left and center panels are drenched in tropical and oceanic atmosphere, and concluded that Bosch was inspired by \\"the news of recently discovered Atlantis and by drawings of its tropical scenery, just as Columbus himself, when approaching terra firma, thought that the place he had found at the mouth of the Orinoco was the site of the Earthly Paradise\\". The period in which the triptych was created was a time of adventure and discovery, when tales and trophies from the New World sparked the imagination of poets, painters and writers.

It is a world of snow and ice all year round. China has sent many scientists there. They try to find resources under the icy land and study climate change and sea biology. What do they eat? Scientists don't have many choices on what they eat. About 60% their food is frozen food. It is easy to heat . Meat is common on the menu, while vegetables are not usual. Fresh vegetables are hard to grow in the cold weather. Therefore, people often eat dried and canned vegetables. How do they sleep? In Antarctica, summer lasts from November to March. During this time, Antarctica faces the sun and gets sunlight 24 hours of the day. In order to get some sleep,scientists cover the window with black cloth to make \\"night\\". How do they work? People can wear warm clothes to be against the cold weather, but they can do little with the strong wind. Sometimes, the wind is even stronger than a typhoon. It can easily blow people away. So there are ropes that connect some research stations. People can hold these ropes to keep balance in strong winds. How do they keep in touch with others? There are no cables or Internet on the frozen continent. So mobiles and computers don't work there. Scientists usually use two-way radios to communicate at work. If they want to say hello to family and friends, they can use the satellite phones. Question: What do scientists do in Antarctica? Yes or no, is the answer \\"They mostly find resources and study climate change and sea biology.\\"? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"They mostly find resources and study climate change and sea biology\\" accurately summarizes the primary activities of scientists in Antarctica.

Article: Sam Walton, the founder of Wal-Mart, was born in Kingfish, Oklahoma on March 29, 1918. He was raised in Missouri where he worked in his father's store while attending school. This was his first retailing experience and he really enjoyed it. After graduation, he began his own career as a retail merchant. He soon opened his first Wal-Mart store in 1962 in Rogers, Arkansas. Wal-Mart specialized in name brands at low prices and Sam Walton was surprised at the success. Soon a chain of Wal-Mart stores sprang up across rural America. Walton's management style was popular with employees and he founded some of the basic concepts of management that are still in use today. After taking the company public in 1970, Walton introduced his \\"profit sharing plan\\". The profit sharing plan was a plan for Wal-Mart employees to improve their income dependent on the profits of the store. Sam Walton believed that \\"individuals don't win, teams do\\". Employees at Wal-Mart stores were offered stock options and store discounts. These benefits are commonplace today, but Walton was among the first to implement them. Walton believed that a happy employee meant happy customers and more sales. He also believed that by giving employees a part of the company and making their success dependent on the company's success, they would care about the company. By the 1980s, Wal-Mart had sales of over one billion dollars and over three hundred stores across North America. Wal-Mart's unique decentralized distribution system, also Walton's idea, created the _ needed to further encourage growth in the 1980s during growing complaints that the \\"superstore\\" was stopping smaller and traditional stores from developing. By 1991, Wal-Mart was the largest US retailer with 1,700 stores. Walton remained active in managing the company, as president and CEO until 1988 and chairman until his death. He was awarded the Medal of Freedom shortly before his death. Question: Sam Walton first made a hit in retailing when _ .

Movie plot title: Village of the Damned Movie plot: The quiet coastal town of Midwich, California is invaded by an unseen force which leaves ten women mysteriously pregnant. Nine months later, the babies are born simultaneously on one night, except for one which is stillborn. At first, they all appear to be normal, but it does not take the parents long to realize that their children are anything but normal. As they grow older, the children are shown to have pale skin, platinum-white hair, fierce intellect and steely, cobalt eyes. The emotionless children display eerie psychic abilities and remarkable powers, which they use with deadly consequences, unleashing a reign of terror. When they actively use their mind-controlled powers, their irises or their entire eyes glow in different colours, mostly reddish-orange, but also green, yellow, violet, blue or pure white.There are some story differences from the earlier adaptation. In this version, the children \\"paired off\\", but one of the children, David (Thomas Dekker), loses his partner after she dies at birth. As a result, he shows human compassion while still resembling the other children and retaining some degree of psychic powers. This leads to him not fitting in well with the children. Their ruthless leader, Mara (Lindsey Haun) (\\"daughter\\" of a local doctor, Dr. Alan Chaffee (Christopher Reeve); her mother, Barbara (Karen Kahn), commits suicide by walking off an ocean cliff), considers him less important due to his expression of emotions. Because of his childhood loss, he understands what the other children do not: pain. He and his mother (Linda Kozlowski) (the local school principal) share a brief conversation about the meaning of the word \\"empathy\\", with David beginning to understand that if he feels pain, he can understand others' pain as well. When the other children experience pain, they simply use their powers to inflict the same pain on the adult responsible for the pain, for example forcing one of the mothers to put one of her arms in a pot full of boiling water, or forcing the local optometrist making...

The unnamed Narrator is an automobile recall specialist who is unfulfilled by his job and possessions, and has developed severe insomnia. He finds catharsis by posing as a sufferer of testicular cancer and other afflictions in support groups, remedying his insomnia. His bliss is disturbed by another impostor, Marla Singer, whose presence reminds him he is attending these groups dishonestly. The two agree to split which groups they attend, but not before they exchange contact details on the premise of switching groups at short notice. On a flight home from a business trip, the Narrator meets and interacts with soap salesman Tyler Durden. The Narrator returns home to find that his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion. Deciding against asking Marla for help, he calls Tyler, and they meet at a bar. Tyler says the Narrator is beholden to consumerism.

Q: Who criticized the sciences for distancing man from nature and not operating to make people happier? A: Philosophes introduced the public to many scientific theories, most notably through the Encyclopédie and the popularization of Newtonianism by Voltaire and Émilie du Châtelet. Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"The answer provided does not directly address the question posed. The question asks about a critique of sciences for distancing man from nature and not contributing to people's happiness. The answer, however, speaks about the introduction of scientific theories by Philosophes and the popularization of Newtonianism, which is not relevant to the original question. A more appropriate answer would be: Jean-Jacques Rousseau, an influential 18th-century philosopher, criticized the sciences for distancing man from nature and not operating to make people happier. In his 1750 work, \\"Discourse on the Sciences and Arts,\\" Rousseau argued that the advancement of knowledge, arts, and sciences had led to moral decay. He believed that as people became more educated and cultured, they lost touch with natural virtues and their true selves. Known for his works such as \\"The Social Contract\\" and \\"Emile,\\" Rousseau emphasized the need for a simpler, less materialistic lifestyle. He maintained that individuals are inherently good but become corrupted by the complexities and demands of society. According to his view, an increased focus on science and intellectual progress led to vanity, envy, greed, and the decline of morality. In conclusion, Jean-Jacques Rousseau was the philosopher who criticized the sciences for distancing man from nature and not operating to make people happier. He believed that people should return to a more natural state and focus on their inherent virtues, rather than devoting their energy to the advancement of knowledge and the arts, which he found to be detrimental to human happiness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Firstly, we can tell you that the lives of your relatives could depend on your ability to give first aid. If you think highly of human's life, this article is for you! Here you can find information about first aid. The very first thing that you should do when you see an accident is to _ the situation and prevent further dangerous incidents. First of all, you have to recognize what has happened and what the dangers to rescuers and victims are. Think about how to take care of the victims. Helping usually takes place in very difficult conditions and injuries can be very bad. Therefore, you cannot be too afraid of making mistakes to help. Sometimes you have to face the fact that regardless of your actions and your efforts the victim's condition might not improve--he or she could even die. In some cases even professional medical aid may not succeed. If you have done everything you think you should do, you shouldn't feel guilty. Do not expose yourself to danger. Giving first aid can be dangerous. While trying to help a victim, do not forget about your own safety. If something happens to you, you won't be able to help anyone. Call for help after you find out the condition of a victim. But remember if a victim faints due to breathing failure caused by drowning, choking or poisoning, you should first take action that helps to bring back the heartbeat and breathing. While calling, talk shortly but clearly. Always provide the following information--the location of the accident, the kind of accident, the number of the injured and your full name and phone number and so on. Options: A Everyone must learn how to give first aid. B When calling for help you should give all important details. C You should forget about your own safety while giving first aid.

This upper section is known as the fracture zone and moves mostly as a single unit over the plastically flowing lower section. When a glacier moves through irregular terrain, cracks called crevasses develop in the fracture zone. Crevasses form due to differences in glacier velocity. If two rigid sections of a glacier move at different speeds and directions, shear forces cause them to break apart, opening a crevasse. Crevasses are seldom more than 46 m (150 ft) deep but in some cases can be 300 m (1,000 ft) or even deeper. Beneath this point, the plasticity of the ice is too great for cracks to form.

Scottish ministers announced the move following calls from the National Farmers' Union of Scotland (NFUS). The NFUS want the troubled IT system to be bypassed. The £178m system set up to deliver European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) payments has been beset by delays and increasing costs.

Background: Daniel Irvin Rather, Jr. was born on October 31, 1931, in Wharton County, Texas, the son of Daniel Irvin Rather, Sr., a ditch digger, and the former Byrl Veda Page. The Rathers moved to Houston, where Dan attended Love Elementary School and Hamilton Middle School. He graduated in 1950 from John H. Reagan High School in Houston. In 1953, he earned a bachelor's degree in journalism from Sam Houston State University where he was editor of the school newspaper, The Houstonian. Context: On October 4, 1986, while walking along Park Avenue to his apartment in Manhattan, Rather was attacked and punched from behind by a man who demanded to know \\"Kenneth, what is the frequency?\\" while a second assailant chased and beat him. As the assailant pummeled and kicked Rather, he kept repeating the question. In describing the incident, Rather said, \\"I got mugged. Who understands these things? I didn't and I don't now. I didn't make a lot of it at the time and I don't now. I wish I knew who did it and why, but I have no idea.\\" Until the crime was resolved years later, Rather's description of the bizarre crime led some to doubt the veracity of his account, although the doorman and building supervisor who rescued Rather fully confirmed his version of events. The assault remained unsolved for some time, and was referenced multiple times in popular culture. The phrase \\"What's the frequency, Kenneth?\\" became a popular-culture reference over the years, such as in a scene in the graphic novel Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron by cartoonist Daniel Clowes. In 1994, the band R.E.M. released the song \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\\" on their album Monster. Rather later sang with R.E.M. during a sound check prior to a gig at New York's Madison Square Garden, which was shown the following night on the Late Show with David Letterman before their performance of \\"Crush with Eyeliner\\". In 1997, a TV critic writing in the New York Daily News solved the mystery, publishing a photo of the alleged assailant, William Tager, who received a 12 1/2 -to-25-year prison sentence for killing NBC stagehand Campbell Montgomery outside The Today Show studio in 1994. Rather confirmed the story: \\"There's no doubt in my mind that this is the person.\\" New York District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau said, \\"William Tager's identity as the man who attacked Mr. Rather was established in the course of an investigation by my office.\\" Tager claimed he thought television networks were beaming signals into his brain. When he murdered the stagehand, Tager was trying to force his way into an NBC studio with a weapon, in order to find out the frequency the networks were using to attack him, so that he could block it. Tager was paroled in October 2010 and is believed to be living in New York City. Question: when was he attacked?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Daniel Rather was attacked on October 4, 1986.

Minutes later he came running out again, towards the house. Soon after, I saw him walking towards the woods again. This went on for an hour. Finally I walked out of the house quietly and followed him. Billy cupped both hands in front of him as he walked, careful not to drop the water he carried. Then I saw an amazing sight. Several large deer stood in front of him. Billy walked right up to them. I saw a baby deer lying on the ground. It was dying of thirst, and it tried to lift its head to drink the water in my boy's hands. When the water was gone, Billy ran back to the house. I followed him to the kitchen.

From Tokyo to Sydney, London to New York, thousands waited for hours – sometimes days – to get their hands on the third incarnation of the iPad. Some who didn’t like the idea of sleeping on a cold pavement paid as much as £300 to jump the queue. Scroll down to see video of Apple fans. Among the ordinary shoppers wanting to get their hands on the latest must-have product were profiteering gangs. They infiltrated queues to buy iPads and re-sell them at inflated prices abroad. Customers in Apple's Regent Street store, all bagged up with their purchases. Dozens of people were paid by 'agents' to join queues around London and grab iPads to sell on. However, there is no suggestion that those pictured had any part in this. Black market gangs in London paid people to join the queue and buy the new tablets so they could then be sold on at a profit. The frenzy – reminiscent of the scenes which greeted the launch of its predecessor this time last year – is all the more surprising given that the latest iPad represents only an evolution of previous designs rather than a revolution. Its key selling point is a so-called ‘retina display’, with a high-definition touchscreen boasting 3.1million pixels – more than an HD television. The new model, which costs from £399 to £659 in the UK, also comes with an improved camera and a faster processor, making it attractive to those who use it to play games. The wait for the pay-day paid off: 16-year-old Noah Green was fourth in the queue - but sold his spot for £300. Eager for a bite of the Apple: People sit in the queue for the new iPad 3 outside the company's flagship store on Regent Street in London. Noah Green, a 16-year-old student from Stanmore, North-West London, had been fourth in the queue at Apple’s flagship store in Regent Street, London, but said someone had paid him £300 to move back. Before going through the door, he said: ‘It is worth it. I am still 18th in the queue so I will be one of the first to buy an iPad. I am going to sell it though and earn some money.’ Many appeared to have been paid £10 or £20 to wait in line for hours on behalf of a third party. Some buyers had their hands full of shopping bags filled with products. One was even pictured wheeling items out on a trolley.

Tech Crunch said: 'Once you see and use the new iPad, there will be no going back.' One said: ‘We’re just buying and selling, we’re not doing anything illegal. We bought them and we sold them.’ At Covent Garden, men were seen handing over money, collecting receipts and organising scores of people queuing. One agent, who gave his name as Martin, said: ‘I hope to get around 70 iPads today. I will be sending them on to India.’ The new iPad will not be on sale officially in India for at least another week. Stores were given only a limited supply of the new device and many had sold out by mid-afternoon. This allowed buyers who did manage to get one the opportunity to make a quick profit by selling them via eBay. Sellers on the auction website were offering the 16GB version, which connects to the web via wifi, for as much as £562.79 – a mark-up of £163.79, or 41 per cent, on the official price of £399. The scenes were repeated around the world. In Paris, one customer, Athena May, said: ‘I don’t think it’s worth the price but I guess I’m a victim of society.’ Shares in Apple punched through the 600 barrier – a new record – briefly on Thursday pushing the value of the technology giant to 560billion (£354billion) and confirming it as the world’s most valuable company.

Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: Colorado theater shooting victims still waiting to see donations AURORA, Colo. — Their numbers were smaller than when they first gathered, but their anger was still raw, this time tinged with a weariness over a fight they say should never have happened. They are victims and families of those killed and wounded in the Aurora movie theater massacre, and they want to know what happened to 5 million in donations collected since the violence of July 20. \\"There have been two tragedies in Aurora. The first was the theater shooting. The second is how the victims have been treated by the powers that be,\\" said Tom Teves, the father of Alex Teves, who was killed in the rampage at a midnight showing of \\"The Dark Knight Rises.\\" Teves has emerged as a spokesman for a group of victims of the attack that left 12 dead and 58 wounded. On Aug. 28, Teves and 17 other family members and victims crowded onto a tiny stage at an Aurora meeting hall for the first time to ask about the millions raised for their loved ones. They also charged that they had been shut out of the process to distribute the funds. Last week, only Teves and seven others gathered and far fewer reporters attended for what Teves has said will be the last news conference on the matter. One by one the eight stepped forward to pay tribute to those lost, repeating, \\"We will remember.\\" Reading from a prepared statement and taking no questions Thursday, Teves said his group had been repeatedly misled by the Community First Foundation, which oversees the Aurora Victim Relief Fund that has been flooded with donations from across the country. He said his group has also been misled by the 7/20 Recovery Committee about who gets final say in how the money is divided. The coalition, made up of 30 community groups, health professionals and Aurora city officials, is in charge of making distribution recommendations. Teves said he was first told the victims and their families would get final say but now is being told the foundation can override their wishes. Calls to Community First for comment were not returned. Instead, a news release was emailed to reporters that says in part: \\"The 7/20 Recovery Committee remains committed to a robust and inclusive process that honors the input of all victims, and not just the voices of a few.\\" It further states that meetings with family members will continue and so far there has been \\"a very wide variety of opinions on the work ahead.\\" After the Aug. 28 news conference sparked outrage, Community First leaders said they would allow victims to have a voice in the process. This month, victims were sent a three-page survey that promised \\"100% of the Aurora Victim Relief Fund will be used exclusively to help meet the needs of the victims.\\" The survey lays out two disbursement possibilities. One would evenly divide the money among the wounded and the families of those killed, as well as others in the theater the night of the shooting and those displaced from their homes as authorities dismantled the booby traps in the apartment of suspect James E. Holmes. The second would divide it according to an individual needs assessment. The letter accompanying the survey says the models are based on those used to distribute funds after other tragedies, including those at Columbine High School in nearby Littleton and at Virginia Tech. The foundation has said it hopes to have the distribution plan in place by early November. Immediately after the shooting, Community First, along with Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper's office, cofounded the Aurora Victim Relief Fund. In late August, each of the 70 families of those killed or wounded received a 5,000 check from the Colorado Organization for Victim Assistance for immediate needs — totaling 350,000 — with a promise of more to come. An additional 100,000 was taken from the fund and divided among 10 community nonprofit groups to help victims. Summary:","completion":"There was a very sad shooting in a movie theater in Colorado where 12 people died and 58 got hurt. People from all over the country donated money to help the families of the victims, and the total amount reached 5 million. But the families are upset because they haven't seen that money yet. They want to know what happened to it and why it hasn't been given to them. The organization in charge of the money is trying to figure out the best way to divide it among the families. The families hope they will receive the money soon to help them during this difficult time."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Rick for the following movie plot: In 1937, London music critic and composer Roderick \\"Rick\\" Fitzgerald (Ray Milland) and his sister Pamela (Ruth Hussey) fall in love with Windward House, an abandoned seaside house, during a holiday on Cornwall's rocky coast. They purchase it for an unusually low price from Commander Beech (Donald Crisp).

Stella is deeply upset by the sale because of her attachment to the house, despite its being where her mother died. The commander has forbidden Stella to enter the house or to see Rick. However, she gains access to Windward House through Rick, who has become infatuated with her. The Fitzgeralds' initial enchantment with the house diminishes when they unlock an artist's studio where they feel an inexplicable chill. Just before dawn, Rick hears the eerie sobs of an unseen woman, a phenomenon that Pamela investigates whilst awaiting her brother's return with their Irish housekeeper, Lizzie Flynn (Barbara Everest). The superstitious Lizzie notices a peculiar draft on the stairs. Rick and Pamela must face the obvious: Windward House is haunted. When Stella comes to Windward for dinner, she senses a spirit. Rather than fearing it, she associates the calming presence with her mother. Also, the strong scent of mimosa is that of her mother's favorite perfume. Suddenly she dashes out towards the very cliff from which her mother Mary fell to her death seventeen years earlier. Rick catches her just before she reaches the edge. Stella professes to have no recollection of the near-fatal incident. The Fitzgeralds and the town physician, Dr. Scott (Alan Napier), investigate. They learn that Stella's father, a painter, had had an affair with his model, a Spanish gypsy named Carmel.

The explosion happened near the bullring, where animal rights activists were preparing to hold a march. Bogota authorities said at least 40 people were injured, including 28 men and 12 women. Many are believed to be officers deployed ahead of the protest. It is unclear if the blast was linked to the protests, which began after the city reinstated bullfighting this year. Gareth Lewis, a British traveller staying in a hostel in La Macarena, on the corner where the explosion took place, told the BBC: \\"I was sitting in my room in the hostel, the windows just came in, there was glass everywhere. \\"Quite a few police have been hurt, they're now sweeping up. They used tear gas and there's quite a bit of blood.\\" Mr Lewis, who has been advised to stay inside the hostel by officers, said he had witnessed protests \\"all week\\" and that \\"armed police have been everywhere\\". The protests began after a decision by the constitutional court, which ruled bullfighting was part of the country's heritage and therefore could be reinstated. The move angered animal rights activists, who have clashed with police during protests against the reopening. In January, demonstrators were arrested and officers fired tear gas to control groups physically attacking spectators. But the explosion was not necessarily linked to the protests. Jorge Restrepo, director of Colombia's Conflict Analysis Resource Center (Cerac), said the attack may have been targeting the police, taking advantage of the fact that many officers were gathered together due to the bullfight. He told the BBC it was possibly linked to a series of attacks against security forces in the capital that have taken place in recent months. Meanwhile, Bogota mayor Enrique Penalosa, who attended the scene, has announced he was convening a security council meeting for Sunday afternoon. \\"The terrorists won't intimidate us,\\" Mr Penalosa said on Twitter. \\"We are going to do all that's necessary to capture them.\\" He earlier tweeted one police officer had been killed, but has since removed the post. It has now been reported there were no fatalities. Two of the injured were said to be in a serious condition.

She continued to knock, even though there had as yet been no answer, because the note card tacked to the right of the door indicated that these indeed were Prof. Turgy K. Sigger's office hours. She could see the light under the door and thought she had heard a groan. Just before she decided to give up, slow feet approached from the opposite side, then silence; with a dramatic turn of the knob, the door swung open. \\"Was this trip really necessary?\\" asked Prof. Sigger, blinking and brushing his oily, graying hair back into place. \\"These are your office hours,\\" Alona replied. She nervously smiled, feeling the corners of her mouth twitch. Somewhere in the darkened hall, a janitor coughed. \\"All right,\\" conceded Prof. Sigger. \\"Come in.\\" The carpet was smothered by leaning towers of textbooks. Papers lined the left side of the desk, above which was a small note card which read \\"To Be Graded.\\" On the right side, the oak finish gleamed of the mid-morning light piercing the Venetian blinds. \\"You've come about your final project,\\" Prof. Sigger stated. \\"It's only mid-term,\\" Alona reminded him. \\"Oh yes, yes,\\" continued Prof. Sigger, without conscious embarrassment. \\"Mid-term grade. I think I have it here. Somewhere.\\" His hands disappeared into the left side of his desk. \\"You told the class that we would get a C if we maintained that Coca-Cola isn't a crypto-fascist conspiracy.\\" \\"Oh yes,\\" said Prof. Sigger. \\"We were discussing social issues, as I remember. I was quoting Marx and some little idiot brought up Rush Limbaugh.\\" \\"That was me,\\" Alona muttered. Question: Why did Prof. Sigger agree to see Alona despite feeling disturbed? Answer: A:","completion":"Prof. Sigger agreed to see Alona despite feeling disturbed because it was during his designated office hours, and he was obligated to meet with students who required his assistance or had concerns to discuss. The note card next to the door indicated that this was the appropriate time for students like Alona to seek help from Prof. Sigger. Furthermore, Alona was persistent in her knocking, leading Prof. Sigger to eventually respond to her request for a meeting. In fulfilling his role as a professor, Prof. Sigger recognized the importance of being available for students during his office hours, even if he might have been initially reluctant or disturbed. It displays his professional commitment to address their academic needs and concerns, fostering an environment where students can openly communicate and seek guidance. Alona's persistence suggests that she had important matters to discuss with Prof. Sigger, and that might have contributed to his decision to meet with her despite his initial reluctance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Last week, I joined the board of a new organization to oppose marijuana legalization: Smart Approaches to Marijuana. The group is headed by former U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy and includes Kevin Sabet, a veteran of the Office of National Drug Control Policy under President Obama. The new group rejects the \\"war on drugs\\" model. It agrees that we don't want to lock people up for casual marijuana use -- or even stigmatize them with an arrest record. But what we do want to do is send a clear message: Marijuana use is a bad choice. There are many excellent reasons to avoid marijuana. Marijuana use damages brain development in young people. Heavy users become socially isolated and perform worse in school and at work. Marijuana smoke harms the lungs. A growing body of evidence suggests that marijuana can trigger psychotic symptoms that otherwise would have remained latent. It's possible to imagine a marijuana rule that tries to respond precisely to such risk factors as happen to be known by the current state of science. Such a rule might say: \\"You shouldn't use marijuana until you are over 25, or after your brain has ceased to develop, whichever comes first. You shouldn't use marijuana if you are predisposed to certain mental illnesses (most of which we can't yet diagnose in advance). Be aware that about one-sixth of users will become chronically dependent on marijuana, and as a result will suffer a serious degradation of life outcomes. As yet, we have no sure idea at what dosage marijuana will impair your ability to drive safely, or how long the impairment will last. Be as careful as you can, within the limits of our present knowledge!\\" Yet as a parent of three, two exiting adolescence and one entering, I've found that the argument that makes the biggest impression is: \\"Marijuana is illegal. Stay away.\\" I think many other parents have found the same thing. When we write social rules, we always need to consider: Who are we writing rules for? Some people can cope with complexity. Others need clarity. Some people will snap back from an early mistake. Others will never recover. \\"Just say no\\" is an easy rule to follow. \\"It depends on individual risk factors, many of them unknowable in advance\\" -- that rule is not so easy. Richard Branson: War on drugs a trillion-dollar failure. Over the past three decades, and in area after area of social life, Americans have replaced simple rules that anybody can follow with complex rules that baffle large numbers of people. Consider, for example, the home mortgage. Once the mortgage was a very simple product. Put 20% down, then sign up for a fixed schedule of payments over the next 30 years. In the space of a single generation, these 30-year fixed-rate amortizing mortgages turned what had been a nation of renters into a nation of homeowners. For more sophisticated buyers, however, the standard mortgage was a big nuisance. For them, bankers developed more flexible products: no money down, no documentation, interest-only, adjustable rate. These products met genuine needs. But as they diffused down-market, they became traps for people who did not understand the risks they were accepting. Consider how we finance higher education. Once, state governments subsidized their universities to offer a low tuition fee to all comers. Fee increases at private universities were constrained by the lower fees at the public institutions: Duke can raise its price only so high above the University of North Carolina. The universities soon realized, however, that by setting their tuition fees low, they were forgoing revenues that might be collected from the most affluent students. Universities rapidly raised their tuition fees, then offered discounts and aid to students in need. Kevin Sabet: Legalize Pot? No, reform laws. But while anybody could understand a 500 per semester tuition bill, the new system of rebates confuses the very people who most need help. A few days before Christmas, Jason DeParle of The New York Times reported a depressing example of the toll modern financial aid exacts upon students from less sophisticated backgrounds. He told the story of three bright girls from poor families who had recently tried -- and failed -- to gain college degrees. One of them was admitted to Emory, a prestigious school with a full-ticket price of 50,000, but one that grants very generous financial aid -- if the student can figure out how to make the financial aid work for her. The trouble was that students who most need aid are often precisely those who have nobody around them who has ever successfully navigated a complicated bureaucratic institution like a university financial aid office. \\"Though Emory sent weekly e-mails -- 17 of them, along with an invitation to a program for minority students -- they went to a school account she had not learned to check,\\" DeParle wrote. \\"Angelica reported that her mother made 35,000 a year and paid about half of that in rent. With her housing costs so high, Emory assumed the family had extra money and assigned ... an income of 51,000. ... (Angelica) discovered what had happened only recently.\\" Unable to cope with the school's e-mail system or to decrypt its rules for imputing family income, Angelica finally dropped out of Emory, burdened by 61,000 in student debt. In 1943, Vice President Henry Wallace published a book celebrating the coming \\"century of the common man.\\" That century did not last very long. We have transitioned instead into the era of the clever man and clever woman. We have revised our institutions, our programs, our rules in ways that offer profitable new chances to those with cultural know-how -- and that inflict disastrous consequences on those who are overwhelmed by a world of ever-more-abundant and ever-more-risky choices. Opinion: The end of the war on marijuana. We're not going to uninvent the no-money-down loan. Universities that receive applications from all over the planet cannot finance themselves like an old-fashioned state land-grant college. But we need to recognize that modern life is becoming steadily more dangerous for people prone to make bad choices. At a time when they need more help than ever to climb the ladder, marijuana legalization kicks them back down the ladder. The goal of public policy should not be to punish vulnerable kids for making life-wrecking mistakes. The goal of public policy should be to protect (to the extent we can) the vulnerable from making life-wrecking mistakes in the first place. There's a trade-off, yes, and it takes the form of denying less vulnerable people easy access to a pleasure they believe they can safely use. But they are likely deluding themselves about how well they are managing their drug use. And even if they are not deluded -- if they really are so capable and effective -- then surely they can see that society has already been massively re-engineered for their benefit already. Surely, enough is enough? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"A group called Smart Approaches to Marijuana is against making marijuana legal. They think it's a bad choice because it can cause problems for young people's brains, make people feel lonely, not do well in school and work, and sometimes cause illness. Even though some grown-ups might be able to use marijuana without big problems, the group believes it's best to protect everyone, especially kids, from making bad choices that may cause big problems in their lives. That's why they want to tell people, especially kids, that using marijuana is not a good idea."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Although Jake and Carrie take an immediate liking to each other, there is instant animosity between Carrie and Amy, mainly because Amy also likes Jake.

Florence Cathcart (Rebecca Hall) is a published author on supernatural hoaxes who works with the police to expose charlatans and debunk supernatural phenomena. It's revealed she lost her lover in the war, and every ghost \\"hunt\\" is an attempt to see if it's possible to bring him back. Every time she proves a hoax, the truth and pain hit her again. She receives a visit from Robert Mallory (Dominic West), a teacher from a boys boarding school in Cumbria. Robert explains to her that there have been sightings of the ghost of a child at the school, and that it may have been the cause of the recent death of a pupil there. Robert asks Florence for help to figure out why the supernatural events occur. Although Florence originally refuses, Robert's concern for the orphaned kids at the school causes her to change her mind since she is an orphan herself. Florence travels to the school, which was a stately home until 20 years earlier, to investigate the sightings and the recent death. She is welcomed by Maud (Imelda Staunton), the school's housekeeper and matron, who tells Florence that she has read her books and feels like she knows her. After investigation, the ghostly sightings are thought to be a prank led by two boys who have been bullying a lonely, redheaded boy into doing what they want for their approval.

The social problems mentioned in that answer, such as long-term unemployment, poverty, and homelessness, might be correlated with schizophrenia, but they are not diagnostic criteria for the condition."},{"prompt":"I heard that Skylar's sister was due to have an operation and needed a babysitter.

When one reflects on pleasant experiences, the mind is often swept up in those joyful moments which creates a soothing and calming effect on the body and mind. This is due to the production of endorphins, the body's natural mood boosters, which are triggered by pleasant thoughts.

Run a small, unobtrusive hose up the center of the fountain and into the water bowl. To do this, you can use a black 1/4 inch hose and drill 1/4-inch holes to route the hose. Make sure not to damage the fountain while drilling the holes, and take extra caution if the fountain materials are fragile. 3. Connect the hose to a nearby water source or an automatic timer valve that regulates the water flow into the fountain. To conceal the hose outside the fountain, you can bury it underground or cover it with decorative elements such as rocks or gravel. 4. Choose a water control system that best suits your needs. For example, you may consider using a float valve, which will maintain a constant water level, or an electronic control system that is programmable and can detect specific times and schedules for turning on and off the water supply. 5. Install the float valve or electronic control system according to the manufacturer's instructions, taking care to secure the appropriate connectors, cables, or fittings required for installation and operation. Be sure to select a location where the system will be protected from the elements as well as remain accessible for any maintenance or adjustments. 6. Test the automatic fill system by turning on the water supply and letting the fountain fill up. Observe the water level and adjust the float valve or electronic control system accordingly to maintain the desired water level. Ensure that the hose provides a steady flow of water and does not overflow the water bowl. 7. Once the system is functioning properly, replace the fountain components or decorations that were removed during the installation process. Make sure the pump is properly submerged under the water and that the hose does not impede the flow of water through the fountain's features. 8. Plug in the fountain's pump and turn it on to ensure that everything is working efficiently. Monitor the fill system over the next few days, making any necessary adjustments to the water level or water flow rate. 9. Maintain your automatic fill system by periodically checking for leaks, clogs, or any other issues that could disrupt the system's functionality. Clean the fountain and fill system components as needed to ensure optimal performance. By following these steps and considerations, you can easily create a reliable and efficient automatic fill system for your decorative garden fountain, saving you time and effort in maintaining the perfect water level. Remember to monitor and maintain the system regularly to ensure a long-lasting, hassle-free experience for you and a beautiful focal point for your garden."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: The Playlist: Bob Dylan’s New Song and Merle Haggard’s Final Recording Every Friday, The New York Times pop critics will weigh in on the week’s most notable new songs and videos — and anything else that strikes them as intriguing — in a new version of the Playlist column. You can listen to this playlist on Spotify here. Like the new format? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com. When Bob Dylan released an album last year of standards associated with Frank Sinatra, “Shadows in the Night,” it was an intriguing sidebar to his own enormous catalog of songs disrupting Tin Pan Alley’s principles: a ragged voice and a rootsy band in the ruins of long-gone youth and pop’s elegant past. A second standards album, the new “Fallen Angels,” just repeats the gesture with diminishing returns. But “Melancholy Mood,” which was the B-side of Sinatra’s debut single with Harry James and his Orchestra in 1939, executes the gesture convincingly. Over the gently swinging band — which, like James, starts with a full instrumental verse — Mr. Dylan’s voice certainly has the mileage and tatters to put across sentiments like, “All I can see is grief and gloom/Till the crack of doom.” JON PARELES Merle Haggard’s final recording, made in his home studio on Feb. 9 — he died on April 6 from complications of pneumonia — is a Jimmie Rodgers-style blues. This was one of Mr. Haggard’s favorite forms, a tight box that nevertheless encouraged freedom: A 12-bar structure that can accommodate changeable phrase lengths and unconventional patterns of lyric repetition. His website says the song is about “memories of leaving Bakersfield in the late ’70s” — Bakersfield, Calif., where he grew up. Like many Haggard songs, it’s about disappointment with the way things are going: The night life is gone, and the Kern River has dried up. “Somebody stole the water,” he sings in a clear but shaky version of his voice; “another politician lied.” It contains what he did best, condensed images and expressions of getting in motion and leaving: “breakfast in the sky,” “donut on a paper,” “kiss an old boxcar goodbye.” Available from merlehaggard.com. BEN RATLIFF The least compelling but most revealing videos captured by fans from the May 7 AC/DC show in Lisbon — the first with Axl Rose serving as frontman — are the ones shot from up close, with the camera fixed mercilessly on Mr. Rose, still hobbled by a broken left foot. In them, Mr. Rose (replacing Brian Johnson, who is suffering from severe hearing loss), is seated, and while Angus Young moves around him doing his signature bent-over kick-shuffle, Mr. Rose howls to the best of his abilities, which, it turns out, are in strong shape. He yelps. He shrieks. He holds notes for ostentatious stretches. The vocal flamboyance Mr. Rose needs in Guns N’ Roses is different from the more direct hollering he does here, but it’s prepared him well. The amateur clips — of songs like “Hell Ain’t a Bad Place to Be,” “Highway to Hell,” “Shot Down in Flames” — tend to underscore the directness of his voice and underdeliver the power of the rest of the band, which is a shame, because they’re rather effective as a unit. By “Whole Lotta Rosie,” Mr. Rose is up and about, and the unit looks and sounds like it’s in fifth gear. But it’s less fun when you can’t see the lightning bolt on the bottom of his cast. JON CARAMANICA The video clip for Grimes’s “California” isn’t just her latest self-directed costume extravaganza. It’s also an entirely different production of the song — farewell to new wave guitars and synthesizers, hello to keyboard arpeggios and a new, more introspective transparency, at least at first. The song, from her 2015 album “Art Angels,” is both a plaint and a taunt: to recording companies courting her, to fans hating any change, to her own ambivalent pop ambitions. “I get carried away/commodifying all the pain,” she sings. In the video, she dances around as, among other things, a cowgirl singer in red, white and blue; a glittery mermaid; and a figure in gauzy red who’s very overdressed on a multicolored basketball court. But most of the time she’s a woman in an art-girl beret, tending (and dancing through) an artist’s studio full of statuary, unfinished or unsold: “When you get bored of me I’ll be back on the shelf,” she sings. J.P. Guitar distortion wells up immediately in “All for One,” the first new music in 21 years from the Stone Roses, as the band gears up for its latest reunion tour, which comes to Madison Square Garden on June 30. The song barely updates the band’s 1980s “Madchester” sound, which drew on Merseybeat, psychedelia, the post-punk noisiness of the Jesus and Mary Chain and the dance-music beats of the wild 1980s club scene in Manchester, England. “All for One” leans psychedelic, not funky, with a seesawing guitar riff that soon spins off multiple overdubbed guitars, along with a foot-stomping shuffle beat and lots of 1960s-style effects on Ian Brown’s voice as well as the guitars and drums. The last chorus becomes an overdubbed, very-late-60s chorale before a final buzzy guitar note. It’s a band emulating its younger self emulating music from decades earlier. Meanwhile, in the current political climate, the jolly lyrics strike a jarring isolationist note: “All for one, one for all/If we all join hands, we’ll make a wall.” J.P. Pink hasn’t just been at home practicing her trapeze act for the last two years, since the end of her most recent arena tour. Or has she? “You just gonna hang around all day?” her husband, Carey Hart, says in the opening moments of her new video, for “Just Like Fire.” The joke is that she is literally hanging, by a harness, as she executes a series of acrobatic twirls. She made “Just Like Fire” for the soundtrack to “Alice Through the Looking Glass,” a fact that the rest of the video makes clear: There’s a mirror-portal, and a giant chessboard, and a Mad Hatter tea party. (Pink’s daughter, Willow Sage, stands in for Alice.) It’s all a nice distraction from the fact that the song — produced by Max Martin, Shellback and Oscar Holter — brings nothing new to Pink’s musical formula. The beat says hip-hop, the strummy guitar says folk-pop and the chorus says “hot adult contemporary.” It’s a sturdy, on-brand effort, and given how long it has been since Pink released a proper new single, that’s wonder enough for now. NATE CHINEN Two items in this week’s news involved the maintenance of two major repositories of folk music and culture, in the widest sense of the word “folk.” Last Tuesday Ben Sisario reported on Smithsonian Folkways’ acquisition of Arhoolie Records, Chris Strachwitz’s great label for traditional blues, gospel, and Mexican music. (More information at arhoolie.com.) Also this week, Maximum Rocknroll, based in San Francisco, the volunteer-only punk zine published monthly since 1977, began a successful crowdfunding campaign to raise money for the digitization of its archive and preservation of its physical holdings. That would include most of the records it’s reviewed or featured on its weekly radio show, which would be pretty much every punk single you can imagine. “With your support,” reads Maximum Rocknroll’s indiegogo project page, “we can make our record collection — the largest of its kind in the entire world — accessible to anyone with an Internet connection.” (More information at maximumrocknroll.com.) BEN RATLIFF Some genres go through constant cycles of rebirth, but New York hip-hop seems to be in a perpetual state of death, or at least a kind of cryogenic purgatory. When the Terror Squad was at its peak, circa 2004, it was part of the last wave of hardcore mainstream traditionalists. After a decade in the weeds, that sound has been having a comeback — a last gasp? — thanks to rappers like Dave East of Harlem. Here, he bridges the generation gap by adding a verse to “All the Way Up,” the unexpected hit collaboration by the old Terror Squad crewmates Fat Joe and Remy Ma. Over the woozy horn loop by producer Edsclusive, he remembers a time when Terror Squad was on top, and he was preoccupied elsewhere: “When Remy was Terror Squadding with Pun and them/We was in the back room rumbling, no one coming in/Homie kinda arrogant, bet this 40’ll humble him.” J.C. “Be kind to your bad self,” urges Sadie Dupuis on “Death Note,” a growly, propulsive affirmation by Speedy Ortiz, the ambitious but low-to-the-ground indie-rock band. The track was named after a Japanese manga and anime series, whose conceit involves a notebook with lethal magical powers. Ms. Dupuis twists this into a metaphor for the therapeutic act of writing in the face of depression: “These are all love letters to me,” she sings. And while the sound is thicker and heavier here than on much of “Foil Deer,” Speedy Ortiz’s standout 2015 album, it’s clearly of a piece; it will appear on “Foiled Again,” a four-song digital EP, on June 3. N.C. Joe Temperley, the gallant Scottish baritone saxophonist, died this week at the age of 86. A veteran of some of the great big bands of the postwar era, he will be remembered for his stint in the late-period Duke Ellington Orchestra — and a subsequent role with the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, in which he was a founding member. Last spring that band performed a concert in honor of Mr. Temperley, featuring glowing testimonials, select Ellingtonia, and a five-part suite by Wynton Marsalis, “Joe’s Concerto.” The full concert was broadcast by the NPR program Jazz Night in America, and it now stands as a noble tribute, and a good distillation of everything that made Mr. Temperley special. Be sure not to miss his tender delivery of “The Single Petal of a Rose,” which ends the concert in all due finery. N.C. Avian polyphony, a true conference of the birds at first light. Some vamp, some improvise. Don’t miss the rooster at 4:06. (Listen here.) J.P.","completion":"This article talks about lots of different music news, so let's look at each bit: 1.

Given the question: Information: - Shrubland, scrubland, scrub or brush is a plant community characterised by vegetation dominated by shrubs, often also including grasses, herbs, and geophytes. Shrubland may either occur naturally or be the result of human activity. It may be the mature vegetation type in a particular region and remain stable over time, or a transitional community that occurs temporarily as the result of a disturbance, such as fire. A stable state may be maintained by regular natural disturbance such as fire or browsing. Shrubland may be unsuitable for human habitation because of the danger of fire. The term \\"shrubland\\" was first coined in 1903. - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - A habitat is an ecological or environmental area that is inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population. - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. - The Amazon basin is the part of South America drained by the Amazon River and its tributaries. The Amazon drainage basin covers an area of about , or roughly 40 percent of the South American continent. It is located in the countries of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela. - Anthony 's nightjar ( Nyctidromus anthonyi ) , also known as the scrub nightjar , is a species of nightjar in the Caprimulgidae family . It is found in western Ecuador and north - western Peru . Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry shrubland . - Caprimulgus is a large and very widespread genus of nightjars, medium-sized nocturnal birds with long pointed wings, short legs and short bills. \\"Caprimulgus\\" is derived from the Latin \\"capra\\", \\"nanny goat\\", and \\"mulgere\\", \\"to milk\\", referring to an old myth that nightjars suck milk from goats. The common name \\"nightjar\\", first recorded in 1630, refers to the nocturnal habits of the bird, the second part of the name deriving from the distinctive churring song. - A nighthawk is a nocturnal bird of the subfamily Chordeilinae, within the nightjar family, Caprimulgidae. The term \\"nighthawk\\", first recorded in the King James Version of 1611, was originally a local name in England for the European nightjar. Its use in the Americas refers to members of the genus \\"Chordeiles\\" and related genera was first recorded in 1778. - Bolivia (; ), officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia, is a landlocked country located in western-central South America. It is bordered to the north and east by Brazil, to the southeast by Paraguay, to the south by Argentina, to the southwest by Chile, and to the northwest by Peru. One-third of the country is the Andean mountain range, with one of its largest cities and principal economic centers, El Alto, located on the Altiplano. Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries (the other is Paraguay) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Bolivia is the largest landlocked country in the Americas. - Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fernández, Salas y Gómez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island in Oceania. Chile also claims about of Antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty. - Crepuscular animals are those that are active primarily during twilight (i.e., the period immediately after dawn and that immediately before dusk). It is thus to be distinguished from diurnal and nocturnal behavior where an animal is active during the hours of daylight or the hours of darkness respectively. The term is not precise, however, as some crepuscular animals may also be active on a moonlit night or during an overcast day. The term matutinal is used for animals that are only active before dawn, and vespertine for those only active after sunset. - A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized woody plant. It is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height, usually under 6 m (20 ft) tall. Plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions. Small, low shrubs, generally less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of roses, are often termed subshrubs. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - A plant community (sometimes \\"phytocoenosis\\" or \\"phytocenosis\\") is a collection or association of plant species within a designated geographical unit, which forms a relatively uniform patch, distinguishable from neighboring patches of different vegetation types. The components of each plant community are influenced by soil type, topography, climate and human disturbance. In many cases there are several soil types within a given phytocoenosis. - The number and type of plants, how leafy they are, and how healthy they are. In places where foliage is dense and plants are growing quickly, the index is high, represented in dark green. Regions where few plants grow have a low vegetation index, shown in tan. The index is based on measurements taken by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASAs Terra satellite. Areas where the satellite did not collect data are gray. - Peru , officially the Republic of Peru, is a country in western South America. It is bordered in the north by Ecuador and Colombia, in the east by Brazil, in the southeast by Bolivia, in the south by Chile, and in the west by the Pacific Ocean. Peru is an extremely biodiverse country with habitats ranging from the arid plains of the Pacific coastal region in the west to the peaks of the Andes mountains vertically extending from the north to the southeast of the country to the tropical Amazon Basin rainforest in the east with the Amazon river. - Nightjars are medium-sized nocturnal or crepuscular birds in the family Caprimulgidae, characterized by long wings, short legs and very short bills. They are sometimes called goatsuckers, due to the ancient folk tale that they sucked the milk from goats (the Latin for goatsucker is \\"Caprimulgus\\"). Some New World species are called nighthawks. Nightjars usually nest on the ground. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area.

This article: Kozelsk and Starobelsk were used mainly for military officers, while Ostashkov was used mainly for Polish Scouting, gendarmes, police officers, and prison officers. Some prisoners were members of other groups of Polish intelligentsia, such as priests, landowners, and law personnel. The approximate distribution of men throughout the camps was as follows: Kozelsk, 5000; Ostashkov, 6570; and Starobelsk, 4000. They totalled 15,570 men.According to a report from 19 November 1939, the NKVD had about 40,000 Polish POWs: 8,000-8,500 officers and warrant officers, 6,000-6,500 officers of police, and 25,000 soldiers and non-commissioned officers who were still being held as POWs. In December, a wave of arrests resulted in the imprisonment of additional Polish officers. Ivan Serov reported to Lavrentiy Beria on 3 December that \\"in all, 1,057 former officers of the Polish Army had been arrested\\". The 25,000 soldiers and non-commissioned officers were assigned to forced labor (road construction, heavy metallurgy).Once at the camps, from October 1939 to February 1940, the Poles were subjected to lengthy interrogations and constant political agitation by NKVD officers, such as Vasily Zarubin. The prisoners assumed they would be released soon, but the interviews were in effect a selection process to determine who would live and who would die. According to NKVD reports, if a prisoner could not be induced to adopt a pro-Soviet attitude, he was declared a \\"hardened and uncompromising enemy of Soviet authority\\".On 5 March 1940, pursuant to a note to Joseph Stalin from Beria, six members of the Soviet Politburo — Stalin, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Kliment Voroshilov, Anastas Mikoyan, and Mikhail Kalinin — signed an order to execute 25,700 Polish \\"nationalists and counterrevolutionaries\\" kept at camps and prisons in occupied western Ukraine and Belarus.

This begins with the grisly scene of a man shouting as he is dragged to the wheel to be broken. The scene ends with the gory aftermath: the bloodied body lying on the wheel. An artistic discussion occurs between Theophanes the Greek and Father Kirill. Theophanes asks him to become his assistant. Kirill says he will, if the master will come to the monastery and ask for him personally, in front of all the monks. To his bitter disappointment, he sends someone else, to ask for Andrei instead. Andrei agrees to go, but Danila refuses, when Andrei asks him to accompany him. Andrei is devastated. The next morning, he goes to Danilas cell and confesses, We have shared the same cell for years. I cant paint without you. I look with your eyes; I listen with your ears. Danila replies with tears in his eyes, You silly man, go with my blessing! Andrei kneels and kisses Danila's hand.

Yes; b). No; Answer:","completion":"Answer: b). No; The right answer to the question \\"name one kind of a protein that some viruses have inside their phospholipid envelope\\" cannot be \\"more abundant,\\" as \\"more abundant\\" is not a specific type of protein. The question is asking for a particular type of protein present in the phospholipid envelope of some viruses. Since some viruses have intrinsic proteins within their phospholipid envelope, the answer should be focused on a specific type of intrinsic protein that can be found in these viruses. Intrinsic proteins, also known as integral proteins, are proteins that are embedded within the lipid bilayer of the membrane. There are several types of intrinsic proteins, such as glycoproteins, ion channels, and receptor proteins, that play crucial roles in the viral life cycle. A better answer to this question might be: Matrix (M) protein: The M protein is an abundant and essential component of many enveloped viruses, including the influenza virus and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It serves as a crucial structural element in the virion by linking the lipid bilayer envelope to the underlying nucleocapsid core, which contains the viral genome.

The area includes urban and suburban development near the Rincon Mountains. East Tucson includes Saguaro National Park East. Tucson's \\"Restaurant Row\\" is also located on the east side, along with a significant corporate and financial presence. Restaurant Row is sandwiched by three of Tucson's storied Neighborhoods: Harold Bell Wright Estates, named after the famous author's ranch which occupied some of that area prior to the depression; the Tucson Country Club (the third to bear the name Tucson Country Club), and the Dorado Country Club. Tucson's largest office building is 5151 East Broadway in east Tucson, completed in 1975. The first phases of Williams Centre, a mixed-use, master-planned development on Broadway near Craycroft Road, were opened in 1987. Park Place, a recently renovated shopping center, is also located along Broadway (west of Wilmot Road). When was East Tucson developed?

News article: Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto of Temple City, the man recently named by Newsweek as the mysterious creator of bitcoin, has hired a law firm and issued a statement late Sunday night in what he says was an attempt to \\"clear my name.\\" The statement came in an email from Ethan D. Kirschner, a Los Angeles lawyer. \\"This firm has been retained by Dorian S. Nakamoto, the subject of the recent Newsweek cover story on Bitcoin,\\" Kirschner said in an email. \\"He has issued the attached prepared statement. No further comment will be made by Mr. Nakamoto or the firm.\\" In the statement, Nakamoto says: \\"I did not create, invent or otherwise work on Bitcoin. I unconditionally deny the Newsweek report.\\" According to Nakamoto, he heard the term bitcoin from his son only in February after he had been contacted by the reporter working on the Newsweek story. When that story was published in early March, Nakamoto, 64, found himself at the center of a media circus as well as a raging online debate about whether he could in fact be the programmer who had created the virtual currency that has become a billion-dollar global phenomenon. Part of the story pointed to the fact that Nakamoto of Temple City had programming skills. In the statement, Nakamoto says: \\"My background is in engineering. I also have the ability to program. My most recent job was as an electrical engineer troubleshooting air traffic control equipment for the FAA. I have no knowledge of nor have I ever worked on cryptography, peer to peer systems, or alternative currencies.\\" The Newsweek story also notes what appears to be a strange gap in his resume over the last decade, the time during which the bitcoin code was written and released. Nakamoto explains: \\"I have not been able to find steady work as an engineer or programmer for ten years. I have worked as a laborer, polltaker, and substitute teacher. I discontinued my internet service in 2013 due to severe financial distress. I am trying to recover from prostate surgery in October 2012 and a stroke I suffered in October of 2013. My prospects for gainful employment has been harmed because of Newsweek's article.\\" Nakamoto ends by asking to be left in peace: \\"Newsweek's false report has been the source of a great deal of confusion and stress for myself, my 93-year old mother, my siblings, and their families. I offer my sincerest thanks to those people in the United States and around the world who have offered me their support. I have retained legal counsel. This will be our last public statement on this matter. I ask that you now respect our privacy.\\" ALSO: Reddit users launch fundraiser to help Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto Is bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto living quietly in Temple City? Did the real Satoshi Nakamoto just say Newsweek has wrong guy? ||||| Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, who Newsweek claimed was “the” Satoshi Nakamoto credited with the creation of bitcoin, has now issued a statement through his lawyer Ethan Kirschner completely denying his involvement in creating the digital currency. “I did not create, invent, or otherwise work on Bitcoin. I unconditionally deny the Newsweek report,” Nakamoto said in the statement. The Newsweek story, which revealed details about Dorian’s life including what town he lived in, sparked something akin to a modern tech manhunt as reports raced to chase the older man down. To be fair, Dorian denied everything then, too, and then again. And now we have Dorian’s denial in written form as well. Reuters Blogger Felix Salmon first produced the statement, but, in this ongoing story of slippery bitcoin “facts,” we have also confirmed the text of the note directly with Kirschner. “We have no comment beyond confirming that we’ve been retained by Mr. Nakamoto and that it is his statement that was released,” he told TechCrunch in an emailed statement. The drama around Bitcoin’s creator fails to die, very much in line with the roller coaster ride the crypto-currency has been going through over past year. This latest chapter is a particularly frustrating one, centred as it is not only on an individual who is claiming no involvement, but one who was already in difficult times. Not only were there apparently no facts unveiled in the Newsweek story, but there has been quite a significant casualty resulting from it, in the form of an individual’s privacy. Dorian writes in the letter that he had never heard of the word “bitcoin” before February 2014, when he was contacted by a reporter. (He does not name Leah McGrath Goodman in his letter.) It was his son who first mentioned the word bitcoin to him, he writes. While the Newsweek story sets up Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto as a hidden-in-plain-sight mystery solved, Nakamoto’s letter paints a rather different picture of the person. Here, we have a smart, but also struggling, individual. Someone who is very much on the other spectrum of the tech boom that is so often the subject of public discourse — and of bitcoin in particular. Despite having a background in engineering, Nakamoto notes that he couldn’t find a programmer’s job for over a decade. “I’ve worked as a laborer, polltaker and a substitute teacher,” he added in the statement. He says he has never worked on cryptography, peer-to-peer systems, or alternative currencies. He also underscores some of the other problems he has had outside of this case of apparently very mistaken identity. They include several health issues and “severe financial distress.” You can imagine that this letter, coming with legal backing, is a precursor to further legal action and claims for damages, either publicly or behind the scenes. Despite Newsweek maintaining a solid stance on its story, the tech world has been skeptical of the evidence from the moment it came out. We’ve even seen one person, allegedly the “real” Satoshi Nakamoto (or at least posting on an account linked with the original manifesto), post on a message board to deny the Newsweek article. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A man named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto was said to be the creator of Bitcoin in a Newsweek article. But he says he did not create Bitcoin and he doesn't know how it works. He is an engineer, but hasn't had a job in that field for ten years.

The pair cater to a clientele who require fraudulent tourist photographs using fake backdrops, which can later be used as evidence that the person in the photograph was at any location in the country. One day, a married couple (Bud Jamison and Constance Bergen) turn up separately in need of alibi photographs: the man wants evidence of being on a Maine moose hunt while the woman needs photographic proof of being in Washington, D.C. The photographers, unaware that the man and woman are married, decide to play matchmaker with the pair. By coincidence, the man and woman have rooms opposite each other in the same hotel.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"The relationship between the first and second sentences raises some interesting considerations about the potential veracity and implications of each statement. However, before delving into the connections between the statements, it is essential to examine each sentence individually. 1. Sentence 1: \\"I was thrown by the question.\\" This statement communicates a feeling of being disoriented, taken aback, or momentarily confused by a question that was asked. The underlying reason for such a reaction might stem from the unexpected nature of the question, a lack of preparedness, or simply the surprising or novel content of the inquiry. Overall, the speaker suggests that they were unsettled or caught off guard, making it difficult for them at that moment to provide a coherent or thoughtful response. 2. Sentence 2: \\"I was surprised to be asked that.\\" The second statement similarly expresses the speaker's response to a question. In this case, the focus is on the feeling of surprise resulting from the experience of being asked a particular question. This implies that the inquiry was unanticipated or perhaps seemed irrelevant, intrusive, or otherwise out of place. The emphasis here is on the emotional reaction (surprise), and how it reflects the speaker's thoughts about why the question was asked or the context in which it occurred. Now, let's consider the question: if the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? On the surface, both sentences appear to describe a similar emotional state or reaction to a question. However, they differ in the specific emotional responses: the first sentence focuses on being \\"thrown,\\" whereas the second sentence highlights feeling \\"surprised.\\" It is possible for both emotions to be experienced simultaneously, as surprise can often lead to disorientation or confusion, as in being thrown off balance. In that sense, if the first sentence is true, it could suggest that the second sentence is also true, because the speaker may have experienced a chain reaction of emotions that began with surprise. However, it's important to note that the emotions or reactions described in the two sentences are not precisely identical, nor are they entirely dependent on each other. It is conceivable that one might feel thrown by a question without necessarily feeling surprised, or vice versa. In conclusion, it is plausible that if the first sentence is true, the second sentence might also be true, as the two emotional reactions might be experienced concurrently or in succession. However, given the nuanced differences between being \\"thrown\\" and feeling \\"surprised,\\" it is not absolutely necessary for the truth of the second sentence to follow automatically from the truth of the first sentence. The relationship between the two sentences depends on the particular context of the situation and the specific emotional reactions and thought processes of the speaker, which may ultimately determine the veracity of both statements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

They don't know what to do when it doesn't work. I think there is huge potential, so I have designed some for them. The ability to connect to friends, who remember the same movies, news and music, is really important, especially as people get older. They end up in retirement homes and they aren't always close to their friends. Allowing the network to help them connect with friends and family members is a really powerful thing. My wife likes using the Internet, although it took me years to get her to use e-mail. She was born with normal hearing, but lost it when she was three years old. She was totally deaf for many years until 53 when she got ear implants .They work really well. That is a big change for her. Before then, her friends couldn't call her on the phone, so they insisted that she use e-mails to communicate with them. The younger people don't even think of this as technology. It's just there, and they use it .There's been a very interesting change in communication styles between the old and the young .A woman named Sharryturkle wrote about this phenomenon .There are some kids who are now in their teens and are tending not to make phone calls.

To strengthen the state machine,the British bourgeosie have let it come into being and exist in one form or another since the 17th century. P.S.Tregidgo once said,\\"The more parties there are,the less likely it is that any one of them will be strong enough in Parliament to control all the others; but when there are only two,one of them is sure to have a majority of seats. This helps to ensure a strong and stable government.\\" This explains why the British have the twoparty system. The division into two parties grew out the establishment of a Protestant Church of England in the 16th century. Because of a purely religious difference of opinion,the Puritans were separated from the broad body of the Anglican Church. The non Puritan Anglicans were on the side of the King and Church,whose supporters were called by their opponents \\"Tories\\".The Puritans were for Parliament and trade,whose supporters are called by the \\"Tories\\" \\"Whigs\\".The Tories and the Whigs were in power by turns for a long time.

Since then,the Liberals and the Conservatives were in office by turns until 1922.They have some different opinions,but were both controlled by the rich.

Question: How do Hunter and Corlie escape? Movie title: Warlords of the 21st Century Movie plot: All remaining reserves of petroleum have finally run out; forcing people to ration the few remaining containers of gasoline left on the earth against mercenaries and warlords. Straker and his men (accompanied by his daughter Corlie - played by Annie McEnroe) find a vast supply of diesel fuel in a compound once thought to be radioactive. When Corlie refuses to execute the previous owners, she runs away from base camp. Hunter (Michael Beck), on his amazing (possibly ex-future-military) motorcycle, rescues the girl and takes her to his farm. After keeping her on the farm on a temporary basis, Hunter sends her off to live in a walled city (known in-film as Clearwater Farm) governed by a strict old-fashioned democracy (similar to the Quakers) where she is quickly accepted by the community. However, she is soon discovered by the mercenaries commanded by her father, Colonel Straker (James Wainwright), who moves to attack the Clearwater community. In the chaos that ensues, Corlie manages to escape back to Hunter's remote hideout. Straker terrorises the residents of Clearwater, taking their weapons, medicines, and other supplies and handing the women over to his men. Within a short time, one of the residents of Clearwater betrays the Clearwater mechanic/fabricator, Rusty, who knows the secret location of Hunter's hideout. Straker &amp; Co. use torture to get the information out of Rusty, then move in to attack Hunter's base and recapture Corlie. Hunter and Corlie escape on his bike, Straker, in a minor rage, plows through Hunter's place with the truck. Hunter takes Corlie back to the Clearwater people and asks Rusty to build him an armored car to attack Straker's \\"battle truck\\". While Rusty and Hunter and a few others are thus occupied, the traitor who betrayed Corlie before knocks her out, puts her in a wagon and heads out to deliver her back to Straker.

Throughout the story, Hunter rescues Corlie using this high-speed vehicle and they manage to stay one step ahead of Colonel Straker and his mercenaries. The first escape occurs when Hunter rescues Corlie after she refuses to execute the previous owners of the diesel fuel supply and runs away from Straker's base camp. Hunter takes her to his farm before sending her to live in the Clearwater walled city, where the Clearwater community accepts her. Their second escape happens when Corlie is discovered by the mercenaries and Colonel Straker, who launches an attack on Clearwater. Amidst the chaos, Corlie manages to escape back to Hunter's remote hideout. The final escape occurs when Straker's men locate Hunter's hideout and attempt to recapture Corlie. Once more, Hunter and Corlie flee on his motorcycle, outrunning Straker and his mercenaries. Hunter then enlists the help of his ally Rusty to build an armored car for a counterattack against Straker's battle truck.

As the stewardess walked by our seats near the end of the flight, I looked at her and said, \\"Thank you and I hope you have a great night.\\" She stopped, bent down, looked at me and said, \\"Excuse me.\\" I repeated my words and she smiled in a rather funny way, almost as if I had asked her a question that she did not know how to answer. After a few moments she returned to our seats. \\"I can tell you work with the public,\\" she said. \\"Why do you think so?\\" I asked. She answered very quietly, \\"Because you are the only passenger here to say something nice to me tonight and I really appreciate your kindness.\\" The sense of belonging to the elite group of people in first class disappeared as we heard her words. Our first class seats offered us more than a comfortable ride. We were reminded that without kindness, we would be flying in no class.

Article: One day in 1924, five men who were camping in the Cascade Mountains saw a group of huge apelike creatures coming out of the woods. They hurried back to their wooden house and locked themselves inside. While they were in, the creatures threw rocks against the house. Several hours later these strange hairy giants went back into the woods. After the men returned to the town and told the people about their adventure, _ . These were the people who remembered hearing tales about footprints of an animal that walked like a human being. The five men, however, were not the first to have seen these creatures called Bigfoot. Long before their experience, the local Native Americans were certain that a group of apelike animals had been living in the _ mountain for centuries. In 1958, some workers, who were building a road through the jungles of Northern California, often found huge footprints in the earth around their camp. Then in 1967, Roger Patterson, a man who was interested in finding Bigfoot, went into the same jungles with a friend. While riding, they were suddenly thrown off from their horses. Patterson saw a tall apelike animal standing not far away. He managed to take photos of the hairy creature before it disappeared in the jungles. When Patterson's photos were shown to the public, not many people believed his story. Richard Brown, an experienced hunter, discovered a similar creature. He saw the animal clearly through the telescopic lens of his rifle . He said the creature looked more like a human being than an animal. Later many other people also found deep footprints in the same area. In spite of regular reports of sightings and footprints, most experts still do not believe that Bigfoot really exists .

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Alejandro Jodorowsky Prullansky (Spanish: [ale'xandro xodo'rofski]; born 17 February 1929) is a Chilean-French filmmaker. Active since 1948, in seventy years of his artistic career Jodorowsky has experienced it in almost all creative forms: writer (in his five facets: novelist, storyteller, poet, playwright and essayist), film director and producer, actor of cinema and theatre, playwright, theatre director, screenwriter, film editor, comics writer, musician, soundtrack composer, philosopher, puppeteer, mime, psychologist and psychoanalyst, draughtsman, painter, eventually sculptor and spiritual guru. Best known for his avant-garde films, he has been \\"venerated by cult cinema enthusiasts\\" for his work which \\"is filled with violently surreal images and a hybrid blend of mysticism and religious provocation\\". Born to Jewish-Ukrainian parents in Chile, Jodorowsky experienced an unhappy and alienated childhood, and so immersed himself in reading and writing poetry. Context: Jodorowsky spent almost a decade reconstructing the original form of the Tarot de Marseille. From this work he moved into more therapeutic work in three areas: psychomagic, psychogenealogy and initiatic massage. Psychomagic aims to heal psychological wounds suffered in life. This therapy is based on the belief that the performance of certain acts can directly act upon the unconscious mind, releasing it from a series of traumas, some of which practitioners of the therapy believe are passed down from generation to generation. Psychogenealogy includes the studying of the patient's personality and family tree in order to best address their specific sources. It is similar, in its phenomenological approach to genealogy, to the Constellations pioneered by Bert Hellinger. Jodorowsky has several books on his therapeutic methods, including Psicomagia: La trampa sagrada (Psychomagic: The Sacred Trap) and his autobiography, La danza de la realidad (The Dance of Reality), which he was filming as a feature-length film in March 2012. To date he has published more than 23 novels and philosophical treatises, along with dozens of articles and interviews. His books are widely read in Spanish and French, but are for the most part unknown to English-speaking audiences. Throughout his career, Jodorowsky has gained a reputation as a philosopher and scholar who presents the teachings of religion, psychology, and spiritual masters, by molding them into imaginative endeavors. All of his enterprises integrate an artistic approach. Currently, Jodorowsky dedicates much of his time to lecturing about his work. For a quarter of a century, Jodorowsky held classes and lectures for free, in cafes and universities all over the city of Paris. Typically, such courses or talks would begin on Wednesday evenings as tarot divination lessons, and would culminate in an hour long conference, also free, where at times hundreds of attendees would be treated to live demonstrations of a psychological \\"arbre genealogique\\" (\\"tree of genealogy\\") involving volunteers from the audience. In these conferences, Jodorowsky would pave the way to building a strong base of students of his philosophy, which deals with understanding the unconscious as the \\"over-self\\", composed of many generations of family relatives, living or deceased, acting on the psyche, well into adult lives, and causing compulsions. Of all his work, Jodorowsky considers these activities to be the most important of his life. Though such activities only take place in the insular world of Parisian cafes, he has devoted thousands of hours of his life to teaching and helping people \\"become more conscious,\\" as he puts it. Since 2011 these talks have dwindled to once a month and take place at the \\"Librairie Les Cent Ciels\\" in Paris. Question: Was there any statement he made about psychomagic? Answer:","completion":"Yes, Alejandro Jodorowsky has made various statements about psychomagic. He believes it's a form of therapy that can heal psychological wounds we experience in life. He thinks that by performing certain acts or behaviors, we can directly influence our unconscious mind and free it from different kinds of traumas. Some of these traumas, he says, can even be passed down from one generation to the next. He has written books to share his theories and methods about psychomagic. In his view, these therapeutic actions are very important and he has spent a lot of his time teaching others about them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the question: WHITE HOUSE — A controversial clothing choice is overshadowing a surprise visit by U.S. first lady Melania Trump to a Texas facility to meet immigrant children separated from their families because of her husband's \\"zero-tolerance\\" immigration policy. Boarding a U.S. Air Force jet at and returning to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Thursday, the first lady was spotted wearing an olive green jacket. The back of the jacket read \\"I really don't care. Do U?\\" in white graffiti-style lettering. The first lady's team insisted that there was no hidden meaning behind the sartorial choice. \\"It's a jacket. There was no hidden message. After today's important visit to Texas, I hope the media isn't going to choose to focus on her wardrobe,\\" said her communications director, Stephanie Grisham. President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the assertion there was no message conveyed by his wife's choice of apparel. Trump, in a tweet, said what was written on the back of the jacket \\"refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares!\\" Television news channels brought pundits in the studio to discuss the meaning conveyed by the jacket. \\"I think she may have had an audience of one in mind — her husband,\\" said USA Today newspaper Washington bureau chief Susan Page, who has covered six presidential administrations, appearing on MSNBC. \\"I think it was Melania giving the middle finger to the media,\\" Kate Anderson Brower, author of First Women: The Grace & Power of America's Modern First Ladies, told VOA. \\"But someone should have told her that it could also be read that she doesn't care about the children, which is clearly not the case.\\" Fashion bloggers quickly identified the jacket as one selling for 39 by Zara, a fast fashion global retailer.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The Brownlow family, a dynasty of lawyers, began accumulating land in the Belton area from approximately 1598. In 1609 they acquired the reversion of the manor of Belton itself from the Pakenham family, who finally sold the manor house to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619. The old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house and remained largely unoccupied, since the family preferred their other houses elsewhere. John Brownlow had married an heiress but was childless. He became attached to two of his more distant blood relations: a great-nephew, also called John Brownlow, and a great-niece, Alice Sherard. The two cousins married each other in 1676 when both were aged 16; three years later, the couple inherited the Brownlow estates from their great-uncle together with an income of £9,000 per annum (about £1.35 million in present-day terms) and £20,000 in cash (equivalent to about £3.01 million now). They immediately bought a town house in the newly fashionable Southampton Square in Bloomsbury, and decided to build a new country house at Belton.Work on the new house began in 1685. The architect thought to have been responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, that it could have been the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a plasterer who worked at Belton to another of his patrons. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The old house, which was situated near the church in the garden of the present house, belonged to the manor of Belton and was sold to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bowie shelved his solo career in 1989, retreating to the relative anonymity of band membership for the first time since the early 1970s. A hard-rocking quartet, Tin Machine came into being after Bowie began to work experimentally with guitarist Reeves Gabrels. The line-up was completed by Tony and Hunt Sales, whom Bowie had known since the late 1970s for their contribution, on bass and drums respectively, to Iggy Pop's 1977 album Lust for Life. Although he intended Tin Machine to operate as a democracy, Bowie dominated, both in songwriting and in decision-making. The band's album debut, Tin Machine (1989), was initially popular, though its politicised lyrics did not find universal approval: Bowie described one song as \\"a simplistic, naive, radical, laying-it-down about the emergence of Neo-Nazis\\"; in the view of biographer Christopher Sandford, \\"It took nerve to denounce drugs, fascism and TV ... in terms that reached the literary level of a comic book.\\" EMI complained of \\"lyrics that preach\\" as well as \\"repetitive tunes\\" and \\"minimalist or no production\\". The album nevertheless reached No. 3 and went gold in the UK.Tin Machine's first world tour was a commercial success, but there was growing reluctance—among fans and critics alike—to accept Bowie's presentation as merely a band member. A series of Tin Machine singles failed to chart, and Bowie, after a disagreement with EMI, left the label. Like his audience and his critics, Bowie himself became increasingly disaffected with his role as just one member of a band. Tin Machine began work on a second album, but Bowie put the venture on hold and made a return to solo work. Performing his early hits during the seven-month Sound+Vision Tour, he found commercial success and acclaim once again.In October 1990, a decade after his divorce from Angie, Bowie and Somali-born supermodel Iman were introduced by a mutual friend.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many more whites are there than African American, in percentage?","completion":"Title: Racial Demographics in the United States: A Comparative Analysis of White and African American Populations Introduction The United States, a diverse nation known as a \\"melting pot\\" of cultures, is comprised of various racial and ethnic groups. Among these groups are the White and African American populations, both playing important roles in shaping the country's history and society. This article aims to present a comparative analysis of these two racial groups and address the question: How many more Whites are there than African Americans, in percentage? Current Demographics According to data from the United States Census Bureau, as of July 2019, the country's total population was approximately 328 million people. Of this, Whites (including those of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origins) accounted for around 76.3%, while African Americans made up to 13.4% of the population. To determine the percentage difference between these two groups, the total population can be utilized as a basis for comparison. Calculating the Difference To compute the percentage difference of Whites and African Americans in the United States, we will consider the non-Hispanic White population in comparison with African Americans, as that is a more accurate representation of the distinct groups. As of July 2019, the non-Hispanic Whites accounted for approximately 60.1% of the total U.S. population. To determine the percentage difference, we can use the following formula: Percentage Difference = ((60.1 - 13.4) / 60.1) × 100% By plugging in the values, we obtain: Percentage Difference = (46.7 / 60.1) × 100% Percentage Difference ≈ 77.7% This calculation reveals that there are approximately 77.7% more non-Hispanic Whites than African Americans in the United States based on the 2019 demographic data. Changes in Demographics It's essential to note that racial demographics in the United States are continuously evolving due to factors such as immigration, birth rates, and social intermingling. This trend is expected to continue in the coming decades. Projections by the U.S. Census Bureau indicate that by 2045, the non-Hispanic White population will shrink to an estimated 49.7%, while the African American population is projected to grow slightly to 13.8%. As a result, the percentage difference between the two racial groups will continue to change as well, narrowing down over time. Conclusion The racial composition of the United States is an ever-changing landscape, which nevertheless remains an important aspect for understanding cultural dynamics and social issues. Currently, the non-Hispanic White population in the United States is about 77.7% larger than the African American population, but this difference will likely decline in the coming decades. As the country continues to evolve and embrace its diversity, it is essential for policymakers, educational institutions, and the general public to be aware of these demographic changes and their implications."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Based in Toronto, the band's original line-up consisted of guitarist and lead vocalist Adam Gontier, drummer and backing vocalist Neil Sanderson, and bassist Brad Walst. In 2003, Barry Stock was recruited as the band's lead guitarist, making Three Days Grace a four-member band. In 2013, Gontier left the band and was replaced by My Darkest Days' vocalist Matt Walst, who is also bassist Brad Walst's brother. From March to August 2008, and from January to April 2009, Three Days Grace recorded their third album at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, British Columbia, and in Los Angeles, again with producer Howard Benson who had worked with them on their previous releases. The album, entitled Life Starts Now, was released on September 22, 2009. Critics as well as band members have noted the album's departure from the angry tone of the band's previous releases into a lyrical style that is perceived as more optimistic. This album reflects the maturity of the band members as they overcome problems such as sickness and death within their families in which they stated, \\"We had to be inspired by it, but the outcome is this: It's a new beginning. It's life starting over.\\" According to guitarist Barry Stock, the album's theme centres around \\"a new sense of freshness\\" and the idea that \\"you don't have to be stuck in whatever it is you're dealing with. Whether it's good or bad, it's your choice to make a change\\". Life Starts Now debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, Three Days Grace's highest chart position to date, and sold 79,000 copies in its first week. The album was met with mostly positive reviews. Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star gave the album a negative review, saying it possesses \\"no sound of its own, just a shallow range between Linkin Park and Nickelback\\". According to Allmusic reviewer James Christopher Monger, who gave the album three out of five stars, Life Starts Now \\"...continues the theme of One-X, Gontier's personal demons, but with a 'hint of sunlight'.\\" He complimented the album, saying it \\"...treats the well-worn metal themes of anger, isolation, heartache, and redemption with the kind of begrudging respect they deserve, pumping out a competent flurry of fist-bump anthems and world-weary, mid-tempo rockers\\". The first single release from the album, \\"Break\\", was released on September 1, 2009. In support of the album, Three Days Grace embarked on a 20 date Canadian tour lasting through November and December 2009. They co-headlined a January-February 2010 tour of the U.S. with Breaking Benjamin and Flyleaf. Life Starts Now was nominated for \\"Best Rock Album\\" at the 2010 Juno Awards, but lost to Billy Talent III. Three Days Grace went on tour with Nickelback and Buckcherry on the \\"Dark Horse Fall 2010 Tour\\". They toured with My Darkest Days starting in March 2011.

Possible A: possessing, plethora, enough, satisfaction, availability Why is \\"enough\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?","completion":"\\"Enough\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it directly and clearly conveys the idea that the individuals did not have the necessary or sufficient amount of supplies to finish the job. The context in the question indicates that the issue was not due to a lack of effort, so the focus lies on the inadequacy of the resources that were required to complete the task. When comparing the other possible answers to \\"enough,\\" it becomes evident as to why \\"enough\\" is the most sensible choice: 1. \\"Possessing\\" implies having or owning something, and it does not convey the idea of insufficiency or inadequacy. 2. \\"Plethora\\" usually signifies an abundance or excess of something, which contradicts the context of the question where the supplies didn't suffice. 3. \\"Satisfaction\\" relates to contentment or fulfillment, and it does not indicate whether there was an adequate amount of supplies or not. 4. \\"Availability\\" refers to the accessibility or obtainability of something, but it doesn't necessarily express the shortage of supplies needed for the task.

The addition of the word \\"operating\\" adds more information about the computer's status, compared to the first sentence. Both sentences share the same core meaning, which is the location of a computer on a desk. However, the second sentence provides additional information about the computer's operational status. This extra detail in the second sentence does not contradict the first sentence but rather provides supplementary information.

It's easiest for you to pick up one dachshund at a time with your hands in the way so you can remain stable. This two-handed technique allows you to distribute the dog's weight evenly, reducing the pressure on both his spine and your arms while ensuring a comfortable and secure grip. As you pick up your dachshund, it's essential to be mindful of their elongated shape and delicate spine. The combination of the support from your hand under the chest and your other hand under the neck helps in maintaining their stability and preventing any injury. Make sure to keep the dog close to your body while lifting to ensure better control and comfort. In any position, be it laying the dog on your chest or holding him upright, always focus on supporting the dog's spine and keeping it as straight as possible. Avoid twisting, bending, or placing sudden force on the dachshund's back, as these actions could lead to injury or aggravate existing conditions like intervertebral disc disease (IVDD), which is common in this breed. In conclusion, the key to holding a dachshund properly is by providing adequate support for their chest, ribcage, neck, and spine. Always be gentle and conscious of their unique shape and ensure that their weight is evenly distributed between both of your hands to avoid any injury and offer the utmost comfort."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Since 2002 the line up consists of Chris Cheney (vocals, guitar), Scott Owen (double bass, vocals) and Andy Strachan (drums). The band rose to fame in 1997 after the release of their double A-sided single, \\"Second Solution\\" / \\"Prisoner of Society\\", which peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Singles Chart. They have released six studio albums and two reached the No. 1 spot on the ARIA Albums Chart: self-titled album (12 October 1998) and State of Emergency (4 February 2006). In February 2002, The Living End's line up changed as Demsey left and was replaced on drums in April by Andy Strachan (ex-Pollyanna). Dempsey wanted to spend more time with his family, and had a dislike of heavy touring; in August that year he joined Fez Perez, and later joined a punk, folk rock group, The Currency. The Living End developed a side project, The Longnecks, to test out Strachan and new material for their third album, Modern ARTillery, without attracting wide public attention. The name is a reference to longneck beer bottles. The Longnecks name was re-used by the band to try out potential material for later albums. They have also played under other names: Glen Waverley & The Mentones, The Dovetones, Roller Toasters, Doncaster & The Dandenongs and Redwings; at various venues in regional Victoria. In mid-2002 The Living End recorded four tracks, including \\"One Said to the Other\\", which were released as an EP in January the following year and reached the top 20 on the ARIA Singles Chart. Two of its tracks were re-recorded in Los Angeles with Mark Trombino (Blink-182, Jebediah) producing, together with new material for Modern ARTillery, which appeared on 28 October 2003. It peaked at No. 3 on the ARIA Albums Chart, top 50 in New Zealand, and top 40 on Billboard's Heatseekers Albums Chart. \\"Who's Gonna Save Us?\\" was issued a month earlier, as the lead single, which reached top 40 in Australia, top 30 in New Zealand and on Billboard's Alternative Songs Chart. They followed with heavy touring (including Big Day Out) promoting their releases. On 27 September 2004 the band released a compilation album, From Here on In: The Singles 1997-2004, early versions included a bonus disc, Under the Covers, which had six cover versions of other artist's tracks. The CD featured two new tracks: \\"I Can't Give You What I Haven't Got\\" and \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\". They also issued a compilation DVD, From Here on In: The DVD 1997-2004, which collated their music video clips and live performances of the groups at festivals: Splendour in the Grass and Big Day Out in Sydney, and from Summer Sonic in Japan. The DVD also documented the band's history by interviews and home footage. What else did the band do during this time?","completion":"During this time, The Living End was also heavily involved in touring both within Australia and internationally. They maintained a steady pattern of conducting tours, often alongside other major artists and at popular music festivals, thereby increasing their fan base. Their consistent touring schedule allowed them to develop a strong reputation for their energetic and dynamic live performances. One of the significant moments during this period was when The Living End were invited to join the Australian leg of the Warped Tour in 1998. The Warped Tour was known for bringing together leading punk rock bands and the Australian leg of the tour served as an excellent platform for The Living End to expand their audience and form connections within the punk rock community. During this period, The Living End also actively worked on many philanthropic pursuits. The band often participated in charity concerts and benefit shows. For instance, they performed at the WaveAid concert in 2005, a fundraising event for victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. This event highlighted their commitment not just to creating music, but also to using their platform to contribute to meaningful causes. The band also frequently collaborated with other prominent artists and bands. Notably, they joined forces with Jet, a fellow Australian rock band, for a national tour in 2006. This tour helped strengthen the alliance of Australian rock bands and further anchored The Living End's status within the local music scene. Furthermore, while continuing their musical career, members of the band used their success to delve into individual projects. Chris Cheney, for instance, made several guest appearances with other bands and continued to improve his songwriting and music production skills. Scott Owen and Andy Strachan also engaged in side projects, thus exploring their musical versatility. In terms of album production, The Living End was not just busy recording their music but also constantly trying to experiment and evolve their sound. During the production of their albums, they worked with various producers and experimented with various recording techniques, leading to the distinct sound featured in their two number one albums 'The Living End' and 'State of Emergency'. The band, true to their punk rock roots, were not afraid to take risks and push the boundaries of their genre. Finally, while keeping up with their heavy touring schedule and music production, the band also focused on connecting with their fans. They continually communicated with their followers through their official website and social media platforms. They made sure that they were accessible to their fans, often staying after shows for meet and greets and hosting Q&A sessions on their social media platforms. Remaining true to their roots while also embracing progress, The Living End became an important fixture in the Australian punk rock scene during this period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Step 2: Recognizing Emotional Words and Phrases The next step is identifying words or phrases that demonstrate emotion, such as \\"worst,\\" \\"awful,\\" \\"poor miserable excuse,\\" \\"takes the cake,\\" and \\"worse movie.\\" To classify the sentiment as positive or negative, we need to consider not only the number of negative words but also the intensity of the prefix used with these words, like \\"worst\\" and \\"awful.\\" Step 3: Determine the Overall Sentiment Given the weight and repetition of negative words and phrases, as well as the context and relative intensity of the language, this text clearly conveys a very negative sentiment.

But here he is, recruited by a side who completed a domestic treble last season and who came within a penalty shootout of winning the Europa League. VIDEO Scroll down to watch United flop","completion":"Bebe training with Benfica and Sir Alex Ferguson talking about his signing As the game commenced, the weight of expectations and past disappointments seemed to hang heavy on Bebe's shoulders. Every touch, every pass, every movement was closely scrutinized by both fans and critics alike. He knew that he had to prove himself worthy of being in this extraordinary team and of his past association with one of the greatest football clubs in the world. The pressure, amplified by the constant murmurs and anticipation that filled the stadium, was both a challenge and a motivation for him to rise above his tainted reputation. Throughout the match, Bebe exhibited a level of determination and resilience that was commendable, if not exceptional. He actively participated in the team's movements, made intelligent runs, and occasionally displayed flashes of brilliance that hinted at the dormant potential lying within him. However, his inconsistent performance and the occasional misplaced pass served as a stark reminder of the reason behind the derisive jeers that seemed to follow him in every footballing environment. The knowledge that he was the subject of mockery and ridicule did not seem to dampen Bebe's spirit, but rather strengthened his resolve to prove himself. As the minutes ticked away and the game progressed, he worked tirelessly to make a tangible impact on the field - in the hope of every once in a while hearing genuine cheers from the audience and allowing himself to steal a brief, precious moment in the limelight. But alas, despite his best efforts, Bebe could not tip the scales in his or his team's favor. The final whistle blew, and with it came the sobering realization that his journey to redemption was far from complete. As he walked off the pitch, the same ironic, mocking cheers and laughter that greeted him before the start of the game seemed to follow him like a remorseless specter. Time will tell whether or not Bebe finds his way back into the hearts of football fans, or whether he will forever be remembered for that ill-fated £7million transfer. Yet, amidst the cruelty and hardship that define the world of professional football, perhaps the most valuable lesson that Bebe's story can teach us is the importance of grit, determination, and the relentless pursuit of one's dreams - even when the odds are stacked against us, and the world seems to turn its back."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Creating a self portrait is not your typical selfie! When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: When did the students do the first self portrait?

The two most important men in Lewis Hamilton’s life left Singapore, one with a permanent smile, the other with a frown and a suitcase full of trouble. The first was Anthony Hamilton, Lewis’s father and backbone through his karting life. The second was Paddy Lowe, the Mercedes boffin trying to stop millions of pounds’ worth of technology from breaking. Whether a car that can last a race or a mind in top working order is more crucial to Hamilton is unclear. Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain and Mercedes celebrates with his team including Nico Rosberg of Germany, his father Anthony Hamilton and his step-mother Linda Hamilton In","completion":"In Lewis Hamilton's journey towards greatness, both his father Anthony Hamilton and Paddy Lowe of Mercedes played indispensable roles. Anthony Hamilton had been Lewis's pillar of strength right from his early karting days, providing him constant support and guidance throughout his racing career. As a father, he instilled in Lewis the values of hard work, determination, and humility that, in due course, contributed to his astounding achievements in the world of motorsports. On the other hand, Paddy Lowe, the renowned Mercedes engineer, was instrumental in ensuring the cutting-edge technology of Lewis's race cars stayed on par with the fierce competition. With millions of pounds dedicated to every aspect of the car, Lowe was committed to making innovative breakthroughs while preventing crucial technology from failing during races. As the brains behind the team's advanced mechanical engineering, Lowe made sure that Hamilton was always equipped with the best machinery to help him ascend the podium. However, the question of whether a perfectly functioning car or a mind in top working order is more significant for Hamilton's success remains open to debate. While it is without a doubt that both these factors are vital, they might be construed as two sides of the same coin, inextricably bound together in the pursuit of victory. In the world of Formula 1, where every second counts, any mechanical failure, even a minor one, can have far-reaching consequences on a driver's position in race standings. Paddy Lowe's expertise and the reliability of his engineering played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Mercedes cars performed optimally, empowering Hamilton to maintain his upward trajectory in the intensely competitive world of motorsports. Simultaneously, having a supportive and grounding figure like his father, Anthony Hamilton, also helped Lewis maintain his mental fortitude and weather the various challenges he faced on and off the track. The toil, the camaraderie, and the comprehensive backing of his father contributed to Hamilton's mental strength, enabling him to remain focused and determined to win race after race and eventually cement his status as one of the all-time greats of Formula 1. In the end, it might be reasonable to say that both a car that can last a race and a mind in top working order were essential elements in Lewis Hamilton's success story. In the unforgiving world of Formula 1, where the stakes are high and the cars are speeding at breakneck velocities, these two factors worked in harmony to bolster Hamilton's impeccable performance on the racecourse. Through the unwavering support of his father, Anthony Hamilton, and the technical wizardry of Paddy Lowe, Lewis Hamilton was poised to etch his name among the legends of the racing world, celebrating victories with his team, including his fellow driver Nico Rosberg. And the indelible bond between Hamilton and his father, as well as his stepmother, Linda Hamilton, was forged even further as they shared the moments of triumph with him."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What was agreed when Bermuda and Newfoundland were added? Context: In May 1940, the US requested base rights in Bermuda from the United Kingdom, but British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was initially unwilling to accede to the American request without getting something in return. In September 1940, as part of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, the UK granted the US base rights in Bermuda. Bermuda and Newfoundland were not originally included in the agreement, but both were added to it, with no war material received by the UK in exchange. One of the terms of the agreement was that the airfield the US Army built would be used jointly by the US and the UK (which it was for the duration of the war, with RAF Transport Command relocating there from Darrell's Island in 1943).

(Photo: Dallas County Jail) DALLAS — A Dallas County magistrate judge increased the bond for a woman accused of forcing her 4-year old son to ingest poison to 500,000, according to court records. Paw Eh, 31, was arrested in Northeast Dallas Saturday after she tried but failed to make her other two children, ages 7 and 12, ingest the poison. Eh has been charged with attempted capital murder. Her original 150,000 bond was increased after her arraignment from the Dallas County jail on Sunday. When detectives interviewed Eh's 7-year-old son, he told them, \\"my mom wants to kill us with poison powder that kills ants and stuff,\\" according to an arrest warrant. He said Eh put ant poison on a spoon, added water, then forced his brother to drink it. She had to slap the 4-year-old to get him to drink the poison. Bail increased for mom who fed son ant killer Eh's daughter told police that her mother said she planned to kill her children and herself, the warrant states. Officers responded to the call in the 10000 block of Walnut Hill Lane Saturday night. Child Protective Services seized custody of Eh's children. The 7 and 12-year-old are in foster care. The 4-year-old remained hospitalized in stable condition Sunday. CPS spokeswoman Marleigh Meisner said it appears that Eh has no prior history with the agency and has no criminal background on her record. Read or Share this story: http://on.wfaa.com/1MsUyuc ||||| [This post has been updated at 11 p.m.] By CLAIRE Z. CARDONA and KRISTEN TAKETA Staff Writers A Dallas mother forced her 4-year-old son to ingest ant poison after telling her three children that she planned to kill them and herself, according to police documents released Sunday. Paw Eh, 31, was arrested Saturday and charged with attempted capital murder. Her youngest child had improved from critical to stable condition by Sunday afternoon, police said. Eh’s 12-year-old daughter told investigators that Eh called the 4-year-old downstairs to the kitchen of a Lake Highlands apartment. The girl said she watched her mother open the poison and put a tablespoon into the container, according to the arrest warrant affidavit. Eh put the poison on a spoon, added water, then tried to force her 4-year-old son to drink it, the affidavit states. When the boy held his mouth shut, Eh slapped him on the cheek. The boy started to cry and Eh forced the spoon into his mouth, the affidavit states. Police say Eh also tried to poison her daughter and 7-year-old son but was unsuccessful. The girl said her mother told them earlier in the day that she was going to kill them and herself, according to the affidavit. The 7-year-old boy told authorities, “my mom wants to kill us with poison powder that kills ants and stuff,” the affidavit states. KTVT-TV (Channel 11) reported that the older children ran to their grandmother’s apartment — which is in the same complex — to tell her what happened. A witness called police to the apartment complex in the 10800 block of Walnut Hill Lane at 1:37 p.m. Saturday to report the incident. The 4-year-old was transported to Medical City Dallas Hospital, according to the affidavit. Police said the two older children were released to family members Saturday night, but Child Protective Services spokeswoman Marleigh Meisner said the children were in CPS custody Sunday. Meisner said Eh does not appear to have a CPS history, and public records show no criminal record in Dallas County. A friend of Eh’s, Sharl Nie, told WFAA-TV (Channel 8) that Eh couldn’t sleep at night and frequently thought about suicide. Eh is from Myanmar, WFAA reported. Other neighbors said they had little interaction with Eh because of a language barrier. The affidavit indicates officials used a Burmese translator to communicate with her. One neighbor, who identified himself as Moogay, said Eh had medical problems and said she would sometimes get red in the face, pass out and fail to remember what happened when she woke up. The neighbor said a man who he thought was her husband often had to supervise her. But he said he was surprised to hear of Eh’s arrest. Eh is being held in the Dallas County jail. Her bail has been set at 500,000. She did not have a lawyer late Sunday. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A Dallas County magistrate judge increased the bond for Paw Eh, a woman accused of forcing her 4-year-old son to ingest poison, to 500,000.

The school was across the street from our home and I would often watch the kids as they played during break. I remember the first day I saw her playing basketball. I watched in wonder as she ran circles around the other kids. She managed to shoot jump shots just over their heads and into the net. The boys always tried to stop her but no one could. I began to notice her at other times, basketball in hand, playing alone. One day I asked her why she practiced so much. Without a moment of hesitation she said, \\"I want to go to college. The only way I can go is to get a scholarship. I am going to play college basketball. I want to be the best. My Daddy told me if the dream is big enough, the facts don't count.\\" Well, I had to give it to her--she was determined. I watched her through those junior high years and into high school. Every week, she led her school team to victory. One day in her senior year, I saw her sitting in the grass, head in her arms. I walked across the street and sat down in the cool grass beside her. Quietly I asked what was wrong. \\"Oh, nothing,\\" came a soft reply, \\"I am just too short.\\" The coach told her that at 5'5\\" she would probably never get to play for a top ranked team--much less offered a scholarship--so she should stop dreaming about college. She was heartbroken and I felt my own throat tighten as I sensed her disappointment. I asked her if she had talked to her dad about it yet. She told me that her father said those coaches were wrong. They just did not understand the power of a dream. He told her that if she truly wanted a scholarship and that nothing could stop her except one thing -- her own attitude. The next year, as she and her team went to the Northern California Championship game, she was offered a scholarship and on the college team.

Let's analyze each sentence to understand the reasoning behind this conclusion: Sentence 1: At low tide you can walk or wade out to the little island of Grand B??, with its simple, unadorned tomb of the locally born Romantic writer Ceteaubriand. This sentence tells us that it is possible to walk or wade out to the little island of Grand B?? during low tide. The presence of the tomb of Ceteaubriand is indicated, but it is not relevant to the main point of the sentence, which is that one can access the island during low tide by walking or wading through the water. Sentence 2: Even at low tide, the water is too crazy to get into. This sentence directly contradicts the first one. It suggests that the water is too dangerous or turbulent to cross even during low tide. If we assume that the first sentence is true, meaning people can walk or wade out to the island of Grand B?? during low tide, then it is unlikely that the second sentence is also true. The second sentence states that the water is too dangerous or turbulent to enter, even at low tide, which would make it impossible to walk or wade through.

Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into upland and lowland rivers. The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a canopy derive the majority of their food base from algae. Anadromous fish are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and introduced species. A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed. The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands. I am facing a new situation today: Two rivers spring from the same mountain. Olt was a fast moving river, while Mures river was slow moving and deep.

English: These remedies or treatments are employed in cases where individuals experience various symptoms or conditions, including nerve irritation, skin itching, hives, swollen legs, and rheumatic swelling. The purpose of using such remedies is to alleviate discomfort, reduce inflammation, and provide relief to those who are affected by these issues. Nerve irritation, also commonly referred to as neuralgia, is a condition where the nerves become inflamed and cause sharp, stabbing pain or a burning sensation. This can occur due to factors such as injury, infection, pressure on the nerves, or other underlying medical conditions. Utilizing appropriate treatments can aid in calming the nerves and minimizing the pain associated with this condition. Skin itching, also known as pruritus, can result from various causes, including dry skin, allergic reactions, bug bites, or certain skin conditions, such as eczema. Relief from itching can be achieved through topical creams, antihistamine medications, or other specialized treatments depending on the underlying cause. Hives, medically known as urticaria, are red, itchy, and raised welts on the skin that can develop as a result of an allergic reaction, exposure to sunlight, heat, cold, or other triggers. They can typically be treated with antihistamines or anti-inflammatory medications to reduce itching and inflammation. Swollen legs can be caused by numerous factors, such as prolonged standing, injury, infection, or underlying medical conditions like deep vein thrombosis, lymphedema, or heart failure. It is essential to determine the underlying cause to provide the appropriate treatment, which may range from compression stockings and elevating the legs to specific medications for managing fluid retention or addressing the root issue. Lastly, rheumatic swelling is associated with rheumatic diseases or conditions, such as arthritis, which is characterized by inflammation, pain, and stiffness in the joints. Various treatment options are available depending on the type and severity of the rheumatic condition, including anti-inflammatory medications, pain relievers, and disease-modifying drugs to slow the progression of the disease. In conclusion, these treatments and remedies play an essential role in managing and alleviating symptoms in individuals experiencing nerve irritation, skin itching, hives, swollen legs, and rheumatic swelling.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Mr Abbas said Israeli \\"war crimes\\" in Gaza should be punished, but stopped short of saying he would take the issue to the International Criminal Court. His speech brought strong condemnation from Israel and from the US, which described it as \\"offensive\\". The 50-day conflict left about 2,100 Palestinians and 73 Israelis dead. Correspondents say the conflict has weakened Mr Abbas politically, with his rivals in the radical group Hamas, which dominates Gaza, seeing a surge of popularity among Palestinians for fighting Israel. The UN says that most of the Palestinian dead were civilians. Israel says the high civilian death toll was because of Hamas fighters launching attacks from residential areas, including schools and mosques, drawing return fire. Earlier this month Israel ordered a criminal investigation into five incidents in which civilians are believed to have died, and is investigating over 100 incidents in total. Mr Abbas said the scale of damage in Gaza was unprecedented and surpassed that of earlier wars. \\"This last war against Gaza was a series of absolute war crimes carried out before the eyes and ears of the entire world, moment by moment,\\" he told the UN General Assembly in New York. He added that it was \\"impossible\\" to return to negotiations with Israel that did not address what he called \\"fundamental questions\\". \\"There is no meaning or value in negotiations for which the agreed objective is not ending the Israeli occupation and achieving the independence of the State of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital on the entire Palestinian Territory occupied in the 1967 war,\\" he said. Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said it was a \\"speech of incitement filled with lies\\". He said Mr Abbas's remarks \\"highlight once again how he does not want and cannot be a partner for a reasonable diplomatic agreement\\". He went on to accuse the Palestinian leader of \\"diplomatic terrorism\\". US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said President Abbas's speech \\"included offensive characterisations that were deeply disappointing\\". \\"Such provocative statements are counterproductive and undermine efforts to create a positive atmosphere and restore trust between the parties,\\" she said. Mr Abbas has previously threatened to take Israel to the International Criminal Court, but did not mention the body in his speech. The Palestinian leader also said the \\"hour of independence of the state of Palestine\\" had arrived. He added that he would be seeking a UN Security Council resolution on a two-state solution, but gave no time frame. The Israeli delegation was not present in the hall during Mr Abbas's speech. Israel launched a major military operation in Gaza on 8 July, with the stated aim of stopping militants firing rockets and mortars at its territory. Following several short-lived ceasefires, both sides agreed to an open-ended truce on 26 August which has so far held.","completion":"Mr. Abbas talks about Israeli \\"war crimes\\" in Gaza and wants them to be punished, but hasn't said if he will go to the International Criminal Court about it, which has caused strong reactions from Israel and the US."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Forest fires burn forests - The animals living in the forest have fewer places to hide - Predators can now find their prey eaiser - Birds will fly away from the area - Waters warm up which hurts the fish swimming in them. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose general climate change happens, how will it affect it will be harder for fires to start. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation, which is general climate change, does have an effect on the process. The process described - \\"forest fires leading to changes in animal habitats and ecosystem dynamics\\" - is affected by climate change both directly and indirectly. First and foremost, climate change directly influences forest fires. Warmer temperatures and frequent drought conditions create a conducive environment for wildfires to ignite and spread. When a region experiences these conditions due to a changing climate, there can be an increase in vulnerability to forest fires, which ultimately exacerbate the problems being faced by animals living in these forests. As a result of the increased frequency and intensity of fires, habitat loss becomes more prevalent. The animals that depend on the forest for shelter, food, and mating grounds are placed under increased pressure to find alternative habitats, and may face a decline in available resources, making it more challenging for them to thrive. Moreover, the entire food chain can be disrupted by the changes brought about due to forest fires. Since predators and prey both face the consequences of climate change-driven forest fires, there can be a direct effect on their populations and relationships in the ecosystem. For instance, if a predator species becomes more abundant due to easier access to prey as a result of the canopy loss caused by fires, it may lead to the decline or extinction of the prey species. Additionally, as you mentioned, migrating birds may need to fly away from the area to find a more suitable habitat as a result of the forest fires. This can cause the bird populations in those areas to decrease, which can consequently impact the ecosystem because birds contribute significantly to seed dispersal and pollination. The warming waters you mentioned due to forest fires can also have a direct effect on fish populations and the overall aquatic ecosystem. Higher water temperatures can change the metabolic rates of fish, alter their food availability, and shift their suitable habitat ranges. This exposes fish to new predators, decreases their ability to survive, and can ultimately lead to a reduction in species diversity in these ecosystems. Furthermore, climate change-driven wildfires can indirectly affect other processes in the environment, such as local weather patterns and water cycles. In fact, the smoke and particulates emitted from forest fires can contribute to climate change itself by releasing greenhouse gases and darkening the atmosphere, absorbing heat, and further exacerbating the warming effect. To conclude, the perturbation hypothesis you proposed highlights the interconnectedness and complexity of ecosystems. Climate change undoubtedly affects numerous processes, including forest fires, their impact on animal populations, and other environmental aspects. It is crucial to understand these intricate relationships and work toward mitigating the effects of climate change to preserve the health and diversity of our ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She rejected the idea that the procedure would mean people would end up living with a dead person's face. \\"There are so many people without faces, I have half a face... but we are all so much more than just a face... you don't take on their personality.

Title: Executive Action Movie plot: A narrator states that when President Lyndon Johnson was asked about the Kennedy Assassination and the Warren Commission report, he said he doubted the findings of the Commission. The narration ends with the mention that the segment did not run on television and was cut from a program about Johnson, at his own request. At a gathering in June 1963, shadowy industrial, political and former US intelligence figures discuss their growing dissatisfaction with the Kennedy administration. In the plush surroundings of lead conspirator Robert Foster (Robert Ryan), he and the others try to persuade Harold Ferguson (Will Geer), a powerful oil magnate dressed in white, to back their plans for an assassination of Kennedy. He remains unconvinced, saying, \\"I don't like such schemes. They're only tolerable when necessary, and only permissible when they work.\\" James Farrington (Burt Lancaster), a black ops specialist, is also among the group: He shows Ferguson and others that a careful assassination of a U.S. President can be done under certain conditions, and refers to the murders of Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, and William McKinley as examples, and includes assassination attempts of others including Roosevelt in 1933. He calls this \\"executive action\\". The film cuts to a desert, where a shooting team is doing target practice at a moving object. One of the shooters says they can only guarantee the operation's success by slowing down the target to 15Â miles per hour. The lead conspirators, Farrington and Foster, discuss preparations for the assassination. Obtaining Ferguson's approval is crucial to the conspirators, although Farrington proceeds to organize two shooting teams in anticipation that Ferguson will change his mind. Ferguson, meanwhile, watches news reports and becomes highly concerned at Kennedy's increasingly \\"liberal\\" direction: action on civil rights, Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, nuclear disarmament.

After two years in Yonkers, New York, the family moved to Longmeadow, Massachusetts, where Santiago attended Longmeadow High School and graduated from Wilbraham & Monson Academy in 1983. His first experience with a musical instrument was playing a Hammond organ at the age of eight, but he never took on the instrument seriously because he had to share it with five brothers. Santiago first played a guitar at the age of nine after he noticed a classical guitar hanging on his oldest brother's wall for decoration. The first song he learned to play was The Velvet Underground's \\"Rock and Roll\\".As a teenager, Santiago became interested in computer programming, naming his first program \\"Iggy\\" and his second \\"Pop\\" after punk rocker Iggy Pop. He participated in a cycle ride across the United States in aid of charity, but on completing it did not bother to collect the sponsor's money.After graduating from high school in 1983, Santiago studied at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He remained without a major as long as the university would permit him to, but eventually chose economics.

I’ve shared my feelings about Temple Spa before in my review of Repose Aromatherapy Resting Cream. Basically, my first experience was a very pushy salesperson at a wedding fair several years ago which really put me off the brand, and it took me a while to try their products again. But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I’ve reviewed since has disappointed me! Today I’m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque’s slightly expensive price tag. The first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too. The mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it’s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes. The mask doesn’t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit. For extra benefits you can also then massage the mask into your skin for around 2 minutes, before removing with a damp muslin cloth or flannel.

Article: A woman's three-year battle with a government department has ended with a conviction, a fine and the death of a \\"lucky\\" 5000 fish. The Asian arowana, considered in some Asian cultures to bring good luck, was seized by federal environment department officers from a Mount Gravatt pet shop in November 2011. An Asian arowana fish. It was then euthanised after a veterinary officer using a scanner failed to detect a microchip, which is usually present in Asian arowanas farmed overseas. It was only after the fish was dead that the microchip was found. Authorities suspected that the native South-East Asian specimen was brought in from overseas because they were not aware of Asian arowanas being bred in captivity in Australia. Asian arowanas are considered threatened and are listed on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Trading the animal is banned unless there are exceptional circumstances. Advertisement In Australia, it is illegal to own an Asian arowana unless it is legally imported. When officers grilled then Pet City Mount Gravatt aquarium manager Kelly Hsu, she said the fish was purchased for 5000 from a local supplier named \\"Justin Smith\\" who bred the animals in Australia. However it later emerged that Mr Smith did not exist. Ms Hsu, a US citizen in her mid-30s who holds science and arts degrees, was charged with breaches of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. She pleaded guilty to possessing an endangered animal in the Brisbane Magistrates Court in May this year. But the federal environment department, not wanting to let her off the hook, appealed Representatives argued the 500 fine and the lack of conviction was \\"manifestly inadequate\\". In his findings handed down on September 29, District Court Judge William Everson agreed, fining Ms Hsu 800 and recording a conviction. \\"The offence, whilst not overly serious, is far from trivial,\\" he said. Judge Everson said the penalty needed to deter people \\"committing offences involving the commercial trade in endangered wildlife\\". ||||| Two men have been put on probation and ordered to pay fines after pleading guilty in San Diego federal court to a scheme to smuggle endangered Asian fish into the U.S. for sale. Michael Loo of San Diego was sentenced to three years' probation and a 1,000 fine. Kiem Tran of Westminster was sentenced to two years' probation and a 1,000 fine. The two were part of a scheme to smuggle the endangered Asian arowana fish, according to prosecutors. The plan was discovered when Loo put an ad on Craigslist offering to sell one of the fish for 2,800. An undercover federal agent answered the ad, prosecutors said. U.S. Fish and Wildlife agents seized 13 of the fish, which are found in the rivers of Southeast Asia and have long been on an international list of restricted species. Known as \\"bonytongue\\" or \\"dragon fish,\\" the arowana can grow to 3 feet in length. Folk wisdom holds that they can bring luck, prosperity and long life to anyone who possesses one. Tran owns Fish Warehouse in Westminster. Loo pleaded guilty to the lawful sale of restricted fish; Tran to transporting merchandise illegally imported into the U.S. The fish have been given to SeaWorld San Diego and the San Diego Zoo. ||||| The Dragon Behind the Glass CHAPTER ONE The Pet DetectiveNEW YORKOn a freezing Tuesday in March 2009, my alarm blared at 4:00 a.m. By 6:45, I stood shivering outside a housing project in the South Bronx with Lieutenant John Fitzpatrick and three junior officers, fresh-faced graduates of the Academy. The entire scene was gray—the potholed roads, the sooty snow, the late-winter sky—except the officers themselves, who provided the only glimmer of green. Rather than standard NYPD issue, they wore olive uniforms and trooper hats, à la Ranger Smith from The Yogi Bear Show. As they crunched across the unshoveled walkway, a passing teenage girl wisecracked, “Ain’t you supposed to be in the forest?”Fitzpatrick, who had been patrolling the same beat since 1996, ignored her, keeping his eyes trained on one of the brick high-rises lined up like dominoes. As a cop (of sorts) from Brooklyn, descended from a clan of cops from Brooklyn, he looked the part, a towering man of forty-one with a crew cut and dimpled chin. Tucked under his arm was a file containing a photograph of the suspect he was after—someone he believed could be armed and dangerous. Inside, the building’s lobby was dimly lit and gloomy. The elevator clattered open, and we crowded in, squeaking up to the eighth floor, where the officers’ boots echoed down the long hall before halting outside one apartment. Fitzpatrick pounded on the door. After half a minute passed and nothing happened, he raised his fist again, pounding harder and longer. A baby cried down the hall. At last, a male voice, gravelly with sleep, croaked, “Who is it?”“State Environmental Police,” Fitzpatrick announced.“Who?” said the voice, sounding genuinely confused.The door cracked open to reveal a stocky young man with full-sleeve tattoos wearing flannel pajama bottoms, his eyes squinting against the light. His name was Jason Cruz. Asked if he knew what brought the officers to his door, he shook his head no and said, “I don’t at all.”“We’re here,” Fitzpatrick enlightened him, “because of the alligator that you were offering to sell on Craigslist.”• • •I WAS REPORTING a story about exotic pets for a science program on NPR, and it had taken me six months to get permission to join Fitzpatrick, a detective with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, on one of his busts. When I’d first called him the previous summer, I’d found him brimming with bizarre tales from an urban bestiary. During his time policing the city’s illegal wildlife trade, he had encountered everything from gorilla-hand ashtrays to twelve hundred turtles crammed into a swank Tribeca loft, their owner left with no room for a bed. There was the Harlem man who kept Ming the tiger and Al the alligator in the apartment where his mother was raising eight small children; the wealthy Brooklyn family who treated their African Diana monkey, one of the rarest primate species on earth, like a second daughter—even threatening to barricade their home if marshals tried to take her away; and the proprietor of a popular curio store in SoHo who landed in prison for selling not only a chimpanzee skeleton and walrus tusks but also human body parts. From time to time, a notorious dealer called Mr. Anything Man surfaced in his jalopy advertising exotic live animals, dead or alive.Anything. It’s the theme of the city’s wildlife trade. Sure enough, when Fitzpatrick asked the pajama-clad Cruz how he came by the alligator he’d been trying to sell, Cruz shrugged and said, “This is the Bronx. You can get anything.”Inside his apartment, which was small and tidy with a black leather couch, flatscreen TV, and mirrored photograph of the Manhattan skyline, a dog barked from the bathroom. Birds tweeted in the kitchen. Fitzpatrick walked over to a trio of tanks and inspected a leopard gecko in one and, in the other, a teaspoon-size baby Nile monitor—a yellow-striped lizard with a blue, forked tongue fond of devouring cats when full grown. The third tank was empty, except for a few inches of stagnant water, which Fitzpatrick leaned in to sniff suspiciously. “So where is the alligator now?” he asked.“I gave it back,” Cruz said, claiming he’d bought the reptile from a stranger outside PetSmart on Pelham Parkway. Though it was only a foot long, his girlfriend had pointed out its likelihood of enlarging and insisted that it had to go for the sake of their two-year-old daughter. After this ultimatum, Cruz said he tried to unload the gator online, but Craigslist flagged the ad; so he returned it to the dealer who sold it to him in the first place. “He was a Puerto Rican dude,” he offered.Fitzpatrick jotted this on a notepad. “Now it’s down to just a few million people in the Bronx,” he said drily.I was as disappointed as Fitzpatrick to have narrowly missed the alligator. I’d been hoping for a scene like the time he taped up the snout of a three-foot-long caiman and drove it thrashing in his front passenger seat to the Bronx Zoo. What’s more, Cruz didn’t live up to Fitzpatrick’s billing of the typical alligator aficionado as an exemplar of machismo and aggression. Pet alligators were supposed to be particularly hot among gang members and drug dealers, but Cruz didn’t seem like either. Before his daughter was born, he used to keep pit bulls, as evidenced by black leather harnesses with metal studs hanging from the wall; but the dog barking in the bathroom turned out to be a poodle.“You can really get in trouble over, like, an alligator?” Cruz asked Fitzpatrick, still bewildered by what was happening.His pregnant girlfriend, who had emerged from the bedroom, yawning and looking unamused, added, “There’s a lot of people that sell alligators.”“It’s a criminal offense,” Fitzpatrick told them, explaining that New York State prohibits the commercial sale of live crocodilians, while the city goes further, banning just about every exotic pet from scorpions to ferrets to polar bears. The Nile monitor was illegal too and would have to be seized. Cruz looked crestfallen as his girlfriend found an empty shoebox, into which he gingerly lifted the tiny lizard, wrapping it in a T-shirt to protect it from the cold.“There’s not many animals you can keep here,” Fitzpatrick advised him, “except a dog, cat, goldfish, canary—”“I got like twenty lovebirds!” Cruz exclaimed.In the kitchen, Fitzpatrick inspected the stacked cages of small, green parrots with yellow chests and red beaks, deeming them permissible.“If I didn’t have kids or nothing, I would’ve had cobras here, vipers, all types of stuff,” Cruz said wistfully, explaining that he had loved animals since he was a child, particularly after escaping the Bronx to visit his aunt in Florida where alligators sunned themselves in the backyard and took dips in the swimming pool. While waiting for the officers to write up a court summons, he called his mother and told her that he was going to be on Animal Planet. “NPR,” I mouthed, then frowned, recalling how my producer had requested high drama—something along the lines of a wildebeest in Queens.After hanging up, Cruz turned to me and grew philosophical: “You know what it is? You like animals, and you get tired of seeing the same animals over and over. You go to the pet store, and they have this and that—and you know everybody’s got it. So you try to get something different.”“Honestly, that’s part of the problem,” Fitzpatrick said as he handed over the summons. “Then you get into endangered species.”But Cruz, marveling at how easily he could acquire a fifteen-foot anaconda rumored to be for sale, didn’t seem to hear.• • •MORE EXOTIC ANIMALS are believed to live in American homes than in American zoos. Yet the desire of someone like Cruz to keep an alligator in his living room defies classic theories of pet-keeping, which hold that humans keep pets for unconditional love, for example, or because a misdirected cute response (the scientific term) compels us to care for other species the way we do our own offspring. Alligators are neither affectionate nor cute, at least not in the sense of being cuddly and having large eyes, a round face, and an oversize head like a human infant or a pug dog. Rather, the appeal seems to lie in the opposite direction—the alligator’s ferocity, its wild and untamable nature.In a way, what Cruz had assembled in his Bronx apartment could be seen as having a long historical precedent. It was a menagerie, a collection of exotic creatures kept in captivity for exhibition. Menageries first appeared with the advent of urbanization, when contact with wild animals became rare, and the keeping of exotics was almost exclusively the privilege of royalty and nobility. Mesopotamian kings, who received foreign beasts as tribute, created elaborate gardens to house them called paradeisoi, later to serve as the model for the biblical Garden of Eden. Egyptian pharaohs collected baboons, hippos, and elephants from sub-Saharan Africa and had them mummified to take into the afterlife. In the classical world, the Greeks brought back wild animals from military expeditions, a tradition their Roman conquerors continued, slaughtering the beasts in public arenas, a popular entertainment for nearly five hundred years. The Tower of London gained its famed royal menagerie in 1204. Across the Atlantic, Lord Moctezuma dazzled the first conquistadores with his magnificent pleasure gardens, replete with rare aquatic birds and wildcats tended by their own physicians. With the European discovery of the New World, the desire to own exotic animals intensified, and the Renaissance saw the invention of the private “cabinet of curiosities.” By the eighteenth century, the aristocracy was clamoring for monkeys and parrots as novel playthings.The human species is unique in its compulsion to tame and nurture nearly all other vertebrate animals. In his 1984 classic, Dominance & Affection: The Making of Pets, the cultural geographer Yi-Fu Tuan characterizes this proclivity as an exercise in power—a kind of playful domination stemming from our desire to control the unpredictable forces of nature. According to Tuan, the keeping of pets reflects our hunger for status symbols, for what the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre called the “carnal, clinging, humble, organic, milky taste of the creature,” which underlies all luxury goods.The modern pet shop first appeared in American cities in the 1890s; and with it began the mass importation of exotic animals from Asia and South America. Pet-keeping in the United States exploded in the economic boom following World War II and, since the 1970s, has more than tripled. For the first time in history, more American households have pets than don’t, including some 86 million cats and 78 million dogs. But no one knows how many “exotics” there are, not least because no one agrees how to define an exotic pet. Does a native but wild animal like a skunk count? What about a potbellied pig? Further complicating matters, much of the trade operates underground, flouting state and federal laws.In the 1980s, wild birds comprised the hottest segment of the black market. Next to take off was the “herp trade,” short for herpetoculture, which is the keeping of reptiles and amphibians such as turtles, lizards, and salamanders. “That’s where you have the big-buck items,” Fitzpatrick told me. He described how he once went undercover posing as a reptile collector to buy a critically endangered 18,000 radiated tortoise from Madagascar with a brilliant star pattern on its shell. As he was making the purchase, the dealer showed him a picture of a one-of-a-kind turtle—an albino river cooter, its entire body a pale jade white—and said he’d been offered 101,000 for the animal but was holding out for more.On that occasion, wary of being searched, Fitzpatrick had slipped his gun into a drawer in another room, and when his backup team was delayed, he began to sweat. Though the dealer didn’t resist arrest, high-stakes turtle trafficking can be tied up with all sorts of unsavory behavior. Interpol warns that organized-crime networks use the same routes to smuggle animals as they do weapons, drugs, and people—that environmental crime goes hand in hand with corruption, money laundering, even murder.• • •IT WAS FITZPATRICK who first told me about the Asian arowana. At the time, I still thought of pet fish as one step up from potted plants. Had someone informed me that fish comprise the vast majority of exotic pets—that they are the most common pet, period, with more than 100 million swimming in aquariums across the United States—I would not have cared one bit. If there was anything appealing about them, it was their comic irrelevancy and their association with childhood.When I was little, my parents got a tank of goldfish as a sorry substitute for a dog or cat. One day when I was about six, I noticed bubbles escaping from the fish’s puckering mouths and wondered if they were talking to each other. Retrieving my Fisher-Price stethoscope, I pushed a chair next to the aquarium and climbed up to listen for tiny voices rising from the water’s surface. All I heard was silence. After that, I ignored them, and they continued to ignore me.Not everyone, however, shared my dispassion. “One thing we deal with here in the city is a fish,” Fitzpatrick told me. “Arowana.” I misheard this as “marijuana,” and the association proved surprisingly apt. Protected by the Endangered Species Act, the Asian arowana cannot legally be brought into the United States as a pet. Yet trafficking is rampant across the country. Fitzpatrick recounted a bust at a dingy Brooklyn sweatshop, where women sat hunched over sewing machines, scraps of fabric strewn about the floor—a front for running fish. Another time, acting on a tip, he caught a Malaysian-born Queens man smuggling arowana through JFK Airport in water-filled baggies packed in a suitcase. Fitzpatrick noted that even the cheapest specimens sold for thousands of dollars, and prices went up from there, depending on coloration, the most desirable being red. “In certain Asian populations the arowana is considered good luck or a sign of prosperity or a status symbol,” he explained. “And it’s something that’s been overharvested for the pet trade for those reasons.”The obsession with the fish, however, wasn’t limited to Asian cultures. There was, for example, the Wall Street banker who broke down crying after he was arrested for possession of the species, confessing he couldn’t resist its dark-alley appeal. “In recent years, we’ve seen more cases involving non-Asians—white people,” Fitzpatrick said. The previous summer, two Long Island men had been caught at the Canadian border, driving back from Montreal with four specimens swimming in the spare-tire well of their SUV. Then a young man was busted running arowana from his family’s home in the suburbs. Fitzpatrick theorized that selling black-market fish was considered safer than dealing in other high-value contraband such as drugs and guns—especially in New York, where just twenty environmental conservation officers cover the same territory as some thirty-four thousand NYPD.The way he saw it, wildlife traffickers were motivated by pure greed, participating in what may well be the world’s most profitable form of illegal trade. But the collectors were driven by a passion he found easier to relate to. “I think that a lot of the people who have these animals are interested in nature, and that, in and of itself, is not a bad thing,” he said. “It’s just they’re going about it the wrong way.”As a young graduate student in biology, Fitzpatrick had spent two months studying birds in the jungles of Venezuela, where he lost thirty pounds, grew “a full Grizzly Adams beard,” and got all sorts of weird skin infections before realizing he was really a city person. He still loved tropical animals—from afar. His only pet was a pint-size Maltese with a name he refused to disclose. “Like Snowball?” I asked.“Something along those lines,” he said.“Flufferbutter?”“You get the picture.”• • •THAT EVENING AFTER I got home, I looked up the Asian arowana to see what more I could find. Fitzpatrick had mentioned that the species was officially called the Asian bonytongue—“very unsexy name”—for a long bone of a tongue, bristling with prickly, pinlike teeth, which the fish uses to seize and crush prey against teeth on the roof of its mouth. The bonytongues, I learned, are among the most ancient living fish on earth. The oldest fossils date to the Late Jurassic or Early Cretaceous and reveal giant creatures with ferocious fangs that roamed the prehistoric seas, preying on ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs. Today the family Osteoglossidae (from the Greek osteo meaning “bone,” and gloss meaning “tongue”) no longer inhabits the oceans but rather the rivers and lakes of the earth’s tropical midsection, where it traditionally includes one of the largest of all freshwater fish: the Amazonian arapaima, which can grow nearly fifteen feet long and weigh some 450 pounds. With the exception of this giant, the rest of the family—all long, thin creatures armored in a mosaic of large, heavy scales—are commonly known as arowanas.The most formidable among them (or at least the most acrobatic) is the South American silver arowana, also known as the water monkey for its ability to leap six feet into the air to snatch bugs, birds, snakes, and bats from overhanging branches. (Do not google arowana eats duckling.) In 2008, when a New Jersey man reached into a tank at Camden’s Adventure Aquarium to touch a silver arowana, the fish tried to make a meal of his hand. In his subsequent lawsuit, the victim alleged “painful bodily injuries” and that his three-year-old son suffered “severe emotional distress, headaches, nausea, long continued mental disturbance and repeated hysterical attacks” after witnessing the incident.Despite or perhaps because of its ferocity, the silver arowana is a popular pet in the United States—and a perfectly legal one—with young fry selling for as little as 30 to 50 apiece. In all, there are seven recognized arowana species (with three more disputed among scientists) in South America, Africa, Southeast Asia, New Guinea, and Australia. Only the Asian variety is banned in the United States.Overseas, however, the Asian arowana is an openly coveted commodity in a legitimate luxury market. “Forget oil and diamonds, the next big thing in Southeast Asia is fish,” I read in the hobbyist magazine Practical Fishkeeping, which described how fifty specimens collectively valued at a million dollars had been placed under twenty-four-hour guard in Jakarta, Indonesia. “While these fish may be disappearing in the wild, their popularity amongst Asia’s richest is ever increasing.”In some instances, the species was reared on farms that could pass as prisons—facilities protected by nested walls, watchtowers, and rottweilers that prowled the perimeters at night. The reason for the heavy security became clear as I dug deeper into an international news archive that chronicled a spate of fish thefts across Southeast Asia. In Malaysia, five arowana stolen from a woman’s house were worth more than all her other possessions combined. Singapore, which boasts one of the lowest crime rates in the world, once reported four such heists in a single week. One thief punched out an elderly woman who chased him as he made off with her prized fish in a sloshing bucket. He was sentenced to three years in prison and twelve strokes of a wet cane.As for who was taking the fish, some surmised that the thieves were fish lovers who could not afford the astronomical prices. Others suspected that a crime syndicate was behind the thefts—a sort of shadowy “fish mafia.” Bolstering this theory was a harrowing case in Indonesia, where an arowana dealer and his heavily armed cronies allegedly kidnapped and held for ransom a Japanese buyer.Despite all this criminality, however, the trade in the farmed fish was legal not only in Asia but throughout most of the world, including Canada and Europe—the one major exception (other than the United States) being Australia, which bans the species to protect its own tropical fauna. A few years back, a forty-five-year-old housewife was arrested at the Melbourne Airport trying to enter the country with fifty-one fish, including an Asian arowana, hidden beneath her poufy skirt. “We became suspicious after hearing these flipping and flapping noises,” a customs official later told the press.Such absurd tales of smuggling kept me up late as I poured through the hundred-some articles I’d printed out and spread across my living room floor. The picture that gradually emerged, however, looked less like the illegal drug trade and more like a parody of Manhattan’s overheated art scene, complete with record-breaking prices, anonymous buyers, stolen specimens, unsavory dealers, and even clever fakes. Whatever the best metaphor, it seemed the Asian arowana had a long history of driving human beings to dangerous extremes.One summer in college, I’d read Jane Goodall’s In the Shadow of Man, and ever since, I’d dreamed of venturing into the jungle to write a great story about wildlife. Around the time my curiosity in the arowana began, I’d been awarded a fellowship intended to fund a reporting project abroad. Now I knew how I’d use it: I would go see for myself where all these smuggled arowana were coming from and what made the species so irresistible. Goodall had her noble, tool-wielding primates—I would have a bad-tempered, bony-tongued fish.It was obvious where to start. At the center of the glamorous world of Southeast Asian aquaculture reigned a flamboyant Singaporean tastemaker known as Kenny the Fish, a chain-smoking millionaire fond of posing nude behind strategically placed aquatic pets. The Fish’s real name was Kenny Yap, and he was the executive chairman of an ornamental-fish farm so lucrative that it was listed on Singapore’s main stock exchange. Recently, the Singaporean press had dubbed him one of the city’s most eligible bachelors and called for him to host a national spin-off of Donald Trump’s reality show, The Apprentice. To enter his website, I had to click on his belly button.I’ve since come to think of this navel as the rabbit hole into which I fell, not to emerge for some three and a half years. ||||| One January evening as the tepid winter heat was beginning to subside across Singapore, a stranger walked into the Lam Hong Aquarium Shop. The owner, a bespectacled woman named Tay Chai Eng, knew most of her patrons, but she had never seen this man before. He was in his early thirties—young enough to be her son—and carrying a bucket of water. He was also concealing a six-inch knife. The moment Tay turned her back, the man plunged his hand into a tank, then raced out the door and into the parking lot. The older woman took off in frantic pursuit, catching the thief and latching onto his free arm like a barnacle. He dropped the bucket to punch her. It was just what she wanted—not the broken glasses or sliced cheek, but the five tiny young fish that spilled onto the asphalt, glinting like gold in the low rays of the sun. These were Asian arowana, the world’s most expensive aquarium fish. In Chinese, they’re known as lóng yú, the dragon fish. Four of them died that day. The one that survived is now two feet long, its sinuous body plated with large scales as shiny and round as coins. A pair of whiskers juts from its lower lip, and two gauzy pectoral fins extend from its sides, suggesting a dragon in flight. This resemblance has led to the belief that the species brings prosperity and good fortune, that it will even commit suicide by jumping out of its tank to prevent the death of its owner. Across Asia, tycoons boast of dropping six figures on the finest specimens. In the United States, the fish is protected by the Endangered Species Act—though a thriving black market persists. One Wall Street banker wept when authorities confiscated his illegal fish. How did a primitive predator from the swamps of Southeast Asia become such a coveted commodity? When I first began researching the fish, I expected to hear much about feng shui. I did. Ultimately, however, my reporting pointed me toward a more surprising story—the history of the species as a test case in conservation. In the mid-’70s, when the Asian arowana was still eaten more often than kept as a pet, its population was found to be declining due to overfishing and habitat loss. Consequently, the fish landed on the first Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Today CITES is one of the largest conservation agreements in the world, regulating the movement of some 35,000 species across the borders of 186 member states. The animals and plants on Appendix I are considered the rarest of the rare and generally banned from international trade. In the case of the Asian arowana, however, the listing seemed to backfire, propelling the species into the spotlight as a limited edition. Paradoxically, “declaring a species endangered may make it more desirable and thereby increase the likelihood of exploitation,” according to a study led by French conservation biologist Franck Courchamp, who elsewhere has pointed to the example of rhinos: After rhinos were moved to Appendix I, the value of their horn quadrupled in Korea, which led to a sharp spike in poaching. A similar phenomenon afflicts reptiles and amphibians in the exotic pet trade, where animals listed on CITES fetch a premium price. Economic theory has long held that trade alone is unlikely to drive a species to extinction, because of the rising cost of finding the last individuals of a dwindling population. Courchamp, however, proposes a new model that integrates a basic facet of human behavior well-known to economists since Adam Smith—the “paradox of value,” otherwise known as the “water and diamonds paradox.” While water has tremendous practical value, it’s worth nothing in exchange. Rare animals are the opposite, like diamonds. Their inflated value drives their exploitation, causing them to become ever rarer and hence more desirable until they’re sucked into an “extinction vortex.” One solution is to scrub species of the sheen of rarity, scrapping bans in favor of sustainable trade. This approach produced one of the greatest conservation success stories of the 20th century: the resurrection of crocodilians, which were rescued from the brink through ranching programs in which eggs are collected from the wild and reared in captivity for skins. Some biologists such as Courchamp argue that this model is the best way to save rhinos whose horns could be harvested like wool. Others warn that for ranching to work as a conservation tool it must place a value on the preservation of wild populations. Without that link, we’re likely to be left with an oxymoron like the Asian arowana: a mass-produced endangered species. Bred by the hundreds of thousands on high-security farms protected by nested walls, barbed wire, and rottweilers that prowl the perimeters at night, the fish has all but disappeared from nature.

He is studying atoms and discovers that the electrons that are farther away from the nucleus are moving less. or more? The answer is:","completion":"More. Step 1: Understand the question The question is asking whether the electrons farther away from the nucleus of an atom are moving less or more compared to the electrons closer to the nucleus. Step 2: Recall the relationship between electron energy levels and distance from the nucleus As the distance from the nucleus increases, the electron energy levels also increase. This means that electrons occupying higher (farther) energy levels have more energy than those in lower (closer) energy levels. Step 3: Relate electron energy to electron movement Electron energy is directly related to the movement of electrons. With higher energy, electrons are likely to move more. In contrast, electrons with lower energy tend to move less. Step 4: Apply the knowledge to the given scenario In Lonnie's observations, the electrons farther from the nucleus are situated in higher energy levels. Based on the relationship between electron energy and electron movement, these electrons should be moving more compared to the electrons closer to the nucleus. The answer to the question is that the electrons farther away from the nucleus are moving more."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Title: Worst printer ever Review: For about a decade I always have bought HP printers.

An annual footrace named the Gate River Run accepts 18,000 participants who travel a course along and over the river twice. The largest kingfishing tournament in the U.S. is held on a St. Johns tributary, where sport fishers concentrate on king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla), cobia (Rachycentron canadum), dolphin (Coryphaena hippurus) and Wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri). The home stadium for the Jacksonville Jaguars faces the river, as does most of the commercial center of downtown. Seven bridges span the St. Johns at Jacksonville; all of them allow tall ships to pass, although some restrict passing times when train or automobile traffic is heavy.Tides cause seawater to enter the mouth of the St. Johns River and can affect the river's level into the middle basin. As a result, much of the river in Jacksonville is part seawater, making it an estuarine ecosystem. The animals and plants in these systems can tolerate both fresh and salt water, and the fluctuations in saline content and temperatures associated with tidal surges and heavy rainfall discharge. Marine animals such as dolphins and sharks can be spotted at times in the St. Johns at Jacksonville as can manatees. Fish such as mullet (Mullidae), flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma), shad (Alosa sapidissima), and blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) migrate from the ocean to freshwater springs upriver to spawn.Although freshwater invertebrates inhabiting and comprising algae and periphyton make the foundation of food webs in the middle and lower basin, zooplankton and phytoplankton take that role in the estuarine habitat.

The body snatcher is depicted with a particularly feminine appearance: red nail polish in her fingernails, pencil skirt and polka dot blouse.[5] Monika apparently evades notice while carrying Rob's corpse into her apartment, where she unwraps him from his body bag. Images of tabloid headlines inform viewers of the source of Monika's knowledge of Rob and his activities.[5] Meanwhile, Mark (Mark Reeder) heads to his as-yet-unspecified job, and the film then cuts back to a scene of Monika undressing Rob. Mark's job is thereupon revealed to be dubbing porn films, and this scene foreshadows the next, in which Monika has sex with Rob's corpse. Betty (Beatrice Manowski), Rob's ex-girlfriend from the previous film, is then briefly introduced as she discovers, to her disappointment, that Rob's grave has already been robbed. Monika fails to have an orgasm and the sex scene ends with her running to the bathroom. She is disgusted, and about to vomit. The implication is that \\"the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak\\".[5] Once Monika has cleaned Rob's corpse, she takes photos with him using her camera's self-timer. She is seen cuddling the corpse in the photos.[5] Mark, meanwhile, makes plans to meet a friend (Simone SpÃ¶rl) at the movie theater. Mark's friend, however, is late, and Mark offers his ticket instead to Monika, a stranger who happens to be passing by.[5] Monika and Mark hit it off and soon go on a carnival date, after which point Monika decides to break up with Rob. She is apparently attempting to live a normal life with a real boyfriend.[5] She tearfully saws the corpse of Rob into pieces and putting them into garbage bags, saving just his head and genitals. She then disposes the garbage bags. She keeps the... Answer:","completion":"What challenges does Monika face as she attempts to leave her past life as a body snatcher behind and tries to build a normal relationship with Mark, a stranger she meets at the movie theater, given her disturbing history with Rob's corpse?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

During a 2+ hour layover in PHX, we were headed to La Madeleine to get soup for the wife when we saw the French Onion Soup on the menu here. Since we can do \\"La Mad\\" back home, we said what the heck and stopped in to Zinc. Now, as everyone knows, French Onion Soup is general served with a \\"crouton\\" on top, on which the cheese melts. But if you're gluten free like the wife, they'll just melt the Gruyu00e8re cheese right on the top of the soup-filled crock. Even though it would probably have been more fun to be able to have the cheese on toasted bread on top (poor wife), she was pleased with the soup. And speaking of Gruyu00e8re... The truffled Gruyu00e8re Zinc Burger was as amazing as it looked. Five stars right there. The dessert we chose was some sort of chocolate bread pudding/cake situation, with a side of ice cream with \\"house made caramel sauce on top\\". Eh.... Fairly forgettable (we didn't finish it, even splitting it between the two of us... well, wife could only have the ice cream). Maybe pastry isn't their strong suit. Overall, it's pricy because of the airport premium, and it's trying a bit too hard to be a \\"bistro\\" (which for some reason, makes people think they should charge 10% more).

Answer the following question: Process: - Carbon dioxide enters the leaves through the stomates by diffusion - Water is transported to the leaves in the xylem - Energy harvested through light reaction is stored by forming ATP - Carbon dioxide and energy from ATP are used to create sugar - Oxygen exits the leaves through the stomata by diffusion - The plant reuses the water or the water exits through the stomata as water vapor. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose humans were unable to get oxygen from plants to produce carbon dioxide happens, how will it affect More carbon dioxide is released into the air. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation would have both direct and indirect effects on the process. Step-by-step breakdown of the effects: 1. If humans were unable to get oxygen from plants and produce carbon dioxide, the overall concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere would be affected. This would result in an imbalance between carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations in the atmosphere. 2. As a direct effect, higher concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would lead to increased absorption of CO2 by plants through the stomata in the leaves. This may actually improve the rate of photosynthesis in the short term, as higher CO2 levels are known to boost plant growth. 3. However, the indirect effect of this perturbation involves the reduced availability of oxygen necessary for human life. This would negatively impact humans and other oxygen-dependent organisms, ultimately affecting the entire food chain and ecosystem. 4. Moreover, another indirect effect is the potential exacerbation of climate change, as higher concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere contribute to the greenhouse effect and global warming. This can cause increased temperatures, extreme weather events, and other negative impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity. In summary, the proposed perturbation of humans not being able to produce carbon dioxide from oxygen derived from plants would directly affect the photosynthesis process by increasing the amount of CO2 absorbed by plants. However, the numerous indirect effects, such as the reduced availability of oxygen for humans and other organisms as well as the exacerbation of climate change, could have significant negative implications on the ecosystems and the planet as a whole."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Milk is such a presence in our lives we probably take it for granted. Thank goodness, then, for today, World Milk Day — one of those weird food holidays which are sometimes invented by interest groups to push a certain product. Regardless of the so-called holiday's origins, let’s take this opportunity to delve into some of the ways people appreciate milk in their daily lives. The Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy conducted a survey of more than 1,000 adults 18 and over in April of this year. They uncovered some shocking facts about how people think about – and drink – milk. First off, 48% of respondents said that they aren’t sure where chocolate milk comes from. Um, guys, it comes from cows – and not just the brown kind. Still, 7% of people – and remember, this survey talked to actual, grown-up adults – still think that chocolate milk only comes from brown cows. Actually, chocolate milk gets its flavor and color from cocoa beans. Now that you know what milk-myths are still floating around out there, what about the ways people drink their milk? A fair chunk of people are still hanging on to their taboo kitchen habits: 37% secretly drink milk straight out of the container, while another 29% use their kids as an excuse to buy chocolate milk for themselves. And despite the fact that healthy lifestyle diets are all the rage right now, only 5% of people abstain from drinking milk altogether, making it a continued staple in most people’s homes. In fact, it seems to still be one of America’s favorite beverages: One quarter of participants reported taking a trip to the grocery store before 6 in the morning just to buy milk. We just can’t seem to escape dairy in any of its forms: An additional 95% of people surveyed currently have some type of cheese in their refrigerator. So there you have it. Even though an unfortunate number of people can't seem to figure out where it comes from, milk is still beloved by Americans. ||||| Seven percent of American adults believe chocolate milk comes from brown cows, according to a recent online survey commissioned by the Innovation Center of U.S. Dairy. Here are a few other things Americans get wrong. (Elyse Samuels/The Washington Post) Seven percent of all American adults believe that chocolate milk comes from brown cows, according to a nationally representative online survey commissioned by the Innovation Center of U.S. Dairy. If you do the math, that works out to 16.4 million misinformed, milk-drinking people. The equivalent of the population of Pennsylvania (and then some!) does not know that chocolate milk is milk, cocoa and sugar. But while the survey has attracted snorts and jeers from some corners — “um, guys, [milk] comes from cows — and not just the brown kind,” snarked Food & Wine — the most surprising thing about this figure may actually be that it isn’t higher. For decades, observers in agriculture, nutrition and education have griped that many Americans are basically agriculturally illiterate. They don’t know where food is grown, how it gets to stores — or even, in the case of chocolate milk, what’s in it. One Department of Agriculture study, commissioned in the early ’90s, found that nearly 1 in 5 adults did not know that hamburgers are made from beef. Many more lacked familiarity with basic farming facts, like how big U.S. farms typically are and what food animals eat. Experts in ag education aren’t convinced that much has changed in the intervening decades. “At the end of the day, it’s an exposure issue,” said Cecily Upton, co-founder of the nonprofit FoodCorps, which brings agricultural and nutrition education into elementary schools. “Right now, we’re conditioned to think that if you need food, you go to the store. Nothing in our educational framework teaches kids where food comes from before that point.” Upton and other educators are quick to caution that these conclusions don’t apply across the board. Studies have shown that people who live in agricultural communities tend to know a bit more about where their food comes from, as do people with higher education levels and household incomes. But in some populations, confusion about basic food facts can skew pretty high. When one team of researchers interviewed fourth-, fifth- and sixth-graders at an urban California school, they found that more than half of them didn’t know pickles were cucumbers, or that onions and lettuce were plants. Four in 10 didn’t know that hamburgers came from cows. And 3 in 10 didn’t know that cheese is made from milk. “All informants recalled the names of common foods in raw form and most knew foods were grown on farms or in gardens,” the researchers concluded. “They did not, however, possess schema necessary to articulate an understanding of post-production activities nor the agricultural crop origin of common foods.” In some ways, this ignorance is perfectly logical. The writer and historian Ann Vileisis has argued that it developed in lockstep with the industrial food system. As more Americans moved into cities in the mid-1800s, she writes in the book “Kitchen Literacy,” fewer were involved in food production or processing. That trend was exacerbated by innovations in transportation and manufacturing that made it possible to ship foods in different forms, and over great distances. By the time uniformity, hygiene and brand loyalty became modern ideals — the latter frequently encouraged by emerging food companies in well-funded ad campaigns — many Americans couldn’t imagine the origins of the boxed cereals or shrink-wrapped hot dogs in their kitchens. Today, many Americans only experience food as an industrial product that doesn’t look much like the original animal or plant: The USDA says orange juice is the most popular “fruit” in America, and processed potatoes — in the form of french fries and chips — rank among the top vegetables. “Indifference about the origins and production of foods became a norm of urban culture, laying the groundwork for a modern food sensibility that would spread all across America in the decades that followed,” Vileisis wrote, of the 20th century. “Within a relatively brief period, the average distance from farm to kitchen had grown from a short walk down the garden path to a convoluted, 1,500-mile energy-guzzling journey by rail and truck.” The past 20 years have seen the birth of a movement to reverse this gap, with agriculture and nutrition groups working to get ag education back into classrooms. Aside from FoodCorps, which worked with slightly more than 100,000 students this year, groups like the National Agriculture in the Classroom Organization and the American Farm Bureau Foundation are actively working with K-12 teachers across the country to add nutrition, farm technology and agricultural economics to lessons in social studies, science and health. The USDA Farm to School program, which awarded 5 million in grants for the 2017-2018 school year on Monday, also funds projects on agriculture education. For National Dairy Month, which is June, NACO has been featuring a kindergarten-level lesson on dairy. Among its main takeaways: milk — plain, unflavored, boring white milk — comes from cows, not the grocery case. Nutritionists and food-system reformers say these basic lessons are critical to raising kids who know how to eat healthfully — an important aid to tackling heart disease and obesity. Meanwhile, farm groups argue the lack of basic food knowledge can lead to poor policy decisions. A 2012 white paper from the National Institute for Animal Agriculture blamed consumers for what it considers bad farm regulations: “One factor driving today’s regulatory environment ... is pressure applied by consumers, the authors wrote. “Unfortunately, a majority of today’s consumers are at least three generations removed from agriculture, are not literate about where food comes from and how it is produced.” Upton, of FoodCorps, said everyone could benefit from a better understanding of agriculture. “We still get kids who are surprised that a french fry comes from a potato, or that a pickle is a cucumber,” she said. “... Knowledge is power. Without it, we can’t make informed decisions.” Editor's note: A previous version of this story incorrectly reported that the survey in question was commissioned by the National Dairy Council. It was actually commissioned by the Innovation Center of U.S. Dairy, its sister organization. Read more: What is “natural food”? Even the people who make it aren't sure.

And 48 percent of adults surveyed admitted to not being sure of where chocolate milk comes from.

The organization's site is very diplomatic, though, adding, \\"To be fair, some milk questions and myths may make us smile. But we realize we need accurate information to make the best choices for ourselves and our families about what we eat. It’s time to set the record straight about some common misconceptions about chocolate milk.\\" One other myth we were happy to hear debunked: A study of more than 7,000 children and adolescents found that drinking neither flavored or white milk was not related to weight gain, compared to non-milk drinkers.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:Use information from the paragraph to answer the question. Question: If Jim increases a lot of blood from a cut he sustains, what will happen to his blood pressure it will become lower or it will become higher? Paragraph : If blood volume in the body decreases, blood pressure decreases. A:","completion":"If Jim experiences a significant amount of blood loss from a cut he sustains, his blood pressure will become lower. According to the information provided in the paragraph, a decrease in blood volume within the body will lead to a decrease in blood pressure. Blood volume and blood pressure are directly proportional to each other; when one decreases, so does the other. Blood pressure is the force exerted by the blood against the walls of blood vessels. It is necessary to maintain a certain level of blood pressure to ensure that blood can circulate effectively throughout the body, delivering essential oxygen and nutrients to the cells. When blood volume decreases due to blood loss, there is less force exerted against the blood vessels, resulting in lower blood pressure. The body has various mechanisms to try to compensate for this drop in blood pressure, such as increasing the heart rate or constricting blood vessels, to get the blood pressure back to a normal range and maintain proper blood flow to vital organs. However, if the blood loss is too severe, the body may not be able to adequately compensate, which can lead to shock and potentially life-threatening complications. In Jim's case, if the blood loss is substantial and his body cannot effectively respond, his blood pressure would indeed become lower, and he may require medical attention to prevent further complications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: Director Tony Scott was not suffering from cancer and did not have any serious underlying medical conditions -- including cancer -- at the time of his suicide, chief coroner investigator Craig Harvey said. Los Angeles County coroner's officials released their final cause of death in the 68-year-old's suicide, finding that he died of multiple blunt-force injuries after leaping from the Vincent Thomas Bridge. The director also had therapeutic levels of the sleep aid Lunestra and the anti-depressant Mirtazipine, also known as Remeron, in his system, according to results of toxicology tests. Harvey told The Times that investigators found no pre-existing conditions in Scott, based on both the autopsy and medical records. FULL COVERAGE: Director Tony Scott | 1944-2012 \\"There was no evidence of neoplasia -- cancer -- identified,\\" Harvey said. After Scott's death, some media reports quoted an anonymous source suggesting that Scott had a brain tumor. His family vehemently denied those reports. Scott jumped off the Vincent Thomas bridge on Aug. 19. His family has not offered any public explanation as to why he took his own life. The coroner's findings also do not help untangle the mystery. Harvey said investigators interviewed Scott's family, but the discussion shed no light on the suicide. Several of Scott's associates told The Times that the director had mentioned back or hip problems in the months prior to his death, but many said they had no indication it was anything other than business as normal for the director-producer. \\"He was completely on a high -- laughing and energetic,\\" said Elizabeth Gabler, whose Fox 2000 studio division made \\"Man on Fire\\" and was developing Scott's next film, \\"Lucky Strike.\\" They were scheduled to discuss script notes on the morning after he died, she said. \\"In a million years, this isn't something I'd have thought he'd do,\\" Mark Bomback, a writer on \\"Unstoppable\\" said at the time. \\"I never had an inkling he had any health problems....

Credit: Todd Williamson / Getty Images ||||| Director’s Death Director Tony Scott had an antidepressant and sleep medication in his system when he plunged off an L.A. bridge in August, say coroner’s officials, who ruled Monday he died of multiple blunt-force injuries. Christine Pelisek reports. British director Tony Scott had therapeutic levels of Mirtazapine, an antidepressant, and Lunesta, a sleep aid, in his system when he leaped off a Los Angeles bridge in August, coroner officials said Monday. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled the 68-year-old Top Gun director’s death a suicide and said he died of multiple blunt-force injuries. But the preliminary findings don’t make the motive for Scott’s suicide any clearer. After his death, friends found a detailed suicide note at his office and police discovered a letter with contact numbers in his black Toyota Prius, but the contents of the notes were never made public. ABC News reported that the director was suffering from inoperable brain cancer, though there were no public reports of health problems. On Monday, chief coroner spokesman Craig Harvey said Scott had no underlying health problems and there was “no anatomic evidence of neoplasia [cancer] identified.” The results of the coroner’s autopsy will not be available for two more weeks. Scott, who was known for his trademark red baseball cap, and his 74-year-old brother, Prometheus director Ridley Scott, had been producing the hit CBS drama The Good Wife at the time of his death. The two men were also working together on Killing Lincoln, based on the bestseller by Bill O’Reilly. Just two days before he plummeted to his death, Scott had met with Tom Cruise to discuss a sequel to their 1986 hit Top Gun. The men toured the Fallon U.S. Naval Air Station in Nevada, where the real Top-Gun pilots train. Cruise, who was reportedly devastated by Scott’s death, said at the time in a statement: “Tony was my dear friend and I will really miss him. He was a creative visionary whose mark on film is immeasurable. My deepest sorrow and thoughts are with his family at this time.” Around 12:35 p.m. on Aug. 19, Scott drove onto the Vincent Thomas Bridge, which spans the port city of San Pedro and Terminal Island, and parked at the bridge’s highest point, officials said. Witnesses reported that the director got out of his car and climbed the 10-foot fence on the south side of the bridge before plunging 185 feet into the cold murky water below. Los Angeles harbor patrol, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Los Angeles port police were able to pinpoint Scott’s location by using underwater sonar equipment regularly used to find explosives, and after they discovered his sneakers floating in the water. Scott was no stranger to the Vincent Thomas Bridge, the fourth largest suspension bridge in California. In a 2009 interview with Rotten Tomatoes about his plans to do a remake of Warriors, Scott spoke about why he planned to switch the movie location from New York to Los Angeles. “It’s a city which is horizontal,” he said. “New York is vertical, all skyscrapers, and Los Angeles is horizontal. I’m hoping to get 100,000 real gang members standing on the Vincent Thomas Bridge for one shot.” Scott had recently finished shooting the drama Out of the Furnace, starring Christian Bale. He had risen to fame after directing his debut film, 1983’s vampire movie The Hunger, starring Catherine Deneuve and rocker David Bowie. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Director Tony Scott had no serious underlying medical conditions, including cancer, at the time of his suicide, according to chief coroner investigator Craig Harvey.

If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: What does Sarah use to pull the cloak off Mater Lachrymarum? Title: Mother of Tears Movie plot: The film begins with members of the Catholic Church digging up the body of a 19th-century church official, whose casket has a box-shaped urn chained to it. Inside the box they discover artifacts belonging to Mater Lachrymarum (Moran Atias), the last surviving member of the Three Mothers; an ancient trio of powerful black witches. In particular, the box contains a magic cloak that, when worn by Mater Lachrymarum, increases her powers significantly. The urn is shipped to the Museum of Ancient Art in Rome where Sarah Mandy (Asia Argento), an American studying art restoration, works. Sarah is dating the curator Michael Pierce, a single father who is away from the museum that night. With help from the assistant curator, Sarah opens the box and finds the cloak, a dagger, and three statues representing the three witches. Sending Sarah to her office to retrieve tools to help her translate the text on the artifacts, the curator is promptly attacked by the demonic agents of Mater Lachrymarum. Sarah arrives too late to save her boss (who is being disembowelled by the monsters) and starts to flee the museum. Unfortunately, she is pursued by Mater Lachrymarum's familiar (a baboon) and is only able to escape when a disembodied voice magically throws open a series of locked doors keeping her trapped inside the museum. Sarah tells the police what happened as she spends the night with Michael and his son. Michael visits the Cardinal who sent him the urn only to find out that, shortly after mailing the urn to him, he had a severe stroke and is now in a coma. An assistant of the priest gives Michael a piece of paper, which the Cardinal was writing on before collapsing. On it is scrawled the name \\"Mater Lachrymarum\\". As he leaves the hospital, a pair of witches observe Michael leaving the building. Back in Rome, chaos descends as a wave of mass suicides, murder, and violence engulfs the city.

Question: While getting drunk the body can only process so much at a time, go too fast and your belly might just make you what? Options: - getting arrested - throw up - staggering - fall down - explode Explain why a human would choose \\"throw up\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"throw up\\" to answer the question above because it is the most accurate and biologically plausible response among the given options when considering the effects of alcohol on the human body. Drinking alcohol introduces it into the bloodstream, which then travels to the liver to be broken down and metabolized. The liver can only process a certain amount of alcohol per hour, and if a person consumes more than the liver can handle, the excess alcohol builds up in the bloodstream, leading to intoxication or even alcohol poisoning. Among the given options, here's a detailed explanation for each: 1. Getting arrested: Consuming alcohol quickly might lead to increased intoxication, which could result in poor decision-making and risky behavior. This increases the likelihood of getting arrested, but getting arrested is not a direct physiological effect of excessive alcohol consumption on the body. 2. Throw up: When alcohol is consumed too quickly, the body may respond by inducing vomiting as a protective mechanism to protect itself from potential harm by expelling the excess content. Throwing up helps to remove some of the unabsorbed alcohol from the stomach and it also serves as a signal to the person to stop drinking. This is the most accurate answer for this question. 3. Staggering: Staggering refers to the loss of balance and coordination that may occur due to alcohol intoxication. While this outcome is a common effect of excessive alcohol consumption, the question implies a more immediate reaction to consuming alcohol too quickly. Staggering is not a direct response to alcohol overwhelming the stomach and liver. 4. Fall down: Falling down is another common effect of excessive alcohol consumption influenced by the central nervous system. However, this is not the most accurate response in this context, as it does not directly refer to the body's inability to process alcohol at a fast rate. 5. Explode: This option is a hyperbolic and unrealistic response. The human body does not explode from consuming too much alcohol too quickly. It is not a valid answer in this context. In conclusion, \\"throw up\\" is the most accurate and biologically plausible answer to this question because it addresses the body's need to protect itself from the harmful effects of excessive alcohol intake. It explains the immediate physiological response to the overconsumption of alcohol that cannot be processed quickly enough by the liver, whereas the other options do not focus on the body's limitations directly or are exaggerated and unrealistic."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Options: - sing - play games - start fighting - fiddle - spread The answer is \\"sing\\" because Answer:","completion":"The answer is \\"sing\\" because singing is a direct and natural way for children to express their happiness and emotions. When children are happy, they tend to sing spontaneously, often incorporating their own lyrics or tunes, as a means of sharing and celebrating their joy. Step-by-step justification: 1. Analyze the given options: sing, play games, start fighting, fiddle, spread. 2. Eliminate the options that are not directly related to expressing happiness: start fighting, fiddle, spread. 3. Among the remaining options (sing, play games), singing is the most direct and natural way for children to express happiness as it is an immediate, vocal response that can be done anywhere and anytime. 4. Playing games, while enjoyable, does not inherently imply happiness, as it could also be done to alleviate boredom or to socialize with others. 5.

Your task is to classify whether the given answer is correct or not by providing \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\", based on the article. Q: Article: A punctual person is in the habit of doing a thing at the proper time and is never late in keeping an appointment. The unpunctual man, on one hand, never does what he has to do at the proper time. He is always in a hurry and in the end loses both time and his good name. A lost thing may be found again, but lost time can never be regained. Time is more valuable than material things. In fact, time is life itself. The unpunctual man is for ever wasting and mismanaging his most valuable asset as well as other's. The unpunctual person is always complaining that he finds no time to answer letters, or return calls or keep appointments promptly. But the man who really has a great deal to do is very careful of his time and seldom complains of want of it. He knows that he can not get through his huge amount of work unless he faithfully keeps every piece of work when it has to be attended to. Failure to be punctual in keeping one's appointments is the sign of disrespect towards others. If a person is invited to dinner and arrives later than the appointed time, he keeps all the other guests waiting for him. Usually this will be regarded as a great disrespect to the host and all other guests present. Unpunctuality, moreover, is very harmful when it comes to do one's duty, whether public or private. Imagine how it would be if those who are put in charge of important tasks failed to be at their proper place at the appointed time. A man who is known to be habitually unpunctual is never trusted by his friends or fellow men.

Given the question: I have a new situation: Bobby and Kenny are two prolific farmers from Arkansas who have ponds located down stream from their farm sites. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms. But I can use this background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. What is an answer for this question: Who will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near their farm? The answer is:","completion":"Kenny will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near his farm. The explanation for this answer is based on the background provided and understanding the chain of events related to the usage of fertilizer and its impact on nearby water bodies. It all starts with the amount of fertilizer used by the farmers. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes and, as a result, has increased the amount of fertilizer he uses on his farm. On the other hand, Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. When it rains, the rainwater dissolves the fertilizer in the soil, and the runoff water carries it away, eventually depositing the fertilizer in bodies of water, such as ponds, rivers, and oceans. In this case, Bobby and Kenny's farms have ponds located downstream, which are directly impacted by the fertilizer runoff. The nitrogen content in the fertilizer stimulates the growth of algae in water bodies, causing an algal bloom. The overgrowth of algae is harmful to water ecosystems because it uses up the dissolved oxygen that other aquatic life depends on. As the algae population increases, they use up more and more carbon dioxide in the water, and after they die, decomposers break down the dead algal tissue. These decomposers consume oxygen during decomposition, creating a dead zone within the water body where nothing can grow due to low levels of oxygen. Given the background provided, it is clear that Bobby is using more fertilizer on his farm due to the increased demand for potatoes. Consequently, there will be more nitrogen-containing runoff entering the nearby ponds and causing the overgrowth of algae. The higher volume of algae, in turn, will contribute to a greater depletion of oxygen in the water, resulting in larger dead zones in the ponds. On the other hand, Kenny is using less fertilizer since tomatoes are not in season. This means that there would be less runoff carrying nitrogen into the ponds, leading to a smaller growth of algae and therefore smaller impacts on the oxygen levels in the surrounding ponds. In conclusion, based on the quantities of fertilizer used by the farmers and the resulting impact on the algae population and oxygen levels in the nearby ponds, Kenny will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near his farm."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the sentence \\"Predation can be heightened during migration: Eleonora's falcon Falco eleonorae, which breeds on Mediterranean islands, has a very late breeding season, coordinated with the autumn passage of southbound passerine migrants, which it feeds to its young.\\" answer the question \\"What makes birds prone to parasites and pathogens?\\" Choices: A). yes. B). no.","completion":"B). No. The sentence \\"Predation can be heightened during migration: Eleonora's falcon Falco eleonorae, which breeds on Mediterranean islands, has a very late breeding season, coordinated with the autumn passage of southbound passerine migrants, which it feeds to its young.\\" does not answer the question, \\"What makes birds prone to parasites and pathogens?\\". Rather, the sentence highlights a specific example of increased predation during bird migration. In this case, Eleonora's falcon is using the migration of southbound passerine migrants as a food source for its young during their late breeding season. To answer the question about what makes birds prone to parasites and pathogens, we need to consider several factors that can contribute to their susceptibility: 1. Environmental factors: Birds' susceptibility to parasites and pathogens can be affected by various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and contaminants in water and food sources. For example, higher temperatures and humidity can create favorable conditions for parasite growth and transmission. 2. Migration: During migration, birds face numerous challenges, including long-distance travel, limited food sources, and exposure to new environments with different parasite and pathogen strains. These factors can increase their susceptibility to infection. Additionally, birds often congregate in larger numbers at specific stopover sites during migration, which may facilitate the transmission of parasites and pathogens among individuals. 3. Stress: Birds experience various stressors throughout their lives, including from predation, competition for resources, social interactions, and environmental changes. Stress can weaken a bird's immune system, making it more susceptible to parasites and pathogens. 4. Breeding: Breeding activities, such as nest-building and territorial defense, can increase stress levels and reduce the availability of resources for self-maintenance, leaving birds vulnerable to parasites and pathogens. Breeding colonies may also create suitable environments for parasite and pathogen transmission, with many birds in close proximity to each other. 5. Host factors: Birds have evolved various defenses against parasites and pathogens, including immune and physiological responses, as well as behavioral strategies for avoiding infected habitats and conspecifics. However, previous exposure, age, and genetics can influence a bird's susceptibility to infection. For example, young birds with immature immune systems are generally more susceptible to parasites and pathogens than older, more experienced individuals. In conclusion, while the given sentence does not address birds' vulnerability to parasites and pathogens, multiple factors can contribute to their susceptibility, including environmental conditions, migration stressors, and host characteristics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Given the following context: The Mothers of Invention played in New York in late 1966 and were offered a contract at the Garrick Theater (at 152 Bleecker Street, above the Cafe au Go Go) during Easter 1967. This proved successful and Herb Cohen extended the booking, which eventually lasted half a year. As a result, Zappa and his wife, along with the Mothers of Invention, moved to New York. Their shows became a combination of improvised acts showcasing individual talents of the band as well as tight performances of Zappa's music. Everything was directed by Zappa using hand signals. Guest performers and audience participation became a regular part of the Garrick Theater shows. One evening, Zappa managed to entice some U.S. Marines from the audience onto the stage, where they proceeded to dismember a big baby doll, having been told by Zappa to pretend that it was a \\"gook baby\\".Zappa uniquely contributed to the avant-garde, anti-establishment music scene of the 1960s, sampling radio tape recordings and incorporating his own philosophical ideals to music and freedom of expression in his pieces. Bands such as AMM and Faust also contributed to the radio sampling techniques of the 1960s. Situated in New York, and only interrupted by the band's first European tour, the Mothers of Invention recorded the album widely regarded as the peak of the group's late 1960s work, We're Only in It for the Money (released 1968). It was produced by Zappa, with Wilson credited as executive producer. From then on, Zappa produced all albums released by the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. We're Only in It for the Money featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard in pop music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the hippie and flower power phenomena. He sampled plundered surf music in We're only in It for the Money, as well as the Beatles' tape work from their song Tomorrow Never Knows. The cover photo parodied that of the Beatles' Sgt.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the answer to this question? where is the integration center located for most autonomic reflexes?","completion":"The integration center for most autonomic reflexes is primarily located within the central nervous system, specifically in the brainstem and spinal cord. These structures are responsible for receiving, processing, and coordinating automatic or involuntary responses to stimuli. Within the brainstem, key components such as the medulla oblongata, pons, and midbrain play crucial roles in the regulation of autonomic reflexes. The medulla oblongata, in particular, is responsible for controlling various vital functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration. It also houses several important nuclei that regulate autonomic reflexes related to the cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal systems. The pons and midbrain contribute to the coordination and control of autonomic reflexes as well. The pons is involved in the regulation of respiratory rhythm, while the midbrain contains regions responsible for controlling eye movement and pupil size, which are also part of the autonomic nervous system. In the spinal cord, a series of sympathetic and parasympathetic preganglionic neurons are organized into segments called the lateral horn. These neurons receive input from various regions of the brain, such as the hypothalamus, and other sensory receptors throughout the body. They subsequently transmit this information to peripheral ganglia by releasing neurotransmitters, ultimately resulting in a coordinated autonomic response. In addition to the brainstem and spinal cord, other structures within the central nervous system are also involved in the regulation of autonomic reflexes. For instance, the hypothalamus is a critical component of the autonomic regulatory system. It maintains homeostasis by integrating sensory information and hormonal signaling to modulate autonomic activities. The hypothalamus regulates various physiological processes, such as body temperature, water balance, and food intake, by influencing both the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system. Furthermore, regions of the limbic system, like the amygdala and hippocampus, play a role in regulating autonomic reflexes related to emotional processing and memory. For example, the amygdala is directly involved in the \\"fight or flight\\" response, which coordinates a range of autonomic and endocrine responses to perceived threats or stressors. In summary, the integration center for most autonomic reflexes is primarily located within the central nervous system, particularly in the brainstem and spinal cord. Other regions, such as the hypothalamus and limbic system, also contribute to the regulation of autonomic responses. Together, these structures work in concert to maintain the body's homeostasis and enable appropriate responses to various stimuli."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He contemplated a story, an outline he had laboriously constructed some time ago. He had filled his pen and raised it, the nib descending towards the paper, before the sound came: the gentle, persistent tapping of the gnarled, primeval willow touching the window with long, insistent fingers. His eyes awoke with a passionate, determined flame, though the only light came from the glutted moon. Allan filled page after page, the words escaping from his mind onto the paper. Where before they had marched in regiments, practiced in ranks and followed their leaders' commands, the words now escaped in their true forms, unhindered by any stricture. He continued long into the night, until the eldritch orb had sunk into the waiting hands of the willow, raised perpetually skyward. Arthur looked up from the results of a night's frenzied labors and looked Allan in the eye. \\"What is this?\\" he queried, indicating the pages he held in his left hand. \\"I decided that… since I wasn't having much success with more – traditional – stories, I might see what sort of work I produced if I let my imagination go freely,\\" Allan replied, somewhat less self-assured than he had been the previous night. \\"What in G-d's name could have possessed you to do such a thing,\\" cried Arthur, nearly raising his voice. \\"After all I said the day before, why have you abandoned centuries of literary progress for some self-indulgent fantasy?\\" He shook the papers at Allan, raising them like a belt above the head of a disobedient son. \\"This is nothing but a glorified Grimm's tale, a miscarried child of Stoker, a creation less fit to be published than to be told around an open fire at the hovel of some peasant!\\" He spoke the last word with such heavy intonation that Allan shrank back before the physical wave of sound emanating from Arthur's throat. \\"Do you hate the modern system of literature?

Article: Andy Steele lives just a few blocks from the campus of Black Hills State University in Spearfish, S.D., so commuting to class isn't the problem. But he doesn't like lectures much, isn't a morning person, and wants time during the day to restore motorcycles. So Steele, a full-time senior business major, has been taking as many classes as he can from the South Dakota State system's online offerings. He gets better grades and learns more, he says, and insists he isn't missing out on the college experience. \\"I still know a lot of people from my first two years living on campus, and I still meet a lot of people,\\" he says.

At least 2.3 million people took some kind of online courses, according to a recent survey by The Sloan Consortium, an online education group, and two-thirds of colleges offering \\"face-to-face\\" courses also offer online ones. But what were once two different types of classes are looking more and more alike and often falling into the same pool of students. At some schools, online courses originally intended for non-traditional students living far from campus have proved surprisingly popular with on-campus students. A recent study found 42 percent of the students enrolled in its distance education courses were located on campus at the university that was hosting the online courses. Numbers vary depending on the policies of particular colleges, but other schools also have students mixing and matching online and \\"face-to-face\\" credits.

Especially the time he caught Trisha bending over me in nothing but a frilly market stall thong while I worked the angles best I could to get a dangle-shot. Next night he took her in the car park woods and doped her up to the eyeballs. He took out a bottle of India ink and told her he would etch the love-heart she'd always wanted. Instead, he safety-pinned the word 'inbred' into her arse. Trisha's step-dad tracked the spits of blood and found her sobbing in the bathroom of their long-stay static. It didn't take him long to slap out the truth. He went straight round to Keith's place with a crow-bar and did enough damage to make sure he'd need more than laser treatment to put things right.

Pick from: [A]. no; [B]. yes;","completion":"In order to answer the questions, I will first research the topics and provide well-reasoned responses to each question. 1. What is a good Uber driver rating? - To find this information, I will look into Uber's rating system and guidelines. 2. Can passengers rate Uber drivers if the driver cancels? - I will research Uber's policies on cancellations and their impact on driver ratings. Now, let's address each question individually. 1. A good Uber driver rating is usually around 4.7 or higher on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest score. This is because Uber considers a driver with an average rating below 4.6 to be at risk of deactivation. Therefore, a rating higher than 4.7 typically ensures that the driver is considered reliable and providing quality service. 2. Passengers usually cannot rate Uber drivers if the driver cancels the ride, as ratings are based on completed trips. However, frequent cancellations by a driver can negatively impact their overall standing with the Uber platform, and may lead to penalties or even deactivation. At this point, I have provided two separate answers to the given questions. Now I will determine if the questions are the same or not: Comparing the two questions, I can conclude that they are not the same. The first question asks about what is considered a good driver rating, while the second question asks if passengers can rate a driver when the driver cancels the ride.

We are repeatedly told that American schools are failing, that colleges are not teaching, and that the students of today are not as good as the students of the past. There are, of course, problems with the education system. Because of economic inequality some schools are significantly better than others and the ideas of equality of education and equality of opportunity are cruel jokes. However, the mere fact that there are some serious problems does not mean that all the _ claims are true. One stock claim is that America has fallen behind the world in education in terms of performance on various tests. While the fact that America is behind other countries is a point of concern, there are at least three points worth considering here. The first is the above-mentioned economic inequality which will tend to result in poorer performance when taking the average for America. The second is that many countries have put considerable effort into improving their education systems and hence it is worth considering that America's decline is also due to the improvement of others. The third is the matter of the measures-- do they, in fact, present an accurate picture of the situation? I am not claiming that the data is bad. I am merely raising a reasonable concern about how accurate our picture of education is at this time. Another stock claim is that American students are doing badly on standardized tests. While there is clearly value in assessment, it is reasonable to consider whether or not such tests are a proper and adequate measure of education. It is also worth considering whether the puzzle with these tests is itself causing damage to education. That is, as teachers teach for the test and students learn for the test, it might be the case that what is being taught is not what should be taught and what is being learned is not what should be learned.

Movie plot title: Infernal Affairs II Movie plot: Act 1The film opens eleven years prior to Infernal Affairs in 1991. Inspector Wong Chi-Shing (Anthony Wong reprising his role) is discussing the death of his first partner with an initially unseen companion, who is revealed to be Hon Sam (Eric Tsang, also reprising), the triad boss from Infernal Affairs. At this point in time Sam is a follower in Ngai Kwun's triad family and is also working as Wong's informant. Carrying a nondescript paper bag, a young Lau Kin-Ming (Edison Chen) makes his way through the streets of Mongkok. Ming stops at an ostensible martial arts school where Ngai Kwun is spending the evening. With a gun concealed in his paper bag, Ming kills Kwun and walks away.Ming arrives at a secluded office space where Sams wife, Mary (Carina Lau), greets him. Mary is testing her new stereo system, playing the exact same song Ming used to test his system in Infernal Affairs; she sardonically praises it to Ming in the exact manner that Yan does in the first film while casually ascertaining whether or not he has any reservations about being Sams mole in the police force. Appearing aloof, Ming accepts the position and Mary packs a bag of cash for him, advising that he maintain a low profile and prepare for the police academy; assuming that the song she put on the stereo is distracting him, she also gives him a copy of it. Ming is attracted to Mary, but is unwilling to express it due to his lowly position in the gang. It is then revealed that Mary ordered Kwuns assassination. Mary confesses that Sam has no knowledge of this transgression and urges Ming to keep it that way, as she wants Sam to take Kwun's place as leader of Ngai family triad.Meanwhile, we see a young Chan Wing-Yan (Shawn Yue), his girlfriend and a young Crazy Keung (Chapman To) are waiting for something.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students. When did the students do the first self portrait?

There was a dirt road through the tract, but further down, it crossed two huge concrete pipes. The dirt was washed out between them, and the deep gulch made it impossible to cross in a car. Sometimes, eight or ten of us would go looking for parked cars. If we found one or more, we would go move this incredibly heavy stump onto the road and lay a telephone pole across it. It took all of us and it was incredibly heavy. It was impossible to drive around it because of the ditches and there was no way two or three people could move it. We'd go back to the car and set off a big string of fire crackers or shake the cat and slap on it and run like crazy. We'd watch from the woods as they drove like heck and come to a screeching stop at our roadblock. The guy would get out and try to lift the pole. Never happen. Then the car would drive the other way. That wouldn't happen because of the pipes. We'd go home leaving them in there. This was before cell phones, and it was miles to a pay phone. We'd go back the next day and find the stump and pole moved. We thought it was real funny until one night we set it up and beat on the trunk of a car. A couple was inside, getting it on.

Objective: shoes Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","completion":"To effectively answer this question, it is important to first understand what naive physics reasoning is. Naive physics, also known as folk physics, refers to the informal and intuitive understanding of the world's physical properties, which people develop without any formal education in the field of physics. Naive physics reasoning, therefore, refers to the act of making predictions and judgments about the world's physical properties by relying on common sense and intuition rather than scientific principles or formal education. Given that the objective is \\"shoes,\\" we need to evaluate two or more solutions in terms of such reasoning. As no specific solutions are provided in the question, let's consider the following two common scenarios related to shoes and evaluate them based on naive physics reasoning: Solution 1: Choosing the right shoe size and design for comfort Solution 2: Waterproofing shoes to protect them from water damage Solution 1: Choosing the right shoe size and design for comfort Using naive physics reasoning, it becomes apparent that selecting the appropriate shoe size and design is crucial for comfort. Intuitively, a person would recognize that a shoe that is too small or too big would cause discomfort, as it would either be too tight and restrictive or too loose and unstable. Furthermore, the design of the shoe should be able to accommodate the natural shape and movement of the foot. A shoe that forces the foot into a shape that goes against its natural structure will likely result in discomfort and potential health issues. The choice of material is also essential as it determines the breathability, flexibility, and overall comfort of the shoe. Solution 2: Waterproofing shoes to protect them from water damage Naive physics reasoning also supports the idea of waterproofing shoes as a sound solution. Intuitively, one understands that exposing shoes and the material to water could cause damage in the form of warping, discoloration, and mold growth. This would lead to the shoes having a shortened life span and reduce their functionality. Moreover, the reasoning suggests that waterproofing shoes would prevent water from penetrating the shoe, keeping one's feet dry and comfortable, and preserving the shoe's structural integrity for a more extended period. Comparing the two solutions, we can see that both of them hold merit when it comes to naive physics reasoning. Both solutions address essential aspects related to shoes, with Solution 1 focusing on comfort and fit, while Solution 2 tackles the issue of water damage and preservation. In conclusion, using naive physics reasoning, both Solution 1 (choosing the right shoe size and design for comfort) and Solution 2 (waterproofing shoes to protect them from water damage) can be considered sound solutions. They both address practical concerns regarding shoes, such as comfort, fit, and preservation, using common sense and intuition. While neither solution is superior to the other, as both are important when it comes to wearing and maintaining shoes, they both pass naive physics reasoning's logic test in their own regard."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By the end of the evening, all that is left is a small pile of ashes. What happened to the matter that you started with? Was it destroyed by the flames? It may seem that way. What do you think happened? The truth is that the same amount of matter still exists. The wood changed not only to ashes, but also to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. The gases floated off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Although matter was changed, it was not created or destroyed. Because the same amount of matter still exists, we can say that matter is conserved. You may wonder how it can be conserved if something is now missing? Assume you had measured the mass of the wood before you burned it. Assume you had also trapped the gases released by the burning wood and measured their mass and the mass of the ashes. What would you find? The ashes and gases combined have the same mass as the wood you started with. This example illustrates the law of conservation of mass.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information: - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The Republic of Bashkortostan (\\"Baqortostan Respublikah\\"), also known as Bashkiria is a federal subject of Russia (a republic). It is located between the Volga River and the Ural Mountains. Its capital is the city of Ufa. With the population of 4,072,292 as of the 2010 Census, Bashkortostan is the most populous of the republics in Russia. - The Arctic Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five major oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea or simply the Arctic Sea, classifying it a mediterranean sea or an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean. Alternatively, the Arctic Ocean can be seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing World Ocean. - Ufa is a city in Russia, the capital of the Republic of Bashkortostan. - Yekaterinburg, alternatively romanised as \\"Ekaterinburg\\", is the fourth-largest city in Russia and the administrative centre of Sverdlovsk Oblast, located in the middle of the Eurasian continent, on the border of Europe and Asia. At the 2010 Census, it had a population of 1,349,772. - Russia (from the Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - The term dialect (from Latin , , from the Ancient Greek word , , \\"discourse\\", from , , \\"through\\" and , , \\"I speak\\") is used in two distinct ways to refer to two different types of linguistic phenomena: - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - The Ural or Jayq/Zhayyq (, ), known as Yaik before 1775, is a river flowing through Russia and Kazakhstan in Eurasia. It originates in the southern Ural Mountains and ends at the Caspian Sea. At , it is the third-longest river in Europe after the Volga and the Danube, and the 18th-longest river in Asia. The Ural River is conventionally considered part of the boundary between the continents of Europe and Asia. - Russia is not proportionately populated between the smaller western portion (almost 25%) of the country that is considered part of Europe, and the larger eastern portion (more than 75%) that is part of Asia. European Russia contains about 77% of the country's population (110,000,000 people out of about 144,000,000) in an area comprising almost 4 million km (1.54 million mi); an average of 27.5 persons per km (70 per mi). This territory makes up 38% of Europe. Its eastern border is defined by the Ural Mountains and in the south, it is defined by the border with Kazakhstan. This area includes Moscow and Saint Petersburg, the two largest cities in Russia. - The Ural Mountains, or simply the Urals, are a mountain range that runs approximately from north to south through western Russia, from the coast of the Arctic Ocean to the Ural River and northwestern Kazakhstan. The mountain range forms part of the conventional boundary between the continents of Europe and Asia. Vaygach Island and the islands of Novaya Zemlya form a further continuation of the chain to the north into the Arctic Ocean. - Novaya Zemlya (lit. \\"new land\\"), also known, especially in Dutch, as Nova Zembla, is an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean in northern Russia and the extreme northeast of Europe, the easternmost point of Europe lying at Cape Flissingsky on the Northern island. Administratively, it is incorporated as Novaya Zemlya District, one of the twenty-one in Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia. Municipally, it is incorporated as Novaya Zemlya Urban Okrug. - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - The Volga is the longest river in Europe. It is also Europe's largest river in terms of discharge and watershed. The river flows through central Russia and into the Caspian Sea, and is widely regarded as the national river of Russia. - Moscow (or ) is the capital and most populous city of Russia, with 12.2 million residents within the city limits and 16.8 million within the urban area. Moscow has the status of a Russian federal city. - A mountain range (also mountain barrier, belt, or system) is a geographic area containing numerous geologically related mountains. A mountain system or system of mountain ranges, sometimes is used to combine several geological features that are geographically (regionally) related. On Earth, most significant mountain ranges are the result of plate tectonics, though mountain ranges are formed by a range of processes, are found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets. - Novosibirsk is the third-most populous city in Russia after Moscow and St. Petersburg.

In the given statement, \\"The flow of current in an electrical circuit is moved up and down,\\" the focus is on the flow of current within an electrical circuit, not an electrical storm. An electrical circuit is a closed loop that allows electrons to flow through a conducting path, producing various effects such as heat, light, or movement. The flow of current in the context of an electrical circuit generally refers to the movement of electrons through the conducting path. This flow can vary (up and down) based on several factors, including the voltage, resistance, and characteristics of the circuit components. An electrical storm, also known as a thunderstorm or a lightning storm, is a natural phenomenon characterized by the occurrence of lightning and thunder, accompanied by heavy rain, strong winds, or hail. The flow of current in an electrical storm, specifically in a lightning strike, is the result of a massive discharge of electrical energy between the Earth's surface and a thundercloud or between thunderclouds. While both an electrical circuit and an electrical storm involve the flow of electric current, they are different phenomena with distinct properties and behaviors.

(The flight was aborted at the last second after a faulty valve was discovered; SpaceX officials said the launch was postponed till Tuesday or Wednesday.) Some NASA supporters are mourning what they see as the decline of U.S. leadership in space. But they should really be celebrating the dawn of a new era. After all, we've been stuck in low Earth orbit for several decades now, at considerable cost. Visionary plans for genuine space exploration have gathered dust at NASA, the National Research Council and other space-savvy places.

This vision aligns with the main objective of advancing space exploration by leveraging the innovation and cost-effectiveness offered by private enterprises. By doing so, they aim to assist government space agencies like NASA in achieving their goals and maintaining the leadership of countries such as the U.S. in space. One of the advantages of private space companies is their greater flexibility in terms of decision making and execution, as they do not depend on government bureaucracy and budget allocations. This enables them to develop and test new technologies at a faster rate, which in turn allows for the rapid progress of space exploration. For instance, SpaceX has developed reusable rockets that significantly reduce the cost of launching spacecraft, making space exploration more affordable and accessible to a wider range of organizations and countries. Moreover, private companies can attract funding from different sources, including private investors and venture capitalists, which can help to bolster financial resources for audacious space ventures. This diversification of financial sources can alleviate the burden on taxpayers and the federal budget, allowing governments to allocate funds to other crucial areas such as education, healthcare, or national defense while still making significant strides in space exploration. Collaboration between public agencies like NASA and private players like SpaceX has the potential to synergize the strengths of both entities, ultimately leading to greater efficiency and more significant achievements in space exploration. In particular, the access to advanced technology provided by private companies can support government agencies to focus on research that involves deeper exploration of space and finding ways to improve life back on Earth. Furthermore, private companies can help stimulate public interest in space exploration and inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs by offering out-of-the-box solutions and exciting new projects in the space industry. This includes plans by SpaceX for crewed missions to Mars, as well as asteroid mining initiatives and space tourism opportunities. By bringing novel ideas to the table and pushing the boundaries of space exploration, private companies can keep the public engaged and hopeful about the future of space travel. In conclusion, private space companies like SpaceX offer a new frontier for space exploration, with a progressive vision that includes big goals, achieved through small but steady steps. By collaborating with government bodies such as NASA and receiving support without undue interference from the nation, they can propel the space industry forward, maintain the leadership of countries like the U.S. in this arena, and ultimately bring humanity to the next phase in our journey through the cosmos."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Founded in 1892, the Carabane school was one of the first in the region. It began as an all-boys school, but in 1898, three nuns belonging to the indigenous congregation of the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary began teaching classes for girls. Soon, there were 60 students. A school infrastructure description in the region in 1900 reveals that the boys' school in Carabane was open from December to August each year, and that holidays ran from September to November, when parents needed their children in the fields to help cultivate rice. In 1903, when Carabane lost its status as capital, the school was instructing 63 boys and 102 girls. In 1914, it had only 56 boys and 26 girls, a situation similar to that in Bignona. Carabane has a new primary school, École François Mendy, inaugurated on January 21, 2006, hosting six classes. The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students may continue their studies at the middle school in Elinkine, the Aline Sitoe Diatta High School in Oussouye, and then a university in either Dakar or Ziguinchor. Carabane's kindergarten is located in a community house, called \\"House of Women and Children,\\" founded in 1988 under the auspices of Caritas Ziguinchor. In 1895, the government established a medical post in Carabane, but it closed the following year.

This introductory scene establishes that Monika is not simply the local gravedigger. The body snatcher is depicted with a particularly feminine appearance: red nail polish in her fingernails, pencil skirt and polka dot blouse.[5] Monika apparently evades notice while carrying Rob's corpse into her apartment, where she unwraps him from his body bag.

Due to its great size in comparison to other English counties, functions have been undertaken over time by its subdivisions, which have also been subject to periodic reform. Throughout these changes, Yorkshire has continued to be recognised as a geographical territory and cultural region. The name is familiar and well understood across the United Kingdom and is in common use in the media and the military, and also features in the titles of current areas of civil administration such as North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and East Riding of Yorkshire. - In geography, latitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the northsouth position of a point on the Earth's surface. Latitude is an angle (defined below) which ranges from 0° at the Equator to 90° (North or South) at the poles. Lines of constant latitude, or parallels, run eastwest as circles parallel to the equator. Latitude is used together with longitude to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth. Approximations employed. Two levels of abstraction are employed in the definition of these coordinates. In the first step the physical surface is modelled by the geoid, a surface which approximates the mean sea level over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses. The second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface. The simplest choice for the reference surface is a sphere, but the geoid is more accurately modelled by an ellipsoid. The definitions of latitude and longitude on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections. Lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a graticule on the reference surface. The latitude of a point on the \\"actual\\" surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface, the correspondence being along the normal to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface. Latitude and longitude together with some specification of height constitute a geographic coordinate system as defined in the specification of the ISO 19111 standard. - Kirkbymoorside is a small market town and civil parish in the Ryedale district of North Yorkshire, England, about north of York, midway between Pickering and Helmsley, on the edge of the North York Moors National Park.

It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. - Helmsley is a market town and civil parish in the Ryedale district of North Yorkshire, England.

It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - A sundial is a device that tells the time of day by the apparent position of the Sun in the sky. In the narrowest sense of the word it consists of a flat plate (the \\"dial\\") and a \\"gnomon\\" which casts a shadow onto the dial. As the sun appears to move across the sky, the shadow aligns with different \\"hour-lines\\" which are marked on the dial to indicate the time of day. The \\"style\\" is the time-telling edge of the gnomon, though a single point or \\"nodus\\" may be used. The gnomon casts a broad shadow; the shadow of the style shows the time. The gnomon may be a rod, a wire or an elaborately decorated metal casting. The style must be parallel to the axis of the Earth's rotation for the sundial to be accurate throughout the year. The style's angle from horizontal is equal to the sundial's geographical latitude. - The Howardian Hills take their name from the Howard family who still own local lands, and are located between the Yorkshire Wolds, the North York Moors National Park and the Vale of York.

The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said it is at risk of being exported from the UK unless a buyer pays the asking price of Â£8,460. The temporary order was imposed earlier by Culture Minister Ed Vaizey. The use of gilding and the high quality of the brooch indicates it was used by an individual of significant social status. An illustration of the Virgin Mary in the 9th Century gospel manuscript, the Book of Kells, shows her wearing a brooch of similar type and also suggests it had a Christian meaning. Mr Vaizey said: \\"With an object as old and as rare as this one, it is important that we protect it for the UK in order to help us better understand what life, society and culture was like during Anglo-Saxon times. \\"I hope that the temporary export bar that I have put in place will result in a UK buyer coming forward to buy this brooch and save it for the nation.\\" The ban was imposed on the advice of the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest (RCEWA). Leslie Webster, from the group, said: \\"This beautiful object has intriguing stories to tell, and would be a marvellous acquisition for a UK museum.\\" The identity of the owner is confidential according to the DCMS.

Your job interview serves as a first impression for a potential employer, so rescheduling may come off as unprofessional. If possible, rearrange the other parts of your schedule before rescheduling your job interview. Rescheduling a job interview can be a huge inconvenience to everyone involved. Because of this, it's important that you contact your potential employer to reschedule at least 24 hours before your scheduled interview. When you contact your interviewer, give a brief explanation for your need to reschedule. Be as honest as possible. Give your interviewer a few alternative dates that will work for your rescheduled interview. If you're rescheduling due to another job interview, it's best not to tell your interviewer that. Tell them you've had a work or family conflict come up, and that you'd love to reschedule your interview for another time. If a life emergency happens and you cannot give 24 hour notice, contact your interviewer as soon as possible to let them know what happened. If it's a real emergency (you were injured, you have a family emergency, etc.), your potential employer should understand. If you're still interested in the job, express that when you call to cancel. Say something like \\"I'm very sorry, but an emergency has come up and I won't be able to make our interview tomorrow. I'm still interested in the position and would be extremely grateful if we could reschedule.\\" When possible, make direct contact with your potential employer instead of sending an email or leaving a message. Making contact via phone will make you look like a responsible professional. Make an effort to get in touch with your interviewer in numerous ways, and only leave a message or send an email if you cannot reach them via phone. Never send a text message to reschedule an interview, as it will make you look unprofessional. If you end up leaving a message or sending an email, ask that your interviewer contact you to confirm they got your message. A job interview is normally scheduled around multiple people's schedules. Therefore, cancelling or rescheduling an interview is usually an inconvenience for multiple people. Don't assume that your interviewer's schedule revolves around you, and apologize for causing any inconvenience. Try to be flexible when you ask to reschedule your interview. If your interviewer sees that you are putting in good effort to make this interview work, they will be more likely to reschedule your interview. After you've contacted your interviewer about rescheduling, send them a personal note or email reiterating your apology and your interest in the company. Your interviewer may be frustrated or irritated by you cancelling, so use this note as an opportunity to let them know that you are genuinely sorry and would still like a chance to reschedule an interview.","completion":"When you need to reschedule a job interview, first try to change your other plans, but if you must reschedule, contact the interviewer with an honest explanation, suggest new dates, and always be polite because it might inconvenience many people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I just had to trash loads of them because they were of such poor quality. Mary: Oh, absolutely Greg! I can't tell you how many times I've had to do that. The clothes nowadays just seem to deteriorate too quickly. Greg: Yeah, I thought it was just me. It's pretty disappointing when you have to throw them away after only a few months of use. Mary: It's true. Sometimes you think you're scoring a deal with inexpensive clothing, but it turns out being more costly in the long run since they don't last very long. And not just for our wallets, it's harmful for the environment too. Greg: Oh definitely! I've been reading about how the fast fashion industry has a significant negative impact on the environment. It's one of the primary causes of pollution and waste all around the world. Mary: Yes, I've been hearing a lot about that too. You know, textile production and manufacturing create a vast amount of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming. Moreover, the fashion industry consumes an outrageous amount of water. Greg: That's true. I remember reading that it takes thousands of liters of water just to produce one cotton shirt – and that's not even considering the pollution generated in the process. And to think of all the clothes we've just thrown away, it's such a waste of resources. Mary: Absolutely. I feel so guilty about all the clothes I've discarded without even thinking about it. If only there was a way we could reduce this wastage and minimize the environmental consequences. Greg: Well, I think it all comes down to being more conscious about our purchases. We should make an effort to buy only what we genuinely need, and invest in good-quality clothes that will last longer. Mary: I couldn't agree more, Greg. We should also try to support brands that are eco-friendly and prioritize sustainable production methods. And, of course, we could recycle or donate our clothes whenever possible instead of just throwing them away. Greg: That's a great idea, Mary. And we can even go a step further by trying to repair our clothes when they get worn out, or upcycle them into new items. Mary: That's true, Greg! I've been meaning to take up sewing classes or maybe even learn online so I can do that myself. Greg: That sounds fantastic! I'll look into it too. We should also encourage our friends and family to adopt these sustainable practices. If we all start making small changes, we can make a significant impact in the long run. Mary: Absolutely, Greg. Let's make a conscious effort to be more environmentally responsible, and hopefully, we won't have to trash loads of clothes ever again! Greg: Yes, let's do it, Mary!

That happened last night against the lowly Boston Celtics. They had only won 13 games the whole year and were really struggling. We had just come off a very good win against the Orlando Magic on the road and were feeling good about ourselves. The day did not start out good for us when we learned that T-Mac was going to miss the game with the flu. When you lose your best players (Yao, T-Mac) everyone must play a little harder and do a little bit more on the floor. We inserted Bonzi Wells into the lineup (he was the only one to have a good game for us), in place of T-Mac. It was a nasty game. We are usually one of the best three point shooting teams in the NBA and we only made 1 of 22 three point shots! I have never seen that happen. Never! Rafer Alston, Luther Head, and me combined to shoot 5 of 33 from the field. Ouch! You aren't going to win too many games like that. Even as poorly as we shot the ball, we STILL had a chance to win the game in the fourth quarter but failed to make the winning plays that you must make to leave the floor victorious. In the locker room after the game, everybody felt terrible. When we play a bad game, we feel that we let our teammates down. There is a bad feeling in the pit of your stomach when you leave the gym and you just want to go home and not talk to anyone.

So, we can combine them: 0 = (13864*p - 13807*p) - 741 Which simplifies to: 0 = 57*p - 741 Now, we need to isolate the variable 'p' on one side of the equation.

The December 2009 attack occurred in a neighborhood previously thought to be secure, demonstrating the unpredictable nature of violence in war-torn areas. The suicide car bombing took place near the former Afghan vice president's home, adding a political dimension to the attack.

The fact that the attack also impacted a hotel frequented by Westerners highlights the continued threat to foreign nationals in the region, which further complicates international efforts to assist and stabilize the country. As the attack was carried out by a suicide car bomber, this indicates a level of organization and commitment on the part of the perpetrator or their support network. Such methods are typically used as a way to maximize damage and casualties and are difficult to predict or prevent. The aftermath of the attack saw eight people killed and nearly 40 wounded, illustrating the human cost of such acts of terror. Neighborhoods that were once considered safe become sites of fear and insecurity, and the lives of innocent civilians are forever changed. In a city like Kabul, where international diplomatic efforts and peacekeeping missions take place, the potential for violence to escalate or derail important work is always present. The December 2009 suicide car bombing is just one example of the ongoing challenges faced by the Afghan government, international forces, and NGOs working in the region. The security situation in Kabul, and throughout Afghanistan, is complex and fraught with danger. Addressing the root causes of this instability – ineffective governance, corruption, lack of economic opportunity, and the allure of extremist ideologies – will require comprehensive, long-term strategies that promote peace and development in the country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: Larry Wilson and Richard Parker are at a Manhattan morgue where they see their deceased CEO Bernie Lomax. Larry falsely claims Bernie as his uncle, so he can get some of Bernie's possessions including Bernie's credit card. At the insurance company, Larry and Richard are quizzed by their boss and Arthur Hummel, the company's internal investigator, who ask the two if they have the US2 million that Bernie embezzled. They deny knowing where the money is, but their boss believes they're lying and fires them. He also sends Hummel after them, giving him two weeks to prove their guilt. Over dinner (paid for with Bernie's credit card, in one of its many uses), Larry tells Richard he found a key to a safe deposit box in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands and asks Richard if he will use the computer at work to see if the 2 million is in Bernie's account. At first Richard refuses but ultimately gives in. Meanwhile, in the Virgin Islands, a voodoo queen named Mobu is hired by mobsters to find the money Bernie stole. She sends two servants—Henry and Charles (Tom Wright)—to go to New York, get Bernie's body, use a voodoo ceremony to reanimate him, and bring him back to her so he can lead her to the money. Their attempts to bring Bernie back are plagued by accidents. They prepare in a bathroom at a sleazy porno theater for the voodoo ceremony, but having lost the sacrificial chicken, they use a pigeon instead. This limits Bernie's ability to walk toward the hidden money: he only moves when he hears music.

Article: Sandstorms hit northwestern China's Gansu Province and North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on the first day this year. According to Sun Landong,a meteorologist with the Lanzhou Meteorology Observatory,visibility was less than 100 meters in Minqin, a Gansu county near Inner Mongolia,because of sand. When visibility drops to less than 1 kilometer, it is called a sandstorm. The sandstorm in Minqin blew up dust in neighboring towns, such as Baiyin,Wuwei,Jinchang and Lanzhou,the capital city of Gansu Province Dust-laden winds also swept into Beijing. Brought by northwesterly blowing at more than 20 meters per second, dust first reached the capital's suburbs at 7 a. m.,downtown areas at 9 a. m. The winds,which died down during the night,brought the temperature down to as low as 8 0C below zero and many flights put off their planned time from the city's airport. It is quite rare for sandstorms,which are frequent between March and June,to happen in winter,when the earth is frozen. The sandstorms in Gansu and Inner Mongolia do not necessarily mean there will be more of them in the spring than last year,when they were serious,but Beijing is taking it very seriously. It is reported that Beijing will spend 6 billion yuan( US 725 million) in preventing sandstorms in the capital and has already set up a special team to make sure what causes them.

The presidential daughter appeared on Fox Business Network Friday and said her silence was deliberate. “I have chosen, and I made a conscientious decision a long time ago, that I was not going to get into the fray, and that means that I’ll absorb the body blows that come my way,” Trump told Maria Bartiromo. Instead, she says she wants to \\"focus on the task at hand, which is serving the American people and using this moment in my life to advance an agenda that I deeply believe in and feel very fortunate to be able to work on.\\" Ivanka Trump had taken flak for not publicly criticizing the policy of separating families at the border—in fact, that was the source of Bee's criticism.

Answer this question: Which best determines the number of wolves that can live in an area? pick from the following. * the amount of snow in the area each year * the number of birds that live in the area * the number of trees in the area * the amount of food available in the area. Answer:","completion":"The best determinant of the number of wolves that can live in an area is the amount of food available in the area. It's essential to understand that the factors mentioned - amount of snow, number of birds, and number of trees - can indirectly impact wolf populations; however, the availability of food resources is the most predominant factor affecting their numbers and survival. Wolves, as carnivorous predators, primarily depend on large ungulates such as elk, deer, moose, and caribou as their primary food source. The presence and abundance of these prey species are essential in sustaining a healthy wolf population. Let's further discuss how the other listed factors are related to food availability and their impact on the number of wolves in an area: 1. The amount of snow in the area each year: Snowfall can impact the accessibility of prey for wolves. Deep snow could make it difficult for wolves to hunt, and sometimes snow can provide an advantage to the prey species, like deer, which are better adapted to navigating snowy terrains than wolves. However, the primary relationship between snow and wolves is that heavy snow can cause the prey population to decrease due to scarcity of food, especially in extreme conditions. When there are fewer prey, it directly impacts the number of wolves an area can support. 2. The number of birds in the area: Birds can play a minor role in a wolf's diet, but they are not a primary food source. While they provide supplementary food in certain situations, birds don't strongly correlate with the number of wolves an area can support. However, the presence of certain bird species can serve as an indicator of a healthy ecosystem, which could indirectly suggest an adequate prey population for wolves. 3. The number of trees in the area: Trees in an area provide shelter and habitat for both wolves and their prey. Dense forests can offer hiding spots for wolves to stalk their prey and can also provide cover to protect their young. On the other hand, an area with fewer trees might not provide sufficient cover, making it challenging for wolves to thrive. However, the number of trees is still not a directly determining factor for the number of wolves that an area can support. In summary, the amount of food available in an area, mainly as large ungulates, is the most significant determinant of the number of wolves that can live in that area. The other factors mentioned can indirectly impact the number of wolves through their effect on prey populations, but they are not directly responsible for the wolf population size. A healthy and sustainable prey population is key to the survival and success of wolf populations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the name of the snuff mill that was replaced by a bridge?, using the article: The newest bridge across the Parrett is Cocklemoor Bridge, a pedestrian footbridge close to the Great Bow Bridge. It was erected in 2006 and forms part of the River Parrett Trail. The next bridge upstream is Bicknell's bridge, which was formerly known as Bickling bridge, which carries the road from Huish Episcopi to Muchelney. It replaced a footbridge in 1829 or 1830. At Muchelney the Westover Bridge carries a minor road over the river, and another minor road crosses on the Thorney Bridge close to the Thorney (or silent) Mill and a lock. The mill, with an iron overshot wheel, was built to grind corn in 1823. Another bridge and mill occur further upstream at Gawbridge west of Martock, where the mill has been the subject of a feasibility study by the South Somerset Hydropower Group. Carey's Mill Bridge was built of Ham stone in the 18th century and named after Carey's Mill, which originally occupied the site. It is surrounded by a collection of buildings known as the Parrett Iron Works, founded in 1855 on the site of a former snuff mill, which included a foundry, with a prominent chimney, ropewalk, workshops and several smaller workshops and cottages. The sluice which powered the waterwheel and sluice keeper's cottage still exist. Further south the river flows under the A303 near Norton-sub-Hamdon and the A356 near Chedington., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided article, the snuff mill that was replaced by a bridge was located on the site where Parrett Iron Works was later established, which is also the location of Carey's Mill Bridge. The article states that the Parrett Iron Works was founded in 1855 on the site of a former snuff mill, and Carey's Mill Bridge was built of Ham stone in the 18th century and named after Carey's Mill, which originally occupied the site. Although it does not directly mention the exact name of the snuff mill, it is safe to assume that it might have been referred to as 'Carey's Mill' since the bridge was named after it. This snuff mill was then replaced by the aforementioned establishment and their infrastructure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Solve this problem.","completion":"Let's start with the given equation: 131*g - 351 = 230*g - 102*g The first step to solving for 'g' would be to simplify both sides of the equation. To simplify the right side, we have to combine like terms, so we subtract 102g from 230g which gives: 131*g - 351 = 128*g Next, we'll isolate 'g' by getting all the terms with 'g' on one side of the equation and the constants on the other. We can start doing this by subtracting 128g from both sides of the equation. The new equation is: 131g - 128g = 351 This simplifies to: 3g = 351 To solve for 'g', we'll divide both sides of this equation by 3: g = 351 / 3 So: g = 117 This means that the solution for 'g' in the equation 131*g - 351 = 230*g - 102*g is g = 117."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here is an article: updated 4:48 AM EST, Fri November 7, 2014 (CNN) -- The director of the FBI defended Friday an agent's actions in impersonating an Associated Press reporter to track down a suspect -- a tactic criticized by the news agency as \\"unacceptable.\\" In a letter to the New York Times, FBI director James Comey said the deception had occurred in 2007, as the agency tried to solve a series of bomb threats and cyberattacks directed at a high school in the Seattle area. And he rebuffed criticism of the agency's methods, saying, \\"We do use deception at times to catch crooks, but we are acting responsibly and legally.\\" Comey said the agency had determined that the suspect was a narcissist and so set out to snare him making use of that. The agent who posed as an AP reporter \\"asked if the suspect would be willing to review a draft article about the threats and attacks, to be sure that the anonymous suspect was portrayed fairly,\\" he wrote. As a result of the suspect clicking on a link relating to the fake story, the agency was able to track him down using court-authorized tools, Comey said. \\"No actual story was published, and no one except the suspect interacted with the undercover 'A.P.' employee or saw the fake draft story,\\" he wrote. \\"Only the suspect was fooled, and it led to his arrest and the end of a frightening period for a high school.\\" However, AP executive editor Kathleen Carroll slammed the agency's tactics, according to an AP report. \\"This latest revelation of how the FBI misappropriated the trusted name of The Associated Press doubles our concern and outrage, expressed earlier to Attorney General Eric Holder, about how the agency's unacceptable tactics undermine AP and the vital distinction between the government and the press,\\" Carroll said in a statement. The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press sent a letter Thursday to Comey and Holder expressing its deep concern over what it said was an \\"inexcusable\\" failure to comply with their own offices' guidelines on impersonation of the news media. \\"The utilization of news media as a cover for delivery of electronic surveillance software is unacceptable. This practice endangers the media's credibility and creates the appearance that it is not independent of the government,\\" it said. \\"It undermines media organizations' ability to independently report on law enforcement. It lends itself to the appearance that media organizations are compelled to speak on behalf of the government.\\" In a letter sent to the Justice Department last week, the AP requested Holder's word that the Justice Department would never again misrepresent itself as the news agency, an AP report said. The AP also asked for policies to ensure the department does not impersonate other news organizations in the future. \\"The FBI both misappropriated the trusted name of The Associated Press and created a situation where our credibility could have been undermined on a large scale,\\" AP General Counsel Karen Kaiser wrote. \\"The FBI may have intended this false story as a trap for only one person. However, the individual could easily have reposted this story to social networks, distributing to thousands of people, under our name, what was essentially a piece of government disinformation.\\" Comey's letter said the methods used in the case were \\"proper and appropriate\\" under Justice Department and FBI guidelines at the time -- but acknowledged that higher approval levels would probably be needed for the use of such a technique today. \\"Every undercover operation involves 'deception,' which has long been a critical tool in fighting crime,\\" his letter concluded. \\"The F.B.I.'s use of such techniques is subject to close oversight, both internally and by the courts that review our work.\\" Write a title for it.","completion":"FBI Director Defends Agent's Impersonation of AP Reporter in 2007 Case, Amid News Agency's Criticism"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Later, while he is in the bathroom, she hears screams outside and goes naked to the window. Seeing a man attacking a young woman, she opens the window and the assailant runs away. When the media report the murder of a young woman near Terry's flat that night, he thinks the police should know what Sylvia saw but, to protect her, claims he was at the bedroom window. At a police lineup, neither he nor the victim Denise is able to pick out the attacker Carl. Despite the feeble evidence against him, Carl is put on trial for the assault and during the proceedings his lawyer proves that since Terry is short-sighted he could not have witnessed the incident. Carl goes free, leaving not only the police and the prosecution but also Denise and Sylvia aghast at Terry's ineptness. In the courtroom, Carl recognised Sylvia as the woman at the window. Desperate to warn her, Terry finds her at a ballet performance and tells her she must go to the police, but she refuses all further involvement.

Given the question: \\"Tenryū-class cruiser\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to? The answer is:","completion":"The Tenryū-class cruiser belongs to the category of mean of transportation, more specifically in the subcategory of naval ships or military vessels. The Tenryū-class cruisers were a type of warship class used by the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War I and World War II. The Tenryū-class cruisers were designed to be scout cruisers or the fleet's \\"eyes\\" during naval engagements. They were intended to serve as fast, light cruiser vessels with powerful weaponry that could perform duties such as reconnaissance, escorting, and screening of larger warships. They were developed following the trend of other naval powers in terms of producing smaller, faster, and more versatile ships. The Tenryū-class cruiser comprised of two vessels: the Tenryū and the Tatsuta. Both ships were commissioned during World War I and saw effective service in various engagements throughout their careers, most notably during World War II. The design of the Tenryū-class cruisers prioritized speed and firepower while sacrificing armor protection. They were equipped with an array of weapons, including four single 5.5-inch (140mm) guns, one 3-inch (76mm) anti-aircraft gun, and three Type 21 surface-to-air torpedoes. The ships also had a top speed of approximately 33 knots, which allowed them to effectively carry out their intended roles. During World War II, both ships of the Tenryū-class cruiser took part in major operations. The Tenryū participated in the invasion of the Philippines, the Battle of the Java Sea, and the Battle of Guadalcanal before being sunk by the USS Albacore submarine. The Tatsuta also participated in several operations, including the Battle of Midway and the Indian Ocean raid before being sunk by the submarine USS Sand Lance. In conclusion, the Tenryū-class cruiser falls under the category of mean of transportation, primarily in the naval ships or military vessels subcategory. They were crucial assets to the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War I and World War II, playing a crucial role in supporting larger warships and performing reconnaissance and escort missions. Although both ships were eventually sunk during World War II, their influence can still be felt today as a historical example of effective naval vessels designed with speed and firepower in mind."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They were both wearing shirts that said , \\" My daddy is the Fallen Angel \\" , it was extra cute , hehe . Give answer the following question using evidence from the above passage: Why are the kids wearing those shirts ?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the passage, it is difficult to determine the exact reason behind the kids wearing those shirts that read \\"My daddy is the Fallen Angel.\\" Nevertheless, we can suggest several possible scenarios drawn from the given context. 1. Expression of love and admiration: The shirts could symbolize the children's love and admiration for their father. By wearing shirts with a text referring to their dad as the \\"Fallen Angel,\\" the children are essentially paying tribute to him and showcasing their connection to him. The fact that the narrator finds the shirts \\"extra cute\\" suggests that this gesture is viewed positively by the observer. 2. Family theme or inside joke: The message on the shirts could be part of a family theme or an inside joke that the kids and their family members find amusing or meaningful. It is possible that \\"Fallen Angel\\" refers to an incident or an anecdote within the family circle, and the shirts are worn to reflect this shared understanding. 3. Parental choice: The choice to have the kids wear these shirts might have been made by their parents. The children, being very young, are unlikely to have chosen the shirts themselves. The parents might have thought it would be humorous or attractive to have their children wear matching shirts with the \\"My daddy is the Fallen Angel\\" text. 4. Public performance or event: The kids might be wearing those shirts as part of a public event or gathering, where wearing such outfits is appropriate or required. For instance, the family could be attending a themed party or a special occasion where people are encouraged to wear distinctive clothing with textual messages. In summary, although the specific reason behind the kids wearing those shirts is not explicitly mentioned in the passage, we can infer that it could either be an expression of love and admiration for their father, an inside joke, a decision made by the parents, or part of a public event."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A: The answer is:","completion":"A series circuit. I will explain step-by-step why it's called a series circuit: 1. In a series circuit, all the components are connected end-to-end in a single path so that the current flows through each component in turn. 2. Since there is only one loop in the circuit, the current has only one path to flow through. 3. If any part of the loop is interrupted, such as by a switch or a break in the wire, the current cannot flow through the rest of the circuit, causing the entire circuit's electric current to cease. 4. This characteristic of cessation of current upon interruption, combined with the single-loop nature of the circuit, justifies calling it a series circuit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the answer: Which element is last alphabetically in the Periodic Table?","completion":"Zirconium is the element that appears last alphabetically in the Periodic Table. It is a chemical element with the symbol Zr and atomic number 40. Zirconium is a strong, lustrous, and corrosion-resistant transition metal with a silver-white appearance. The element's name is derived from the Persian word \\"zargun\\" which translates to \\"gold-colored.\\" However, despite the name, zirconium exhibits a silver-white hue rather than a golden one. Discovered in 1789 by German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth, zirconium is mainly obtained from minerals like zircon and baddeleyite. Today, zirconium is primarily used in a variety of applications, including as an alloying agent in materials that must withstand extreme conditions, such as high temperatures and corrosive environments. Due to its remarkable resistance to corrosion, zirconium has found use in the chemical industry where it constitutes a component of pumps, valves, and heat exchangers. It plays a significant role in the nuclear industry because of its low neutron-absorption cross-section, making it an ideal material for cladding fuel rods in nuclear reactors. Moreover, zirconium compounds have found application in various industries. For instance, zircon – a zirconium silicate – is used as an opacifier and refractory material in ceramics, while zirconium oxide is valued for its toughness and used in cutting tools, abrasive materials, and dental implants. Overall, zirconium's unique properties and diverse applications make it an important element in numerous industrial and technological advancements. Although it may be the last alphabetically in the Periodic Table, its significance in the fields of metallurgy, technology, and science should by no means be underestimated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We have the equation: 686 * w = 466 * w + 2664 - 12344 2. We want to solve for \\"w,\\" so first, let's move the term with \\"w\\" on the right side of the equation to the left side. To do this, we'll subtract 466 * w from both sides: 686 * w - 466 * w = 2664 - 12344 3. Now, since both terms on the left side have \\"w,\\" we can combine them: (686 - 466) * w = 2664 - 12344 4.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who considers Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny the best metal album of all time? ? As Opeth's primary songwriter and lyricist, vocalist/guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt heads the direction of Opeth's sound. He was influenced at a young age by the 1970s progressive rock bands King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Camel, P.F.M., Hawkwind, and Gracious, and by heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Slayer, Death, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Celtic Frost, King Diamond, Morbid Angel, Voivod, and, most importantly, Judas Priest. Åkerfeldt considers Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny (1976) the best metal album of all time, and notes that there was a time when he listened only to Judas Priest. While warming up before Opeth concerts, Åkerfeldt frequently sings \\"Here Come the Tears\\" from Judas Priest's third album Sin After Sin (1977). Åkerfeldt later discovered progressive rock and folk music, both of which had a profound impact on the sound of the band.Opeth's distinct sound mixes death metal with progressive rock. Steve Huey of AllMusic refers to Opeth's \\"epic, progressive death metal style\\". Ryan Ogle of Blabbermouth described Opeth's sound as incorporating \\"the likes of folk, funk, blues, '70s rock, goth and a laundry list of other sonic oddities into their trademark progressive death style.\\" In his review of Opeth's 2001 album Blackwater Park, AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia wrote, \\"Tracks start and finish in seemingly arbitrary fashion, usually traversing ample musical terrain, including acoustic guitar and solo piano passages, ambient soundscapes, stoner rock grooves, and Eastern-tinged melodies—any of which are subject to savage punctuations of death metal fury at any given moment.\\" Åkerfeldt commented on the diversity of Opeth's music: I don't see the point of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be impossible for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music.

Write an article with the title: \\"Telescope May Find Light From Earliest Galaxies\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Telescope May Find Light From Earliest Galaxies Introduction The quest to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos has led humanity to develop some of the most sophisticated technologies and instruments. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), slated for launch in 2021, is one such groundbreaking marvel of engineering. With unparalleled capabilities that far surpass its predecessors, the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope, JWST is expected to uncover secrets from the very beginning of our universe, including the possibility of detecting light from the earliest galaxies. History of Telescopes The first known practical telescope was invented in the early seventeenth century by Dutch mathematician and astronomer Hans Lippershey. However, it was the works of Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei that garnered the attention of the world to the power of telescopes. Since then, telescopes have come a long way and undergone a multitude of advancements, including the iconic Hubble Space Telescope, which has been in orbit since 1990. JWST is envisioned as the scientific successor to Hubble. Named after NASA administrator James E. Webb, who played a pivotal role in the Apollo program, JWST is a collaborative effort between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The James Webb Space Telescope JWST is equipped with a large, segmented, and gold-coated mirror that measures 6.5 meters (over 21 feet) in diameter. This colossal mirror allows the telescope to collect more light and observe objects with greater detail than its predecessors. JWST is also configured to observe in the infrared spectrum, which is crucial in detecting light from the early universe. These capabilities make it possible for JWST to probe deeper into the cosmos than ever before, reaching regions that have been inaccessible until now. Discovering the Light from the Earliest Galaxies The universe came into existence nearly 13.8 billion years ago with the Big Bang. As the universe expanded and cooled, hydrogen atoms combined to form the first stars and galaxies. Detecting the light from these ancient celestial bodies is vital in understanding the origins of the universe and its evolution. Due to the expansion of the universe, the light emitted by these early galaxies has been stretched and redshifted to the infrared spectrum, making it challenging for most telescopes to detect. JWST is uniquely tailored to tackle this challenge. Its infrared capabilities, combined with its powerful mirror, enable the telescope to potentially capture light from faint galaxies that formed approximately 100 to 250 million years after the Big Bang. This remarkable feat will provide astronomers with invaluable information about the birth and evolution of these galaxies, helping us uncover the mysteries of the early universe. The First Galaxies and Their Impact on the Universe Observing the earliest galaxies will shed light on how they were formed, their cluster patterns, and how they interacted with dark matter. Studying these galaxies will also provide insights into the process of reionization – when the universe transitioned from being opaque to transparent due to the formation of stars and galaxies. Reionization allowed photons to travel through space, paving the way for the formation of more complex structures like larger galaxies, stars, and eventually, planets. The James Webb Space Telescope's groundbreaking capabilities are expected to revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos. By potentially capturing the elusive light from the earliest galaxies, we can hope to answer some of the most profound questions about the origins and evolution of our universe. With these extraordinary accomplishments on the horizon, the age of cosmic discovery is poised to enter a thrilling new chapter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize this article: Stock Chart for Goldman Sachs Group Inc/The (GS) Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein’s 19 million compensation for 2010, almost double the prior year, ended two years in which the firm’s top executives gave up cash bonuses. Blankfein’s pay included 5.4 million in cash, 12.6 million in restricted stock, a 600,000 salary and about 464,000 in other benefits, a proxy statement from the New York- based firm showed. Blankfein’s 9.8 million pay for 2009 included 9 million in restricted stock plus salary and other compensation. Cash awards are back at Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, after a 38 percent drop in annual earnings and a year in which the stock price ended close to where it began. While pay is up from 2008, when Blankfein, 56, and six other senior officers got no bonuses, it remains below Blankfein’s record-setting 67.9 million award for 2007. “The fact that they would return to a more market-based pay is probably not surprising” after 2008 and 2009, said Rose Marie Orens, a senior partner at Compensation Advisory Partners LLC in New York. “They’re not quite back to anything remotely like what they paid in the prior years.” Goldman Sachs’s 2010 share performance -- a decline of less than half of 1 percent -- outstripped competitors including Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS), which was the second- biggest U.S. securities firm after Goldman Sachs before both converted to banks in 2008. Shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), which reported a record profit last year, rose 1.8 percent during the year. ‘Difficult Market Conditions’ “While our performance in 2010 was not as strong as in 2009 due to difficult market conditions for much of the year, we continued to create value for our shareholders and prudently manage our firm from a risk perspective,” Goldman Sachs said in the proxy. All 30 members of the management committee received only restricted stock for their 2009 bonuses and four of them --Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar, 55, President and Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn, 50, and Vice Chairmen J. Michael Evans, 53, and John S. Weinberg, 54 -- received the same 9 million award as Blankfein. For 2010, Goldman Sachs once again matched those four executives’ bonuses to Blankfein’s 12.6 million in restricted stock and 5.4 million in cash. All four also received a 600,000 salary in 2010. ‘Partnership Mentality’ “They’ve had a history of paying their top five like partners,” Orens said. “It’s unusual, but it really comes from their partnership mentality.” The firm disclosed in January that Blankfein’s salary will increase to 2 million in 2011 and that Cohn, Viniar, Evans and Weinberg will each receive a 1.85 million salary starting this year. Each of them had received a 600,000 salary since 1999, the year the firm became a public company. Blankfein and eight deputies reaped a total of 125 million during 2010 from their investments in private equity and hedge funds managed by the firm, the proxy disclosed. Blankfein’s payments, which included profits and any return of capital, totaled 27.2 million, outstripping his compensation. After Blankfein, the largest fund distributions were 23.3 million to General Counsel Gregory K. Palm; 20.2 million to Cohn; 16.7 million to Viniar; and 13.7 million to Evans. The others disclosed in the filing were 10.9 million to Vice Chairman Michael S. Sherwood; 6.4 million apiece to Weinberg and General Counsel Esta E. Stecher, and 430,000 to Alan M. Cohen, global head of compliance. Goldman Sachs’s executives stand to earn more cash bonuses in future years under a long-term incentive plan, the LTIP, disclosed in the proxy. The payments are contingent on two financial measures: return on equity and book value per share. Board’s Choice The initial measurement period is three years and the board can extend it through the end of 2018. The notional value of the award for all five executives named in the proxy was 7 million, a figure that wasn’t included in the 2010 compensation because it won’t be delivered for three years. For the executives to receive the awards in full, return on equity, or ROE, must average 10 percent and book value per share must rise an average of 7 percent, the proxy shows. They will receive 150 percent of the bonus if the average ROE is 15 percent or more and book value per share climbs an average of 12 percent or more. The ROE target is below the firm’s long-stated goal of achieving 20 percent return on tangible equity, which equates to more than 15 percent ROE, over the economic cycle. Eleanor Bloxham, president of the Corporate Governance Alliance in Columbus, Ohio, said Goldman Sachs seemed to be responding to regulators’ efforts to align pay to the firm’s longer-term performance. ‘Paying out Cash’ “Going forward I’m pleased that the LTIP cash will include these deferral mechanisms so that it doesn’t encourage risk- taking and that risk measures look at longer-term horizons,” she said. “There’s still a way to go in this year’s plan because they’re paying out cash.” To be sure, all of the executives own company stock worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Blankfein owned 3.29 million shares as of March 7, the proxy disclosed, worth 527.6 million at the 160.23 share price on April 1. Cohn’s 1.96 million shares were worth 313.4 million and Viniar’s 1.89 million shares were worth 302.4 million. The SEC requires that the company’s proxy disclose how much compensation executives received during the fiscal year. Under that methodology, which includes awards received during 2010 for performance in prior years, Blankfein received a total of 14.1 million in compensation. Goldman Sachs’s board has unanimously recommended that the firm give shareholders a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation every year. The firm is set to hold its annual shareholder meeting at 9:30 a.m. on May 6 in Jersey City, New Jersey.

The Sisters of Saint Joseph of Boston, Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, the Sisters of St Francis of Philadelphia and the Benedictine Sisters of Mt Angel – all investors in the bank – have put their name to a proposal to review its remuneration policies, after it emerged its five most senior employees were collectively awarded 69.5m (£43m) in pay last year. The securities and exchange commission disclosed the challenge in a filing ahead of Goldman Sachs' annual meeting next month. The nuns asked that \\"shareholders request that the board's compensation committee initiate a review of our company's senior executive compensation policies and make available a summary report of that review by 1 October, 2011 (omitting confidential information and processed at a reasonable cost). We request that the report include: 1. An evaluation of whether our senior executive compensation packages (including, but not limited to, options, benefits, perks, loans and retirement agreements) are 'excessive' and should be modified. 2. An exploration of how sizeable layoffs and the level of pay of our lowest paid workers impact senior executive pay. 3. An analysis of the way in which fluctuations in revenues impact: a) the company's compensation pool; b) the compensation of the company's top 25 senior executives; and c) the company's shareholders.\\" The nuns have made their feelings on Goldman's pay levels clear in previous years, with about as much success as the coalition government in its attempts to limit UK bank bonuses. Chief executive Lloyd Blankfein, who has claimed to be doing \\"God's work\\" at Goldman, saw his pay reach 14m in 2010, with four other senior executives receiving a similar amount. Goldman said it would resist the request. \\"Shareholders already have access to the information necessary to understand and assess the compensation decisions made with respect to our senior executives, and the firm as a whole. Our board believes that the preparation of the requested report would be a distraction to our compensation committee and our board, would entail an unjustified cost to our firm and would not provide shareholders with any meaningful information.\\" ||||| Summary:","completion":"In 2010, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Title: Cool! Review: Never had a speedloader before this one. It is easy to use and as compact as it can be. Simply put six rounds in and twist...they are held firmly in place and ready to go. The knob feels like it would \\"untwist\\" and release the rounds on its own, but that hasn't happened. When you're ready to load, just pop out the cylinder on your revolver, use the plunger to expel the spent casings, push the new rounds in with the speedloader, then twist the knob to release.One caveat...loading is definitely a two-handed operation. You have to hold the gun's cylinder in place, or when you rotate the knob, the cylinder will rotate with it, and nothing will happen. So, it is necessary to hold the cylinder or the black plastic part of the speed loader in place before you rotate the knob. Kinda fiddly, but with practice it isn't hard...certainly easier than loading six rounds by hand.So far, the unit seems solid and it works great. The price is right, too. I only wish I had gotten more than one. The answer is:","completion":"The customer appears to be satisfied with the product. In their review, they describe multiple aspects of the product they find positive, such as the ease of use, compact design, and firm hold of the rounds. The customer also mentions that the speedloader is more convenient than loading six rounds by hand, which indicates that the product meets their needs. Moreover, the customer addresses a potential concern about the knob untwisting and releasing the rounds unintentionally but negates it by saying that it hasn't happened. Thus, alleviating the concern and showing that the customer is satisfied with the product's performance. Although the reviewer does express a caveat that loading the speedloader is a two-handed operation and could be considered fiddly, they acknowledge that practice makes the process easier. This does not seem to have a significant negative impact on their satisfaction with the product. Furthermore, the customer states that the unit appears solid and works well, and they appreciate the affordability of the speedloader. They even mention wishing they had purchased more than one, which indicates a high level of satisfaction with the product. In conclusion, the customer's overall tone and description of the product's features and performance can be interpreted as an indication of satisfaction with the speedloader.

Founded in 1982, in France, EASE now has an international membership from diverse backgrounds, professional experiences, and job titles.","completion":"Based on the information provided in the given text, it can be determined that the sentence \\"EASE members come from all over the globe\\" is true. This conclusion can be drawn from the statement in the text that says the European Association of Science Editors (EASE) \\"now has an international membership from diverse backgrounds, professional experiences, and job titles.\\" Although the text does not explicitly mention that the EASE members come from every continent or every country in the world, the term \\"international membership\\" strongly suggests that the members are not only from Europe but from various parts of the world. That's because \\"international\\" refers to involving more than a single country. Hence, the EASE members are likely to come from multiple countries and regions across the globe. Created in France, the organization has broadened its scope and reach since its establishment in 1982, catering to those interested in science communication and editing worldwide. It comprises members who are diverse not only geographically but also in terms of their professional backgrounds and job titles. This could potentially include people working in different areas of science communication and editing, adding to the evidence that its members are globally dispersed. It's important to note that while the exact geographic distribution or representation is not detailed in the text (for example, it does not specify whether there are members from both developed and developing countries, or from countries in every continent), it is reasonable to deduce that the term \\"international membership\\" implies a global presence. In conclusion, given the international membership of EASE and the fact that the members come from diverse backgrounds, it is valid to say that EASE members come from all over the globe. Although the exact specifics of their geographic distribution aren't provided, the use of the term \\"international\\" is a strong indicator of their global presence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Available options: (A). yes (B). no","completion":"(A). yes One of the subjects of a treatise by Ibn Sina, also known as Avicenna, is metaphysics. Ibn Sina was a Persian polymath and one of the most significant thinkers in the history of Islamic philosophy. His work covered numerous disciplines, including medicine, astronomy, alchemy, and psychology. However, he is best remembered for his immense contributions to the field of philosophy. In his vast philosophical corpus, Ibn Sina wrote several treatises on the subjects of logic, ethics, and metaphysics, but his most famous work in philosophy is \\"Al‑Shifa\\" (The Healing) and \\"Al‑Najat\\" (The Deliverance). Within these treatises, he covers both the theoretical and practical aspects of these disciplines and builds upon the works of earlier philosophers like Aristotle and al-Farabi. These works played a crucial role in transmitting the ideas of Greek philosophy to the Islamic intellectual tradition. \\"Al‑Shifa\\" is a large encyclopedic work divided into four sections: logic, natural sciences, mathematics, and metaphysics. In his treatise on metaphysics, Ibn Sina elaborates on the nature of existence, causality, and the relationship between the material and immaterial worlds, developing and extending Aristotle's metaphysics. Notably, he introduces the argument for the existence of a \\"Necessary Existent,\\" which is a precursor to the arguments for the existence of God in later Western philosophy. Aside from his discussions on the nature of being and existence, Ibn Sina's treatise on metaphysics delves into the organization and structure of the universe, including the celestial spheres and the principles of motion. He also investigates questions about the nature of the human soul, arguing that the soul is independent of the body and can achieve immortality. In conclusion, one of the subjects of a treatise by Ibn Sina is metaphysics, which can be found in his famous works, \\"Al‑Shifa\\" and \\"Al‑Najat.\\" His contributions to this field not only had a significant impact on Islamic intellectual traditions but also influenced Western philosophy in the later Middle Ages and Renaissance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Question: \\"Which causes a smaller loss, Stoke shift loss or internal optical losses?\\" Context: \\"Among the challenges being faced to improve the efficiency of LED-based white light sources is the development of more efficient phosphors. As of 2010, the most efficient yellow phosphor is still the YAG phosphor, with less than 10% Stoke shift loss. Losses attributable to internal optical losses due to re-absorption in the LED chip and in the LED packaging itself account typically for another 10% to 30% of efficiency loss. Currently, in the area of phosphor LED development, much effort is being spent on optimizing these devices to higher light output and higher operation temperatures. For instance, the efficiency can be raised by adapting better package design or by using a more suitable type of phosphor. Conformal coating process is frequently used to address the issue of varying phosphor thickness.\\" Answer: The answer is:","completion":"Stoke shift loss causes a smaller loss compared to internal optical losses. Step 1: Identify the information given in the context. - YAG phosphor has less than 10% Stoke shift loss. - Internal optical losses account for 10-30% of efficiency loss. Step 2: Compare the losses. - Stoke shift loss: less than 10% - Internal optical losses: 10-30% Step 3: Determine which loss is smaller. Based on the information given in the context, the Stoke shift loss (less than 10%) is smaller than the internal optical losses (10-30%).

Write an article based on this summary: Swallow a large mouthful of air. Force yourself to burp Take a shower with an abrupt temperature change. Trigger sudden emotions.","completion":"Title: The Science Behind Triggering a Release: Sudden Emotions, Temperature Changes, and More Introduction Ever felt the need to release stress or a built-up emotion, but felt unable to do so? Sometimes our bodies require a little push to clear the air and make us feel more relaxed. In this article, we will explore some interesting ways that one can trigger a release in their body, allowing them to ease tension and feel lighter. Read on as we discuss swallowing a large mouthful of air, forcing yourself to burp, taking a shower with an abrupt temperature change, and triggering sudden emotions. 1. Swallowing a Large Mouthful of Air Step 1: Inhale deeply Start by taking a deep breath, filling up your lungs with fresh air. This action can help increase your blood's oxygen levels, leading to improved concentration and alertness. Step 2: Swallow the air While holding this large volume of air inside your lungs, use your throat muscles to swallow a significant portion of it. As the air moves down your esophagus, it will create pressure to facilitate a physical release. 2. Forcing Yourself to Burp Step 1: Create pressure After swallowing a large mouthful of air, you will need to apply pressure in the form of a forced burp. Since burping is a natural process to expel excess air from the digestive tract, this can lead to a feeling of relief. Step 2: Release Allow the burp to come out naturally, offering an instant release of tension. As the air escapes, you should feel lighter and more relaxed. 3. Taking a Shower with Abrupt Temperature Change Step 1: Begin with your preferred temperature Start by taking a shower at your ideal, comfortable water temperature. Allow your body to adjust to the warmth and enjoy the sensation as you begin to relax. Step 2: Switch to cold water Without warning, quickly turn the shower knob to a significantly lower temperature, so that the once warm water is now cold. This abrupt and unexpected change will shock your system, triggering the release of endorphins, which will help to reduce stress and tension. 4. Triggering Sudden Emotions Step 1: Identify the emotional trigger Consider which emotions are building up inside you. Pick one that needs a release and think of a situation or memory that can stir up these emotions. Step 2: Embrace the emotional release Allow yourself to feel the full spectrum of these emotions and embrace the catharsis that follows when you let go. This emotional release can lead to a state of well-being and overall mental and physical relaxation. Conclusion Our bodies often require a physical or emotional release to alleviate built-up tension and stress. By following these methods outlined in this article – swallowing a large mouthful of air, forcing yourself to burp, taking a shower with an abrupt temperature change, and triggering sudden emotions – you can successfully achieve a renewed sense of relaxation and satisfaction, leaving you lighter and more at ease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These organizations both called for major financial and economic reforms that would aid the struggling agrarian communities and bolster their economic stability. Key demands that were championed by both the Greenback Party and Farmers' Alliances include: 1. Monetary Policy Reform: Both movements recognized the need for reforming the nation's monetary system. The Greenback Party and Farmers' Alliances advocated for expanding the currency supply by increasing the circulation of greenbacks – the fiat paper money issued by the federal government during the Civil War. They believed that this inflationary policy would raise crop prices, ease the repayment of debts, and benefit the farmers. 2. Increased Availability of Credit: One major concern shared by these organizations was the difficulty farmers faced in obtaining loans to support their agricultural operations. They believed that the national banks catered mostly to the interests of Eastern industrialists and businesses, and the high-interest loans provided by local banks were too expensive for struggling farmers. As a result, both called for the establishment of public or cooperative banking systems that would lend money at lower interest rates, making credit more accessible to the agrarian communities. 3. Regulation of Railroads and Transportation: The high transportation costs due to unregulated railroad monopolies impacted the farmers' profits significantly. Both the Greenback Party and Farmers' Alliances demanded the stricter regulation of railroads and other transportation-related industries to ensure fair prices and treatment for farmers. They sought the transition of railroads and related services into public utilities, which would prevent monopolistic practices and provide better cost management of this vital resource. 4. Progressive Income Tax: An important aspect of the Greenback Party and Farmers' Alliances was their desire for a more equitable distribution of wealth. They supported the introduction of a progressive income tax, which would impose higher tax rates on wealthier individuals, thus helping to reduce income inequality and channel more resources towards the less privileged classes. 5. Direct Election of Senators: At the time, U.S. Senators were chosen by state legislatures, which often led to corruption and the selection of Senators who did not adequately represent the interests of farmers and laborers. Both movements advocated for direct election of Senators by the people, thereby promoting more democratic representation and addressing the concerns of rural populations. While neither the Greenback Party nor the Farmers' Alliances were ultimately successful in achieving their goals, they contributed to the eventual formation of the more influential Populist Party in the 1890s. This movement, which combined the objectives of these earlier organizations with new demands, significantly influenced U.S. politics and helped to bring about some long-lasting reforms in the nation's financial and political systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Analyze the question: The question is asking what activity a bored child might choose to do. This suggests we are looking for a fun and engaging activity that can alleviate boredom. 2. Review the options: We have five possible answers - walk, change shoes, play tag, smell smoke, and reach over. 3. Evaluate each option: - Walk: While walking could be a chosen activity, it is not necessarily the most exciting or engaging for a bored child. However, it is still a better option than some of the others. - Change shoes: This action does not seem related to alleviating boredom, as it is more of a functional activity rather than a fun one. - Play tag: This is a fun, engaging, and interactive game that children commonly enjoy. It involves physical activity and social interaction, both of which can effectively alleviate boredom. - Smell smoke: This option does not seem to be related to alleviating boredom at all. The act of smelling smoke is not an activity that a bored child would typically do to entertain themselves. - Reach over: This action also does not seem to be related to alleviating boredom. It is a simple physical movement, and not an engaging activity for a child. 4. Choose the best option: Based on the evaluation of each option, \\"play tag\\" stands out as the most engaging and fun activity that a bored child might choose to do. 5.

When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease. John is studying a species in two similar countries, country A and country B. Country A has large population, but country B has small population of that species. John is pondering about how this species would fare in the future in these two countries. Would country A see higher or lower growth rate of the species than country B? Answer:","completion":"Based on the principles of population dynamics in nature, it is likely that Country A would have a lower growth rate of the species than Country B. This conclusion can be drawn by considering the following factors: 1. Resource availability - As described, when there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can reproduce more easily, resulting in a high birth rate, and thus, a high growth rate of the species. Since Country A has a large population of the species, it is likely that the resources are more limited compared to Country B, which has a smaller population. Consequently, the species in Country A could face increased competition for limited resources, making it difficult for each individual to thrive, reproduce, and contribute to population growth. 2. Carrying capacity - The carrying capacity refers to the maximum number of individuals of a species that a given environment can sustain. When an ecosystem reaches its carrying capacity for a specific species, the growth rate of that species decreases. As the population size in Country A is large, it is possible that it could be approaching or has already reached its carrying capacity for the species. On the other hand, the population of the same species in Country B is smaller, indicating that there might be more room for population growth before reaching its carrying capacity. 3. Density-dependent factors - As population density increases, some factors can cause higher mortality rates or decreased reproduction in a species due to increased competition. These factors, known as density-dependent factors, include limited food supply, increased predation, competition for mates, and increased exposure to diseases and parasites. In Country A, with a larger population, these density-dependent factors could contribute to a lower growth rate when compared to Country B. 4. Genetic diversity - Although not directly related to population growth rate, genetic diversity within a population is important for long-term sustainability. A smaller population, such as in Country B, is more prone to losing genetic diversity due to inbreeding. While this might not influence the immediate growth rate, it can result in long-term negative effects on the population, such as decreased adaptability, increased vulnerability to environmental changes, and a reduced ability to cope with diseases. In conclusion, considering the elements that influence population growth in nature, it is likely that Country A would experience a lower growth rate of the species compared to Country B. However, it is essential to keep in mind that actual outcomes might depend on various external factors, such as intervention efforts, changes in environmental conditions, or the introduction of new species into the ecosystem that could affect the dynamics of species growth."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

It was constructed by Canadian-born French military engineer Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, Marquis de Lotbinière between October 1755 and 1757, during the action in the \\"North American theater\\" of the Seven Years' War, often referred to in the US as the French and Indian War. The fort was of strategic importance during the 18th-century colonial conflicts between Great Britain and France, and again played an important role during the American Revolutionary War. The site controlled a river portage alongside the mouth of the rapids-infested La Chute River, in the 3.5 miles (5.6 km) between Lake Champlain and Lake George. It was thus strategically placed for the competition over trade routes between the British-controlled Hudson River Valley and the French-controlled Saint Lawrence River Valley. The terrain amplified the importance of the site. Both lakes were long and narrow and oriented north–south, as were the many ridge lines of the Appalachian Mountains, which extended as far south as Georgia. The mountains created nearly impassable terrains to the east and west of the Great Appalachian Valley that the site commanded. The name \\"Ticonderoga\\" comes from the Iroquois word tekontaró:ken, meaning \\"it is at the junction of two waterways\\".During the 1758 Battle of Carillon, 4,000 French defenders were able to repel an attack by 16,000 British troops near the fort. In 1759, the British returned and drove a token French garrison from the fort. During the American Revolutionary War, when the British controlled the fort, it was attacked in May 1775 in the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Green Mountain Boys and other state militia under the command of Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold, who captured it in the surprise attack.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Choose your answer? Which of these would best help a scientist discover a new planet? OPTIONS: a). making a model of outer space b). asking questions to other scientists c). collecting information about planets d). looking at the night sky with a telescope","completion":"Option d). looking at the night sky with a telescope would best help a scientist discover a new planet. A telescope is a crucial tool for the observation and study of celestial objects, including planets. There are several reasons why using a telescope to look at the night sky would be the most effective way of discovering a new planet among the given options. First, telescopes allow scientists to observe the vast expanse of the universe more clearly and in more detail than the naked eye can. Telescopes can magnify the appearance of distant objects, making it easier to spot smaller or fainter objects, such as new planets, which may not be visible without their aid. The ability to study these faraway celestial objects up close is invaluable to scientists in their efforts to discover new planets. Second, telescopes can be equipped with specialized instruments, such as spectrographs, to analyze the light emitted by celestial objects, including planets. This can provide critical data about the composition, temperature, and other properties of these objects. The analysis of this data can help scientists identify unknown celestial bodies, including previously undiscovered planets. Third, modern telescopes have the capability to operate across a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum. This versatility means that they can detect objects not only in visible light, but in other wavelengths such as infrared, radio, ultraviolet, or even X-ray. This extended range of observation increases the chances of detecting new planets that may not be detectable through visible light alone. Compared to the other options, using a telescope is a more direct and efficient way to discover a new planet. While making a model of outer space (option a) could help scientists visualize the positions and characteristics of known celestial objects, it is unlikely to lead to the discovery of new planets which were previously unknown. Option b, asking questions to other scientists, can be a valuable way to exchange information and ideas, but it would not necessarily lead to the discovery of a new planet. It would largely depend on the knowledge and findings of other scientists. Option c, collecting information about planets, might increase our understanding of known planets, but it would not directly contribute to the discovery of a new planet by actually observing the night sky and searching for undiscovered celestial bodies. In conclusion, option d). looking at the night sky with a telescope is the most effective approach to discovering a new planet among the presented options. It allows scientists to directly observe celestial objects with a level of detail and precision that cannot be achieved through other methods, and its versatility offers a broader range of observations to increase the likelihood of finding previously unknown planets."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the best way to: Bake the pumpkin in oven at 350 degrees.","completion":"Baking a pumpkin in the oven at 350°F (175°C) is a simple and delicious way to enjoy the flavors of fall. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you achieve the best results: 1. Preheat your oven: Set your oven to 350°F (175°C) and allow it to preheat while you prepare the pumpkin. 2. Select the right pumpkin: Choose a small pie or sugar pumpkin that is specifically meant for baking and not a large carving pumpkin. The smaller pumpkins tend to have sweeter and more tender flesh. 3. Clean the pumpkin: Thoroughly rinse the pumpkin with water to remove any dirt or debris. Pat it dry with a clean towel. 4. Cut the pumpkin: Use a sharp knife and cutting board to carefully cut the pumpkin in half or into quarters, depending on its size. Be extra cautious while cutting through the thick skin to avoid any accidents. 5. Scoop out the seeds and fibrous strands: Use a sturdy spoon or a pumpkin scraper to remove the seeds and strands from the pumpkin halves. Save the seeds for roasting, if you like. 6. Optional: Season the pumpkin: If you want a savory pumpkin dish, brush the cut sides of the pumpkin with olive oil and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and any herbs or spices that you prefer. For a sweeter dish, brush the pumpkin with melted butter and then sprinkle with cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, or the sweetener and spices of your choice. 7. Prepare the baking sheet: Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil for easy cleanup. Place a wire rack on the baking sheet if you have one. 8. Arrange the pumpkin: Place the pumpkin halves or quarters cut-side down on the lined baking sheet or wire rack. This will allow the moisture to escape and help the pumpkin cook evenly. 9. Bake the pumpkin: Place the baking sheet with the pumpkin in the preheated oven and bake for 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the size of your pumpkin pieces. It is ready when a fork can easily be inserted into the flesh. 10. Check for doneness: Keep an eye on the pumpkin as it bakes to ensure it does not overcook or burn. To test for doneness, insert a fork into the flesh. If it slides in easily, the pumpkin is cooked thoroughly. 11. Rest and cool the pumpkin: Once the pumpkin is fully cooked, remove it from the oven and let it cool on the baking sheet or wire rack for about 10-15 minutes. 12. Prepare pumpkin puree, if desired: Once the pumpkin is cool enough to handle, you can scoop out the flesh and discard the skin. For a smooth puree, process the flesh using a food processor, immersion blender, or a fine mesh sieve. 13. Enjoy or store: You can now use the cooked pumpkin or pumpkin puree in various recipes such as pumpkin soup, pumpkin pie, or even pumpkin smoothies! Otherwise, store the pumpkin in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week or freeze for up to three months. By following this detailed guide, you can easily bake pumpkin at 350°F (175°C) and enjoy the delicious, versatile results!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Some are, so she is pale but not pure white, with red or blue eyes, as a true albino would be,” he explained. “Omo is the only pale giraffe we are currently aware of, but we have also observed leucistic waterbuck, Cape buffalo and ostrich in Tarangire. “Omo appears to get along with the other giraffes, she has always been seen with a large group of normally coloured giraffe, they don't seem to mind her different colouring.” Photo: DEREK LEE/ CATERS NEWS However he warned that her unique colour could make her a target for poachers in the African park. He added: “Omo is now 15 months old. She survived her first year as a small calf, which is the most dangerous time for a young giraffe due to lion, leopard and hyena preying on them. “Her chances of surviving to adulthood are good but adult giraffes are regularly poached for bush meat, and her colouration might make her a target. “We and our partners are working on giraffe conservation and anti-poaching to help give Omo and her relatives a better chance of survival. “We hope that she lives a long life and that someday she has calves of her own.” The WNI blog adds: “We were lucky enough to see her again this January, almost exactly one year [after the first sighting]. “We are thrilled that she is still alive and well. A local lodge guide christened her Omo, after a popular brand of detergent here.” ||||| Researchers recently caught a glimpse of a white giraffe named Omo in the Tanzania’s Tarangire National Park. (Photo: Screenshot) Researchers recently caught a glimpse of a white giraffe named Omo in the Tanzania's Tarangire National Park. Wild Nature Institute researchers first spotted the unusual giraffe when she was a calf during a population survey in 2015, according to a statement from the organization. “A local lodge guide christened her Omo, after a popular brand of detergent here,” the organization, which conducts scientific research, said in a blog post. While Omo may appear to be an albino, she is actually leucistic, according to the organization. “One way to tell the difference between albino and leucistic animals is that albino individuals lack melanin everywhere, including in the eyes, so the resulting eye color is red from the underlying blood vessels,” the organization said.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? of an overripe episode of tv 's dawson 's creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story","completion":"The sentiment of the given sentence appears to be negative. In order to understand this, let's break down and analyze the components of the sentence: 1. \\"of an overripe episode of tv 's dawson 's creek\\": The word “overripe” typically carries a negative connotation, implying that something has gone past its peak and is no longer fresh or enjoyable. In this context, the implication is that the episode in question is stale and not at its best, regardless of whether the show itself is considered good or bad. As a result, this part of the sentence has a negative sentiment. 2. \\"and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story\\": This segment refers to a version of a love story that has been “recycled” and “dumbed-down.” The word “recycled” indicates that the story is unoriginal and has borrowed heavily from other sources, which is generally seen as negative. Similarly, “dumbed-down” implies that the story has been simplified and reduced to a lower level of quality or intellectual engagement, further contributing to the negative sentiment. Thus, by considering the individual components of the sentence, it becomes evident that the sentiment of the entire sentence is negative. The sentence suggests that the subject matter is stale, unoriginal, and has been cheapened or oversimplified, and these are all negative qualities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: austin was a nice person so she improved lee's situation. Given the context: How would Austin feel afterwards? Possible answers: great, angry, upset A:","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the context of the question to identify the key elements. In the question, the two main elements are: - Austin was a nice person. - Austin improved Lee's situation. Step 2: Understand the emotional impact of each element. As Austin is described as a nice person, it can be deduced that they would have good intentions and possibly feel positive emotions when helping others. Moreover, the fact that Austin improved Lee's situation indicates that something beneficial or good has been done for Lee due to Austin's actions. Step 3: Assess the possible answers based on the context and the emotional impact of each element. Great: This answer aligns with the context and actions of Austin, as they are a nice person who helped improve Lee's situation. The feelings of accomplishment and fulfillment of helping someone else are consistent with possibly feeling great afterwards. Angry: This answer is not in line with the context, as there is no indication that Austin would feel angry after helping someone, since they are described as a nice person. Upset: This answer also does not align with the context. As a nice person who improved someone's situation, there is no reason to assume Austin would feel upset afterwards. Step 4: Choose the answer that best aligns with the context and emotional impact. Based on the analysis in Steps 1-3, I would choose answer: A: Great Reason: Austin, being a nice person, likely feels a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction after helping to improve Lee's situation. This matches the emotional response of feeling great."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

In which city was the Arab League founded in 1945???","completion":"The Arab League, also known as the League of Arab States, was founded in the city of Cairo, Egypt, on March 22, 1945. Cairo, the capital of Egypt, is not only a pivotal city in the region but also a historical and cultural center of the Arab world. The establishment of the Arab League was a result of the efforts of several Arab countries seeking to promote political, economic, cultural, and social cooperation amongst its members. The initial founding members of the Arab League were Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Transjordan (now Jordan), and Yemen. Over the years, other Arab countries joined the organization, and it now represents 22 member states in total. The objectives of the Arab League include strengthening the relationships between its member states, coordinating their policies, ensuring non-intervention in domestic affairs, respect for the sovereignty of member states, and encouraging joint economic and military projects. It also aims to safeguard the national independence, sovereignty, and cultural heritage of the Arab countries. Despite being established in Cairo, the Arab League's headquarters were not permanently housed in the city from the outset. Initially, the headquarters were situated in a temporary location until the construction of the league's official headquarters was completed. The Arab League building, a modern structure reflecting the shared aspirations of the Arab world, was finally inaugurated by Gamal Abdel Nasser, the President of Egypt at the time, in 1957. Since its inception, the Arab League has played a significant role in various key events and conflicts in the region, such as the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the Suez Crisis in 1956, the Lebanese Civil War in 1975-1990, and the Gulf War in 1990-1991, among others. Although the league has faced various challenges and criticisms related to its effectiveness in resolving disputes within the Arab world, it remains as an essential forum for dialogue and consultation among its member states."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For other planets in the Solar System, north is defined as being in the same celestial hemisphere relative to the invariable plane of the solar system as Earth's North pole. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, winter in the Northern Hemisphere lasts from the December solstice (typically December 21 UTC) to the March Equinox (typically March 20 UTC), while summer lasts from the June solstice (typically June 21 UTC) through to the September equinox (typically September 23 UTC). The dates vary each year due to the difference between the calendar year and the astronomical year. - Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. Bears are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails. - Claudius Ptolemy (\\"Klaúdios Ptolemaîos\\", ; ) was a Greek writer, known as a mathematician, astronomer, geographer, astrologer, and poet of a single epigram in the Greek Anthology. He lived in the city of Alexandria in the Roman province of Egypt, wrote in Koine Greek, and held Roman citizenship. Beyond that, few reliable details of his life are known. His birthplace has been given as Ptolemais Hermiou in the Thebaid in an uncorroborated statement by the 14th-century astronomer Theodore Meliteniotes. This is a very late attestation, however, and there is no other reason to suppose that he ever lived anywhere else than Alexandria, where he died around AD 168. - Ursa Major (also known as the Great Bear) is a constellation in the northern celestial hemisphere. One of the 48 constellations listed by Ptolemy (second century AD), it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It can be visible throughout the year in most of the northern hemisphere. Its name, Latin for \\"the greater (or larger) she-bear\\", stands as a reference to and in direct contrast with Ursa Minor, \\"the lesser she-bear\\", with which it is frequently associated in mythology and amateur astronomy. The constellation's most recognizable asterism, a group of seven relatively bright stars commonly known as the \\"Big Dipper\\", \\"the Wagon\\" or \\"the Plough\\" (among others), both mimics the shape of the lesser bear (the \\"Little Dipper\\") and is commonly used as a navigational pointer towards the current northern pole star, Polaris in Ursa Minor. The Big Dipper and the constellation as a whole have mythological significance in numerous world cultures, usually as a symbol of the north. - Polaris, designated Alpha Ursae Minoris (Ursae Minoris, abbreviated Alpha UMi, UMi), commonly the North Star or Pole Star, is the brightest star in the constellation of Ursa Minor. It is very close to the north celestial pole, making it the current northern pole star. The revised Hipparcos parallax gives a distance to Polaris of about 433 light-years (133 parsecs), while calculations by other methods derive distances around 30% closer. - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - Ursa Minor (Latin: \\"lesser-Bear\\", contrasting with Ursa Major), also known as the Little Bear, is a constellation in the Northern Sky. Like the Great Bear, the tail of the Little Bear may also be seen as the handle of a ladle, hence the North American name, Little Dipper: seven stars with four in its bowl like its partner the Big Dipper. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Ursa Minor has traditionally been important for navigation, particularly by mariners, because of Polaris being the North Star. - In astronomy and navigation, the celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of arbitrarily large radius, concentric with Earth. All objects in the observer's sky can be thought of as projected upon the inside surface of the celestial sphere, as if it were the underside of a dome or a hemispherical screen. The celestial sphere is a practical tool for spherical astronomy, allowing observers to plot positions of objects in the sky when their distances are unknown or unimportant. - In modern astronomy, the sky (celestial sphere) is divided into 88 regions called constellations, generally based on the asterisms (which are also called \\"constellations\\") of Greek and Roman mythology. Those along the ecliptic are the constellations of the zodiac. - Amateur astronomy is a hobby whose participants enjoy watching the sky, and the abundance of objects found in it with the unaided eye, binoculars, or telescopes. Even though scientific research is not their main goal, many amateur astronomers make a contribution to astronomy by monitoring variable stars, tracking asteroids and discovering transient objects, such as comets and novae. - The International Astronomical Union (IAU UAI) is an international association of professional astronomers, at the PhD level and beyond, active in professional research and education in astronomy. Among other activities, it acts as the internationally recognized authority for assigning designations to celestial bodies (stars, planets, asteroids, etc.) and any surface features on them. - NGC 4194 , the Medusa merger , is a pair of interacting galaxies in the constellation Ursa Major . A region of extreme star formation 500 ly ( 150 pc ) across exists in the center of the Eye of Medusa , the central gas - rich region . - A constellation is formally defined as a region of the celestial sphere, with boundaries laid down by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The constellation areas mostly had their origins in Western-traditional patterns of stars from which the constellations take their names. - The Big Dipper (US) or Plough (UK) is an asterism consisting of the seven brightest stars of the constellation Ursa Major; six of them are of second magnitude and one, Megrez (), of third magnitude. Four define a \\"bowl\\" or \\"body\\" and three define a \\"handle\\" or \\"head\\". It is recognized as a distinct grouping in many cultures.

On that day last year, many online stores offered a big discount and free delivery service. The biggest online shopping sites in China,Taobao.com and Tmall.com ,sold things worth 19.1 billion yuan in total. \\"Goods online are often much cheaper. It also saves me a lot of time. And we often have more goods on many online stores than in shopping malls,\\" Wang Xin, an online shopping lover in Beijing, said to China Daily. She stayed up very late for a lot of cheap goods online. She spent several thousand that day. Another big advantage of online shopping is that it helps people get things from different cities, even different countries, _ . \\"I like eating duck neck very much and I often buy it on Taobao from shops in Wuhan.

Let's analyze each option separately for clarity: A: It can save people time and money - The article supports this statement as an advantage. Wang Xin notes that, \\"Goods online are often much cheaper. It also saves me a lot of time,\\" and further points out that discounts and free delivery services are sometimes offered. B: Online stores have better quality goods - The article does not mention or indicate that the quality of goods in online stores is better than that found in physical stores. Zang Xin, a customer, comments that she can buy a certain product, duck neck, which she finds tastier than what is available locally, but this is a matter of personal preference rather than a statement about the general quality of online goods. C: People can buy things from different places - The article mentions this as one of the advantages of online shopping. Wang Xin states that she can purchase goods from many online stores, implying a wide range of options, while Zang Xin verifies this advantage by explaining that she buys a product from another city because it's more delicious. D: Online stores may have more kinds of goods - The article supports this statement. Wang Xin explains that there are often more goods available in online stores than in physical shopping malls. So, it can be concluded from the article that the correct answer is B, as it does not indicate that online stores inherently have better quality goods as an advantage of online shopping."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: close up of yellow flowers and its leaves after a rain","completion":"The most important words in the following sentence are \\"close up,\\" \\"yellow flowers,\\" \\"leaves,\\" and \\"rain.\\" 1. Close up: This phrase indicates a view or perspective at a short distance, allowing us to see small details of the subject matter. In the context of photography or videography, it refers to a shot that is taken from very close to the subject, which allows the viewer to observe a greater degree of detail and texture that's not usually discernible from a distance. 2. Yellow flowers: This term specifies the primary subject of the image, focusing on flowers that are yellow in color. It helps to describe the type and color of the flowers, which differentiates the scene from any other potential subjects. The mention of 'yellow flowers' brings to mind warmth, brightness, and a bit of cheerfulness. 3. Leaves: This word references another part of the plant or subject matter. It adds variety and extra context to the scene, as leaves often provide visual interest and texture. Additionally, leaves are a vital component of the plant's life cycle and are associated with growth and change. 4. Rain: The reference to 'rain' in this sentence adds another layer of depth, as it provides a sense of the environment, atmosphere, and timing in which the close-up was taken. Rain is often associated with freshness and rejuvenation, so it suggests the flowers and leaves might be glistening with water droplets, which typically adds an aesthetic appeal and enhances the overall impact of the scene. The mention of rain heavily impacts our understanding and appreciation of the image described. In summary, these four words – \\"close up,\\" \\"yellow flowers,\\" \\"leaves,\\" and \\"rain\\" – are crucial in providing essential information about the scene. They create a vivid mental image of yellow flowers and their leaves captured up close after a rain shower, allowing the reader to understand the context, details, and the aesthetic appeal of the scene."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A:","completion":"\\"Smoke cigarettes\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because cigarette smoking is a well-known and scientifically established cause of lung cancer in adults. Cigarettes contain numerous harmful chemicals and carcinogens which, when inhaled, can damage the delicate tissues inside the lungs. Over time, this damage increases the risk of developing lung cancer.

However, excessive alcohol consumption can increase the risk of other cancers and health problems. 4. \\"Dress themselves\\": Dressing oneself is a daily activity that has no direct correlation with lung cancer.

Sometimes, you feel as if you're on top of the world. But occasionally you feel horrible, and you lose things and you cannot focus on your schoolwork. For more than 20 years, scientists have suggested that high self-esteem is the key to success. Now, new research shows that focusing just on building self-esteem may not be helpful.

Studies show that people with high self-esteem are less likely to be depressed, anxious, shy, or lonely than those with low self-esteem. But, after reviewing about 18,000 studies on self-esteem, Roy Baumeister, a psychologist at Florida State University, has found that building up your self-esteem will not necessarily make you a better person. He believes that violent and wicked people often have the highest self-esteem of all. He also said: \\"There's no evidence that kids with high self-esteem do better in school.\\" Problems All types of people have problems.

Step 1: Identify the speaker's feelings and situation The speaker acknowledges that he doesn't want to shirk his duty as a husband. This shows that he recognizes his responsibilities and wants to fulfill them. However, he keeps finding his wife with other men, which causes him emotional turmoil. Step 2: Examine the speaker's response to the situation Despite the speaker's commitment to his duties, deep down, he hopes that his wife will be stolen away by someone else. This indicates that he is unhappy in his marriage and tired of his wife's infidelity. Step 3: Analyze the speaker's desires and end-result After his wife is taken away by another man, the speaker ends up living alone in his big house – something he seems to prefer over living with his wife. This situation suggests that the speaker desires solitude and peace, away from his spouse's unfaithfulness. Based on these steps, it can be concluded that the speaker hoped for one of the men to take his wife away for good because he was unhappy in his marriage and found it difficult to deal with his wife's infidelity.

In humans, the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function.

Q: Title: Gold and silver to shows through DVD labels Review: The top of the disc is gold with a silver bar and the logo across the middle. The result is when you stomp on the label, you can see the silver bar and you can clearly see the \\"Maxell\\" lettering through the disc label. This is because the contrast between the gold and silver is so high. How dumb. I would get the memorex DVDs instead. They are all silver and stomped labels look great on them.I should also add that the packaging was terrible. The spindle case came broken. Is this product review negative? OPT: (1). Yes. (2). No. A:","completion":"This product review is negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with multiple aspects of the Gold and Silver DVD labels, specifically criticizing the contrast between gold and silver on the labels, the visibility of the \\"Maxell\\" lettering, poor packaging, and a broken spindle case. Furthermore, the reviewer recommends an alternative product (Memorex DVDs) as a superior option, which reinforces the negative tone of the review."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:Y,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},q={class:"card-container"},H={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],D={key:0},E={key:1};function N(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",q,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",H,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
