Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose influence on successive generations of northern artists was substantial? Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....

(CNN) -- A proposal to house federal prisoners, including some detainees from Guantanamo Bay, in a largely vacant maximum-security prison would be an economic boost to struggling northern Illinois, state officials said Sunday. \\"This is something that is very good for our state, it's good for our economy, it's good for public safety,\\" Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn told reporters. Officials from the departments of Defense, Justice, Homeland Security and the federal Bureau of Prisons will visit the Thomson Correctional Center on Monday, the officials said. Quinn's office on Saturday said the officials would see whether the \\"virtually vacant, state-of-the-art facility\\" in Thomson, about 150 miles west of Chicago, could be of use to the Bureau of Prisons. The","completion":"proposal of housing federal prisoners, including some detainees from Guantanamo Bay, in the largely vacant maximum-security prison in northern Illinois has been met with enthusiasm from state officials. They believe that this move could provide an economic boost to the region, which has been struggling for some time now. Governor Pat Quinn has expressed support for the proposal, stating that it would be beneficial for the state in terms of its economy and public safety. The purpose of the visit from officials of the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, and the federal Bureau of Prisons is to evaluate the Thomson Correctional Center as a potential site for housing federal prisoners. Located roughly 150 miles west of Chicago, the facility has remained virtually empty since its construction. Given its state-of-the-art infrastructure and secure nature, it presents a viable option for the federal government in its quest to find a suitable place to detain Guantanamo Bay prisoners and other federal inmates. There are several reasons why this proposal may be beneficial for both the state and the federal government: 1. Economic benefits: The influx of federal prisoners and the increased operational requirements of the Thomson Correctional Center would create an immediate need for jobs in the local area, both at the prison and in ancillary service providers. This would lead to an increase in local employment, potentially reducing the region's unemployment rate and providing a much-needed economic boost. 2. Improving public safety: Housing federal prisoners in a maximum-security facility like the Thomson Correctional Center would improve public safety by ensuring that high-risk inmates are secured in a controlled environment. The prison's maximum-security status means it is equipped with robust security features designed to minimize the risk of escape and maintain order within its walls. 3. Cost-efficiency: For the federal government, the use of an existing, underutilized facility like the Thomson Correctional Center represents a cost-efficient solution to address the need for additional prisoner housing. Investing in a new facility would require significant funding and time, whereas utilizing the existing prison offers the advantage of minimal new infrastructure costs and a faster implementation timeline. 4. Alleviating concerns about Guantanamo Bay detainees: The ongoing discussion about the future of Guantanamo Bay and its detainees has been a topic of debate for years. Housing some of these detainees in a secure facility like the Thomson Correctional Center may help to address the ethical and legal concerns that have been raised about their continued detention in Guantanamo. However, there are also potential drawbacks and concerns surrounding this proposal: 1. Public opposition: Some residents may be concerned about the potential risks that come with housing high-risk federal prisoners and Guantanamo Bay detainees in their community. They might worry about the possibility of escape attempts, increased crime in the area due to the presence of the prison, or negative perceptions associated with having a maximum-security facility in their vicinity. 2. Political implications: The proposal may be met with resistance from lawmakers who oppose the relocation of Guantanamo Bay detainees to American soil. They may argue that doing so could pose a national security risk or set a dangerous precedent. In conclusion, the proposal to house federal prisoners and Guantanamo Bay detainees in the Thomson Correctional Center has clear economic and public safety benefits for the state of Illinois. Still, it may also face challenges in terms of public opposition and political contention. As federal officials visit the facility and evaluate its viability as a location to house these prisoners, it is important that the benefits and concerns are carefully considered and potentially mitigated to ensure a balanced approach to resolving this issue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Polar Trappers is a 1938 Donald Duck and Goofy cartoon set in the South Pole , where the duo are trapping polar animals . This is the first cartoon that Donald Duck and Goofy appear without Mickey Mouse . - Donald Duck is a cartoon character created in 1934 at Walt Disney Productions. Donald is an anthropomorphic white duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. He typically wears a sailor shirt and cap with a bow tie. Donald is most famous for his semi-intelligible speech and his mischievous and temperamental personality. Along with his friend Mickey Mouse, Donald is one of the most popular Disney characters and was included in TV Guide's list of the 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time in 2002. He has appeared in more films than any other Disney character, and is the most published comic book character in the world outside of the superhero genre. - A comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \\"Famous Funnies\\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \\"comic book\\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone. - Walter Elias \\"Walt\\" Disney (December 5, 1901December 15, 1966) was an American entrepreneur, animator, voice actor and film producer. A pioneer of the American animation industry, he introduced several developments in the production of cartoons. As a film producer, Disney holds the record for most Academy Awards earned by an individual, having won 22 Oscars from 59 nominations. He was presented with two Golden Globe Special Achievement Awards and an Emmy Award, among other honors. Several of his films are included in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress. - Goofy is a funny-animal cartoon character created in 1932 at Walt Disney Productions. Goofy is a tall, anthropomorphic dog with a Southern drawl, and typically wears a turtle neck and vest, with pants, shoes, white gloves, and a tall hat originally designed as a rumpled fedora. Goofy is a close friend of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck and is one of Disney's most recognizable characters. He is normally characterized as extremely clumsy and dimwitted, yet this interpretation is not always definitive; occasionally Goofy is shown as intuitive, and clever, albeit in his own unique, eccentric way. - Mickey Mouse is a funny animal cartoon character and the official mascot of The Walt Disney Company. He was created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks at the Walt Disney Studios in 1928. An anthropomorphic mouse who typically wears red shorts, large yellow shoes, and white gloves, Mickey has become one of the world's most recognizable characters.

I saw this film at its premier at Sundance 09. Since American Beauty is a movie that had something to say, I had hopes for Towelhead. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. In fact, of countless movies I've seen in almost a dozen Sundance festivals, Towelhead is the only Sundance movie I've ever wanted to walk out early from. The worst problem with Towelhead is that it so obviously originates with a collection of \\"provocative\\" concepts concerning cultural stereotypes, rather than with an organic human drama. The screenplay derives from the novel of the same name by Alicia Erian. The famous Edith Wharton quote comes to mind: I have never known a novel that was good enough to be good in spite of its being adapted to the author's political views. That observation is especially devastating for Towelhead because its political views are so stale and simplistic. If there ever was a time when Towelhead's white male villains, condescending portrayals of blacks, ironic treatments of foreign cultures, etc., were fresh, it's long past. For a more detailed review, please look up any of the many professional reviews available online. Almost all rate this movie poorly and expose the shallow and manipulative tissue it is based on.

Indeed, I've encountered many people who seem to regard any book or movie dealing with racial, cultural, gender, or sexual issues as deeply moving, thought provoking, full of profound insight.

(Photo: Air 11) HOUSTON – Authorities have dug up human skeletal remains in a field where they’ve been searching for a teenage girl who went missing for nearly 20 years. The medical examiner’s office is investigating whether the remains belong to Jessica Cain, who went missing from Texas City in 1997. “If it’s not Jessica Cain, then we have to find out who it is,” said Houston Homicide Detective Richard Martinez. “There’s enough there to know that it’s a body, so they still have to keep digging and meticulously get every bone they can. The remains were found around 2:30 Friday afternoon when a backhoe operator found what he thought were skeletal remains, according to detectives. Those suspicions were confirmed after an anthropologist conducted an investigation. Martinez said the remains were found about four feet in the ground to find the remains. “We don’t know what the conditions of the field were back in 1997,” he said. Crews have been digging in the field for more than three weeks after convict William Reece tipped them off that Cain’s remains could be found in the field. Reece, who’s serving time for aggravated kidnapping, has been linked to at least five murders or kidnappings—all from 1997. The Houston Police Department is the lead agency in the investigation. Investigators said they’ll work in conjunction with other departments, such as the Friendswood Police Department, if, in fact, they are Cain's remains.

It all depends on the forensics, Houston police said Friday as searchers continued carefully excavating a scrubby horse pasture along East Orem near Hobby Airport. \\"Right now, we have no clue who this person is,\\" said Richard Martinez, a detective with the Houston Police Department's homicide division. Harris County medical examiners will analyze the remains, police said, and should be able to say if they are that of Jessica Cain, 17, who vanished without a trace on Aug. 17, 1997, while driving home after a high school musical cast party at a restaurant in Clear Lake. Only her truck, with her purse locked inside, was ever found, on the shoulder of Interstate 45 on the route to her Tiki Island home. But, Martinez said, the spot where the remains were discovered is \\"basically the same area\\" where convicted kidnapper William Lewis Reece, 54, was recently seen in the company of law enforcement officers. After weeks of searching the field, about 2:30 p.m. Friday a backhoe operator at the site signaled the discovery of the apparent remains. An anthropologist and other analysts with the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences were called to the scene. \\"Right now, they're in the process of recovering those remains,\\" Martinez said. \\"There is enough there to know that it's a body.\\" He said the remains were found at least four feet below the surface. Heavy thunderstorms blew through the area while investigators continued the excavation. \\"If it rains too hard and fills up with water, you have to let it subside and then start over,\\" Martinez said. The cause of death and the identity won't be known until after a forensics examination. Martinez said there appeared to be enough to make a DNA confirmation. \\"If it is not Jessica Cain, we have to find out who it is,\\" he said. The investigation will become a Houston police case regardless of the identity because the remains were discovered within their jurisdiction. But Martinez said the department will work with other law enforcement agencies if it does turn out to be Jessica Cain. Police said Reece was not at the site on Friday. He was serving a 60-year prison sentence for a 1998 aggravated kidnapping when police in mid-February brought him in shackles to Galveston County for interviews. Since then, Reece had been seen pacing the pasture, seeming to point out the spots where the searchers should focus. He also is identified by police as the prime suspect in the August 1997 kidnapping and murder of 12-year-old Laura Smither, who vanished from her Friendswood neighborhood while jogging. Houston police could not estimate how long it would take for medical examiners to determine the identity of the skeletal remains. Chronicle reporter St. John Barned-Smith contributed to this report. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Human skeletal remains have been discovered in a field in southeast Houston, where authorities have been searching for teenage girl Jessica Cain, who went missing nearly 20 years ago. The remains were found on Friday afternoon by a backhoe operator and were identified as human after an anthropologist conducted an investigation. The medical examiner's office is now investigating if the remains belong to Jessica Cain, who went missing from Texas City in 1997. The primary suspect in Jessica Cain's disappearance, William Reece, who has been linked to at least five murders or kidnappings from 1997, tipped off the authorities about the location of the remains."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Martín de Ursúa used his conquest of the Itza as a stepping stone to achieving the coveted post of Governor-General of the Philippines, which he took up in 1709. European-introduced diseases devastated the native population of Petén, with the effects of disease compounded by the psychological impact of defeat. The population around Lake Petén Itzá numbered between 20,000 and 40,000 in 1697. By 1714, a census recorded just over 3,000 individuals in Spanish Petén, including non-Indians. This number would not have included the so-called \\"wild\\" Maya living in the forest far from Spanish administration and control. By 1700 the new colonial capital of Petén was mainly inhabited by colonists, soldiers and convicts. During the second half of the 18th century, adult male Indians were heavily taxed, often being forced into debt peonage. Western Petén and neighbouring Chiapas remained sparsely populated, and the Maya inhabitants avoided contact with the Spanish. San José, on the northwest shore of lake Petén Itzá, is the home of the last surviving speakers of the Itza language. The surname Kowoj still survives, but the Kowoj and Itza have fully merged and no longer exist as separate ethnicities. In modern times there is a history of conflict between San José and neighbouring San Andrés , and this mutual hostility probably represents ancient hostility between the Itza and the Kowoj.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the proposed perturbation does have an effect on the process. Diabetes is a disease where the body's ability to produce or respond to the hormone insulin is compromised, resulting in abnormal metabolism of carbohydrates and elevated levels of glucose in the blood. In both types of diabetes (type 1 and type 2), the effectiveness or availability of insulin is affected. In type 1, the body doesn't produce enough insulin, often requiring patients to manually inject insulin. In type 2 diabetes, the body doesn't use insulin properly and gradually loses its ability to produce adequate amounts, often requiring dietary changes, oral medication, or insulin injections. In both cases, a person with diabetes may need to use more insulin to maintain normal sugar levels. Thus, the disease and its treatment can increase the use of insulin in the body."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What did Darwin theorize? Context: Evolution had less obvious applications to anatomy and morphology, and at first had little impact on the research of the anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Despite this, Huxley strongly supported Darwin on evolution; though he called for experiments to show whether natural selection could form new species, and questioned if Darwin's gradualism was sufficient without sudden leaps to cause speciation. Huxley wanted science to be secular, without religious interference, and his article in the April 1860 Westminster Review promoted scientific naturalism over natural theology, praising Darwin for \\"extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated\\" and coining the term \\"Darwinism\\" as part of his efforts to secularise and professionalise science. Huxley gained influence, and initiated the X Club, which used the journal Nature to promote evolution and naturalism, shaping much of late Victorian science. Later, the German morphologist Ernst Haeckel would convince Huxley that comparative anatomy and palaeontology could be used to reconstruct evolutionary genealogies. Answer:","completion":"Darwin theorized the concept of evolution through the process of natural selection. He proposed that species gradually change over time, and that those best adapted to their environment have a better chance of survival and reproduction, thereby passing on their advantageous traits to future generations. This theory challenged the widely accepted view at the time of natural theology and instead promoted scientific naturalism as a way to understand and explain the natural world. Huxley, a supporter of Darwin's ideas, coined the term \\"Darwinism\\" in his efforts to secularize and professionalize science, further promoting this groundbreaking theory in the field of life sciences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which period would be more harmful for habitat of species, time A or time B?

New Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) rates came into effect on 1 April, which introduced an annual flat-rate charge for all cars except those with zero emissions.

In Northern Ireland, new car sales recorded an increase of 9.6% in March 2017 compared to the same month the previous year. However, the figure has likely been distorted due to the changes in Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) rates that came into effect on April 1, which introduced an annual flat-rate charge for all cars except those with zero emissions. As a result, some motorists decided to buy new cars before the tax changes, leading to higher sales figures. In March 2006, before the recession, there were 9,564 new cars sold, while in March 2017, new car sales reached 8,556, which is still 1,000 fewer than the pre-recession peak.

Explanation: Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. When Pete heated the unopened can of soup, the heat caused the molecules within the soup and the air inside the can to move faster, increasing their kinetic energy. As kinetic energy increased and the pressure built up inside the sealed can, it eventually led to the explosion. On the other hand, Dan opened his can and heated it over the fire without any problems, which didn't provide him an opportunity to learn about kinetic energy through a similar experience.

(Photo: Courtesy/ Kaitlynn Toporzycki's Facebook page) CHAMBERSBURG - In a quiet rural neighborhood, one couple is experiencing major internet fame after a man's quick innovations went viral. Jonathan Schill was 15 minutes into his snow shoveling when he decided he needed a snow plow on Saturday, just after the first big snow of the season. Having just moved, he only had a shovel, a much larger driveway than before, and no access to a plow. He looked in his garage and found a box to a 50-inch TV - cardboard with a shiny coating - and decided to see if he could fasten it to his lawn mower. Read: Here are tips to keep your power bill down when it's extremely cold A couple cables and weights later, he was moving the driveway snow efficiently when his fiance, Kaitlynn Toporzycki, came out to check on him. \\"I walk out there and (he) doesn't look like he needs my help at all,\\" Toporzycki recalled. She decided to start recording the makeshift plow, thinking friends of theirs would find it funny. Neither expected it to blow up once it got to Facebook. Watch the video below (story continues below it): As of 9 p.m. on Thursday, it had 9.4 million views. \\"My first thought was I didn't really intend to do this to be funny, I did it to save myself from being tired and all that,\\" Schill said. \\"I really didn't expect it to be this big.\\" Toporzycki said she loves that the video shows off her fiance's creativity, even if it is something silly. \\"We're simple people, so it's not every day that our posts gets shared,\\" Toporzycki said. Most notably, she saw her video shared by comedian Jeff Foxworthy. Schill said when he saw that, he questioned \\"How is it getting so big?

The tomb, which has lain undisturbed for centuries, was found during excavations of the royal Maya city of El Perú-Waka, in the sweltering Petén jungle region in northern Guatemala. Among a hoard of glistening jade jewels, the archaeologists found in the seventh-century tomb a small alabaster vase showing the image of the queen's face and inscribed with her name.

Queen Kalomt'e K'Abel, otherwise known as 'the Holy Snake Lord,' was a significant figure in the Maya civilization and one of the great warrior queens who guided her people. The discovery of her tomb in the royal Maya city of El Perú-Waka, situated in the dense Petén jungle region of northern Guatemala, has shed new light on her role and life during the seventh century. The tomb's contents, including the small alabaster vase depicting the image of the queen's face and inscribed with her name, have provided invaluable information to archaeologists seeking to better understand the history and culture of the Maya civilization. Among these artifacts is a collection of exquisite jade jewels, indicating the queen's high social standing and the abundant wealth of her city. By deciphering the glyphs on the back of the vessel, researchers have been able to confirm the identity of the tomb's inhabitant as Kaloomte K'Abel, a name that pays tribute to her formidable abilities as a leader and a warrior. The newly discovered tomb stands as a testament to the significance of female rulers in Maya society, shedding light on the powerful roles they held and the immense contributions they made to their cities and civilization as a whole. As archaeological work continues at El Perú-Waka and throughout the wider Maya region, researchers are hopeful that they will find further evidence of this illustrious queen and her rule, allowing us to continue piecing together the rich tapestry of the ancient Maya world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The visual arts during the Song dynasty were heightened by new developments such as advances in landscape and portrait painting. The gentry elite engaged in the arts as accepted pastimes of the cultured scholar-official, including painting, composing poetry, and writing calligraphy. The poet and statesman Su Shi and his associate Mi Fu (1051–1107) enjoyed antiquarian affairs, often borrowing or buying art pieces to study and copy. Poetry and literature profited from the rising popularity and development of the ci poetry form. Enormous encyclopedic volumes were compiled, such as works of historiography and dozens of treatises on technical subjects. This included the universal history text of the Zizhi Tongjian, compiled into 1000 volumes of 9.4 million written Chinese characters. The genre of Chinese travel literature also became popular with the writings of the geographer Fan Chengda (1126–1193) and Su Shi, the latter of whom wrote the 'daytrip essay' known as Record of Stone Bell Mountain that used persuasive writing to argue for a philosophical point. Although an early form of the local geographic gazetteer existed in China since the 1st century, the matured form known as \\"treatise on a place\\", or fangzhi, replaced the old \\"map guide\\", or tujing, during the Song dynasty.The imperial courts of the emperor's palace were filled with his entourage of court painters, calligraphers, poets, and storytellers. Emperor Huizong was a renowned artist as well as a patron of the arts.

Robin is an exterminator who is making new mixtures of chemicals to use for when he gets called to kill rats in his neighborhood. To make the mixtures, he has to dissolve nitrogen gas in containers of water. In one container, container A, he dissolves the nitrogen gas under high pressure. In the other container, container B, he dissolves the nitrogen gas under low pressure. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which container will have lower solubility of the nitrogen gas?","completion":"Container B will have lower solubility of the nitrogen gas. According to Henry's Law, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the pressure of the gas above the liquid. When the pressure is higher, as in Container A, more gas gets dissolved in the liquid. In contrast, a lower pressure, as in Container B, results in lower solubility of the gas. Therefore, Container B will have the lower solubility of nitrogen gas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: I woke at dawn when Digger climbed over me to get out of bed, and I woke again an hour later when Pa called, \\"Everyone up who wants breakfast!\\" Across the room, Little Bit was dressing in a T-shirt and jeans that had been mine a year before. Ma had put a stack of clean clothes at the foot of the bed for me. I dressed without caring what I put on. The only important items were my cowboy boots and my Roy Rogers belt with two holsters for cap guns, even though I only had one cap gun left, and its trigger was broken. When I used the toilet, I sat on the front edge of the seat, watching the water beneath me, and scooted off as soon as I was done. I had seen a cartoon in a book at Grandpa Abner's that showed a fish leaping out of a toilet bowl and a woman staring at it with big eyes. I thought that was funny and I knew it was impossible, but I didn't think there was any reason to take chances.

OAKLAND, California (CNN) -- A former police officer for the Bay Area transit system pleaded not guilty Thursday in the New Year's Day shooting of a passenger at an Oakland rail station. Former transit officer Johannes Mehserle is charged with homicide in the death of Oscar Grant III. Johannes Mehserle, 27, appeared in a packed Alameda County courtroom, with his supporters separated by a courtroom aisle from relatives of shooting victim Oscar Grant III and other spectators. Mehserle is charged with shooting Grant, 22, in an incident that spurred violent protests in Oakland after being captured on video. Mehserle resigned his job as a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer days after the shooting, and he was arrested in Nevada earlier this week. Thursday's proceedings took less than five minutes, with Mehserle appearing behind heavy windows in an enclosure out of view of all but a handful of spectators. BART police had been called to","completion":"the Fruitvale Station on New Year's Day in response to reports of a fight involving several passengers on a train. Grainy cell phone videos taken by bystanders showed officers, including Mehserle, detaining a group of young men, including Grant, on the station platform. During the altercation, Grant, who was unarmed, was forced to the ground. While Grant was face-down on the platform, Mehserle pulled his service weapon and fired a single shot into Grant's back, which ultimately proved fatal. The case drew nationwide attention after the videos went viral, sparking public outrage and a series of protests and riots in Oakland. Critics accused the police of racial bias and excessive force, as Grant was African American, and Mehserle is white. Some protesters compared the shooting to the high-profile cases of police violence against unarmed black men in other cities across the United States. In the months that followed, the Alameda County District Attorney's Office sought to have Mehserle tried for murder, but the jury ultimately found him guilty of involuntary manslaughter, a lesser charge. They also found that Mehserle had used a gun in the commission of a crime. The trial, which had been moved to Los Angeles due to concerns about finding an impartial jury in Alameda County, ended with Mehserle receiving a two-year prison sentence. He was released on parole in 2011 after serving 11 months. Grant’s family and supporters expressed disappointment and frustration with what they saw as a lenient sentence for Mehserle. They argued that the judicial system had failed to hold the former police officer fully accountable for his actions and demanded reforms to address police brutality, racial profiling, and the use of excessive force. In the years since the verdict, Grant's death has remained a rallying point for civil rights activists, who continue to seek justice and change on a broader scale. The shooting and its aftermath have also led to policy changes within the BART police force. These changes include enhanced training in non-lethal force techniques, the use of body cameras by officers, and the creation of an independent auditor's office to review complaints against the BART police. While the end of the passage marks the conclusion of the criminal trial, it's clear that the consequences and discussions triggered by the shooting of Oscar Grant III continue to influence policing practices and public discourse on racial injustice today."},{"prompt":"FINAL EXAM Question 1.

Q:Information: - The House of Capet or the Direct Capetians, also called the House of France (\\"la maison de France\\"), or simply the Capets, ruled the Kingdom of France from 987 to 1328. It was the most senior line of the Capetian dynasty itself a derivative dynasty from the Robertians. Historians in the 19th century came to apply the name \\"Capetian\\" to both the ruling house of France and to the wider-spread male-line descendants of Hugh Capet. It was not a contemporary practice (see House of France). They were sometimes called \\"the third race of kings\\", the Merovingians being the first, and the Carolingians being the second. The name is derived from the nickname of Hugh, the first Capetian King, who was known as \\"Hugh Capet\\". The direct succession of French kings, father to son, from 987 to 1316, of thirteen generations in almost 330 years, was unparallelled in recorded history. - Troyes is a commune and the capital of the department of Aube in north-central France. It is located on the Seine river about southeast of Paris. This area is known as the Champagne region of Northern France. Many half-timbered houses (mainly of the 16th century) survive in the old town. Troyes has been in existence since the Roman era, as Augustobona Tricassium, which stood at the hub of numerous highways, primarily the Via Agrippa. - The Robertians, or Robertines, was the Frankish predecessor family of origin to the ruling houses of France; it emerged to prominence in the ancient Frankish kingdom of Austrasia as early as the eighth centuryin roughly the same region as present-day Belgiumand later emigrated to West Francia, between the Seine and the Loire rivers. The members were forefathers of the Capetian dynasty. With fealty (sometimes mixed with rancor) to the Carolingians they held the power of West Francia through the whole period of the Carolingian Empire; and from 888 to 987 theirs was the last extant kingdom of that house until they were succeeded by their own (Robertian) lineage, the house of Capet. - The term House of France refers to the members of the Capetian dynasty from which came the Kings of France since the election of Hugh Capet. In retrospect of the monarchy, the Merovingians and Carolingians were encompassed by the House of France by French historians and jurists. The House of France consists of a number of branches and their sub-branches. Some of its branches have acceded to the Crown, while others remained cadets. - The Count of Champagne was the ruler of the region of Champagne from 950 to 1316. Champagne evolved from the county of Troyes in the late eleventh century and Hugh I was the first to officially use the title \\"Count of Champagne\\". - Louis X ( 4 October 1289 -- 5 June 1316 ) , called the Quarreler , the Headstrong , or the Stubborn ( French : le Hutin ) , was a monarch of the House of Capet who ruled as King of Navarre ( as Louis I ) and Count of Champagne from 1305 and as King of France from 1314 until his death . Louis was the eldest son of Philip IV of France and Joan I of Navarre . His short reign as king of France was marked by the hostility of the nobility against fiscal and centralization reforms initiated by Enguerrand de Marigny , the Grand Chamberlain of France , under the reign of his father . Louis ' uncle -- Charles of Valois , leader of the feudalist party -- managed to convince the king to execute Enguerrand de Marigny . Louis allowed serfs to buy their freedom ( which was the first step towards the abolition of serfdom ) , abolished slavery , and readmitted French Jews into the kingdom . In 1305 , Louis had married Margaret of Burgundy , with whom he had Joan II of Navarre . Margaret was later convicted of adultery and strangled in prison . In 1315 , Louis married Clementia of Hungary , who gave birth to John I of France a few months after the king 's death . John 's untimely death led to a disputed succession . - Hugh Capet (c. 941 24 October 996) was the first King of the Franks of the House of Capet from his election in 987 until his death. He succeeded the last Carolingian king, Louis V. - The Capetian dynasty , also known as the House of France, is a dynasty of Frankish origin, founded by Hugh Capet. It is among the largest and oldest European royal houses, consisting of Hugh Capet's male-line descendants. The senior line ruled in France as the House of Capet from the election of Hugh Capet in 987 until the death of Charles IV in 1328. They were succeeded by cadet branches, the Houses of Valois and the Bourbon, which ruled until the French Revolution. After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'louis x of france' exhibits the relationship of 'noble family'. Find the answer from the choices below. Choices: - capetian dynasty - champagne - house of capet - house of france - robertians A:","completion":"Louis X of France exhibits the relationship of 'noble family' with the Capetian Dynasty, the House of Capet, and the House of France. He was a monarch of the House of Capet who ruled as King of Navarre and Count of Champagne. Moreover, the House of France refers to the members of the Capetian dynasty, which includes the Merovingians, Carolingians, and Kings of France since Hugh Capet's election.

Chromosome abnormalities are the most common cause, and in most cases there's nothing the mother could have done to prevent it. OPT: (i) There are three main examples of loss of the baby and miscarriages : The mother is unfaithful. A \\" miscarriage \\" occurs because the mother is convinced that something wrong is happening, and the fetus isn't growing properly. (ii) Miscarriages don't last long, making it common for women to experience birth defects along the way. You should know why they happen, as they take place as a natural occurrence of miscarriage, rather than an event unrelated to the miscarriage. (iii) The risk of miscarriage drops after thirteen weeks of gestation. By then, most chromosome abnormalities would have already caused the pregnancy to end. (iv) Most miscarriages occur suddenly in the early years of pregnancy.

Travelling to a new part of the world can introduce people to an array of distinct food and drink options, many of which directly reflect the region's culture, climate, and local resources. By sampling local culinary specialties, individuals are granted intimate glimpses into these aspects of a region, which can foster personal growth and enrich one's understanding of the world around them. The concept of pleasure can be derived from both the sensory experience of tasting new cuisine or flavors as well as engaging in the exploration of different food cultures. In addition to this, the introduction of unique food combinations and textures greatly contributes to the overall joy that one may derive from experiencing culinary delights in a new locale. Furthermore, shared dining experiences can also play a significant role in creating memorable moments while travelling. People can forge lasting connections with others through engaging in communal meals and partaking in food-centered customs in various cultural contexts. Such interactions can lead to heightened senses of enjoyment while embellishing travellers' insights into the lives and traditions of the people they encounter. Lastly, the adventurous aspect of discovering and sampling new food and drinks also caters to individuals' innate desire for novelty and learning. This adventurousness can bring about a sense of excitement, which in turn bolsters the pleasurable aspects of the situation, elevating it from a mere meal to a truly remarkable experience. Undeniably, various factors work in concert to make the act of exploring food and drink in new and unfamiliar places a uniquely satisfying pursuit. In conclusion, the statement \\"Eating and drinking in a new part of the world can be a pleasurable adventure\\" implies that the enjoyment stems from a combination of sensory experiences, cultural exploration, forging social connections, and the inherent excitement of trying new things. Therefore, it can be aptly concluded that \\"It can be enjoyable to experience food and drink in a new place.\\""},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What can overexposure to vibrating matter cause?\\" with the following options: - symptoms - hypothyroidism - Pollution - hyperthyroidism - Damaged hearing - Electrical energy - Relieve pain - decrease stamina The answer is:","completion":"Damaged hearing To understand why damaged hearing is the correct answer, it's essential to consider the given facts and analyze the relationship between them. Fact 1: Matter vibrating can cause sound. Fact 2: Overexposure to sound can damage hearing. Fact 1 explains that vibrations in matter, such as air, solid objects, or water, can create sound. These vibrations produce pressure waves, which our ears detect and interpret as sound. In everyday life, we encounter sounds generated by vibrating matter, such as machinery, music, or other people's voices. Fact 2 reveals that overexposure to sound, specifically loud and repetitive or continuous noises, can lead to hearing damage. When the sound waves are too intense, they can cause harm to the tiny hair cells in the inner ear, which are responsible for transmitting sound signals to the brain. Once these hair cells are damaged, they're not able to regenerate, leading to permanent hearing loss. This is known as noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Furthermore, overexposure to loud sounds over time can result in tinnitus, a constant ringing or buzzing in the ears. By combining these two facts, we can infer that overexposure to vibrating matter can lead to damaged hearing. This is because the vibrations from the matter give rise to sound, and if that sound is too loud or repetitive for an extended period, it may result in hearing damage, as mentioned in Fact 2. The other options listed – symptoms, hypothyroidism, pollution, hyperthyroidism, electrical energy, relieve pain, and decrease stamina – are not directly related to the given facts and may not accurately answer the question at hand."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The author seems to express strong dissatisfaction and frustration towards the movie in question. Several factors contribute to this perception: 1. Choice of words: The author uses a set of harsh words and strong expressions - \\"bang your head on the seat in front of you\\", \\"cluelessness\\", \\"idiocy\\", and \\"utterly misplaced earnestness\\". This vocabulary underscores the level of discontent and irritation felt by the author. 2. Imagery: The action of \\"banging your head on the seat in front of you\\" is a vivid and extreme image. It suggests a sense of wanting to escape the movie theater or show dissatisfaction with the movie. This image accentuates the negative sentiment, as the author compares the discomfort and frustration experienced during the movie to self-inflicting pain. 3. Emphasis on the scope of negative qualities: The author does not limit their criticism to just one aspect of the movie. Instead, they mention multiple negative qualities, such as cluelessness, idiocy, and misplaced earnestness. This suggests that the author perceives a whole range of issues with the movie, which contributes to an overall negative sentiment. 4. Use of hyperbole: The phrase \\"utterly misplaced earnestness\\" suggests that the author thinks that any attempt to take the movie's content seriously is entirely misguided. This exaggeration intensifies the negative sentiment and casts the movie in an even more unfavorable light. In conclusion, the sentiment of this sentence is perceived as extremely negative and critical due to the choice of words, imagery, emphasis on the range of negative qualities, and the use of hyperbole. The author communicates a strong sense of dissatisfaction, irritation, and frustration, effectively conveying their negative view of the movie."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: fun but buggy Review: I would love this game but for the fact that it locks up in the middle, or sometimes early in the game. I've found if I reset it will sometimes start back up but sometimes I have to reset 3 or 4 times in an hour. The first game we got we sent back because it would suddenly start scrolling thru the selections so fast it was simply a matter of pushing the A button and taking what came. And sometimes it wouldn't accept any selection.The replacement worked better but still locks up which is really annoying as I set aside the time to get some exercise and end up repeatedly standing there waiting for it to boot up again.Anyone else have such problems - and how do you deal with it?If it would just work as it's supposed to, I'd give it a rave review, but the frustration overcomes the positives sometimes - like tonight. Answer: Answer:","completion":"The tone of this product review can be characterized as negative with a hint of positivity. The reviewer acknowledges that the game is fun, which shows some positive sentiment. However, they express frustration over the various technical issues they've encountered, such as game lockups, unresponsiveness, and problems with the initial and replacement unit. These issues lead to overall dissatisfaction with the product, resulting in a predominantly negative tone. The reviewer would have given a positive review if not for these problems, suggesting that they do see potential in the product if it operated correctly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend blog will know that I suffer from an extremely sensitive scalp which can be really itchy, and I have to be very careful what shampoo I use. I know that I’m sensitive to shampoos containing sodium laureth sulfate (also known as SLS, it’s the ingredient that makes shampoos, shower gels and soaps lather) but I’m also sensitive to some other ingredients in shampoos too – mainly fragrances. I had previously been using Rainforest Balance Shampoo and Conditioner from The Body Shop®, but I found the conditioner a bit too rich and my hair didn’t always feel totally clean after using it. So I started doing a bit of research into recommended natural shampoos – and this Sensitive Shampoo from Lavera kept coming up again and again! Several of the reviews I read said that this was the best shampoo for sensitive scalps and that it left hair feeling really clean and soft, so I decided to try it. The shampoo is a translucent peach-coloured gel that contains organic witch hazel and organic almond milk. It has quite a strong scent, but it’s a nice one so it doesn’t put me off. The shampoo feels creamy when you rub it together in your hands, but I did need quite a lot of it to get a good lather on my first application – the second application lathers a lot more easily. I definitely agree that this makes hair feel a lot cleaner than a lot of the other SLS-free shampoos that I’ve tried, my hair feels clean and full and soft when I’ve used it – the same way it would do if I were using a regular shampoo. I think it also helps my hair to dry more quickly and makes it easier to straighten too. But where this shampoo is outstanding is the way it makes my scalp feel – my scalp feels soothed and calm and there’s no hint of itching. I’ve been using Lavera Sensitive Shampoo for over a year now and I wouldn’t change it for the world, it’s definitely one of the best shampoos for a sensitive itchy scalp.

Summarize this article: To effectively treat breast eczema or an outbreak of psoriasis on your breast, you will likely need a prescription strength corticosteroid product. Topical corticosteroid products, including those available over-the-counter, should not be applied to your breast area without first consulting your physician. Psoriasis outbreaks occur anywhere on the body, including the breast tissue. Psoriasis patches appear as thick, silvery, sometimes reddened patches, that are itchy and often painful. If you develop a psoriasis outbreak on your breast area, contact your doctor before you apply any medication. Be sure your doctor intends for you to apply medications you may already have on your breast tissue. Breast eczema outbreaks most often occur in the area of the nipple. The area often appears as an itchy, reddened area, and is sometimes accompanied by crusty formations and drainage from the sores. Due to the similarity in the rash associated with breast eczema and a more serious condition, Paget's disease, a medical examination is warranted. Take care to keep the area dry, and avoid harsh soaps or perfumed products. In addition to topical products, your doctor may prescribe oral medications to help treat any infection that may have started, as well as medications that can help control the itching. Topical products that may be prescribed include corticosteroids that reduce inflammation and promote healing, as well as newer agents, called calcineurin inhibitors. The newer agents are only used in people with severe and repeated flare-ups of eczema. Examples of the newer agents include tacrolimus and pimecrolimus. These agents help your skin to heal, and prevent further flares of eczema or atopic dermatitis. These medications alter the way your immune system works. With outbreaks of both psoriasis and eczema, regardless of where they form on your skin, scratching the areas can lead to complications. Scratching can cause the condition to spread beyond the immediate area, can cause further skin irritation, and possibly lead to infection. Many people scratch at night without realizing it. Try putting band-aids over your fingertips when you sleep, or sleep with socks over your hands to help avoid scratching.","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of seeking a medical professional's advice when dealing with breast eczema or psoriasis outbreaks on the breast.

The term was used by American critics and other countries because most of these Westerns were produced and directed by Italians. - Cobra Verde (also known as Slave Coast) is a 1987 German drama film directed by Werner Herzog and starring Klaus Kinski. It was based upon Bruce Chatwin's 1980 novel, \\"The Viceroy of Ouidah\\". The film depicts the life of a fictional slave trader. It was filmed on location in Brazil, Colombia and Ghana. - Klaus Kinski (born Klaus Günter Karl Nakszynski; 18 October 1926 23 November 1991) was a German actor. He appeared in more than 130 films, and was a leading role actor in the films of Werner Herzog, including \\"Aguirre, the Wrath of God\\" (1972), \\"Nosferatu the Vampyre\\" (1979), \\"Woyzeck\\" (1979), \\"Fitzcarraldo\\" (1982), and \\"Cobra Verde\\" (1987).

Minnesota has a consistently high voter turnout. In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, 78.2% of eligible Minnesotans voted—the highest percentage of any U.S. state—versus the national average of 61.2%. Voters can register on election day at their polling places with evidence of residency.Hubert Humphrey brought national attention to the state with his address at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota has gone for the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Republican Richard Nixon. Both the Democratic and Republican parties have major-party status in Minnesota, but its state-level \\"Democratic\\" party is actually a separate party, officially known as the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL). It was formed out of a 1944 alliance of the Minnesota Democratic and Farmer-Labor parties. The state has had active third-party movements. The Reform Party, now the Independence Party, was able to elect former mayor of Brooklyn Park and professional wrestler Jesse Ventura to the governorship in 1998. The Independence Party has received enough support to keep major-party status. The Green Party, while no longer having major-party status, has a large presence in municipal government, notably in Minneapolis and Duluth, where it competes directly with the DFL party for local offices. Major-party status in Minnesota (which grants state funding for elections) is reserved to parties whose candidates receive five percent or more of the vote in any statewide election (e.g., Governor, Secretary of State, U.S. President).

An additional 10 acres (4 ha) was also purchased from United States Senator William Maclay. The legislature met in the old Dauphin County courthouse for the next decade until a new capitol was constructed. A competition was held to determine the design of the capitol starting in 1816, which \\"was the first formal contest for [designing] an American statehouse\\". The designs submitted, including one from William Strickland, were rejected as being too expensive. Another contest was started in January 1819. Of the seventeen designs submitted, two were selected as semifinalists. One was from Harrisburg architect Stephen Hills and the other was from the designer of the Washington Monument, Robert Mills; Hills' design was selected. Hills had designed a \\"red-brick, Federal-style\\" capitol to \\"architecturally represent the function of democratic government.\\" Construction began on the Hills Capitol in 1819 and it was completed in 1822. The capitol's construction and subsequent furnishing was estimated to have cost 244,500. The Hills Capitol was visited by famous people, including the Marquis de Lafayette in 1825 and Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, (later King Edward VII) in 1860. Abraham Lincoln visited the capitol in 1861 as president-elect, and then his body lay in state there after his 1865 assassination.

Peter Loew is a driven literary agent and an example of the stereotypical narcissistic and greedy yuppie of the 1980s: he works all day and club hops at night, with little in his life but alcohol, one night stands and the pursuit of money and prestige. However, he is slowly going insane and sees a therapist frequently; it is during these sessions that his declining mental health becomes clear through a series of increasingly bizarre rants which eventually begin to scare even the psychiatrist. After he takes home a girl he met in a club named Jackie, a bat flies in through his window, scaring them both. At his next session he mentions to his therapist that the struggle with the bat aroused him, and after visiting an art museum with Jackie the next day, he ditches her, and she leaves an angry message on his phone. Loew meets Rachel at a night club, and takes her home. She pins him down, reveals vampire fangs and feeds on him. He soon begins to believe that he is changing into a vampire.

The Vestals were freed of the usual social obligations to marry and bear children, and took a vow of chastity in order to devote themselves to the study and correct observance of state rituals that were off-limits to the male colleges of priests. - Lucius Caecilius Metellus Diadematus was the second son of Roman politician and general Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus.

Options: - kept at accountant - purse - desk drawer - bank - keeping track of expenses Explain why a human would choose \\"desk drawer\\" to answer the question above:","completion":"A human would choose \\"desk drawer\\" as the most appropriate option for storing an account book when leaving and not needing to bring it along, for several reasons: 1. Accessibility: Placing the account book in a desk drawer ensures that it is easily accessible whenever needed. Desk drawers are usually located where the person works and are readily available when they need to consult or update the account book. This allows for efficient management of the information contained in the book. 2. Organization: Keeping the account book in a desk drawer helps keep a person's workspace organized. Desk drawers typically contain necessary office supplies, stationery, and other work-related items. Storing the account book in a designated location like a desk drawer allows for a systematic approach to managing financial records, making it easier to locate the book when needed. 3. Security: A desk drawer provides a certain degree of security for the account book. While it may not be as secure as a locked safe, it does offer some protection against theft, loss, or unauthorized access. Additionally, the account book can be placed in a locked drawer for added security, if required. 4. Confidentiality: Financial information, such as what is contained in an account book, can be sensitive and confidential. Storing the book in a desk drawer gives the individual a level of privacy, protecting the information from being unintentionally seen by visitors, coworkers, or other unauthorized individuals. 5. Prevention of Damage: A desk drawer also helps protect the account book from any potential damage. Storing it in a secure location, away from potential spills, direct sunlight, or other hazards minimizes the risk of accidental harm befalling the book, thus maintaining its condition and preserving the information it contains. On the other hand, the alternatives mentioned do not suit the requirements: - \\"Kept at accountant\\" implies that a professional would manage the account book on behalf of the individual, which may not be necessary since they do not need to access the book when leaving. This option may be excessive and expensive for personal finances. - \\"Purse\\" is not an appropriate storage option since it would be with the person when leaving, which contradicts the initial requirement of not needing to bring it along. - \\"Bank\\" is not a suitable option since banks typically do not hold personal documents like account books. They focus on providing financial services and safeguarding financial assets like money, bonds, and other valuable items in secure boxes, rather than physical books. - \\"Keeping track of expenses\\" is not a specific storage location but a purpose for using the account book. Therefore, it does not answer the question. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"desk drawer\\" to store an account book when leaving without needing to bring it, as it provides accessibility, organization, security, confidentiality, and protection from potential damage. It is an effective storage solution that meets the person's needs while not being excessively burdensome or costly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Her father, Mitchell \\"Mitch\\" Winehouse, was a window panel installer and then a taxi driver; and her mother, Janis Winehouse (nee Seaton), was a pharmacist. Winehouse's ancestors were Russian Jewish and Polish Jewish immigrants to London. Amy had an older brother, Alex (born 1979), and the family lived in London's Southgate area, where she attended Osidge Primary School. Throughout her life Winehouse donated her money, music and time to many charities, particularly those concerned with children. She was once named \\"the most charitable act\\" by Pop World. While this side of her personality was never well known to the general public, throughout both the arts community and the charity community she was known for her generosity. Among the charities she supported are Adopt-A-Minefield, Anti-Slavery International, Breast Cancer Campaign, CARE, Children of the Andes, Children's Medical Research Institute, Christian Children's Fund, City at Peace, UK charity telethon Comic Relief, London's Great Ormond Street Hospital for sick children, Greenpeace, Healthlink Worldwide, Hear the World, Heifer International, Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen, the Red Cross, LIFEbeat, Lifeline and Rape Crisis PMB, Opportunity International, Oxfam, Rights and Humanity, Save the Children, Save the Music Foundation, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Teenage Cancer Trust, Christina Noble Children's Foundation, Little Dreams Foundation, Lotus Outreach, Nelson Mandela Children's Fund, UNHCR, UNICEF, V-Day, WaterAid, and World Neighbors.

And at the center of it all, President Donald Trump. “Can we do one question at a time? Wait! One question at a time,\\" the president scolded reporters. Trump launched a new attack on the Russia probe in the wake of a critical report on the Hillary Clinton email investigation by the inspector general of the Department of Justice. “I did nothing wrong. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction,\\" he said. \\"The IG (inspector general) report yesterday went a long way to show that, and I think that the Mueller investigation has been totally discredited.” But the report in question only dealt with how the FBI handled the Clinton email controversy. It was critical of the man Trump fired as FBI director, James Comey, but rejected the notion of a politically-directed effort aimed at Trump. “This report did not find any evidence of political bias or improper considerations actually impacting the investigation under review,\\" announced current FBI Director Christopher Wray. Democrats also took note of the report. “Anyone who is hoping to use this report to undermine the Mueller probe or prove the existence of a ‘deep state’ conspiracy against President Trump will be sorely disappointed,\\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. During his lengthy encounter with reporters Friday, Trump also defended his recent summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “They are doing so much for us, and now we are well on our way to get denuclearization,\\" he said. \\"And the agreement says there will be total denuclearization. Nobody wants to report that. I got along with him great. We have a great chemistry together. That is a good thing, not a bad thing.\\" Trump also lashed out at opposition Democrats and tried to blame them for recent administration actions to separate family members caught trying to come across the U.S. border. “The Democrats forced that law upon our nation. I hate it. I hate to see separation of parents and children,\\" Trump said. Question: When did the media frenzy occur?

Answer:","completion":"The composer best known for his works Requiem in D minor and Pavane in F sharp minor is Gabriel Fauré. Born on May 12, 1845, in Pamiers, France, Fauré was a prominent French composer, organist, and pianist of the Romantic era. His music is characterized by its distinctive harmonic language, stylistic inventiveness, and delicate expressiveness, which greatly influenced the French music scene of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Gabriel Fauré's Requiem in D minor, Op. 48, is undoubtedly one of his most famous and enduring works. Composed between 1887 and 1890, the Requiem stands out from other settings of the traditional Latin funeral mass due to its unique selection and arrangement of the liturgical texts. Fauré chose to omit some sections and include others that are not part of the standard Requiem Mass texts, like the \\"Pie Jesu\\" and \\"In Paradisum.\\" This approach contributed to the composition's calm and meditative nature, often referred to as a \\"lullaby of death,\\" which sets it apart from the more dramatic and solemn Requiems of other composers like Mozart or Verdi. Fauré's Requiem is scored for mixed chorus, soloists (soprano and baritone), orchestra, and organ. The work is divided into seven movements: \\"Introit et Kyrie,\\" \\"Offertoire,\\" \\"Sanctus,\\" \\"Pie Jesu,\\" \\"Agnus Dei,\\" \\"Libera Me,\\" and \\"In Paradisum.\\" Each movement showcases Fauré's exceptional ability to create atmospheric and emotional music while displaying his innovative harmonic language and masterful command of the choral and orchestral textures. In addition to the Requiem, Fauré's Pavane in F-sharp minor, Op. 50, has become an essential piece in the orchestral repertoire. Composed in 1887, the Pavane is a brief but hauntingly beautiful work for orchestra and optional mixed choir. In its original form, the piece features the text \\"Les Danses aux environs d'Elbeuf\\" written by Count Robert de Montesquiou, a French poet and close friend of Fauré. However, the Pavane is now often performed as a purely orchestral piece without the choral part. The Pavane is characterized by its elegant, melancholic melody, which is set against a repeated rhythmic pattern reminiscent of a slow and stately dance from the Renaissance era. This graceful and evocative work showcases Fauré's ability to write music that is both emotionally expressive and exquisitely crafted in terms of form and structure. Throughout his long and distinguished career, Gabriel Fauré produced an extensive catalogue of compositions, including chamber music, orchestral works, sacred choral music, and numerous piano pieces and songs. However, it is through the Requiem in D minor and Pavane in F sharp minor that Fauré's unique voice and exceptional craftsmanship continue to captivate and inspire musicians and audiences worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Several rock bands were formed in Southampton, including Band of Skulls, The Delays, Bury Tomorrow, Heart in Hand, Thomas Tantrum (disbanded in 2011) and Kids Can't Fly (disbanded in 2014). James Zabiela, a highly regarded and recognised name in dance music, is also from Southampton.\\" Answer: The answer is:","completion":"Thomas Tantrum disbanded earlier than Kids Can't Fly. To provide a more comprehensive answer, let's first explore the details of both bands mentioned in the context. Thomas Tantrum was a band originated from Southampton, England. The group consisted of members Megan Thomas (vocals, guitar), David Wade (guitar), Jim Shivers (bass), and Ken Robshaw (drums). Their musical style can be described as a blend of indie pop and alternative rock. Thomas Tantrum formed in 2006 and, after releasing several EPs and two studio albums (self-titled in 2008 and 'Mad By Moonlight' in 2011), they disbanded in 2011. On the other hand, Kids Can't Fly was also a Southampton-based band with a style leaning more towards pop-punk and ska. The band members were Rob Peterkin (guitar, lead vocals), Jamie Dagg (bass, vocals), Iain Allen (guitar, vocals), Alex Robinson (drums), and Sam Trench (trombone, keyboards, vocals). Kids Can't Fly formed in 2006 as well and gained popularity in the UK underground music scene. They released several EPs, such as 'Strength in Numbers' (2008), 'Esquires and Eccentrics' (2010), and 'Northern Horizons' (2013), before disbanding in 2014. Considering this information, Thomas Tantrum disbanded earlier than Kids Can't Fly, with the former disbanding in 2011 and the latter in 2014. Both bands were part of the vibrant music scene from Southampton, contributing to the rich musical history of the city."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Remembering When Driverless Elevators Drew Skepticism These days, the idea of a driverless car makes a lot of people nervous. Our Planet Money team goes back in time when automatic elevators made people just as worried. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Now, as Google and other companies work to create self-driving cars, there's a concern in the industry. This is the question. Will people be comfortable getting inside? Would you put your child in a car without a steering wheel? The very idea makes many of us nervous. But every new automatic device that enters our lives, from automatic doors to escalators, has had to face this awkward moment where people are skeptical and maybe scared. Steve Henn from NPR's Planet Money podcast has one example we hardly think of anymore. STEVE HENN, BYLINE: When elevators were invented, they were kind of terrifying. I mean, think about it. You're hanging hundreds of feet in the air by a cable. And elevator operators in those days guided the cars to level stops by hand. They opened and closed the doors manually. And sometimes, they made mistakes. Lee Gray wrote the definitive history of the passenger elevator. LEE GRAY: There were lots of times when as a businessman you might say, oh, the elevator's leaving. And you hurry up, and you sort of jump the gap into the car and land. And off you go just before the operator shuts the door. And if you're athletic, it's all good. If you trip and fall and you're laying half in and half out of the car, the operator's not going to have time to stop. And that ended rather badly. HENN: Now, this was not the image the elevator industry wanted for its brand-new transportation device. So they added doors with safety bumpers, automatic stopping. And eventually, they created a driverless elevator. And this was in 1900. This was amazing. It was the Google car of its era. And people hated it. GRAY: People walked in and looked and walked right back out. They would quickly step back out and try to find someone to say where's the operator? HENN: But then, in 1945, elevator operators in New York went on strike. New York City ground to a halt. The strike costs New York a hundred million dollars in lost taxes. It prevented one and a half million office workers from getting to work. Building owners demanded a change. And the elevator industry decided they had to convince people to rethink what an elevator was. GRAY: Early ads, they showed children pushing the buttons and grandma riding in the elevator car showing how safe this is. HENN: And for the nervous rider there was a soothing voice piped out of speakers when you walked inside. GRAY: This is an automatic elevator. Please press the button for the floor you desire. HENN: And this voice directed you to the biggest calming device ever invented, a big red button that said, stop. GRAY: It would say, you have pulled the emergency stop. If this is not an emergency, please push it back in. If this is an emergency, please use the phone. HENN: And these innovations worked. Today, you can almost count the number of elevator operators in New York City using your fingers and toes. And the lessons here are being examined by Google's designers right now as they build their self-driving car. But there's one part of the elevator's history Google does not want to repeat. The automatic elevator was invented around 1900, but it took more than 50 years before the public became comfortable and automatic elevators became ubiquitous. Steve Henn, NPR News.

She added that some even believed \\"that women's bodies were not designed to go at 50 miles an hour,\\" and worried that their \\"uteruses would fly out of [their] bodies as they were accelerated to that speed.\\" When elevators first became automated a century ago, meanwhile, some people were afraid to ride in them without an operator onboard—in much the same way some now fear not having a human at the helm of a driverless car. NPR talked to the guy who literally wrote the book on elevator history, Lee Gray, and he noted that when the automatic elevator was first invented, \\"People walked in and looked and walked right back out. They would try to find someone to say 'Where's the operator?'\\" Of course, there's a huge difference between a metal box moving slowly along an enclosed concrete shaft and a metal box with four wheels moving fast along an open concrete surface with hundreds of other such boxes. But the basic unease with not having a human in control is the same, and it's almost as irrational as expecting a human to operate an elevator. Public Misgivings about Self-Driving Cars It seems as if a new survey comes out every month revealing public doubts about self-driving cars. The results of a recent Deloitte survey of 22,000 consumers around the world revealed that \\"trust appears to be the biggest roadblock to selling the notion of self-driving cars.\\" Less than half of US consumers surveyed (47 percent) \\"trust a traditional car manufacturer to bring autonomous vehicles to market,\\" Deloitte found, while only 20 percent have confidence in Silicon Valley tech companies to get self-driving technology right. Just this week, yet another survey of 3,116 drivers conducted between January 31 and February 6 found that almost a quarter (24.8 percent) of respondents would never ride in a self-driving car. Even the new Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao earlier this week expressed concerns over negative public opinion on self-driving technology. \\"In particular, I want to challenge Silicon Valley, Detroit, and all other auto industry hubs to step up and help educate a skeptical public about the benefits of automated technology,\\" she said. I have my own doubts about autonomous technology, even after riding in several self-driving cars on public roads and testing vehicles with the latest semi-autonomous systems. But my reservations are about when fully autonomous technology will be perfected, not if it will be perfected—and become as normal as elevators. I'll take my chances with vehicle sensors and cameras that are always on the lookout and even in-car computers over distracted drivers and human shortcomings. I highly doubt that robot-driven cars will kill 30,000-plus people in roadway accidents each year in the US alone. The automatic elevator was invented circa 1900, but it took more than 50 years before the public became comfortable with the technology and human elevator operators became obsolete. I don't believe it will take that much time before self-driving cars catch on, and it may not even be that long before human drivers go the way of elevator operators. |||||Summary:","completion":"Before automatic elevators became universally accepted, the public was highly sceptical of the technology, a situation that parallels today’s public doubts about self-driving cars, according to an NPR report from 2015. Steve Henn, of NPR’s Planet Money podcast, noted that people eventually embraced the elevator due to innovations such as big red stop buttons, safety bumpers and automatic stopping. The first automatic elevator was patented in 1900, but didn’t become ubiquitous until over 50 years later."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are presented with the question \\"How many legs do most arthropods have?\\" and the following answer choices: - legs - Many - 12 - six - four - zero - eight - two Now knowing that most arthropods are insects and every insect has six legs, that's an insect, choose the best answer. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Six. Arthropods are a diverse group of invertebrate animals that include insects, arachnids (e.g. spiders and scorpions), myriapods (e.g. centipedes and millipedes), and crustaceans (e.g. crabs and shrimps). This phylum has one of the largest number of species of any in the animal kingdom, and their evolutionary success is attributed to their tough exoskeletons, jointed appendages, and varying numbers of legs. Arthropods are characterized by their segmented bodies and jointed limbs, and the number of legs varies among the different classes: 1. Insects, which constitute the majority of arthropods, always have six legs. For example, ants, bees, mosquitoes, and butterflies are insects. 2. Arachnids typically have eight legs, with spiders, scorpions, mites, and ticks being common examples. 3. Myriapods possess a large number of legs (varying from 30-400), with centipedes and millipedes as the prime representatives. 4. Crustaceans, such as crabs and lobsters, usually exhibit five pairs of legs (thus ten legs in total). Since the question specifically mentions that most arthropods are insects, and every insect has six legs, the best answer choice is \\"six.\\" It is crucial to note that while insects represent the majority of arthropod species, arthropods as a whole can exhibit a wide range of leg numbers depending on their class and individual adaptations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Goldfrapp are an English electronic music duo from London, formed in 1999. The duo consists of Alison Goldfrapp (vocals, synthesizer) and Will Gregory (synthesizer). Despite favourable reviews and a short-listing for the Mercury Prize, their 2000 debut studio album Felt Mountain did not chart highly. Goldfrapp's second album Black Cherry, which incorporated glam rock and synthpop sounds into their music, was released in 2003. Context: Supernature, Goldfrapp's third album, was released in August 2005. The album comprises pop and electronic dance music prominently featured on Black Cherry, but focuses more on subtle hooks instead of the large choruses that made up its predecessor. The band never intended to create dance music, however, previous releases were popular across nightclubs in North America and as a result, they decided to write a more dance-oriented album. Supernature debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart and was certified platinum in the UK. As of February 2008, it had sold one million copies worldwide. The album received a Grammy Award nomination in 2007 for Best Electronic/Dance Album and \\"Ooh La La\\" was nominated for Best Dance Recording. The song was used for the iPhone 5S's commercial in 2013. \\"Ooh La La\\", the album's lead single, became Goldfrapp's first UK top five single. The song was chosen as the lead single \\"because it was up and in your face and carried on the theme of the glammy, discoey beat from the last album\\". \\"Ooh La La\\" became the first song performed by the band to feature the electric guitar and was cited as a highlight of the album by Allmusic. \\"Number 1\\" was released as the album's second single. Constructed around a synthesiser and bass arrangement, it was written about the importance of relationships. The album's third single \\"Ride a White Horse\\" was inspired by the disco era and reached number 15 in the UK. \\"Fly Me Away\\" was released as the album's fourth single, but did not perform as well as its predecessors. In 2006, Goldfrapp released We Are Glitter, a North American-only compilation of remixes from Supernature. It included a Flaming Lips remix of \\"Satin Chic\\", the band's favourite song from the album. Question: What type of music was it? Answer:","completion":"The type of music in Goldfrapp's album Supernature is electronic dance music with elements of pop, glam rock, and synthpop. It has catchy tunes and dance beats that are fun to listen and dance to."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: President Donald Trump's approval rating has headed into unfamiliar territory in recent weeks — upward. Trump's approval hit 43 percent in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, with 52 percent disapproving. That represents a 3 percent improvement from last month in the same survey. Several other new surveys also show Trump at or slightly above 40 percent. The RealClearPolitics polling average puts the president's approval rating at 41 percent, a noticeable bump from August, when the rating was often in the mid-30s. For much of the second half of August, Trump's approval rating in the Gallup Daily Tracking poll was either 34 percent or 35 percent, historically a low mark for a new president. On Thursday, Gallup had Trump at 37 percent. The previous day, Trump hit 39 percent, his highest mark since late July. Trump's recent outreach to Democrats on budget issues and, possibly, immigration has boosted his poll numbers, as has his administration's response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 71 percent of those surveyed approved of Trump's deal with Democrats to fund the government until December and raise the debt ceiling, while 8 percent disapproved. The question is whether Trump has turned a political corner, or is merely seeing a temporary respite from the low poll ratings that have plagued him since the beginning of his presidency. That could depend on whether working with Democrats is a long-range goal or a passing fad, and experts said that making a forecast on that could turn out to be foolish. \\"When it comes to President Trump, I have gotten out of the prediction business,\\" said Brookings Institution scholar Bill Galston. \\"For now, this is a significant shift of strategy and tactics.

Hundert, now retired from teaching, receives a phone call from his mentee and former student, David Wilson, who is now the headmaster at St. Bartholomew Academy. David offers Hundert an opportunity to teach a newly created class for non-traditional students. The students in this class have exceptional talents and a passion for learning; however, they don't fit the typical mold of the prestigious academy. Initially hesitant due to his retirement, Hundert eventually agrees and decides to embrace the challenge head-on. He brings his signature charisma, depth, and thought-provoking lessons to this new group of students. The class comprises individuals from diverse backgrounds – a rebellious street artist, a child prodigy in robotics, a passionate young environmentalist, and a girl who escaped a war-torn country seeking knowledge and hope. As Hundert gets to know each student, he learns about their unique backstories and the struggles they've faced throughout their lives. This newfound understanding prompts him to tailor his teachings and methods to reflect the individual needs and abilities of each student. Hundert inspires them to think critically about history and connect the significance of the past to the world they live in today. Despite initial skepticism from the school's board members and other teachers, Hundert's fresh approach resonates powerfully with his students. As the class makes significant progress and becomes a tight-knit community, the once-skeptical faculty begins to acknowledge the power of unconventional teaching methods and the importance of adapting to different learning styles. Feeling inspired by his students' progress, Hundert reintroduces the \\"Great Students of the Past\\" competition to the school, inviting his class to participate in the event. The competition tests knowledge, moral reasoning, and public speaking skills. The diverse group of students brings a fresh perspective and unique insight to the competition, challenging the status quo and giving long-standing traditions a new meaning. Through the competition, the students gain newfound confidence in themselves, as well as a stronger connection to the lessons of history. The event culminates in a once-rebellious and misunderstood student using her unique background to provide an inspiring interpretation of the subject matter, resulting in a joyous victory. In the end, Hundert's passion for teaching and the invaluable contributions of his non-traditional students leave an indelible mark on the academy, changing the institution for the better. The \\"Lessons of a Lifetime\\" Hundert has shared with his students have shaped them into well-rounded individuals ready to positively impact the world. The film ends with Hundert reflecting on his impactful teaching career, invigorated by his time with the new class and grateful for the opportunity to learn from each student. As he readies for a quiet but well-earned retirement, the audience is left with an inspiring reminder of the power of unconventional knowledge, personal growth, and the influence mentors and teachers have in shaping future generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Background: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. Paragraph: The specialists studied two groups of larvae. Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't.

Question: - Nephrons in the kidney filter the blood - The waste that is filtered out mixes with water - Become urine - Ureters carry urine out of the kidneys. What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process begins with blood filtration in the nephrons, specifically at a structure called the glomerulus. Located in the renal cortex of the kidney, the glomerulus is a network of tiny capillaries surrounded by the Bowman's capsule, which is a cup-like structure. Blood enters the glomerulus through the afferent arteriole, and the high-pressure environment within the glomerulus forces fluid, waste products, and electrolytes out of the blood and across the porous walls of the capillaries. This filtration process comprises water, glucose, ions, amino acids, and urea, while preventing larger elements like blood cells and proteins from passing through. The filtrate, which is a mixture of water and waste products, then collects in the Bowman's capsule and continues to the next step of the process - the renal tubules. Here, the filtrate goes through various processes, such as reabsorption, secretion, and excretion, which eventually lead to the formation of urine. In summary, the first step in the formation of urine is blood filtration, where the glomerulus filters out waste products and excess water from the blood, resulting in the filtrate that later becomes urine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: There is no hiding from the impact agenda. The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years.

Hint: As Figure above shows, the distance between particles is much smaller for the solid and liquid states than for the gas state. In the solid state, particles are fixed in place, while particles are more free to move in the liquid and gas states. The particles in the solid and liquid states “stick together,” but in the gas state, they move freely about the container. In general, it requires energy to separate individual particles. If we want to make a solid adopt a liquid form, we can add energy in the form of heat, increasing the temperature of the substance. Conversely, if we want to convert a substance from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, we remove energy from the system and decrease the temperature. Pressure also plays an important role in changes of state, which will be discussed later on. We will study these difference in greater detail in the chapter States of Matter.

This period was characterized by social turmoil and power disputes between left- and right-wing political forces. The retreat from the overseas territories and the acceptance of its independence terms by Portuguese head representatives for overseas negotiations, which would create independent states in 1975, prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from Portugal's African territories (mostly from Portuguese Angola and Mozambique). What was the Carnation Revolution? What is the answer? (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"The Carnation Revolution was a bloodless and peaceful military coup that took place on April 25, 1974, in Lisbon, Portugal. It marked the end of the authoritarian regime, Estado Novo, which had been in power since 1933 under Prime Minister António de Oliveira Salazar, and later, Marcelo Caetano. The Carnation Revolution brought significant political and social change to Portugal, ultimately leading to the independence of its overseas territories in Africa and Asia, as well as the restoration of democracy in the country. The coup was led by a group of left-wing military officers who were discontent with the prolonged and unsuccessful Portuguese Colonial War in African territories such as Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau. The military officers, known as the Armed Forces Movement (MFA), were determined to bring the regime to an end and establish a democratic system. The revolution got its name from the fact that the soldiers involved in the coup wore red carnations in their uniforms and placed them in the barrels of their guns as a sign of peace. Following the Carnation Revolution, a transitional period known as PREC (Processo Revolucionário Em Curso) lasted for about two years. This period was marked by social unrest, political turmoil, and power disputes between left- and right-wing factions. During this time, the Portuguese government and military withdrew from their overseas colonies, recognizing the independence of territories such as Angola and Mozambique in a series of negotiations in 1975. This led to a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from these territories, seeking to return to Portugal or find new opportunities elsewhere.

Answer: \\"SUPER HEROES\\" is a trademark co-owned by DC Comics and Marvel Comics . Question: What is the source of a superhero's powers? A:","completion":"The source of a superhero's powers can be attributed to various factors, depending on the character and the universe they belong to. While it is true that \\"SUPER HEROES\\" is a trademark co-owned by DC Comics and Marvel Comics, both companies have adopted unique approaches to developing the source of their superheroes' powers. Here is a detailed and broad look at some of the most common sources of superhero powers: 1. Genetic mutations or enhanced DNA: Some superheroes possess powers as a result of genetic mutations or alterations to their DNA. This can be either inherited from their parents, an intentional experiment, or an accidental exposure to genetic-altering substances. The most well-known example of this source of power is Marvel's X-Men, who have a mutated X-gene that grants them various abilities. 2. Scientific accidents or experiments: Several superheroes have acquired their powers due to accidents involving scientific experimentation or advanced technology. Examples include DC Comics' The Flash, who gained his incredible speed from a lightning strike that also exposed him to chemicals, and Marvel's Spider-Man, who was bitten by a radioactive spider. 3. Alien origins: Some superheroes have powers because they belong to a different species or come from another planet. Extraterrestrial beings, such as Superman from DC Comics and Thor from Marvel Comics, have unique attributes that make them superior to humans, granting them incredible power. For example, Superman's Kryptonian heritage gives him super strength, heat vision, and the ability to fly when under Earth's yellow sun. 4. Mystical or magical powers: Magic and other supernatural forces are also a common source of superhero powers. Characters like DC Comics' Doctor Fate and Marvel's Doctor Strange are sorcerers who draw on the power of mystical energies and artifacts to manifest their abilities. Magic-based superheroes often have a variety of powers, such as energy manipulation, teleportation, and the ability to control time and space. 5. Advanced technology: Some superheroes rely on advanced technology to enhance their physical abilities and grant them power. For example, Iron Man from Marvel Comics utilizes his genius intellect to create intricate and technologically sophisticated suits of armor, which afford him abilities like flight, enhanced strength, and a variety of deadly weapons. Similarly, DC Comics' Cyborg is a hero who has integrated advanced technology within his human body, granting him various cybernetic abilities. 6. Natural or intense training: In some cases, the superhero does not have any inherent powers but has trained their body and mind to reach peak physical condition. This may include intense martial arts training, weaponry expertise, or tactical knowledge. Heroes like DC Comics' Batman and Marvel's Black Widow use their physical prowess, strategic thinking, and mastery of numerous weapons to fight crime and protect others. 7. Cosmic powers or divine gifts: Certain characters may possess their powers due to being bestowed a gift from cosmic or divine entities. These heroes may serve as agents for higher powers or work to protect and maintain balance in the universe. Two renowned examples of this category are Marvel's Silver Surfer, who is empowered by the cosmic entity Galactus, and DC Comics' Wonder Woman, who is granted powers and abilities from the gods of Greek mythology. These are just some of the many sources that contribute to the powers of superheroes in different comic book universes. The origins of their powers can be as diverse and creative as the characters themselves, offering unique opportunities for storytelling and character development."},{"prompt":"Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Great song , Great Heart Review: The medley of the two songs was beautifully done especially with the high notes at the end of the song.

To understand the sentiment behind this phrase, let us break down the elements: 1. \\"Dripping with\\" - This phrase is often used to exaggerate the degree to which something possesses a particular quality. It can be used in both positive and negative contexts. In this case, the adjective that follows \\"dripping with\\" might determine the overall sentiment. If it were a positive adjective (e.g., dripping with charm), the sentiment could be positive. However, in this example, the adjective that follows is \\"cliche,\\" which is generally considered negative. 2. \\"Cliche\\" - A cliche refers to an overused expression, idea, or element that has become trite, unoriginal, or predictable due to its repeated use. In general, cliches are perceived negatively because they indicate a lack of creativity, originality, or insight. They are often associated with mediocrity and predictability. When combining these elements, the sentiment of the sentence \\"dripping with cliche and\\" suggests that the subject being discussed is overly saturated with cliches, to the point that it is tiresome, unimpressive, or even annoying. The phrase most likely intends to highlight that the subject lacks originality and depth, as it heavily relies on commonly used, repetitive elements. However, without knowing the full context of the sentence or what follows the \\"and,\\" it is hard to provide an exact judgment about the overall sentiment. The phrase could be completed with another negative descriptor, solidifying the disapproving stance, or it could take on a more nuanced meaning if paired with a surprising or unexpected element. Nonetheless, the initial sentiment of the sentence is inclined towards negativity and criticism."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

THE PANNIER He was still pacing there when an hour or so before sunset--some fifteen hours after setting out--they stood before the entrance of a long bottle-necked cove under the shadow of the cliffs of Aquila Point on the southern coast of the Island of Formentera. He was rendered aware of this and roused from his abstraction by the voice of Asad calling to him from the poop and commanding him to make the cove. Already the wind was failing them, and it became necessary to take to the oars, as must in any case have happened once they were through the coves narrow neck in the becalmed lagoon beyond. So Sakr-el-Bahr, in his turn, lifted up his voice, and in answer to his shout came Vigitello and Larocque. A blast of Vigitello's whistle brought his own men to heel, and they passed rapidly along the benches ordering the rowers to make ready, whilst Jasper and a half-dozen Muslim sailors set about furling the sails that already were beginning to flap in the shifting and intermittent gusts of the expiring wind. Sakr-el-Bahr gave the word to row, and Vigitello blew a second and longer blast. The oars dipped, the slaves strained and the galeasse ploughed forward, time being kept by a boatswain's mate who squatted on the waist-deck and beat a tomtom rhythmically. Sakr-el-Bahr, standing on the poop-deck, shouted his orders to the steersmen in their niches on either side of the stern, and skilfully the vessel was manoeuvred through the narrow passage into the calm lagoon whose depths were crystal clear.

What a delicious combination! I got it with sweet potato fries; they were sprinkled with sugar and came with a sweet dip. John got the steak sandwich with the herb fries.

The bird picks a tree: In the scenario of fewer trees, birds will have fewer options to choose from. This could lead to increased competition for suitable nesting locations. 2. The bird collects twigs and other refuse: With fewer trees, there may be fewer resources for birds to collect materials from, thus making it more challenging to build nests or build nests as large as they used to. 3. The bird makes a flat base with twigs: Limited resources could potentially affect the size and stability of the base for the nest. 4. The bird makes sides with twigs and other things: Again, restricted resources might mean the capacity to build larger nests will be reduced. 5. The bird adds softer material to the inside: Even if birds are able to add softer material to their nests, the overall construction may still be affected by the limited resources. 6.

These changes have raised concerns among hundreds of British holidaymakers who now face an extra layer of challenges in accessing medical care. Reports of tourists being forced to pay hefty bills, or even before receiving treatment, call attention to the impact on British tourists travelling to popular resorts in Benidorm and Alicante. This article provides an in-depth analysis of the situation and discusses the implications for holidaymakers, healthcare providers, and tourist destinations. Hospitals in Tourist Resorts Install Payment Machines: In an effort to streamline the process of receiving payments, hospitals in tourist resorts have increasingly relied on machines for managing payments. These machines, designed to collect payments upfront, have created an additional barrier for tourists in need of medical services. As demand for healthcare services has grown among tourists, hospitals in heavily visited areas like Benidorm and Alicante have resorted to such measures, aiming to improve the efficiency of their operations and reduce waiting times for treatment. British Holidaymakers Forced to Pay for Care: The installation of payment machines in hospitals has had a direct impact on many British holidaymakers, as they must now confront the reality of paying for their healthcare services upfront. Hundreds of tourists have reported feeling forced to pay for care, even if they possess travel insurance. The absence of a streamlined method for payment reimbursement has led to frustration and confusion, with holidaymakers facing uncertainty over whether the costs incurred will be reimbursed by their insurance providers. Hefty Medical Bills Impacting Tourists: In addition to the difficulties associated with navigating payment machines, British holidaymakers are also encountering hefty medical bills during their trips. The costs of medical treatments in popular tourist resorts like Benidorm and Alicante are considerably higher than in the UK, and in many cases, payment is required prior to receiving care. For instance, the shocking case of a young boy impaled on a fence demonstrates the severity of the situation, as the boy’s family was asked to hand over cash before treatment could begin. This distressing incident highlights the financial burden that tourists may face while travelling on otherwise enjoyable holidays. The Implications and Potential Solutions: As healthcare providers in tourist resorts continue to implement payment machines, the potential consequences extend far beyond the British holidaymakers. First, tourists from across the world face similar challenges, and often, these healthcare costs discourage them from visiting certain destinations. As a result, local economies that rely on visitors to fuel their tourism industry may face financial ramifications. Moreover, the negative experiences facing these tourists may cast a shadow on their overall view of the destination, affecting word-of-mouth recommendations and social media postings. To mitigate these unintended consequences, local governments and healthcare providers must work together to find a balance that ensures accessible healthcare services and a streamlined payment process for all. Partnerships between travel insurance companies, healthcare providers, and the tourism industry can create solutions that benefit all parties involved, while simultaneously enhancing the image of tourist resorts as safe and caring destinations. Conclusion: The implementation of payment machines in hospitals in tourist resorts presents a complex challenge for British holidaymakers. The experiences of those forced to pay hefty medical bills upfront underscore the need for improved collaboration between healthcare providers, travel insurance companies, and local governments. By working together and prioritizing the needs of tourists, it is possible to create a system that offers accessible and affordable medical care while maintaining the efficiency needed in these high-demand destinations. As the situation continues to evolve, it is crucial to monitor the impact these changes will have on the tourist industry and the holidaymakers who rely on it for memorable and safe experiences."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: If webbed feet are used for moving faster through water by ducks, then what uses webbed feet for moving faster through water? Answer choices: - squids - humans - h2o - trout - octopus - insects - ducks - fish A:","completion":"Webbed feet are specialized anatomical structures found in some animals, characterized by the presence of skin connecting their toes. This adaptation allows these animals to move more efficiently through water by creating a paddle-like effect, increasing the surface area and providing additional propulsion. From the answer choices provided, ducks are the most well-known animals that utilize webbed feet for moving faster through water. However, it's essential to understand the role of webbed feet in other animals as well. - Squids and octopuses: These creatures don’t have webbed feet. Instead, they rely on jet propulsion, utilizing specialized water-filled cavities and muscular contractions to propel themselves through water. - Humans: Humans don't have webbed feet naturally, but swimmers and divers sometimes wear swim fins or flippers that mimic the webbed feet function to enhance their water propulsion and swimming speed. - H2O: H2O refers to the chemical formula for water, which is a liquid substance that doesn't have anatomical structures such as webbed feet. - Trout and fish: While most fish don't have what could be considered webbed feet, they do have specialized fins that serve a similar purpose: allowing them to move with greater speed and agility through water. - Insects: Some aquatic insects, like water beetles and water striders, have evolved specialized structures on their legs that help them move quickly on the water's surface or swim efficiently. While not exactly webbed feet, these adaptations serve similar functions. In conclusion, ducks are the primary example of animals in the answer choices that use webbed feet for moving faster through water. However, the concept of webbed appendages for water mobility extends to other organisms such as specific fish species, insects, and humans wearing swim fins. This highlights that evolutionary adaptations for efficient movement through aquatic environments are diverse and can be seen in various species across the animal kingdom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer a question about this article: Based on experience with German strategic bombing during World War I against the United Kingdom, the British government estimated after the war that 50 casualties— with about one third killed— would result for every tonne of bombs dropped on London. The estimate of tonnes of bombs an enemy could drop per day grew as aircraft technology advanced, from 75 in 1922, to 150 in 1934, to 644 in 1937. That year the Committee on Imperial Defence estimated that an attack of 60 days would result in 600,000 dead and 1,200,000 wounded. News reports of the Spanish Civil War, such as the bombing of Barcelona, supported the 50-casualties-per-tonne estimate. By 1938 experts generally expected that Germany would attempt to drop as much as 3,500 tonnes in the first 24 hours of war and average 700 tonnes a day for several weeks. In addition to high explosive and incendiary bombs the enemy would possibly use poison gas and even bacteriological warfare, all with a high degree of accuracy.

The earth is dusty in summer and glutinous in the rainy season from December to March, when the days are relatively cool and night bitter cold. South of the coastal strip is a bare limestone plateau, about 50 mi wide at Dabaa and 150 mi broad at Sollum. To the south lies the desert, with sand dunes for several hundred miles. Siwa Oasis, a Senussi stronghold, lies 160 mi south of Sollum on the edge of the sand sea and to the east are a string of oases, some close enough to the Nile Valley to be in range of Senussi raiders mounted on camels. A standard-gauge railway ran along the coast from Alexandria, intended to terminate at Sollum, which in 1915 had reached Dabaa, from which ran a track, known as the Khedival Motor Road, which was motorable in dry weather, although when hostilities began the wet season was imminent. The western frontier of Egypt had not been defined in 1914 because negotiations with the Ottomans had been interrupted by the Italo-Turkish War and then negated by the cession of Tripoli to Italy.

Answer: Tennessee was the last state to leave the Union and join the Confederacy at the outbreak of the U.S. Civil War in 1861, and the first state to be readmitted to the Union at the end of the war. Question: how tennessee became a state Answer:","completion":"Tennessee's journey to statehood began well before its official admission to the Union on June 1, 1796. The region was initially inhabited by various Native American tribes, and European explorers, settlers, and traders began to make their way to the area in the mid-16th century. By the mid-18th century, the Cherokee and the Chickasaw tribes were the most prominent Native American groups in the region. The first permanent European settlements were established by the English in the 1760s and 1770s. Tennessee was initially part of North Carolina's western territory, which was known as the \\"Territory South of the River Ohio.\\" In 1784, a few years after the American Revolutionary War, settlers in eastern Tennessee declared the territory as the \\"State of Franklin.\\" However, the bid to become an independent state lacked sufficient support and was eventually dissolved in 1789. In 1790, North Carolina ceded its western territory to the federal government, which then organized it into the Southwest Territory. President George Washington appointed William Blount as the territorial governor, who played a crucial role in preparing the region for statehood. The territory quickly experienced an influx of settlers, and by 1795, it had reached the minimum population requirement of 60,000 to be considered for statehood. The process of officially becoming a state began with a constitutional convention held in Knoxville in January 1796. The convention represented various regions of the territory and comprised 55 delegates who drafted and adopted Tennessee's first state constitution. On February 6, 1796, the delegates completed the drafted constitution, which was then submitted to President Washington and Congress for review. The constitution provided for a bicameral legislature, a governor with limited powers, and a judiciary system. On June 1, 1796, President Washington signed a bill admitting Tennessee as the 16th state of the United States. Tennessee's involvement in the U.S. Civil War came much later in its history. As a southern state with a predominantly agricultural-based economy and a large enslaved population, Tennessee was bound to have divided loyalties during the Civil War. While many citizens supported secession, there were also Unionist pockets, particularly in East Tennessee. Nonetheless, on June 8, 1861, the citizens of Tennessee voted in favor of joining the Confederacy, becoming the last state to do so. The state experienced heavy wartime devastation and was the site of numerous key battles. Towards the end of the war, on July 24, 1866, Tennessee became the first Confederate state to be readmitted to the Union after meeting the requirements for reconstruction. In summary, Tennessee became a state through a series of territorial acquisitions, population growth, and constitutional conventions that led to its admission to the Union in 1796. Its relationship with the federal government during the U.S. Civil War marked a tumultuous period in its history, but the state's readmission to the Union in 1866 signified its commitment to move forward and rebuild."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It sounds like a scene from an episode of the popular and long-running cartoon The Simpsons. A defendant called Bart Simpson, appearing in court in front of a judge called Mr Burns. However, this isn't a fictional case but a real-life trial which took place at Warwick Crown Court this week. Bizarre: A defendant called Bart Simpson, appearing in court in front of a judge called Mr Burns at Warwick Crown Court. Company Director Barton Simpson, 56, stood trial in front of Mr Recorder Burns at Warwick Crown Court on Monday. He was spared jail after admitting that he carried a .38 Smith and Wesson revolver in his luggage while catching a flight at Birmingham airport in May last year. Mr Burns sentenced Simpson to a 12-month community order with 140 hours of unpaid work and ordered him to pay £800 costs. The defendant was flying to Croatia when he put his bag through an X-ray machine which detected the weapon. He told police the gun, which he inherited from his father, was a 'curio' and that he had forgotten it was in his holdall. Stars: Bart Simpson and Mr Burns are long-running characters in The Simpsons. Andrew Wilkins, prosecuting, said. Simpson normally kept the revolver at his home in Eccleshall,. Staffordshire and realised his mistake almost immediately. 'He put his hands to his face and hesitated before he then went through the personal metal detector,' the lawyer said. 'The reason he said he had it with. him, and there is no reason to disagree, was that he was having work. done on his flat while he was travelling and did not want it to come. into the hands of the decorator.' Mr Wilkins said Simpson had intended. to leave the gun locked in his car, but he was distracted because of. circumstances including the deaths of a friend and of his son, a serving. soldier. Mr Burns told Simpson: 'It was a very stupid thing you did. You must be punished for it, but I think you can be dealt with by way of a community order.' A court worker said: 'It's a bizarre. coincidence that Bart Simpson is actually on trial in front of Mr Burns. but it'll proceed as any other criminal case would. 'There were some eyebrows raised when the court list was published.' The fictional Bart Simpson is the main character in the popular, long-running animated television series The Simpsons. He is the eldest child and only son of Homer and Marge. Charles Montgomery 'Monty' Burns, often referred to as Mr Burns, is the evil owner of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. He is the boss of Bart's father Homer. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Although it is certainly fine to go get a drink of water now and then throughout your work day, what can get you in trouble is heading over there—or to any break room situation—when other coworkers are gathered there. The water cooler has become the symbol for communicating office gossip, and steering clear of it can prevent you from getting embroiled in the politics you are trying to avoid. Opt for water breaks when the cooler isn’t surrounded, or for breaks when the break room is empty. To further fortify your avoidance of politics, be strict about who you take breaks with in general, limiting your lunches to trusted coworkers. If you do your research before you get started on a project, you can avoid crossing boundaries into interpersonal issues. For example, if you are assigned to a project without asking any questions and you encounter a problem a couple of days later, you can upset the office equilibrium if you ask the wrong coworker for help. Get all your instructions from the get-go. Ask lots of questions when you get a project. Even go so far as to ask the boss or supervisor for a meeting so that you can ensure that you aren’t impinging on their work time. Ask the person who assigned you project who they prefer you ask questions of before starting the project. This can minimize offense if you go to someone your boss doesn’t like. In order to stay out of office disputes and politics, you have to not care what they think. Getting in the mix and defending yourself can just add fuel to the gossip fire, not to mention create a reputation for yourself of being a time waster. Recognize that work isn’t about who is most well-liked, like it was in high school. Coworkers who form cliques are bad examples, so stay away from them. Instead of worrying about what coworkers like you, focus on doing a good job. If you’re looking for a promotion, the best way to ensure one is to perform high-quality work. A diligent worker does not need to degrade others or pit people against one another in order to advance, because a good performance speaks for itself. Some office politics are related to disputes about who deserves a promotion or more power in the workplace. Stay out of these conversations and build up your reputation as a hard worker.","completion":"This article says that it is okay to get water during work, but we should be careful not to join gossip near the water cooler. To avoid office problems, pick safe times and safe friends for breaks and lunch. Always ask your boss questions about your work to avoid making mistakes. Do not worry about what others think and just focus on doing a good job.

The presence of a busy event with people behind a railing suggests that the area in question has a considerable level of activity and a large number of people attending. This type of setting is typically found in locations where police presence is important to maintain public safety, provide crowd control and deter criminal activities. Furthermore, the people behind the railing indicate that there might be certain designated areas for the crowd, and police officers are likely responsible for ensuring that attendees adhere to the established boundaries. This is a common practice during busy public events, such as parades, concerts, or street festivals, which indeed require increased law enforcement presence for the safety and well-being of all participants. In addition, police officers performing duties in such environments usually adhere to particular schedules and routines that involve regular patrolling of the area. This is crucial to maintain an effective law enforcement presence, as officers can quickly respond to any emergencies or issues while ensuring they are visible to the public. Therefore, taking into account the police officer's mode of transportation (a motorcycle), the busy event, people behind the railing, and the general role of law enforcement in such circumstances, it is logical to conclude that this scenario describes a police officer patrolling a busy area."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

There are several components of the review that point to the customer's overall satisfaction with the product and highlights its positive features. Firstly, the customer makes note of the product's design as \\"well laid out and designed.\\" This implies that the visual aspect of the product is appealing, seemingly organized, and thoughtfully crafted, which are all features that contribute to the product's value. By describing the product in such a way, the reviewer reveals that the product has met or exceeded their expectations in terms of its appearance and presentation. Additionally, the reviewer mentions the use of \\"quality paper,\\" which indicates that the materials utilized in creating the product are of high-quality. Quality materials often lead to better overall user experience and a longer-lasting product. This further accentuates the positive aspects of the product, as the purchaser is satisfied with the durability and the tactile experience provided by the product. The reviewer also \\"thoroughly recommends\\" the product, which is a direct endorsement from someone who has experienced it first-hand. This statement increases the chances of potential buyers considering and purchasing the product themselves, as people tend to put great value in recommendations and testimonials from real users. The only negative aspect that the reviewer addresses is the product's price, which they describe as \\"a little expensive.\\" However, this is followed by praise for the product, which might suggest that despite the higher price point, the product itself justifies the cost. In this case, potential buyers might be more inclined to overlook the cost in favor of the benefits and positive attributes highlighted by the reviewer. In conclusion, this product review is considered to depict the product in a flattering light, as it provides an overall positive impression of the product, with only a minor remark on the expense. By emphasizing the well-executed design, high-quality materials, and recommending it to others, the reviewer positions the product as a valuable and worthwhile investment.

After their parents divorced in 1991, her mother married again that year, to Caitlyn Jenner (then Bruce), the 1976 Summer Olympics decathlon winner. Context: In February 2007, a sex tape made by Kardashian and Ray J in 2003 was leaked. Kardashian filed a lawsuit against Vivid Entertainment, who distributed the film as Kim K Superstar. She later dropped the suit and settled for a reported US5 million. In October 2007 Kardashian, in addition to her mother Kris Jenner, her step-parent Caitlyn Jenner (Bruce), her siblings Kourtney, Khloe, and Rob Kardashian, and half-sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner, began to appear in the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians. The series proved successful for E!, and has led to the creations of spin-offs including Kourtney and Kim Take New York and Kourtney and Kim Take Miami. In one of the episodes, Kim discussed an offer from Playboy to appear nude in the magazine. That December, Kardashian posed for a nude pictorial for Playboy. In 2008, she made her feature film debut in the disaster film spoof Disaster Movie, in which she appeared as a character named Lisa. That same year, she was a participant on season seven of Dancing with the Stars, where she was partnered with Mark Ballas. Kardashian was the third contestant to be eliminated. In January 2009, Kardashian made a cameo appearance during an episode of the sitcom How I Met Your Mother, in the episode \\"Benefits\\".

Barber first identified FPP in 1981, said to apply to about 4% of the population. Besides identifying this trait, Wilson and Barber reported a number of childhood antecedents that likely laid the foundation for fantasy proneness in later life, such as, \`\`a parent, grandparent, teacher, or friend who encouraged the reading of fairy tales, reinforced the child's ... fantasies, and treated the child's dolls and stuffed animals in ways that encouraged the child to believe that they were alive.'' They suggested that this trait was almost synonymous with those who responded dramatically to hypnotic induction, that is, \`\`high hypnotizables.'' The first systematic studies were conducted in the 1980s by psychologists Judith Rhue and Steven Jay Lynn. Later research in the 1990s by Deirdre Barrett at Harvard confirmed most of these characteristics of fantasy prone people, but she also identified another set of highly hypnotizable subjects who had had traumatic childhoods and who identified fantasy time mainly by \`\`spacing out.''

However, it may be considered normal for individuals who are considered fantasy prone, as identified by psychologists Sheryl C. Wilson and Theodore X. Barber. This trait is estimated to apply to about 4% of the population. Fantasy prone individuals often have a childhood history of encouragement and reinforcement of their fantasies by influential figures in their lives. Furthermore, it is important to note the connection between fantasy proneness and high hypnotizability, as suggested by the researchers. Later studies by Judith Rhue, Steven Jay Lynn, and Deirdre Barrett also identified subsets of highly hypnotizable subjects with traumatic childhoods who had a propensity to \\"space out\\" and engage in fantasies.

The 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, also known as 'The Dismissal,' was a political deadlock that occurred when the Senate, controlled by the opposition Liberal-Country Party Coalition led by Malcolm Fraser, refused to pass the budget bills proposed by the ruling Labor government led by Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. The opposition demanded that Whitlam call for a new election as they believed his government was incompetent, particularly following the controversial 1974–75 Loans Affair. The deadlock persisted, and the government struggled to maintain essential services and payments without the necessary budgetary bills passed by the Senate. As the impasse wore on, the Governor-General Sir John Kerr intervened to resolve the crisis. The 1975 constitutional crisis deadlock ultimately ended on November 11, 1975. On that day, the Governor-General took the unprecedented step of dismissing Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, dissolving the Parliament, and appointing Malcolm Fraser as caretaker Prime Minister. This led to a general election on December 13, 1975, in which the Liberal-Country Party Coalition emerged victorious, and Malcolm Fraser became the Prime Minister of Australia. In summary, the deadlock of the 1975 constitutional crisis came to an end on November 11, 1975, when Governor-General Sir John Kerr dismissed Gough Whitlam as Prime Minister, dissolved the Parliament, and appointed Malcolm Fraser as caretaker Prime Minister."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Holidays are really important. Many of us will have childhood memories of summer holidays where we were taken away from home to experience new environments and learn in different ways. But holidays are expensive and, for those on low wages or living on benefits, they are often unobtainable. Even the cheapest holidays require travel and other additional costs that are difficult for many families to meet. For working parents, the long summer break can be a very difficult problem for childcare. When an annual leave allowance amounts to only five weeks, there is a need to spread this across the year. Couples can find themselves taking leave in turn in order to care for children who are on holiday. For some this makes even an affordable family holiday difficult. The schools that I visit in Nottingham are full of experienced staff committed to giving our children a caring and inspiring learning environment. The number of children receiving free school meals is quite large in Nottingham and many schools have breakfast clubs to make sure that children get a healthy start to the day. Most schools undertake programs of group or individual educational support. Schools also have an important role in safeguarding children's welfare through the ongoing touch and support with their pupils. During the long summer holidays, much of this is missed. While teachers are holidaying in the UK, many of their pupils spend the whole six weeks on the street where they live. The lack of free school meals for six weeks can result in pressure on a family budget and an inability to afford the inspiring experiences that help children to continue their learning. In setting out its plans for a five-term year, Nottingham City Council is seeking to reduce the summer holiday down to four and a half weeks, with a more balanced five terms of roughly eight weeks, each followed by a two-week break. We believe this will give real \\"down time\\" for school staff and pupils alike but will be short enough not to cause a real break in learning. We...

Make this proper case","completion":"To learn Tai Chi Chuan, you must be conscious of yourself both physically and mentally. This ancient Chinese martial art, also known as \\"supreme ultimate fist,\\" not only focuses on self-defense techniques but also on cultivating the individual's overall well-being. First and foremost, understand the philosophy behind Tai Chi Chuan, which is largely influenced by the concept of Yin and Yang. The balance of these opposing forces promotes harmony and health, both crucial aspects of Tai Chi practice. To begin learning this powerful art, follow these crucial steps: 1. Find a qualified instructor: A competent teacher with suitable experience in Tai Chi Chuan will ensure you learn the proper techniques and methods. They can also give you individual attention, correct your errors, and guide you towards progress and improvement. 2. Develop patience and dedication: Learning Tai Chi Chuan takes time, and it is essential to invest yourself in consistent practice. You must be patient and dedicated to truly experience its benefits. 3. Learn the basic stances and movements: Start with learning foundation exercises such as standing meditation (Zhan Zhuang), which helps with balance and body awareness. Gradually move on to basic stances, like horse stance and bow stance, and learn fundamental movements to build a solid foundation. 4. Practice forms and sequences: Tai Chi Chuan consists of several forms, which are a set of movements practiced in a particular sequence. As you become comfortable with the basic movements, progress towards learning and practicing these forms. 5. Incorporate breathing techniques: Proper breathing is crucial in Tai Chi Chuan. Learn to inhale and exhale slowly and synchronously with your movements. This will help you maintain focus, enhance your movements' effectiveness and develop your inner energy, known as \\"Qi.\\" 6. Engage in partner exercises: As you move forward in your Tai Chi journey, participate in partner exercises that teach you how to assess, redirect, and manipulate an opponent's energy and movements. 7. Cultivate mindfulness and self-awareness: Proper Tai Chi practice requires a heightened level of mindfulness and self-awareness. Develop these by concentrating on your movements, remaining grounded and present, meditating, and channeling your internal energy throughout your body. 8.

Funerary art tends to be conservative in style, and many grave markers in various cultures follow rather traditional patterns, while others reflect modernism or other recent styles. Public monuments representing collective memorials to particular groups of dead people continue to be erected, especially war memorials, and in the Western world have now replaced individual or family memorials as the dominant types of very large memorials; Western political leaders now usually receive simple graves. Some large memorials are fairly traditional, while those reflecting more contemporary styles include the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and several Holocaust memorials, such as Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, the Vel d'Hiv Memorial in Paris (1994), the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin (2004), and the Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial in Vienna (2000). These are in notable contrast to the style of most war memorials to the military of World War II; earlier modernist memorials to the dead of World War I were sometimes removed after a time as inappropriate. Some war memorials, especially in countries like Germany, have had a turbulent political history, for example the much-rededicated Neue Wache in Berlin and the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which is internationally controversial.Several critics detect a crisis in public memorial style from 1945, when the traditional figurative symbolic language, and evocation of nationalist values, came to seem inadequate, especially in relation to genocide, at least on the Western side of the Iron Curtain. In the Communist East the established style of Socialist Realism was still considered appropriate, at least by the authorities. The generation of abstracted and conceptual war and Holocaust memorials erected in the West from the 1990s onwards seems finally to have found a resolution for these issues.Many large mausoleums have been constructed for political leaders, including Lenin's Mausoleum and those for Atatürk, Jinnah, Kim Il-Sung, Che Guevara and several Presidential...

If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: Who is faced with the death of his dear mother? Title: The Simple-Minded Murder Movie plot: The story takes place in 1930's SkÃ¥ne, Sweden, and focuses on Sven, who is hare-lipped and thus can't speak correctly. Most people consider him stupid, and call him an idiot. The film begins with Sven and a woman, who we later learn is called Anna, driving an old car across the landscape. The sun is setting, and in the sky Sven sees three angels. He and Anna hide in an old house, and while Anna makes herself comfortable, Sven throws a huge, bloodstained blade into a well. He lies down beside Anna and starts his inner monologue about how it all began. When Sven's mother died, he was \\"taken care of\\" by HÃ¶glund (Hans Alfredsson), an evil factory owner who is a member of the local Nazi party, and lives on a farm. Sven must work on HÃ¶glund's farm without pay, and sleep among cows in the stables, where he is tormented by a rat. Being very goodhearted, Sven cannot make himself drown the animal once he has caught it, because he simply can't take another life. Having read the Bible, a gift from his sister, Sven imagines he is visited by three angels from time to time, whom he speaks to in a clear voice, making it clear that this dialog takes place in his own mind. One day he mets the wheelchair-bound Anna (Maria Johansson), whom he falls in love with, and having been mistreated at HÃ¶glund's, Sven escapes to Anna's family, who gladly take him in. At Anna's house, Sven is finally treated as an adult. He is given a real bed, gets to work at their own farm, and is paid by Anna's father, Mr. Anderson (Per Myrberg), \\"in real money\\", as he points out when HÃ¶glund comes and wants to take Sven back to his farm. Although Andersson wins the argument, Sven faints from fear. Sven decides to buy himself a motorcycle, a real Indian. But HÃ¶glund, now out for revenge, pulls some strings and uses his contacts to ensure Sven can't get a driver's license. After a long media battle arranged by Anderson, Sven gets his license and starts riding his motorcycle around town. HÃ¶glund, however, does not surrender that easily. The...

This article: Inside the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle Cesare Angelotti, former consul of the Roman Republic and now an escaped political prisoner, runs into the church and hides in the Attavanti private chapel – his sister, the Marchesa Attavanti, has left a key to the chapel hidden at the feet of the statue of the Madonna. The elderly Sacristan enters and begins cleaning. The Sacristan kneels in prayer as the Angelus sounds. The painter Mario Cavaradossi arrives to continue work on his picture of Mary Magdalene. The Sacristan identifies a likeness between the portrait and a blonde-haired woman who has been visiting the church recently (unknown to him, it is Angelotti's sister the Marchesa). Cavaradossi describes the \\"hidden harmony\\" (\\"Recondita armonia\\") in the contrast between the blonde beauty of his painting and his dark-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca. The Sacristan mumbles his disapproval before leaving. Angelotti emerges and tells Cavaradossi, an old friend who has republican sympathies, that he is being pursued by the Chief of Police, Baron Scarpia. Cavaradossi promises to assist him after nightfall. Tosca's voice is heard, calling to Cavaradossi. Cavaradossi gives Angelotti his basket of food and Angelotti hurriedly returns to his hiding place. Tosca enters and suspiciously asks Cavaradossi what he has been doing – she thinks that he has been talking to another woman. Cavaradossi reassures her and Tosca tries to persuade him to take her to his villa that evening: \\"Non la sospiri, la nostra casetta\\" (\\"Do you not long for our little cottage\\"). She then expresses jealousy over the woman in the painting, whom she recognises as the Marchesa Attavanti. Cavaradossi explains the likeness; he has merely observed the Marchesa at prayer in the church. He reassures Tosca of his fidelity and asks her what eyes could be more beautiful than her own: \\"Qual'occhio al mondo\\" (\\"What eyes in the world\\").

Here is a goal: how to use bleach when handwashing clothes How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of using bleach when handwashing clothes, follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Prepare the Area Choose a well-ventilated area to handwash your clothes with bleach. This is because bleach has a strong odor that can be harmful when inhaled for an extended period. Having a well-ventilated area also allows the bleach to work more effectively. Step 2: Gather Necessary Materials For this process, you'll need: - Laundry bleach (chlorine bleach or color-safe bleach, depending on your clothes) - Rubber gloves - A basin or container large enough for the clothes - Cold water - A measuring cup - A mild detergent - A soft brush or cloth (optional, for scrubbing) Step 3: Sort the Clothes Separate white clothes from colored ones. Chlorine bleach is ideal for white clothes, as it can cause discoloration on colored garments. If you need to use bleach on colored clothes, use a color-safe bleach specifically designed for that purpose. Step 4: Dilute the Bleach Follow the instructions on the bleach bottle for the appropriate dilution ratio. Generally, you should dilute 1/4 cup of bleach in 1 gallon of cold water for white clothes or 1 cup of color-safe bleach in a gallon of water for colored clothes. Always dilute the bleach to avoid damaging the fabric. Step 5: Pre-treat Stains (optional) If there are specific stains on the clothes, you can pre-treat them by applying a small amount of the diluted bleach directly onto the stain. Let it sit for a few minutes (around 3-5 minutes) before proceeding to the next step. Step 6: Soak the Clothes Fully submerge the clothes in the bleach solution and let them soak for around 5-10 minutes. Make sure to wear rubber gloves to protect your skin from the bleach. Step 7: Handwash the Clothes Add mild detergent to the water and gently agitate the clothes to remove dirt and stains. You can use a soft brush or cloth to help remove stubborn stains. Do this for around 5-10 minutes. Step 8: Rinse the Clothes Thoroughly rinse the clothes under cold running water until no traces of detergent and bleach remain. You may need to change the water a few times to ensure proper rinsing. Step 9: Dry the Clothes Gently wring out the excess water from the clothes. Avoid twisting the clothes too much as it may cause damage to the fabric. Hang the clothes to dry in a well-ventilated area, away from direct sunlight. By following these steps, you can effectively use bleach when handwashing clothes, ensuring that they are clean and properly sanitized."},{"prompt":"Q:The U.S. has long had the unenviable distinction of holding the world's largest prison population, in part because of tough-on-crime policies enacted in the 1990s. But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading...

French president says peace in Europe is precarious as he embarks on week-long tour Emmanuel Macron has used the first world war armistice centenary commemorations to call for a “real” European army, warning that rising nationalism and populism threaten the fragile peace on the continent. “We have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America,” Macron said as he visited the sites of the western front battlefields in northern France on Tuesday. Macron has begun a rare week-long memorial tour of north-east France, calling at villages and small towns that a century ago witnessed the bloodshed of the war and that are now struggling against deindustrialisation and unemployment. “When I see President Trump announcing that he’s quitting a major disarmament treaty which was formed after the 1980s Euromissile crisis that hit Europe, who is the main victim? Europe and its security,” he said in a radio interview to mark 100 years since the end of hostilities. “Peace in Europe is precarious,” he said. The tour culminates on Sunday when Macron hosts Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and dozens of other heads of state at an armistice commemoration in Paris followed by an international “peace conference”. Arriving in Verdun, the site of one of the longest and most savagely fought battles of the war, Macron honoured the local people who fought and died in the trenches. He has argued that modern French society more than ever needs to hail “everyday heroes” such as these. The tour is also aimed at addressing his falling personal popularity ratings, which have reached a new low of less than 30%. An Ifop survey published on Sunday showed that Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party – formerly Front National – had moved ahead of Macron’s centrists for the first time. Far-right and anti-EU parties had combined support of 30%, up from 25% at the end of the summer. Macron, who came to power last year by defeating Le Pen and who has promised to save the EU by championing greater integration, intends to style himself as a leader of progressives against hardline nationalism in the European elections next spring. Although his party firmly controls the French parliament, giving him free rein to implement his pro-business manifesto and overhaul labour and the welfare state, he is struggling to shake off his image as a member of the metropolitan elite, cut off from peripheral towns and villages such as those on the centenary trail in the north-east. What was once seen as Macron’s straight-talking is now criticised as arrogance. Nationwide protests and blockades against higher fuel prices scheduled for later this month have added to the government’s difficulties. Macron stopped outside Verdun town hall to talk to local residents, some of whom complained that he was letting down pensioners, students and workers. “Do you feel the malaise in France?” shouted a retired factory worker. “I hear you, I respect you,” Macron said. The president called for pragmatism, saying he could not offer an immediate fix for what he argued was nearly 40 years of drift. He said France’s problem with mass unemployment was unique in Europe and he vowed to transform the work, welfare and pensions system. “I know what’s being said. I know there is impatience and anger,” he said. Residents shrugged. Aldo, 59, who had worked as a carpenter since the age of 16 but was now on disability allowance, said he had voted for Le Pen. “Macron’s a former banker, he only listens to the rich,” he said. “At the next election I don’t think I’ll bother to vote at all.” Macron is likely to warn Trump, Putin and other leaders on Sunday that multilateralism and cooperation between nations must be protected in what he calls a new era of isolationism and populism akin to that of the 1930s. “I am struck by similarities between the times we live in and those between the two world wars,” he told a French newspaper last week, adding that nationalism was a “leprosy” spreading worldwide. Trump, who greatly appreciated attending France’s vast Bastille Day military parade in Paris last summer, might have expected military fanfare. But the armistice centenary in France has deliberately focused on civilians, not the military – it is not a celebration of victory but a focus on the need for peace, largely because of the bloodshed of the second world war that followed so soon after. Macron also used his armistice trip to address a painful part of French colonial history by paying tribute to African troops who fought in France in the war. These soldiers, often referred to as Senegalese tirailleurs (riflemen), were in fact drawn from all over west Africa and were seen as never having been given the prominence they deserved in French history books. Macron was to be joined in the north-east city of Reims by the Malian president, Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta, whose great-grandfather fought and died in the battle of Verdun and whose body was never found. France deployed an estimated 200,000 black troops in the war. Mor Ndao, a history professor at Cheikh Anta Diop University in the Senegalese capital, Dakar, told AFP that France had never “recognised sufficiently the role and importance of the tirailleurs”. He said: “Their treatment has been unequal compared to their French and European brothers in arms.” ||||| French President Emmanuel Macron is calling for the formation of a “real European army” to protect the continent “with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America.” Agence France-Presse reports that while on a tour of World War I memorials Tuesday, Macron said: “We will not protect the Europeans unless we decide to have a true European army.” Macron has advocated for the mobilization of a collective European force since his election last year. But those calls may be received with more urgency after President Trump announced last month that the U.S. would pull out of a Cold War era nuclear weapons treaty with Russia. Trump has also displayed a tepid attitude in the past towards NATO’s mutual defense commitments. “When I see President Trump announcing that he’s quitting a major disarmament treaty, who is the main victim? Europe and its security,” Macron said on a visit to Verdun, a French city that was the site of a major battle in 1916.

The E.U. launched an annual €5.5 billion (6.3 billion) joint defense fund last year, and added another €13 billion (14.8 billion) in defense spending in June to support development of new military technology. France has also led the formation of a nine-country rapid deployment force to respond to crises like evacuations or natural disasters. Macron is preparing to host dozens of world leaders, including Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, on Sunday to mark the 100th anniversary of the World War I armistice. But ahead of that anniversary, the French president has spoken of modern threats to European peace, including the reemergence of “authoritarian powers” and “intrusion attempts in cyber-space” seeking to derail democratic elections in Europe. (Russia has been accused of intervening in elections in France as well as supporting far-right parties in Germany and elsewhere.) “Peace in Europe is precarious,” Macron said. Write to Eli Meixler at eli.meixler@time.com. ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption President Macron is visiting a series of monuments this week to mark the centenary of the World War One Armistice French President Emmanuel Macron has warned that Europeans cannot be protected without a \\"true, European army\\", as he marks the centenary of the World War One Armistice. On a visit to the former Western Front in Verdun, he said Russia had shown it could be a threat and Europe had to be able \\"to defend itself better alone\\". Russia's president will be among world leaders marking the Armistice in Paris. Mr Macron has already proposed a joint intervention force for crisis missions. German Chancellor Angela Merkel backed the idea of an intervention force in June, but said it would have to be part of \\"the structure of defence co-operation\\". The UK, while in favour of such a joint force, is opposed to a European army, because of the potential risk of creating a parallel structure to Nato. President Macron has already warned that Europeans can no longer rely on the US to defend them, and he revived the theme on Tuesday, in response to President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of a 1987 nuclear treaty with Russia, banning medium-range ground-launched missiles. \\"Who is the main victim? Europe and its security,\\" he told French radio station Europe 1. \\"I want to build a real security dialogue with Russia, which is a country I respect, a European country - but we must have a Europe that can defend itself on its own without relying only on the United States.\\" Speaking about cyber security, he also said: \\"We have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America.\\" Will there be a European army? By Defence correspondent Jonathan Marcus There is no evidence that any group of European countries has the political will or economic muscle to spend sufficiently on defence to make up for the United States' raw power. Indeed the deployment of troops \\"into harm's way\\" remains the ultimate sovereign decision of a national government. There is no \\"Nato army\\" today - merely an alliance of national components trained and accustomed to operating together. President Macron's call for a greater European effort in defence derives from two sets of factors: his support for the greater European project on the one hand, but also horror at much that the Trump Administration is doing on the other, with its overturning of treaties and so on. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Nato holds biggest military exercise since Cold War But could Europe really stand up to Russia alone? And what of the longer-term threat from China? The US relationship may be problematic but it could be becoming more important than ever. President Macron's battlefield tour will take in the River Somme as well as Verdun. 'Ultra-liberal Europe' Last week he warned of the \\"leprosy\\" of nationalism spreading worldwide and declared that he had been struck by the similarities of current times and the period between World War One and World War Two. UK Prime Minister Theresa May will join Mr Macron on Friday at the Somme while President Trump will join dozens of world leaders for Sunday's ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. During his interview on Tuesday, Mr Macron warned that there was anger against a \\"too ultra-liberal Europe that no longer allows our middle classes a decent living\\".

(Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized vermiform creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them from doing this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature \\"Dren\\" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsa's shirt. After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink filled with cold water.

Q: Title: Just a lot of hype Review: I purchased this product at the suggestion of my husband after he saw an infomercial for the product. I was hesitant because I had purchased a different model of the Euro-Pro Shark Cordless Sweeper back in 2003 and promptly returned it. This latest model is no different as far as performance. It is very expensive and for what? It made skid marks on my kitchen floor, it feels very flimsy and I was afraid I would break it, because the dust cup is plastic it creates static electricity which makes the debris just cling to the dust cup. I just was not pleased with the product. It just doesn't seem to have any \\"meat\\" to it. I have three dogs and two cats and need something with strength and power to clean the kitchen floor. For me this product just didn't meet my criteria. Is this product review negative? A:","completion":"Yes, this product review is negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction from the onset, citing an initial hesitation due to a past experience with a similar model by the same brand. They go on to critique general aspects of the product like its construction, quality and functionality. The reviewer states the product feels \\"flimsy,\\" indicating concerns about the product’s durability and robustness. They worry that it could easily break and point out specific features – such as the use of plastic for a dust cup – that they believe contribute to its underwhelming integrity. They also note that the dust cup creates static electricity which causes debris to cling to it. This point suggests they find the product hard to use and clean, a criticism that furthers the negative slant of the review. In addition, the reviewer mentions that the product makes skid marks on their kitchen floor, which shows it fails to satisfy their cleaning needs effectively without causing additional problems. Finally, the review concludes by stating that the product lacks \\"meat\\" - a metaphorical way of saying the product lacks quality, substance, or required functions for it to be deemed satisfactory. The reviewer elaborates they need a cleaner with strength and power due to their three dogs and two cats, a requirement this product fails to meet. The exclamation questioning the high cost of the product further brings out the reviewer's disappointment by implying that the product isn't worth its price point. In conclusion, the overall tone of frustration, disappointment, and dissatisfaction confirms that this is indeed a negative review. The reviewer explicitly states their displeasure with the product’s performance, construction, and even its price point, suggesting that it's not a satisfactory purchase for them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Eliminating unlikely options A ball gown is not a location, making it an invalid option. The ivory coast option refers to a geographical area, which doesn't provide enough context to confirm John's location. The kalahari desert is a wildlife habitat, but the presence of a turned-on light implies that John is indoors. Step 3: Comparing the remaining options Considering both the zoo and trophy room, both locations involve animals. However, while a zoo is built for the housing, preservation, and observation of animals, a trophy room is a place where hunters typically display their kills as hunting trophies.

Options: - close - closeness - proximity - near - measured in meters Answer:","completion":"The driver forgot his glasses, so he was having trouble judging the distance of oncoming cars and wouldn't pull out, thinking they were all too close. This is because, without his glasses, the driver would have difficulty accurately perceiving the distances between his vehicle and other cars on the road. As a result, he might perceive that all the oncoming cars are closer than they actually are due to his impaired vision. This would make him hesitant to pull out into traffic, as he would not want to risk causing an accident due to misjudging the distances. In this context, the most appropriate option in line with common sense is \\"close.\\" This term best reflects the driver's perception that the oncoming cars were too close for him to safely pull out into traffic. The other options do not convey the same meaning or are less suitable in this context. \\"Closeness\\" and \\"proximity\\" are nouns and do not fit grammatically in this situation. \\"Near\\" might be considered as an alternative, but it is less precise and clear than \\"close\\" in describing the driver's perception of the situation.

Given the question: With the growth of the Internet and the ease of publishing content, more and more creative minds are coming online to share videos, music, software, products, services, opinions, and more. While the technology has empowered a generation to build new audiences and share interesting things, an unfortunate side-effect has been a culture in which some consumers of this content have provided feedback in a form that is personalized, mean-spirited, disrespectful, and in some cases, malicious. We have all seen it…the trolls, the haters, the comment boxes filled with venom and vitriol, typically pointed at people just trying to do good and interesting things. Unfortunately, this conduct can be jarring for many people, with some going as far to give up sharing their creative endeavours so as not to deal with the “wrath of the Internet”. As some of you will know, this has been bothering me for a while now. While there is no silver bullet for solving these issues, one thing I have learned over the years is how to put negative, anti-social, and non-constructive comments and feedback into perspective. To help others with this I have written a free book called Dealing With Disrespect. Dealing With Disrespect is a short, simple to read, free book that provides a straight-forward guide for handling this kind of challenging feedback, picking out the legitimate criticism to learn from, and how to not just ignore the haters, but how to manage them. The book helps put all communication, whether on or offline, into perspective and helps you to become a better communicator yourself.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: How did the man checking on the telephone line die? ? Wildlife photographer Pickett Smith is taking photographs of the local flora and fauna as he canoes through a swamp surrounding an island containing the affluent mansion estate of the wealthy and influential Crockett family. Also evident throughout the swamp are numerous indicators of pollution, which Pickett believes are connected to pesticide use on the island plantation. After Clint Crockett accidentally tips over Smith's canoe, he and his sister Karen escort Smith to the family mansion where he meets the entire Crockett family. The grouchy, wheelchair-bound patriarch Jason intends on spending the next day enjoying both the 4th of July and his own birthday celebrations uninterrupted. Due to the mutual dislike of the fauna around the mansion, Jason sends a man named Grover to spray pesticide in order to get rid of the frogs. Pickett later discovers Grover's corpse covered in snakebites in the swamp not far from the house. Despite this warning, Jason continues with his celebrations the next day. Early next morning, Michael Martindale sets out to check on a possible downed telephone line. He accidentally shoots himself in the leg and is rendered immobile by strange white moss hanging down from the surrounding trees. Tarantulas descend from the branches and kill him. Back on the estate, Jason's sister, Iris Martindale sends her son, Kenneth into the greenhouse to collect flowers for a centerpiece. As he gathers the flowers, he fails to notice dozens of tokay geckos entering behind him. The geckos swarm over the stacked shelves, knocking over numerous jars of poisonous chemicals, and the resulting toxic gas asphyxiates him. Seeing the danger posed by the animals, Pickett suggests that everyone should leave the island, but Jason is adamant that nothing will ruin his birthday. A:","completion":"The man checking on the telephone line, Michael Martindale, died due to a combination of unfortunate events. Firstly, he accidentally shot himself in the leg, leaving him immobile and unable to escape the dangerous situation that followed. Next, he was rendered helpless by the strange white moss hanging down from the surrounding trees, presumably entangling him and preventing him from moving. Finally, the immediate cause of his death was the descent of tarantulas from the tree branches, which ultimately killed him."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This is especially true for shoes made of leather or suede, but all shoes benefit from being cleaned up before you store them. Even if you’re just storing your shoes for the night, and you’re planning on wearing them again tomorrow, it’s a good idea to clean them before you put them away. Let them dry before storing. Clean leather and suede shoes by brushing off dirt and dust with a soft, non-scratchy brush. Use a special leather or suede cleaner to remove stains. Clean canvas shoes by brushing them off, then using soapy water to clean stains. Wash plastic shoes with soap and water. If you’ve previously been throwing all your boots, heels, and running shoes in one big pile, picking out pairs as you need them, it’s time to sort your shoes. Sorting them by season and purpose will help your closet stay organized and keep your shoes in better condition than if you just toss them all together. Group your heels and other dress shoes together. Plan to store your winter boots and other winter shoes in the same place. Group flip flops, sandals and other summer shoes together. Group your exercise shoes and casual shoes together. Shoes remain in their best condition when they’re not exposed to lots of sunlight or hot or cold temperatures. The best place to store shoes is in a cool, dark closet that doesn’t get excessively warm and stuffy. If you don’t have enough room in your closet, you could store them under your bed or on your bedroom wall. Don’t store shoes in the basement, garage or other places that might get cold in the winter and hot in the summer. The fibers the shoes are made out of could break down over time under these conditions. If you’re going to be storing shoes for a month or longer before you next wear them, stuffing shoes with paper helps them retain their shape. Just make sure it’s acid-free paper, since paper that contains acid can damage shoe materials. Avoid using newsprint, since it could discolor your shoes. Cut up toilet paper rolls also work well. Use shoe trees for your best shoes. If you have a pair of nice leather shoes, store them with shoe trees so they stay in tip-top condition. Shoe trees made out of cedar keep shoes smelling fresh, and they also repel moths and other bugs. Shoe trees are available at shoe stores or online. If you have a nice pair of boots you want to store, use boot stands to keep them upright. If the tops flop over, they could end up with a permanent crease after a few months of storage. If you don’t want to invest in boot stands, try this clever trick: use empty, dry wine bottles to keep your boots upright. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article emphasizes the importance of proper shoe storage to maintain their quality and organization. It recommends cleaning various types of shoes, like leather, suede, canvas, and plastic, before storing them. The article also suggests sorting shoes by season and purpose, and storing them in a cool, dark environment to avoid exposure to extreme temperatures and sunlight. For long-term storage, use acid-free paper, shoe trees, or boot stands to retain the shape and prevent damage.

Copyright infringement: To prevent piracy of films, the standard drill of film distribution is to have a movie first released through movie theaters (theatrical window), on average approximately 16 and a half weeks, before having it released to Blu-Ray and DVD (entering its video window). During the theatrical window, digital versions of films are often transported in data storage devices by couriers rather than by data transmission. The data can be encrypted, with the key being made to work only at specific times in order to prevent leakage between screens. Coded Anti-Piracy marks can be added to films to identify the source of illegal copies and shut them down. As a result of these measures, the only versions of films available for piracy during the theatrical window are usually \\"cams\\" made by video recordings of the movie screens, which are of inferior quality compared to the original film version.

Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"What ship has a distinct advantage over carriers?\\" is in \\"The aircraft carrier dramatically changed naval combat in World War II, because air power was becoming a significant factor in warfare. The advent of aircraft as focal weapons was driven by the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft. They had higher range and precision than naval guns, making them highly effective. The versatility of the carrier was demonstrated in November 1940 when HMS Illustrious launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at their base in Taranto, signalling the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes. This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships at a cost of two torpedo bombers. World War II in the Pacific Ocean involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets. The 1941 Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Concentrating six carriers in a single unit turned naval history about, as no other nation had fielded anything comparable. However, the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of HMS Glorious by German battleships during the Norwegian campaign in 1940.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, the ship that has a distinct advantage over carriers is not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer that aircraft carriers themselves hold significant advantages over other types of ships due to their ability to launch aircraft that have superior range, flexibility, and effectiveness, as demonstrated by the examples of HMS Illustrious and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. These powerful capabilities fundamentally changed naval combat during World War II, as they allowed for more effective and highly mobile strikes compared to traditional battleships or other naval vessels. That being said, it is important to note that carriers can also be vulnerable when forced into gun-range encounters, as demonstrated by the sinking of HMS Glorious. Nevertheless, the overall advantages provided by aircraft carriers in terms of range and strategic capabilities have made them essential components in modern naval forces."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Chad Pennington returned under center for the Jets, as they attempted to get their first win of the season against another winless team, the Miami Dolphins. The Jets' offense got going toward the end of the first quarter with a three-yard touchdown pass from Pennington to Laveranues Coles. The Dolphins responded swiftly as Trent Green and Ronnie Brown led the team on a three-minute drive that culminated on a one-yard run by Brown to tie the score at seven. However, the Jets wasted little time reclaiming the lead. Leon Washington received the ensuing kickoff at the two-yard line and returned it 98&#160;yards for a touchdown and a 14-7 lead. The Dolphins crept back with field goals of 31 and 39&#160;yards by Jay Feely on their next two possessions. Pennington kept the Dolphins at bay with a successful two-minute drill, finding tight end Chris Baker on a four-yard touchdown to close the first half and give the Jets a 21-13 halftime lead. The Jets attempted to further their lead opening the third quarter, but were stopped short of the goal line and had to settle for a 21-yard Mike Nugent field goal. The Dolphins tried to respond, but the Jets' defense forced their first takeaway of the season on the ensuing drive, an interception by Kerry Rhodes. Pennington led his offense downfield with the help of several Thomas Jones running plays before he ran into the end zone to give the Jets a 31-13 lead early in the fourth quarter. Miami would not go down quietly, however. Green quickly marched the Dolphins downfield to set up Brown's two-yard touchdown run. The Dolphins elected to attempt a two-point conversion to cut their deficit to ten; using a Statue of Liberty play, Brown walked into the end zone to complete the conversion. Although the Jets shed several minutes off the clock on their following possession, the Dolphins got the ball back and again were able to move swiftly downfield, where Brown scored his third touchdown on a 22-yard pass from Green. The Dolphins needed to recover an onside kick on the ensuing kickoff to have a chance to tie or win the game, but, despite a penalty moving the ball up ten yards, were unsuccessful, and Pennington knelt out the clock to give the Jets their first victory of the season.

Step 1: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation. We have -16*f and +f on the left side, so we combine these to get: (-16*f + f) = -15*f So, now our equation is: -15*f = 22*f Step 2: Add 15*f to both sides of the equation to isolate 'f' on the right side. (-15*f) + 15*f = 22*f + 15*f This simplifies to: 0 = 37*f Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 37 to solve for 'f'. 0 ÷ 37 = 37*f ÷ 37 This further simplifies to f = 0 So, the solution to the equation -16*f + f = 22*f is f = 0."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It seems these elements are unrelated to each other. However, to address your question about the supposed perturbation, we should analyze each option: 1. Directly impacting a step of the process: A faulty magnet in a phone is unlikely to have any direct impact on the process of forest formation or dead trees in the forest. These are separate phenomena, and unless the magnet causes a chain reaction that affects forest growth or leads to tree death, there's no direct connection between the faulty magnet and the forest. 2. Indirectly impacting a step of the process: While it's still improbable, the faulty magnet could indirectly impact the forest if it leads to circumstances that negatively impact the environment. For instance, if the magnet causes the phone to malfunction, and the user improperly disposes of their broken phone, leading to electronic waste, it might contribute to an increase in pollution. This pollution could, in turn, negatively affect the process of forest formation or the health of trees. Nonetheless, the potential impact of a single phone's faulty magnet on the forest is minimal and negligible. 3. Not impacting any step of the process: This is the most likely option. A faulty magnet in a phone should not have any impact on the process of forest formation or dead trees in the forest as these are separate phenomena and not related to each other.

However, after the introduction of the status of assistants at the beginning of the current legislature, we still do not have clear evidence that more assistants are needed. The Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on December 1, 2009, brought significant changes to the functioning of the European Union and its institutions, including the European Parliament. One of the main objectives of the treaty was to enhance the democratic legitimacy of the EU by strengthening the role of the European Parliament in decision-making processes and increasing its powers in areas such as legislative and budgetary matters, foreign and security policy, and appointment procedures for high-level EU officeholders. As a result of this increased role, the Parliament is indeed faced with a higher workload and more complex administrative tasks, meaning that it requires additional resources, including staff and administrative capacities, to effectively carry out its duties. With regard to the status of assistants, it is important to differentiate between different types of staff that work for the European Parliament. There are Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) and their personal staff, who are also known as parliamentary assistants. These assistants are directly employed by MEPs to support them in their daily tasks and legislative activities. At the beginning of the current legislative term, the status of parliamentary assistants was introduced, along with rules governing their employment conditions, duties, and obligations, in an effort to ensure a more transparent and professional relationship between MEPs and their assistants. While it has been acknowledged that the Treaty of Lisbon has led to a higher workload for the European Parliament and its Members, it is not immediately clear whether this increased workload has led to a specific necessity for more parliamentary assistants. It should be noted that Parliament does have access to various other resources and supports, such as committee secretariats and political group staff, which also contribute to managing the responsibilities brought about by the treaty. However, it could be argued that further analysis and assessment regarding the potential need for increased staffing levels would be beneficial. This could involve an examination of the existing workloads of parliamentary assistants, as well as exploring alternative solutions that may address the administrative challenges arising from the Treaty of Lisbon, and thus ensuring the European Parliament functions effectively and efficiently. In conclusion, while the Treaty of Lisbon has undeniably increased the administrative and workload demands on the European Parliament and its staff, it is not yet definitively established whether there is a specific need for a higher number of parliamentary assistants. Further evaluation and assessment of the existing resources and challenges implied by the treaty would provide a more informed basis for deciding on the necessity of such a measure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Many broadcast companies, particularly if they are well-established, will have a standard contract they use in most situations. Don't think that just because the company already has a standard agreement, that means you can't suggest changes or refuse clauses that don't fit your needs. Options are: 1). Companies do recognize that these contracts are not one-size-fits-all, and will require adjustment to fit each situation appropriately. Determine what material will be covered by the agreement. 2). Change the agreement to suit the company's needs. The response will be based on what you want out of the company. 3). If the company has a standard contract, however, there's no need to draft it for you. You can draft your own contract if you want to. 4). Additionally, there is no need to discuss certain clauses at all with the company's representative. Conflicts of interest such as disputes between the local state and national governments are a no-no.","completion":"1). Companies do recognize that these contracts are not one-size-fits-all, and will require adjustment to fit each situation appropriately. Determine what material will be covered by the agreement. The correct answer is option 1 as it elaborates on the fact that even if a standard agreement exists, companies are aware that adjustments might be necessary for different situations. This option also prompts the reader to determine the scope of the agreement. Option 2 is incorrect because it implies that the changes to the agreement should only suit the company's needs while ignoring the needs of the other party, which is not the point of the paragraph. Option 3 is incorrect because the paragraph does not suggest that a standard contract eliminates the need to draft an agreement. Instead, it highlights that adjustments can be made to the standard agreement. Option 4 is incorrect because it introduces unrelated topics, such as conflicts of interest and disputes between government entities, which are not connected with the paragraph's focus on drafting and adapting broadcast contracts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Mary is twenty-three years old. She is a nurse at a big hospital. She is very kind, and all of her patients like her very much. One day she was out shopping when she saw an old woman waiting to cross a busy street. Mary wanted to cross the street, too, so she went over to help the woman cross. When Mary was near her, she shouted happily, \\"Mrs Herman! You were my patient last year.\\" \\"Oh, thank you very much, Mary,\\" Mrs Herman said, and stepped forward. \\"No, no, Mrs Herman,\\" Mary said quickly, \\"the light's still red.\\"\\"Oh,\\" Mrs Herman answered as she stepped back. \\"I can easily cross the street alone when the light's green.\\" Question: Why do Mary's patients like her a lot?_. Options: A: Because she is very had B: Because she is serious C: Because she is very kind D: Because she is their aunt The answer is:","completion":"C: Because she is very kind The article states that Mary is a nurse at a big hospital and that she is very kind. This is demonstrated by her willingness to assist an old woman, Mrs. Herman, in safely crossing a busy street. In addition, Mrs. Herman recognizes Mary as the nurse who took care of her in the previous year, and she thanks Mary for her help. This shows that Mary's patients appreciate and remember her kindness. Therefore, it can be inferred that Mary's patients like her a lot due to her kind nature, making option C the correct answer. Option A suggests that Mary's patients like her because she is \\"very hard.\\" However, there is no mention of her work ethic or determination in the article; the focus is on her kind demeanor. Option B claims that her patients favor her because she is \\"serious.\\" While being serious can be a valuable trait in a nurse, the article does not mention this aspect of Mary's personality. Instead, it emphasizes her kindness and her positive impact on her patients. Option D suggests that Mary's patients like her because she is their \\"aunt.\\" This option is incorrect because there is no familial connection mentioned in the article. Furthermore, it is unlikely that all of her patients are related to her. In conclusion, the reason why Mary's patients like her a lot is because she is very kind, making option C the correct answer. Her kindness is emphasized throughout the article, as seen in her interactions with the old woman and her patients' appreciation of her caring nature."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Paragraph- Sent 1: With a budget of 329 million, LSC provides civil legal assistance to low-income people in every county in America, Kleiman said. Sent 2: NLAP was created in 1968. Sent 3: A decade later, the agency used a 50,000 LSC grant to buy a building at 438 King St. in Charleston and 33,000 to buy a building at 201 King St. in Georgetown, according to Erlenborn's letter to Kaynard. Sent 4: In 1980, NLAP used 63,000 in LSC funds to buy property at 607 Main St. in Conway, the letter said. Sent 5: On Nov. 14, 2001, NLAP transferred title of the King Street building in Charleston to the Charleston County Bar Association, according to county property records. Sent 6: The local bar paid 5 for the building, which sits between a redeveloped office building and an antique shop. Sent 7: The local bar said it would maintain the building for \\"legal services to indigent residents of Charleston County and coastal South Carolina,\\" the records said. Sent 8: The King Street building appears to be vacant. Sent 9: Notices at the entrance direct visitors to the equal justice center on West Montague Avenue in North Charleston. Sent 10: E. Douglas Pratt-Thomas, president of the local bar, was not available for comment. Sent 11: Charleston County has not appraised the King Street property because it is tax-exempt.

Answer the following question: What are the first names of the three individuals who, in the original line-up, contributed to the band's lyrics? Answer the above question based on the context below: Slayer is an American thrash metal band from Huntington Park, California. The band was formed in 1981 by vocalist and bassist Tom Araya and guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman. Slayer's fast and aggressive musical style made them one of the founding \\"big four\\" bands of thrash metal, alongside Metallica, Megadeth and Anthrax. Slayer's current lineup comprises King, Araya, drummer Paul Bostaph and guitarist Gary Holt. Hanneman and drummers Dave Lombardo and Jon Dette are former members of the band. In the original line-up, King, Hanneman and Araya contributed to the band's lyrics, and all of the band's music was written by King and Hanneman. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as murder, serial killers, necrophilia, torture, genocide, human experimentation, Satanism, hate crimes, terrorism, religion, antireligion, Nazism and war, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and criticism from religious groups and factions of the general public. However, its music has been highly influential, often being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually and lyrically; the band's third album, Reign in Blood (1986), was described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums. Slayer has released twelve studio albums, two live albums, a box set, six music videos, two extended plays and a cover album. Four of the band's studio albums have received gold certification in the United States. The band has received five Grammy Award nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song \\"Eyes of the Insane\\" and one in 2008 for the song \\"Final Six\\", both of which were from the album Christ Illusion (2006). Between 1991 and 2013, the band sold five million albums in the United States.

But unable to avoid controversy for long, Brand said his friend 'didn't give a monkey's' about the furore caused after they made a series of offensive hoax phone calls to Fawlty Towers star Andrew Sachs.

Please answer the following question: The police arrested two homeless people. James was 35 and had been HIV positive for 20 years, and Bill, who was 54 and was not HIV positive. They booked them and let them go. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person had an incurable disease? Hint: HIV , or human immunodeficiency virus, causes AIDS. AIDS stands for \\"acquired immune deficiency syndrome.\\" It is a condition that causes death and does not have a known cure. AIDS usually develops 10 to 15 years after a person is first infected with HIV. The development of AIDS can be delayed with proper medicines. The delay can be well over 20 years with the right medicines. Today, individuals who acquire HIV after 50 years of age can expect to reach an average human life span. Answer:","completion":"James had an incurable disease. He was 35 years old and had been HIV positive for 20 years. Since HIV causes AIDS, which is an incurable disease, James is the person with the incurable disease in this scenario.

We're going to start by getting rid of that pesky negative sign in front of 45687 by making both sides of the equation positive. This leaves us with 45687 = 278*d + 48467. Next, let's subtract 48467 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with d in it. This will leave us with: 45687 - 48467 = 278*d This gives us -2780 = 278d. Now we want to solve for d, so we will divide both sides by 278. -2780 ÷ 278 will give us our answer. The solution to the problem is -10, so that means d is equal to -10."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Title: Good start - Hollywood ending Product review: Dropping a payload on the sun to save the Earth is a difficult enough task. However, the film-makers thought it necessary to add the typical plot line of evil undead captain sabotage. Hence, the movie went from interesting to mindless mediocracy. The only saving grace was the deep space visual cinematography. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?","completion":"This review can be said to depict the product, which is the movie in question, in a predominantly unflattering light, as it focuses more on the negative aspects of the film and criticizes its story and execution. However, it does provide some positive feedback as well, which implies a sense of balance in the reviewer's assessment. First, let's examine the negative aspects of the review. The reviewer primarily complains about the plot of the movie, stating that it starts with an intriguing premise but loses its originality and appeal due to the incorporation of a clichéd and weak subplot involving an evil undead captain. The reviewer believes that the addition of this subplot reduces the overall quality of the movie and transforms it into a mediocre product. This opinion is likely to diminish the perceived value of the film in the eyes of potential viewers. Moreover, the reviewer seems to imply that the film-makers prioritized style over substance, which further highlights their disappointment in the creative direction taken by the movie-makers. This could possibly discourage potential viewers from watching the film. However, despite the unflattering aspects of the review, there is a positive remark that somewhat redeems the overall evaluation. The reviewer appreciates the deep space visual cinematography employed in the movie, which they consider a \\"saving grace.\\" This acknowledgement indicates that the film has at least one praiseworthy aspect to its credit, and that it might still be worth considering for viewers who place a high value on visual appeal. In conclusion, the review portrays the movie in a largely unflattering light due to the criticisms of its plot and storyline. These negative comments might deter potential viewers from wanting to watch the film, and in turn, affect its success. Nonetheless, the single compliment about the movie's cinematography does provide a glimmer of hope, suggesting that the film might still be enjoyable for some viewers who appreciate exceptional visuals."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By the early 18th century, the Maratha Kingdom had transformed itself into the Maratha Empire under the rule of the Peshwas (prime ministers). In 1737, the Marathas defeated a Mughal army in their capital, Delhi itself in Battle of Delhi (1737). The Marathas continued their military campaigns against Mughals, Nizam, Nawab of Bengal and Durrani Empire to further extend their boundaries. Gordon explained how the Maratha systematically took control over new regions. They would start with annual raids, followed by collecting ransom from villages and towns while the declining Mughal Empire retained nominal control and finally taking over the region. He explained it with the example of Malwa region. Marathas built an efficient system of public administration known for its attention to detail. It succeeded in raising revenue in districts that recovered from years of raids, up to levels previously enjoyed by the Mughals. For example, the cornerstone of the Maratha rule in Malwa rested on the 60 or so local tax collectors who advanced the Maratha ruler Peshwa a portion of their district revenues at interest. By 1760, the domain of the Marathas stretched across practically the entire subcontinent. The north-western expansion of the Marathas was stopped after the Third Battle of Panipat (1761). However, the Maratha authority in the north was re-established within a decade under Peshwa Madhavrao I. The defeat of Marathas by British in third Anglo-Maratha Wars brought end to the empire by 1820. The last peshwa, Baji Rao II, was defeated by the British in the Third Anglo-Maratha War. With the defeat of the Marathas, no native power represented any significant threat for the British afterwards.

One spring it stopped raining in early March and didn't start again. There was one very well-off bunny in the village who had a large burrow and lots of food saved up. He wasn't worried about the drought at all. The other bunnies, though, looked at the purple-red nettles withering in the fields and the mayweed that hadn't even flowered and wondered if they were going to have enough food to get them through the next winter. The very well-off bunny was named Albertus, but everybody called him Big Al--at least they called him that when they were sure he couldn't hear them. Big Al was in fact a very large bunny with long, white, silky fur. He had lots of land that his parents had left to him, and he never let any of the other bunnies gather food there. The story was that Big Al had sat on the one bunny who tried to make off with some of his carrots until the small bunny begged for mercy. After Big Al let him up, the small bunny moved to another village. One morning a dozen or more bunnies sat around the village square, licking the dew off the dried and wrinkled clover to quench their thirsts, and talking about the drought. There was still a bit of a cool breeze from Possum Creek, a mile or so away. Sophie Bunny, who was large and sleek, with a black circle around one eye, was there with her husband Lenny and their youngest, Ralph, who still lived at home with them. \\"I don't mind telling you,\\" Lenny said, \\"I'm getting a little scared by all this.\\" Lenny was a small, tan bunny with buck teeth and big cheeks like a chipmunk. \\"No need to be afraid,\\" said the short, overweight Reverend Billy Bunny, the village's spiritual leader. \\"The Easter Bunny will provide.\\" He sat, as he usually did, by the thick green hawthorn bush in the middle of the square--although the bush was neither as thick nor as green as it had once been.

Her college friends Sudha Mathur (Sabeeha) and Sunil (Javed Jaffrey) try to help her sort through her visions but to little avail. Devi is relieved after she talks to her sister and finds that she is alive. However, just some time later, Rama is murdered in the same way as Devi had pictured. The murderer hides Rama's body in a mansion's wall. Rama is reported missing. Devi firmly believes Rama is dead. Five years later, Devi moves to her uncle (Ajit Vachani)'s home where she eventually meets and is courted by millionaire businessman Ram Kumar (Jackie Shroff). Sunil, who was secretly in love with Devi, is deeply disappointed. Devi and Ram marry and enter his family mansion, which he has re-earned after a legal battle. Little known to anybody, this is the same mansion where Rama was buried. When Devi starts having the visions again, Rama's skeleton is not the only thing that will come tumbling out. Devi sees a wall in the mansion being torn down. Devi tears down the wall, only to find a skeleton tumbling out of it. Devi knows whose skeleton it is: it's Rama's, since she had a necklace similar to Devi's. Also, the dead woman's skeleton is roughly same height as that of Rama. The Inspector (Shivaji Satam) quickly points out that since the mansion was closed when Rama disappeared, anyone could have hidden a dead body in there and nobody would know the truth. However, he doubts that the dead woman is Rama: Several such necklaces are available. Devi now gets another vision of another woman getting murdered.

What is the solution?","completion":"To solve for 's', we need to combine the terms with 's' into one, and then isolate 's' on one side of the equation. Here's the step by step solution: 1. Start with the given equation: 11062 * s + 28536 = -3206 * s 2. Move the -3206s term to the left by adding 3206s to both sides: 11062 * s + 3206 * s + 28536 = -3206 * s + 3206 * s 3. Now we can combine the 's' terms on the left: (11062 + 3206) * s + 28536 = 0 4. Perform addition: 14268 * s + 28536 = 0 5. To isolate 's', we need to subtract 28536 from both sides: 14268 * s = -28536 6. Finally, to get the value of 's', divide by 14268: s = -28536 / 14268 7. Perform the division: s ≈ -2 Thus, the solution for the equation 11062 * s + 28536 = -3206 * s is s ≈ -2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I think that this is important because the treatment of acne is such a personalised journey that it is good to hear about the results of the skincare from a variety of people. In the third review of this series, Nalini from The Made Up Maiden has reviewed this acne set for me. Nalini is 30 and has troublesome skin. She has tried many products to fix it without a lot of luck. Here is Nalini's review: I've always thought the journey to clear skin can be quite a complicated one. There are just so many things that affect the condition of your skin; genetics, skincare, diet, hormones, weather, stress...the list is endless. In my case, both parents had acne when they were younger, and I had hopes that my acne would fade once I left my teens. My skin isn't completely horrendous, but I do have some minimal scarring on my cheeks (which goes away after a little while), and the odd large pimple on my chin during those hormonal times, which goes away after a while but is still really frustrating when it happens! I'm 30 years old, so it looks like these problems are here to stay. I have contemplated taking hormonal pills or medication aimed at reducing acne, but decided that the possible side effects haven't really been worth the benefit. As a result, I was really keen to explore the Aphelia Cosmetology range and see if it lives up to the promise of helping with acne troubled skin. I would classify my skin as combination, the t-zone gets a little oily towards midday, while the rest of my skin is pretty much classified as 'normal'. I received the following items. What does the author want to happen to her skin?

What bandwagon are people jumping on? Is it a trend, movement, or idea that's popular among a specific group of people or the general public? Step 2: Assess your own values and interests Analyze your own values, interests, and preferences. Do they align with the bandwagon in question? If your values directly oppose or significantly differ from the bandwagon, it's less likely that you would join in. Step 3: Evaluate potential benefits and risks Consider the potential benefits and risks of joining the bandwagon. Are there social, financial, or personal gains you could achieve by participating? Conversely, are there any negative consequences or drawbacks that would result from your participation? Step 4: Determine your susceptibility to social influence Reflect on your past behavior and assess your tendency to be influenced by others. Are you generally swayed by popular opinions and trends, or do you prefer to form your own opinions and make decisions independently? Step 5: Assess the strength of social connections Consider the strength of your social ties with the people jumping on the bandwagon. If you have strong connections to these individuals, you might feel more inclined to join. However, if your social connections are weaker or nonexistent, you may be less influenced by their actions. Step 6: Make a decision Taking all of these factors into account, evaluate the likelihood of you joining the bandwagon. If the factors suggesting involvement outweigh the factors against, you might conclude that you will probably join in too. Conversely, if the opposing factors are stronger, you may conclude that you won't join in.

This will eliminate the -11*x term on the right side of the equation. -23*x + 11*x = -11*x + 11*x + 48 Step 2: Simplify both sides of the equation. Combining the two 'x' terms on the left side of the equation gives: -12*x = 48 Step 3: Isolate x by dividing by the coefficient of x. To isolate x, divide both sides of the equation by -12: -12*x / (-12) = 48 / (-12) Step 4: Simplify. x = -4 So the solution to the equation -23*x = -11*x + 48 is x = -4."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Tommy and his friend Hawes The answer to this question is:","completion":"Title: The Unearthing Genre: Horror, Thriller Plot: Act 1: Haunted Traumas - The movie opens with Tommy (a 28-year-old man with a tormented past) waking up from a terrifying nightmare where he is being chased by the infamous killer, Jason Voorhees. Tommy's psychologist, Dr. Laura, suggests it's because of his unresolved guilt and fear from surviving Jason's killing spree years ago. Can he finally let go of his past? - Tommy continues to experience vivid visions of the undead Jason, and he's convinced that the only way to end this cycle is to ensure that Jason's body is completely destroyed. Tommy does some research about the cemetery where Jason has been buried and discovers that his remains were never cremated. - Taking matters into his own hands, Tommy enlists the help of his childhood friend, Hawes, who works as a cemetery caretaker, to help him exhume the body. Hawes, though reluctant, agrees to join Tommy in his quest to finally put an end to Jason's reign of terror. Act 2: The Exhumation - Tommy and Hawes start making preparations to dig up the grave. As they investigate the cemetery, they uncover clues about a dark history and a secret cult that worships Jason as an immortal entity. Is there more to this nightmare than they ever imagined? - They find the grave where Jason's body is supposed to be buried but discover that the body is missing. A sudden and ominous storm starts brewing as they search for clues, and they soon learn that the cult has moved the body to a hidden location to revive Jason. - Tommy and Hawes are determined to stop the cult's intentions at any cost. As they follow the tracks leading to the cult's hideout, they come across terrified locals, some who have lost family members to the wrath of Jason. Along the way, Tommy and Hawes gain unlikely allies, including a medium who claims to communicate with Jason's long-dead mother, Pamela Voorhees. Act 3: The Final Confrontation - As the group reaches the cult's hideout, they find that the members are in the process of conducting a horrifying ritual to resurrect Jason. The cult leader, Father Kane, is adamant that Jason's return will cleanse the world of sinners and non-believers. - A final battle commences as Tommy, Hawes, and their group of allies fight the cult members and ultimately confront the reanimated Jason Voorhees. The fight is brutal and intense, with several allies losing their lives in the process. - During the battle, Tommy realizes that the spirit of Pamela Voorhees is the key to defeating Jason. She tells them that cremating the remains of her son will sever his connection to the mortal world and end his terror. - As the climax draws near, Tommy and Hawes manage to find the body of Jason and set it on fire, finally cremating his mortal remains. The undead Jason, sensing the demise of his corporeal form, charges towards them in a last-ditch effort to take Tommy down with him. - In a thrilling ending, Tommy risks his own life to rid the world of Jason's menace once and for all. As the fire engulfs Jason's body, the supernatural tether binding him to the world is severed, and Jason vanishes before the horrified eyes of Tommy and the remaining survivors. Epilogue: As the movie fades to black, the remaining survivors pay their respects to the fallen and begin a weary journey back to their homes, forever scarred by their harrowing ordeal. Tommy knows that he must continue to confront his own demons that plague him, but for now, he can lay to rest the phantom of Jason Voorhees."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Harry was sorting alkenes. The smallest of the bunch have lower or higher boiling points? The answer is:","completion":"The smallest alkenes have higher boiling points compared to larger alkenes due to several factors that influence the physical properties of these organic compounds. To understand this better, let's first examine the structure and properties of alkenes. Alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons that contain a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in their molecular structure. They have the general formula CnH2n, where n is the number of carbon atoms. The physical properties of alkenes, such as boiling and melting points, are significantly influenced by the size and shape of the molecules, as well as the intermolecular forces present between them. In the case of smaller alkenes, the molecules are relatively more compact and have fewer carbon atoms, which results in stronger intermolecular forces between them. These stronger forces translate to higher boiling and melting points because it takes more energy to overcome these attractions and separate the molecules into a gaseous state. Consequently, smaller alkenes, such as ethene (C2H4) and propene (C3H6), are gases at room temperature. On the other hand, larger alkenes possess more carbon atoms and have more extended molecular structures. Consequently, they exhibit weaker intermolecular forces due to the increased distance between individual molecules. This results in lower boiling and melting points, making them liquids or waxy solids at room temperature. Examples of larger alkenes include hexene (C6H12) and decene (C10H20), which are liquids at room temperature. To summarize, while sorting alkenes, Harry would find that the smallest of the bunch have higher boiling points compared to the larger alkenes. This is primarily due to stronger intermolecular forces between the compact molecules of smaller alkenes, which require more energy to be overcome during the phase transition from liquid to gas or solid to liquid. In contrast, larger alkenes with more carbon atoms and extended molecular structures exhibit weaker intermolecular forces, leading to their lower boiling and melting points as well as their liquid or waxy solid state at room temperature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Called the PURE (Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology) study, this was a very large observational study looking at the link between fat and carbohydrate consumption and longevity in 18 countries across 5 continents. Running for 7 years and involving over 135,000 people, this was a very big study so its conclusions are right to take notice of. The key finding from the work that attracted the most media attention was that a high carbohydrate diet was linked with a higher risk of earlier mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to a lower risk of earlier mortality. Digging deeper into the study, the research team found that global diets consisted of 61 percent energy coming from carbohydrates and 24 percent energy from fats. And while those in the highest carbohydrate consumption group (a whopping 77 percent of energy) had a higher risk of earlier death, it wasn’t cardiovascular disease they were dying from. What those other causes of death were exactly is unclear. Perhaps getting hit by a car running for a Mars Bar was one of them as a recent commenter on my Facebook page theorised. A paradigm shift? Not quite Does this study turn on its head ‘everything we knew about nutrition?’ Not quite. And here’s why. Before the PURE study, there were many studies showing the opposite link between carbohydrates and longevity. So, when a conflicting study comes along, this grabs the media spotlight for the day. Here is just one example – a major systematic review and meta-analysis from 2013 involving 17 individual studies and over 242,000 people showing a higher risk of earlier mortality as carbohydrate intake decreased. And this is the problem at times with observational research in that two studies can give polar opposite results so the findings of the PURE study should be seen through this filter.

Q: During brain development, excess neurons that are formed die by apoptosis. cln3 was recently identified as the gene defective in juvenile Batten disease, an inherited neurodegenerative disease of childhood. In this disease, neurons die by apoptosis. Overexpression of this gene increases survival of human NT2 neuronal precursor cells. We, therefore, hypothesized that cln3 may be present in developing neurons and may play an important role in regulating the developmental process. NT2 neuronal cells were induced to develop into mature neurons. We evaluated cln3 expression by reverse transcription PCR and immunohistochemistry over a 7-wk period of differentiation. Also, cln3 expression was characterized in neonatal rat brain during the first week of life (P-1, P0, P4, and P8) and at P30. cln3 was differentially expressed during neuronal development into nondividing post-mitotic neurons. The greatest expression was noted during wk 6 and then dropped to predifferentiation levels during wk 7. cln3 expression was detected in all the rat brain developmental stages evaluated. The greatest expression was seen at P0 and was double compared with the other stages. We conclude that cln3 is present during critical periods of neuronal cell differentiation and brain development. As cln3 is antiapoptotic, we hypothesize that cln3 plays an important role in regulating brain development.

Seventeenth-century houses in colonial North American were simple structures that were primarily functional, carrying over traditional designs that went back to the Middle Ages. During the first half of the eighteen century, however, houses began to show a new elegance. As wealth increased, more and more colonist built fine houses. Since architecture was not yet a specialized profession in the colonies, the design of buildings was left either to amateur designers or to carpenters who were engaged in translating architectural handbooks imported from England. Inventories of libraries shows an astonishing number of these handbooks for builders, and the houses built during the eighteenth century show their influence. Nevertheless, most household architecture of the first-quarters of the eighteenth century displays a wide _ of taste and freedom of application of the rules laid down in these books. Increasing wealth and growing sophistication throughout the colonies resulted in houses of improved design, whether the material was wood, stone, or brick. New England still favored wood, though brick houses became common in Boston and other towns, where the danger of fire gave an impetus to the use of more durable material. A few houses in New England were built of stone, but only in Pennsylvania and areas nearby was stone widely used in buildings. An increased use of brick in houses and outbuildings is noticeable in Virginia and Maryland, but wood remained the most popular material even in houses built by wealthy landowners. In the Carolinas, even in closely packed Charleston, wooden houses were much common than brick houses. Eighteenth-century houses showed great interior improvements over the former ones. Windows were made larger and shutters removed. Large, clear panes replaced the small leaded glass of the seventeenth century. Doorways were larger and more decorative.

This can be inferred from the statement \\"most household architecture of the first-quarters of the eighteenth century displays a wide _ of taste and freedom of application of the rules laid down in these books.\\" As the colonies grew wealthier and more sophisticated, houses began to reflect improved designs and more refined tastes. Even though architectural handbooks imported from England were widely available in the colonies, the designers and carpenters constructing these houses showed a considerable variation in the application of the rules outlined in those books. Eighteenth-century North American houses displayed many improvements over their predecessors, such as larger windows with clear panes, more decorative doorways, and more ornate fireplaces. Building materials varied based on region; New England primarily used wood, with some brick in urban areas, while stone was more common in Pennsylvania and nearby areas. Virginia and Maryland saw an increase in brick usage, but wood remained the most popular material across the colonies. The overall picture presented is one of transformation and a flourishing of architectural variety in the colonies, as builders and designers work with different materials and adapt imported ideas to suit their local context and the needs of those living in the new structures. This evolution suggests that rather than strictly adhering to the rules described in architectural handbooks, the builders and designers developed their own unique styles and approaches that combined European influences with local resources and preferences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He was on the point of launching this project, having invested 1,000 of his own money (equal to 25,097 today) in preparation, when he learned that James Herring of New York City was planning a similar series. In October 1831, he wrote to Herring, and the two men agreed to work together on The American Portrait Gallery (later called the National Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Americans), published in four volumes between 1834 and 1839. Herring was an artist, but much of the work of illustrating fell to Longacre, who traveled widely in the United States to sketch subjects from life. He again sketched Jackson, who was by now president, as well as former president James Madison, both in July 1833. He met many of the political leaders of the day, who were impressed by his portraits. Among these advocates was the former vice president, South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun. In July 1832, Niles' Register described a Longacre engraving, \\"one of the finest specimens of American advancement in the art\\".Longacre had married Eliza Stiles in 1827; between 1828, when their daughter Sarah was born, and 1840, they had three boys and two girls. Sales of the Gallery lagged due to the Panic of 1837; Longacre was forced to declare bankruptcy and travel through the southern and midwestern states, peddling his books from town to town, with his wife and elder daughter managing shipping and finances at home. Later in 1837, he was able to return to Philadelphia and open a banknote engraving firm with partners, Toppan, Draper, Longacre & Co. With great demand for engraving for notes being issued by state banks, the firm prospered, and had offices at 60 Walnut Street in Philadelphia and a branch at 1 Wall Street in New York. According to Snow, Longacre was known as the best engraver in the country. Guess a valid title for it!

We have this math problem: -532960 = -32*l - 531456 Here's what we'll do step-by-step: 1. Move the -531456 from the right side of the equation to the left side by adding 531456 to both sides. So, we get: -532960 + 531456 = -32*l 2. Now, let's find the result of the addition on the left side: -1,504 = -32*l 3. We need to find the value of l. To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -32. So, we have: -1,504 / -32 = l 4. When we divide -1,504 by -32, we get: 47 = l So, the hidden treasure we found is l = 47.

If they had to describe their perfect day in London, what exactly would it involve? This was a question Mashable put to various celebrities — from Kate Winslet to Colin Farrell — on the red carpet at the 2015 London Film Festival. While there were quite a mixture of different responses, two of the recurring themes were parks and cycling. \\"My perfect day in London is a day like today, where it's brisk but it's bright,\\" actor Michael Smiley told Mashable, \\"I get on the bicycle and I wear my long cotton socks and my riding boots, and I go off for a cycle along the South Bank.\\" Composer Daniel Pemberton, who wrote the music for Steve Jobs, also enjoyed cycling along the South Bank — albeit in a slightly different capacity. \\"Cycling in London is the best thing you can do, it's fantastic,\\" he said. \\"Cycling when you're drunk, late at night, back along the South Bank — that's my favourite thing.\\" Jeff Daniels, however, had a more simple idea. \\"A perfect day in London is to walk outside the hotel and there's no paparazzi,\\" he said. Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments. What was this article about?","completion":"This article delves into the fantasy of well-known celebrities including actors and composers such as Kate Winslet, Colin Farrell, Michael Smiley, Daniel Pemberton, and Jeff Daniels, envisioning their perfect day out in the bustling city of London. This question was presented to multiple celebrities during various interviews on the red carpet at the 2015 London Film Festival. Actor Michael Smiley described his flawless day in London as one with a brisk yet bright weather, perfect for a bike ride. He visualises starting his day wearing long cotton socks and riding boots and heading off for a peaceful cycle along the South Bank. The appreciation for cycling in London similarly echoed in the composer Daniel Pemberton's response as well. He glorified the idea of cycling late in the night while being somewhat tipsy, claiming it to give him a sense of euphoria when he rides back along the South Bank in such a state. Meanwhile, actor Jeff Daniels has a simpler image of his perfect day in London. For him, a perfect day would mean walking outside his hotel and not being met with paparazzi. This indicates his preference for a more private, calm day in the city away from the hustle and prying eyes of the media. The narrative portrays that the perfect day in London for most celebrities revolves around enjoying a scenic bike ride and maintaining an appreciation for the peaceful, tranquil moments amid their usually hectic lives. Parks and cycling seemed to be recurring themes in their responses, indicating a clear inclination towards activities surrounded by nature and exercise. However, the variance in their responses also shows how each celebrity values different aspects of their day out in London, be it peaceful solitude, a nighttime adventure, or a brisk day outdoors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The revolution they had long sought was launched on 22 July and was declared a success the next day. The Free Officers seized control of all government buildings, radio stations, and police stations, as well as army headquarters in Cairo. While many of the rebel officers were leading their units, Nasser donned civilian clothing to avoid detection by royalists and moved around Cairo monitoring the situation. In a move to stave off foreign intervention two days before the revolution, Nasser had notified the American and British governments of his intentions, and both had agreed not to aid Farouk.

Consider this option carefully, however; trying to find a roommate will split the cost of rent and utilities in half, but it can add a lot of stress as well. Consider a few key issues before searching for a roommate: Would you be comfortable sharing a room or an apartment? Are you expecting your roommate to be your best friend? Do you feel comfortable having someone around your personal belongings? How clean are you? Are you loud? How clean and loud would you want your roommate to be? Sharing a room with a brother, sister, or cousin is great training for life with a roommate. If you are close with one of your siblings, you may want to move out together. Make sure you trust one another to pay the bills on time. There are many ways to find roommates, whether it is through mutual friends or social media sites, but once you found someone who wants to live in the same area as you and is financially stable, talk to them in person. Some questions you should ask are: How clean are you? When do you go to bed, and how often do you have company? Do you have any pets, and will a significant other be living with you? Can you pay all bills on time? See if these questions influence your decision to live with the potential roommate. Your lifestyles should be mostly similar. Conflict is bound to happen when living with others. What matters is how you deal with it. Pretending to not be bothered by your roommate’s behavior will lead to frustration, but constant bickering is stressful. If you need to confront your roommate, choose your words carefully so your roommate does not feel attacked. “I feel frustrated when you don’t wash the dishes because the room smells” is better than “You’re a slob.” Focus on the behavior, not the person. Confront problems as they arise, not when you are frustrated and overwhelmed. If your roommate confronts you, remember that they are trying to improve your relationship. Listen and reflect on what your roommate tells you. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"The article discusses the increasing trend of people living with roommates to afford rent and provides guidance on choosing a suitable roommate and handling conflicts.

The war left significant legacies in all three countries. In the context of Japanese imperialism, the invasions are seen as the first Japanese attempt to become a global power. The partial occupation of Korea developed the Japanese concept that Korea belonged within Japan's sphere of influence, and the Japanese leaders of the late 19th and the early 20th centuries used the 1592-1597 invasions to reinforce the justification for their 20th century annexation of Korea. In China, the war was used politically to inspire nationalistic resistance against Japanese imperialism during the 20th century. In Chinese academia, historians list the war as one of the Wanli Emperor's \\"Three Great Punitive Campaigns\\". Contemporary Chinese historians often use the campaigns as an example of the friendship the two nations shared. In Korea, the war is a historic foundation of Korean nationalism and, as in China, inspired and was used politically to instigate nationalistic resistance against Japanese imperialism during the 20th century. Korea gained several national heroes during the conflict, such as Admiral Yi Sun-sin. Even today, anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea can be traced as far back as the Japanese invasions in 1592, although the principal cause is rooted in more recent events, particularly the hardships suffered by Koreans during the Japanese occupation of Korea from 1910 through 1945.

A solid retelling of an undeniably inspirational story but it's unforgivably bland in places. 3.

Apple's iPhone is already a 'games console' for many of its users - the average iPhone owner plays games for 14.7 hours a month, according to a Nielsen study. But a new app will ensure they have more to play than Angry Birds. The key? The 3D, hi-def games - including hits such as Assassin's Creed: Revelations - aren't actually playing ON your phone or tablet's slow processor - they're playing elsewhere, and the video streams to iPad, iPhone or Android devices courtesy of the new Onlive app. The new Onlive app allows users to play games that iPad's processor simply wouldn't be capable of such as Lego: Batman - streaming the video from high-powered servers, and adding touch controls to the 'console quality' games. The app adds an 'overlay' of touch controls to console games, making them easier to use on iPad. The app itself is free - but a subscription of £6.99 buys you access to a library of 150 games. Renting a game for three days costs £3.99. 'Buying' a game outright costs similar prices to what it would cost in the shops - for instance Assassin's Creed: Revelation is £39.99. The app comes with two free games - the crime thriller L.A. Noire, and Lego Batman. So far, 25 games have been adapted for touchscreen controls. Current PC and console hits such as Assassin's Creed Revelations are available either for a one-off payment or via a subcription of £6.99 a month. Even when 'renting' games via the app, the app counts up your rentals and once you've 'paid' for the game, you keep it. There are 500 million mobile devices in the U.S. and UK capable of using the app. In the UK, the service only works over wi-fi. In the U.S., 4G mobiles will also be able to use the service. L.A. Noire from Rockstar Games and family titles like LEGO: Batman will be given free to anyone who downloads the OnLive app. There is also an upcoming wireless controller (£39.99/49.99) which works with many tablets and phones - overcoming one of gaming's major hurdles on the platforms, the fact that touchscreen controls rarely work on action games. Only 25 games have been optimised for touchscreen control so far - but you can buy a £39.99 controller which works with most phones and tablets. 'Today marks a major milestone: OnLive is now delivering the latest, console-class, top-tier games—literally to your fingertips—on mobile tablets and phones for instant on-demand play anywhere, anytime,' said Steve Perlman, OnLive Founder and CEO. 'Through the free OnLive app, tablet and smartphone gamers can play top console and PC titles like Assassins Creed: Revelations and L.A. Noire—one of the most highly acclaimed, graphically sophisticated games to date—with exclusive OnLive Cloud Touch controls or with the new mobile-compatible OnLive Wireless Controller. 'Tablets and smartphones, the fastest-growing consumer product categories in history, are now capable of running the hottest, highest-end games. Gaming and mobile devices will never be the same.' There are 500 million devices in the U.S. and the UK capable of running the free app. Most of the nearly 200 games in OnLive's growing library, including recent top-tier releases like Batman: Arkham City, Assassin’s Creed: Revelations and Lord of the Rings: War in the North, are immediately playable on virtually any device with the OnLive Wireless Controller, which automatically find wireless connection for any tablet, smartphone, PC, Mac, TV or Blu-ray player. 'As always, any game purchased on one OnLive app device (TV, PC, Mac or mobile device) can be played instantly on any other OnLive app device with full cloud save game data intact, allowing users to start play on one device, and continue playing on any other device, whenever and wherever they want.

I read this background article the other day: Freezing is a common method of food preservation that slows both food decay and the growth of micro-organisms.

He is trying to decide if he should store the cupcakes at 0° F or at 10° F in the freezer. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which temperature will result in slower growth of micro-organisms on the cupcakes?","completion":"Based on the knowledge acquired from the background article, we could safely infer that lower temperature slows down the growth of micro-organisms due to its effect on reaction rates.

Step 3: Apply the information from the background article. According to the article, freezing makes water less available for bacterial growth. This would imply that the lower the temperature, the slower the growth of microorganisms. Step 4: Conclusion.

Therefore, Robert should store the cupcakes at 0°F to slower the growth of micro-organisms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Write a title for this article: PHOENIX – The federal government issued a scathing report Thursday that outlines how Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio's office has committed a wide range of civil rights violations against Latinos, including a pattern of racial profiling and discrimination and carrying out heavy-handed immigration patrols based on racially charged citizen complaints. The report, obtained by The Associated Press ahead of its release, is a result of the U.S. Justice Department's three-year investigation of Arpaio's office amid complaints of racial profiling and a culture of bias at the agency's top level. The Justice Department's conclusions in the civil probe mark the federal government's harshest rebuke of a national political fixture who has risen to prominence for his immigration crackdowns and became coveted endorsement among candidates in the GOP presidential field. Apart from the civil rights probe, a federal grand jury also has been investigating Arpaio's office on criminal abuse-of-power allegations since at least December 2009 and is specifically examining the investigative work of the sheriff's anti-public corruption squad. The civil rights report said federal authorities will continue to investigate complaints of deputies using excessive force against Latinos, whether the sheriff's office failed to provide adequately police services in Hispanic communities and a large number of sex-crimes cases that were assigned to the agency but weren't followed up on or investigated at all. The report took the sheriff's office to task for launching immigration patrols, known as \\"sweeps,\\" based on complaints that Latinos were merely gathering near a business without committing crimes. Federal authorities single out Arpaio himself and said his office, known as MCSO, has no clear policies to guard against the violations, even after he changed some of his top aides earlier this year. \\"Arpaio's own actions have helped nurture MCSO's culture of bias,\\" wrote Thomas Perez, who heads the Justice Department's civil rights division, adding that the sheriff frequently gave such racially charged letters to some of his top aides and saved them in his own files. \\"MCSO is broken in a number of critical respects. The problems are deeply rooted in MCSO's culture,\\" he said Thursday. The Justice Department's expert on measuring racial profiling said it's the most egregious case of racial profiling in the nation that he has seen or reviewed in professional literature, Perez said. Investigators interviewed more than 400 people, including Arpaio, reviewed thousands of documents and toured county jails as part of its probe, he said. If the sheriff's office doesn't turn around its policies and practices, the federal government could pull millions of dollars of federal funding. Arpaio's office did not immediately respond to AP requests for comment. The report will require Arpaio to set up effective policies against discrimination, improve training and make other changes that would be monitored for compliance by a judge. Arpaio faces a Jan. 4 deadline for saying whether he wants to work out an agreement. If not, the federal government will sue him and let a judge decide the complaint. Arpaio, the self-proclaimed toughest sheriff in America, has long denied the racial profiling allegation, saying people are stopped if deputies have probable cause to believe they have committed crimes and that deputies later find many of them are illegal immigrants. Arpaio has built his reputation on jailing inmates in tents and dressing them in pink underwear, selling himself to voters as unceasingly tough on crime and pushing the bounds of how far local police can go to confront illegal immigration. The report also said he and some top staffers tried to silence people who have spoken out against the sheriff's office by arresting people without cause, filing meritless lawsuits against opponents and starting investigations of critics. One example cited by the Justice Department is former top Arpaio aide David Hendershott, who filed bar complaints against attorneys critical of the agency along with bringing judicial complaints against judges who were at odds with the sheriff. All complaints were dismissed. The anti-corruption squad's cases against two county officials and a judge collapsed in court before going to trial and have been criticized by politicians at odds with the sheriff as trumped up. Arpaio has defended the investigations as a valid attempt at rooting out corruption in county government. The civil rights report said Latinos are four to nine times more likely to be stopped in traffic stops in Maricopa County than non-Latinos and that the agency's immigration policies treat Latinos as if they are all in the country illegally. Deputies on the immigrant-smuggling squad stop and arrest Latino drivers without good cause, the investigation found. A review done as part of the investigation found that 20 percent of traffic reports handled by Arpaio's immigrant-smuggling squad from March 2006 to March 2009 were stops -- almost all involving Latino drivers -- that were done without reasonable suspicion. The squad's stops rarely led to smuggling arrests. Deputies are encouraged to make high-volume traffic stops in targeted locations. There were Latinos who were in the U.S. legally who were arrested or detained without cause during the sweeps, according to the report. During the sweeps, deputies flood an area of a city -- in some cases, heavily Latino areas -- over several days to seek out traffic violators and arrest other offenders. Illegal immigrants accounted for 57 percent of the 1,500 people arrested in the 20 sweeps conducted by his office since January 2008, according to figures provided by Arpaio's office. Police supervisors, including at least one smuggling-squad supervisor, often used county accounts to send emails that demeaned Latinos to fellow sheriff's managers, deputies and volunteers in the sheriff's posse. One such email had a photo of a mock driver's license for a fictional state called \\"Mexifornia.\\" The report said that the sheriff's office launched an immigration operation two weeks after the sheriff received a letter in August 2009 letter about a person's dismay over employees of a McDonald's in the Phoenix suburb of Sun City who didn't speak English. The tip laid out no criminal allegations. The sheriff wrote back to thank the writer \\"for the info,\\" said he would look into it and forwarded it to a top aide with a note of \\"for our operation.\\" Federal investigators focused heavily on the language barriers in Arpaio's jails. Latino inmates with limited English skills were punished for failing to understand commands in English by being put in solitary confinement for up to 23 hours a day or keeping prisoners locked down in their jail pods for as long as 72 hours without a trip to the canteen area or making nonlegal phone calls. The report said some jail officers used racial slurs for Latinos when talking among themselves and speaking to inmates. Detention officers refused to accept forms requesting basic daily services and reporting mistreatment when the documents were completed in Spanish and pressured Latinos with limited English skills to sign forms that implicate their legal rights without language assistance. The agency pressures Latinos with limited English skills to sign forms by yelling at them and keeping them in uncomfortably cold cells for long periods of time. The Justice Department said it hadn't yet established a pattern of alleged wrongdoing by the sheriff's office in the three areas where they will continue to investigation: complaints of excessive force against Latinos, botched sex-crimes cases and immigration efforts that have hurt the agency's trust with the Hispanic community. Federal authorities will continue to investigate whether the sheriff's office has limited the willingness of witnesses and victims to report crimes or talk to Arpaio's office. \\"MCSO has done almost nothing to build such a relationship with Mariciopa County's Latino residents,\\" Perez wrote.

Context: Last week we talked about healthy eating on a budget. Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget. It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example: you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall. Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. Question: What field does the author most probably work in?

Meanwhile, 5,000 hamsters are overrunning Wellman College and causing general chaos. It turns out that these are the school's laboratory hamsters that 400-pound Sherman accidentally released the night before. The problem having been contained, Sherman is given an update by his assistant, Jason (John Ales), about their latest project an experimental formula that reconstructs the DNA of an obese person to make weight-loss easy. It seems that their fattest hamster, Shelley, has lost 3 ounces, proving that the serum works. Jason suggests increasing the amount Shelley is fed, but the ever-kindly Sherman argues against it, saying it could be dangerous.He then has an unpleasant meeting with Dean Richmond (Larry Miller). The Dean tells him that the incident with the hamsters has cost the science department most of its funding. Harlan Hartley (James Coburn) is the school's last remaining wealthy alumnus and is planning to award a 10 million grant to the college; Klump is warned not to alienate him as well.After class, Sherman meets and instantly falls in love with the lovely Miss Carla Purty (Jada Pinkett), a chemistry graduate student teaching a class across the hall, who is a big fan of his work.

What is the answer: In 1978, after escaping from Iran, where was the Ayatollah Khomeini granted political asylum?","completion":"In 1978, after escaping from Iran, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was granted political asylum in France. As a prominent Shiite cleric and a leading figure in the opposition to the Shah of Iran, Khomeini had previously been exiled to Turkey and Iraq, where he spent several years before relocating to France. When Khomeini arrived in France, he settled in the small village of Neauphle-le-Château, near Paris. The French government granted Khomeini political asylum based on its long-standing tradition of providing refuge to political dissidents and those fleeing persecution from their home countries. Khomeini's presence in France enabled him to communicate more easily with the Iranian people and coordinate opposition activities against the Shah's regime. During his stay in France, Khomeini gathered around him a group of trusted advisors and supporters who he often met with. His residence became a hub for various members of the Iranian opposition and passionate followers who traveled to see him. He also utilized modern communication technologies to send messages back to Iran, particularly by means of audio tapes which were smuggled into the country and played at local mosques. This ensured that his influence within Iran continued to grow, despite being physically absent from the nation. Khomeini's presence in France, combined with his widespread support within Iran, played a crucial role in the eventual overthrow of the Shah. After the Iranian Revolution in 1979 and the ousting of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Khomeini returned to Iran and became the country's Supreme Leader, establishing an Islamic Republic. In conclusion, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was granted political asylum in France in 1978 after escaping Iran. This enabled him to effectively coordinate opposition to the Shah's regime, ultimately leading to the success of the Iranian Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran, with Khomeini as its Supreme Leader."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Young undocumented immigrants seeking permanent status in the United States received an unexpected boost Thursday on Capitol Hill as a small group of House Republicans mounted a last-minute effort to bring up an immigration vote in Congress. The group of eight Republicans — some freed from political considerations by upcoming retirements and others facing tough re-elections races — defied their own party leadership, quickly persuading 10 more Republicans to sign on to a petition that would force debate on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. With all 193 Democrats expected to sign on, Republicans will have to persuade just seven more members of their own party to join the petition to trigger a vote on several immigration bills on the House floor. But Republican leadership said the effort would be wasted if the end result is a presidential veto. \\"I think it's important for us to come up with a solution that the president can support,\\" House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters Thursday. These types of petitions are rare and seen as a threat to leadership's ability to direct legislative action. \\"It's better to use the legislative process,\\" Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters Wednesday. But that argument appears to be losing sway with House members who see an opportunity for legislative action in a mid-term election year. The growing group of House Republicans are joining Democratic colleagues who have long criticized Ryan for not bringing immigration bills up for a vote. \\"This is about making sure we're not consolidating power in the White House,\\" said Representative Mia Love, a Republican from Utah and one of the first lawmakers to sign petition. The immigration issue had all but died after an effort to pass a DACA fix collapsed in the U.S. Senate earlier this year. The program has been the focus of fierce negotiations on Capitol Hill since last September, when President Donald Trump announced he was ending the 2012 Obama-era program and called for a legislative fix.

Q:Background: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease. Paragraph: Mike is studying the population growth rate of countries around the world. He noticed that countries like Japan and Russia are having a demographic shift. They have a growing population of late adulthood. He recorded the late adulthood population as population A. On the other hand, many developing countries have growing population of younger people.

It was a Tuesday night so I called last minute to see if a table of four was possible and was told that they would be happy to set one aside. We arrived and lucked into the best table in the place in the window, just off the bar, a cozy little nook indeed. The place is very big with high ceilings and when we walked in we were immediately greeted by a gentleman by the name of Francesco. Water was brought to our table and he asked us if we wanted to start with drinks or if we prefer wine. We paused for a second to consider, we had just had cocktails, but decided to try another, so I asked our new found friend for a suggestion and he said, the signora must try a house cocktail made of Prosecco and ?, (I think the something was an Italian Amperol, but he called it by another name, I cannot remember, he mentioned it was harder to find), whatever the brand, it was delish. The next thing we got was the bread and olive oil/balsamic dip and four really good bruschettas, off to a promising start..... We then ordered some apps, Polpo ai ferri, Mozzarella di Bufala, Pappardelle with rose sauce more Mozzarella di Buffala, prosciutto and fresh basil, and an Insalata Cesare with extra anchovies. The octopus was one of the best ever, grilled with what we could have sworn was wood, it's smoky flavor was awesome and it melted on the tongue, it was served with paper thin slicesof onion, capers and garbanzo beans. The tomato and buffala salad was also perfect with fat juicy tomato slices, very fresh cheese a sprinkle of shredded basil and just the right amount of drizzled oil and balsamic. The Cesar salad was well balanced, and with a made from scratch dressing, which again was the perfect amount, and no anchovies were left behind! The parpadelle was a huge hit, they must make their pasta in house. the toothiness of the pasta was so good you could really appreciate it on it's own, but the light sauce and fixing made this a symphony of taste to enjoy. I would reorder this as a main anytime. We then went in for the kill, mains were 2 Costoletta di Vitello, for the gents and the fish of the day (Grilled swordfish) and another dish of the day, Veal scallopini, spinacci, grapes and pine nuts and an extra center dish of Penne Sauce u00e0 la cru00e8me de truffles et saucisses. . They know their food prep, the veal was a ting a beauty I tell ya. Perfectly grilled on the outside but delicately pink and moist at the center, it was a very generous portion which led us to believe it would get wrapped up, but by the end of the evening everyone had happily noshed their way until nothing but bone was left, sorry puppies no leftover for you! I did not really try the fish (because I had too much already), but was told by my 3 other dining mates that it was really just as good as all the rest. My main was the veal with spinach, the sweet white grapes gave the sauce a rich sweetness, that balanced really well with the salty spinach and lovely roasted fingerling potatoes (found in each dish and consumed with great pleasure). The pasta was even better than anyone could have hoped, and we devoured it like people who were deprived of food (considering the volumes of food available this is no mere feat), this too is a must repeat. We ordered some very good red ,which I can't name because we drank two bottles after all those cocktails so something has to give. I remember describing it's bite to corduroy, and somehow this was generally accepted by all at the table and we were surprised that this would be a good thing, but I digress. By the end of the evening we had met the other owner Vincenzo, and were told the third of this trio was on vacation. (in case you can count in Italian, yes their was a fourth but he left after one month, so while the name is still there it is a trio), they were charming to a fault, pros at their vocation, and masters at the art of picking, preparing,creating, and serving up fine food and hospitality. They happily chatted us up about various common places we knew from Italia, we talked shop, we laughed we cried, it was real.

Summarize this article: I have been responding to different disease outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for 18 years, yet I have never seen anything as challenging as containing Ebola in an armed-conflict zone. DRC is facing its 10th Ebola outbreak, but this epidemic, which broke out in August, is the country’s first in an area where fighting is ongoing. Since 2014, about 2,000 people have been killed in clashes between armed groups. I’m a doctor stationed in Beni, in the north-eastern province of North Kivu. It’s the epicentre of the current Ebola outbreak. Here, any aid worker, especially us locals, can be in imminent danger. Active shooting is common. A few weeks ago, a vehicle of humanitarian staff moving an Ebola patient’s dead body to be buried was attacked and passengers were injured. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Dr Erik Mukama has been working with Care in DRC for more than two years. Photograph: Mahmoud Shabeeb/CARE I cannot access entire villages. Not because of the unequipped terrain and unpaved dirt roads but because these villages act as frontlines between the different armed groups. Ebola is a fatal disease. Because it is a viral infection, it does not have an effective cure. People here in Beni have never encountered Ebola and in many cases have never even heard of it. There is strong resistance from people to accept the existence of the disease and cooperate with people like me working to eliminate it. Recent reports have said the epidemic has been controlled. This is not true. We still have new confirmed cases, almost on a daily basis. To confirm an Ebola epidemic is under control we need to wait for at least six weeks after the last confirmed case, which involves inspecting all the direct contacts of every infected person, and ensuring that during that period we have not had a single new case. Wave of rebel attacks leads to surge in DRC Ebola cases Read more Despite communities’ resistance, people are becoming aware of the disease and its danger. But even the most basic ways to counter it are almost impossible to implement in some inaccessible villages. These include installing handwashing stations and refilling them, conducting awareness-raising sessions, or doing some basic distributions of much-needed items such as soap, buckets and hand sanitisers. In some areas we cannot confirm if the symptoms and even deaths occurring are due to Ebola. This is why we have some “probable” cases. One of the biggest challenges is providing direct help to infected people, while ensuring caregivers do not get infected. When you walk around the city and visit response sites and clinics, no one shakes hands. When we want to greet each other, we do it through touching elbows, to avoid any possibility of spreading the virus, which is only transmitted through direct contact of body fluids. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Congolese health workers in Mangina, North Kivu province. Photograph: Olivia Acland/Reuters At every location there is at least one water cooler and everyone is obliged to wash their hands. You can smell the chlorine on your hands for hours afterwards, but this is a mandatory precaution to ensure no aid workers, especially health staff, get infected, as this will risk losing the trust of local communities. The basic health precautions we promote to eliminate Ebola are the same standards that should be applied all the time, with or without an epidemic. Sadly, this outbreak has revealed a gap there, which could be due to lack of awareness, or lack of tools and infrastructure. To be better able to protect communities from epidemics, some basic services need to be enhanced. In Beni, for example, water networks do not reach everywhere, and schools do not have enough bathrooms. In schools, awareness-raising campaigns are carried out, and they are provided with handwashing stations­­ and thermometers. Similarly, we make sure clinics are well-equipped and completely clean from the virus, by providing handwashing facilities, gloves, and the necessary training to volunteers and paramedics. If it is possible to prevent the infection of all the staff and volunteers responding to the epidemic, then it must be possible to eliminate Ebola completely. ||||| Please enable cookies on your web browser in order to continue.

The outbreak, which began in August, is primarily focused in the north-eastern province of North Kivu, where around 2,000 people have been killed in clashes between armed groups since 2014. Aid workers, particularly locals, are in significant danger due to the violence, and certain villages are inaccessible due to their position as frontlines between warring factions. Many people in the region have never encountered Ebola before and some are resistant to accepting the disease's existence or cooperating with those trying to eliminate it. Reports that the epidemic has been controlled are false, with new cases continuing to emerge daily. The crucial six-week period, which must pass with no new confirmed cases for the epidemic to be considered under control, has not yet been achieved. Despite the resistance from some communities, awareness of the disease is spreading. However, even basic preventative measures, such as installing handwashing stations and refilling them or distributing soap and sanitizers, are impossible to carry out in some inaccessible villages. In these areas, it is uncertain whether the symptoms and deaths that occur are due to Ebola, resulting in some \\"probable\\" cases. A significant challenge is providing direct assistance to infected individuals while ensuring caregivers remain uninfected, as spreading the virus among aid workers risks losing the trust of local communities. Progress is being made in some areas, with schools receiving awareness-raising campaigns, handwashing stations, and thermometers, while clinics are being equipped with handwashing facilities, gloves, and necessary training for volunteers and paramedics. Addressing the lack of basic services and infrastructure is vital to protecting communities from epidemics. In some places, water networks are insufficient and schools lack adequate bathroom facilities. If infection can be prevented among all staff and volunteers responding to the epidemic, it should be possible to eliminate Ebola entirely."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Since 8*a and -60*a both have the variable 'a', we can combine them: -312 = (8 - 60)*a -312 = -52*a Now, the equation becomes -312 = -52*a. To solve for 'a', we want to isolate the variable on one side. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by -52: (-312) / (-52) = (-52*a) / (-52) When you divide -312 by -52, you get: 6 = a Thus, the solution for the given equation is a = 6."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here each term is either a constant number, or consists of the variable x raised to a certain power and multiplied by a number. These numbers are called weights. For example, in the polynomial: 2x^2+3x+4, the weights are: 2,3,4. You can present a polynomial with the list of its weights, for example, equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4 and equation weights = [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4. In this task, you need to compute the result of a polynomial expression by substituing a given value of x in the given polynomial equation. Equation weights are given as a list. Problem:x = 6, equation weights = [0, 5, 9, 3, 1] Solution:","completion":"To compute the result of a polynomial expression with the given value of x and the list of equation weights, follow these steps: 1. Identify the value of x and the list of equation weights: - x = 6 - equation weights = [0, 5, 9, 3, 1] 2. Understand the polynomial equation structure based on the equation weights: Since the length of the equation weights list is 5, the polynomial equation has 5 terms. - 0: This represents the constant term, which is 0 in this polynomial equation. - 5: This is the coefficient for the x term (linear term), so the term is 5x. - 9: This is the coefficient for the x^2 term (quadratic term), so the term is 9x^2. - 3: This is the coefficient for the x^3 term (cubic term), so the term is 3x^3. - 1: This is the coefficient for the x^4 term (quartic term), so the term is 1x^4. 3. Construct the polynomial equation based on the equation weights, which looks like this: P(x) = 0 + 5x + 9x^2 + 3x^3 + 1x^4 4. Substitute the given value of x (x = 6) into the polynomial equation: P(6) = 0 + 5(6) + 9(6)^2 + 3(6)^3 + 1(6)^4 5. Calculate the result: - 5(6) = 30 - 9(6)^2 = 9(36) = 324 - 3(6)^3 = 3(216) = 648 - 1(6)^4 = 1(1296) = 1296 6. Add up all the terms to get the final result: P(6) = 0 + 30 + 324 + 648 + 1296 = 2298 The solution for the given polynomial equation with x = 6 and equation weights = [0, 5, 9, 3, 1] is 2298."},{"prompt":"I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Q: I remember back in the late 1970’s when I first started investing in property as a young guy, being taken to a house that felt EXTREMELY cold, strange, and rather chilling. Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase. As they say in the property business ‘Location, Location, Location’ is always an important factor in determining the value of a property. However despite that being a good location, it was reputation that deterred me on that occasion. Sometimes there are situations where even the best makeover will not work. Question: What happened after the potential buyer found out about the murder? === The answer to the above question is A:","completion":"After finding out about the murder that had taken place in the property he was considering to buy, the potential buyer decided not to proceed with the purchase. He was unimpressed with the real estate agent who had not been forthcoming about the property's history.

Answer the above question based on the context below: 11-year-old Annie Parker is living the perfect young life, loved by all, and especially by her mother, father, and older sister. But none of them knows that something horrible is stalking their perfect family. On a fall afternoon in 1976, young Annie hears a noise from upstairs. Her mother has collapsed and died, and an agonizing downward spiral begins. At UC Berkeley a brilliant research geneticist named Mary-Claire King is embarking on something of a personal crusade to uncover the genetic roots of breast cancer. While still in her twenties, she has already made a famous discovery that made the cover of Science—quantifying the genetic variation between humans and chimpanzees. But her conviction that there is a hereditary basis to at least some forms of breast cancer is not widely shared. Nevertheless, her tireless research throughout the 1980s would end in a medical breakthrough—the discovery of the location of the BRCA1 hereditary breast cancer gene—considered one of the most important scientific discoveries of the twentieth century.At the age of 19, after the sudden death of her father, Anne marries Paul and soon is pregnant. She struggles to find a way in the world with her equally young but misguided husband and her older sister, Joan Parker who tries to become a surrogate parent to Anne. But, cruelly, Joan contracts the same cancer that killed their mother, and in a few months, she, too, is dead. Annie is diagnosed with the same disease that killed her mother and sister—breast cancer. It is severe, and surgery and chemotherapy, with all its accompanying difficulties, soon follows. She loses her hair, and if that wasn't enough to endure, her husband, never really mature or stable, has begun an affair with Anne's closest friend Louise, and leaves her. Paul is soon diagnosed with cancer and expires shortly before she is diagnosed with a second cancer. The answer is:","completion":"In the given context, the person experiencing hair loss due to breast cancer and its treatment is Annie Parker. The full real name of this person would be Annie Parker.

Answer the following question: Background: Collision theory tells us that molecules need to collide in order for a reaction to take place. All else being equal, anything that increases the frequency of collisions would also increase the rate of reaction. One way to do this is to increase the concentrations of one or more of the reactants. Using a real world example, a busy freeway will experience much more frequent car collisions than a fairly empty neighborhood street. Similarly, forcing more randomly moving molecules into the same amount of space will cause an increased number of collisions over a given length of time, providing the reactants with more opportunities to transform into products. Paragraph: John is a chemical engineer with a pharmaceutical company. He is trying to develop a drug that can be absorbed by the system in different rates. To that end, he conducted two experiments. In one case, he used lower concentrations of reactants, he called it case A. Then he used the same reactants in a higher concentration. He called it case B. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would case A have higher or lower rate of reactions than case B? Answer:","completion":"Case A would have a lower rate of reactions than case B. Reasoning: According to the collision theory, the frequency of collisions between molecules increases with higher concentrations of reactants. In the given paragraph, John conducted two experiments where he used lower concentrations of reactants in case A and higher concentrations of reactants in case B. As a result, there would be more frequent collisions between the molecules in case B, leading to a higher rate of reactions compared to case A with lower concentrations of reactants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Process: - Networks of trees start forming - The trees die off - The dead material provides nutrients for more trees - The rising trees provide shelter - And more organisms begin to thrive - The ecosystem known as a forest is made. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more pollution around happens, how will it affect more trees dies off. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of increased pollution would have both direct and indirect effects on the process of forest formation as well as the existing forest ecosystem. The impacts of pollution on trees and forests could be multifaceted, with both short-term and long-term consequences. Here is a detailed explanation of how pollution could affect the various stages of the process and the overall forest ecosystem: 1. Networks of trees start forming: When there is an increased level of pollution, it could impact the growth and formation of new trees within the network. Pollutants like ground-level ozone can cause damage to the leaves, reducing their photosynthetic capacity. This can further inhibit the capacity of young trees to grow and establish themselves within the network. 2. The trees die off: As more pollution is present in the environment, the overall health of trees might be negatively affected, causing a higher mortality rate among mature and young trees. Air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter can be harmful to trees by damaging their leaves, roots, and bark. Moreover, these pollutants can disrupt the delicate balance of nutrients in the soil, making it difficult for trees to absorb essential elements like nitrogen and phosphorus. 3. The dead material provides nutrients for more trees: As more trees die off due to pollution, the decay of dead organic material will indeed release nutrients into the soil, potentially allowing new trees to grow. However, it is important to consider the negative impacts of pollution on soil chemistry as well. For instance, acid rain, a consequence of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions, can cause soil acidification, which leaches essential nutrients from the soil and inhibits the uptake of essential elements by plants. In this case, the dead material may not provide the necessary nutrients for the growth of new trees, limiting forest regeneration. 4. The rising trees provide shelter: If pollution adversely affects the growth and survival of trees, the network of trees that provide vital shelter and habitat for other organisms will be compromised. A decline in tree population could lead to habitat loss and fragmentation for many species, affecting the overall biodiversity and stability of the forest ecosystem. 5. More organisms begin to thrive: With reduced tree cover and compromised habitat conditions, the number of organisms thriving in the forest might decrease. The decline in the health and number of trees, along with degraded habitat conditions caused by increased pollution, could lead to decreased population sizes and species diversity across various trophic levels. 6. The ecosystem known as a forest is made: Overall, the perturbation of increased pollution has both direct and indirect negative effects on the formation and maintenance of a forest ecosystem. As pollution affects tree health, growth, and survival rates, it disrupts the intricate dynamics of the forest ecosystem, threatening biodiversity, habitat quality, and the ability of the forest to provide essential ecosystem services, including natural regulation of the environment, carbon sequestration, and provision of resources and habitats to various species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This statement likely refers to the ongoing debates and negotiations between countries regarding their official names, as well as the recognition of those names by the international community. In this context, Karamanlis points out that having a name accepted by all parties involved is crucial for the efficient and successful progress of a country's efforts to join these alliances. Both NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) and the European Union are significant international organizations that promote cooperation, stability, and economic growth among their member countries. Therefore, being a part of these alliances is highly desirable for many nations. For a country to gain membership in both NATO and the EU, they must meet certain criteria and undergo rigorous evaluations. One aspect of this process is ensuring that the aspiring member's name is recognized and agreed upon by the current member states. This can sometimes involve lengthy negotiations and diplomatic efforts to find a suitable and agreeable name. An example of this issue is the naming dispute between Greece and its northern neighbor regarding the use of the name \\"Macedonia.\\" The long-standing disagreement between the two countries primarily revolved around historical and cultural reasons. Eventually, they reached a compromise and agreed on the name \\"North Macedonia,\\" which paved the way for the latter country's accession to NATO and further integration into the EU. In conclusion, Greek Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis's statement underlines the importance of consensus on a country's name for achieving progress towards NATO and EU membership. This process illustrates the necessity for diplomatic efforts, effective communication, and compromise to promote cooperation and mutual understanding among nations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean President Moon Jae-in said he urged North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to directly engage with Washington to salvage the June 12 nuclear summit with the U.S., when the two leaders held a surprise second inter-Korean summit Saturday. “I emphasized that the two sides must directly communicate in order to eradicate any misunderstandings, and preliminary talks through working-level negotiations on key agendas are necessary,” said President Moon at a press briefing in Seoul Sunday. North Korea requested the meeting between Kim and Moon after U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday canceled the Singapore summit. Trump said his decision was based on the “tremendous anger and open hostility displayed” by North Korea officials recently over U.S. demands that Pyongyang follow the Libya denuclearization model. North Korea sees that model for rapid and complete denuclearization as a threat to the Kim government’s security, since Libyan leader Moammar Ghadafi was later overthrown and killed by his own people, with support from a multinational military coalition that included the U.S. Pyongyang has called for a more incremental process that links concessions to partial nuclear reductions and postpones complete denuclearization until the North’s security demands are met. Moon met with Kim on the North side of the inter-Korean border, in the same village of Panmunjom where the two leaders held a summit in April. At that meeting, on the south side of the border, the two leaders jointly declared their support for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. On Saturday Moon said Kim reaffirmed his commitment to end his country’s nuclear weapons program, but shared his key concern that the U.S. would work to destabilize his rule despite any security guarantees it offers. “What is uncertain for Chairman Kim Jong Un is not his willingness for denuclearization, but he has concerns over whether North Korea can trust the fact that Washington will end its hostile relations, and guarantee the security...

Lash is associate dean at the University of Southern California Law School. Johnson is a justice on California's Second District Court of Appeal. Lash and Johnson are co-chairs of the California Commission on Access to Justice. The full report can be viewed at (www.calbar.org). In her year-long odyssey through the California justice system, Katherine, a 35-year-old single mother with three children, experienced failure at every turn. Leaving her abusive husband, she moved into the only apartment she could afford, and soon discovered a broken toilet and non- working oven, rats and roaches, and a fourthfloor landing with no railing. She began withholding rent pending repairs her landlord refused to make, but then her Medi-Cal benefits were cut off when she could not provide rent receipts. She lost health care for her children and herself, although she is a borderline diabetic in need of medication and her children were suffering from rat bites. Katherine tried to seek help through the courts. Representing herself at an administrative hearing, she lost her appeal to restore Medi-Cal benefits because she did not have proper documentation of the rent account. When she went to a courthouse to file a complaint against her landlord, she found the process so confusing that she gave up and went home. According to \\"The Path to Justice: A Five-Year Status Report on Access to Justice in California,\\" prepared by the California Commission on Access to Justice, Katherine is just one of 4.6 million poor Californians whose basic civil legal needs -- often involving such critical needs as housing, health care, education, employment, safety and transportation -- are not being addressed. California has a critical dearth of legal services for the poor, and, as this report makes clear, it is imperative that the state join with the federal government and private funders to increase resources so that all Californians, regardless of income, have equal access to our justice system. Our justice system is predicated on the assumption that both parties will be represented by lawyers who act as gatekeepers and guides through a complex legal system that would otherwise be inaccessible to many of us. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable members of our society are the least able to afford legal services. California does have a strong network of legal aid organizations that try to help meet the needs of the poor, but there's just one legal aid lawyer available per 10,000 poor people. We may promise \\"justice for all,\\" but for those who can't afford a lawyer, that promise is often a lie. In its new report, the Commission on Access to Justice notes some significant steps toward providing equal access to justice for all Californians. Question: \\"Why was Katherine seeking legal help?\\" Answer: \\"She committed a crime\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"No, the answer to the question is not correct. Correct Answer: Katherine was seeking legal help because she faced various problems, including a broken toilet, non-working oven, rats and roaches, lack of railing on the fourth-floor landing in her apartment, withholding rent due to her landlord's refusal to make repairs, and the loss of her Medi-Cal benefits, which affected healthcare for her and her children."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","completion":"The answer is: A living organism dies. Explanation: To derive this solution, let's examine the missing first step in the given process of fossil formation: 1. (Missing step) - The process starts with an event or change in the living organism's condition. 2. The soft tissue decomposes - This implies that the organism is no longer alive. 3. The bones are left behind - This further indicates the death of the organism. 4. Scavengers tear the body apart and move the bones elsewhere - Occurs after the organism's death. 5. Wind and rain also scatter the bones further - Again, this takes place after the organism dies. 6. The bones left behind will weather and become buried by sand and soil - The bones are still present post-death. 7. The proteins in the bone are replaced with minerals that are dissolved in the soil - The fossilization process. 8. This creates a rock-like substance called a fossil - The outcome of fossilization. 9. Water and wind erosion wear away the layers of soil on top of the fossil - The fossil remains have been preserved. 10. This makes the discovery of the fossil possible - The end result of the entire process. Taking all these steps into account, we can deduce that the missing first step must be the death of the living organism, which initiates the subsequent decomposition, scaterring of bones, fossilization, and eventual discovery of the fossil."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who was honored in 1884 and awarded with a lifetime pension? is inside the article: Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (English: chy-KOF-skee; Russian: Пётр Ильи́ч Чайко́вский, tr. Pyótr Ilʹyích Chaykóvskiy, IPA: [pʲɵtr ɪlʲˈjitɕ tɕɪjˈkofskʲɪj] (listen); 7 May 1840 [O.S. 25 April] – 6 November [O.S. 25 October] 1893), was a Russian composer of the romantic period, whose works are among the most popular music in the classical repertoire. He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally, bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in Europe and the United States. He was honored in 1884 by Emperor Alexander III, and awarded a lifetime pension. Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant. There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five, with whom his professional relationship was mixed. Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style—a task that did not prove easy. The principles that governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music; this seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great. This resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country's national identity—an ambiguity..., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"The last name of the person who was honored in 1884 and awarded a lifetime pension is Tchaikovsky. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky was a Russian composer of the romantic period, and he was honored by Emperor Alexander III for his significant contributions to music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: If hormones control many cell activities and are very important to the central theme of physiology, then what is hormones controlling cell activities important to? Answer choices: - gravity - it helps plants in growing - the sun - central theme of physiology - female sex cells - density - Generating heat - production of energy Answer:","completion":"Hormones controlling cell activities are important to a number of processes in living organisms and particularly play a significant role in the central theme of physiology. While some of the answer choices provided are related to the presence or function of hormones in specific contexts, the most accurate and encompassing answer is that hormones control cell activities to maintain and regulate various aspects of the central theme of physiology. Physiology is the study of how living organisms, tissues, and cells function and interact to maintain homeostasis, overall health, and survival. Hormones take center stage in this regard, as they act as chemical messengers in the body and help regulate a wide array of processes, such as growth and development, metabolism, reproduction, and responses to stress or injury. The importance of hormones controlling cell activities in the context of physiology can be emphasized in several ways: 1. Growth and development: Hormones play a crucial role in controlling the growth and development of organisms. For example, hormones like auxins and gibberellins in plants help regulate growth, while growth hormone in animals controls growth and development. 2. Metabolism: Hormones help maintain a balance of energy production, storage, and utilization in the body. For instance, insulin and glucagon regulate blood sugar levels in vertebrates, ensuring the body has adequate energy resources for proper functioning. 3. Reproduction: Hormones are essential for controlling reproductive processes, such as the production and maturation of gametes, fertility cycles, and the development of secondary sexual characteristics. Examples include estrogen and progesterone in female mammals and testosterone in male mammals. 4. Stress response and adaptation: Hormones are involved in helping organisms react and adapt to their environment, including responses to stress, injury, or external factors. The production of cortisol in response to stress and epinephrine during a \\"fight or flight\\" response are clear examples of how hormones contribute to an organism's survival in changing environmental conditions. 5. Homeostasis: The overall aim of physiology is to maintain homeostasis – a stable and balanced internal environment. Hormones play a critical role in achieving this; for example, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland release hormones like antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and oxytocin that help regulate water balance and maintain osmotic balance in the body. In summary, hormones controlling cell activities are crucial to the central theme of physiology as they help regulate, maintain, and coordinate various bodily functions to ensure the survival, growth, and overall health of living organisms. These complex functions help organisms adapt to their environment and maintain homeostasis across a wide range of internal and external challenges."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choices: - typically surface area - Weak Surface area - strongest surface area - smallest surface area A: Answer:","completion":"A: Smallest surface area Surface tension is a phenomenon caused by the cohesive forces between liquid molecules, which results in the liquid's surface acting like a thin, elastic film. These cohesive forces arise from the molecular attraction that occurs between the outermost liquid molecules at the surface of the liquid. The surface tension causes a contracting force that acts perpendicular to the surface and tends to minimize the surface area of the liquid. This is because the molecules at the surface have a higher energy state as they are exposed to the air and experience an asymmetric attraction to other liquid molecules in comparison to those in the interior. As a result, the surface molecules are constantly trying to move closer together and reduce the surface area to minimize their energy state. Among the given choices, the answer is \\"smallest surface area\\" since surface tension forces cause the surface of a liquid to contract to the smallest possible surface area. This phenomenon can be easily observed in the formation of liquid droplets or bubbles, where the spherical shape represents the smallest surface area for a given volume. In summary, due to the cohesive forces between liquid molecules, surface tension causes the surface of a liquid to contract to the smallest surface area, thereby minimizing the energy state for molecules at the surface."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Your goal is to modify the last three sentences (the original ending) so that it aligns with the counterfactual context and is as close to the original ending as possible. Let's break it down step-by-step: 1. Read the premise: \\"Jim's favorite ice cream was chocolate.\\" This tells us that the story is about Jim and his love for chocolate ice cream. 2. Check the initial context: \\"One day he went to the China Buffet.\\" - This provides information about the story's setting, but we'll replace it with the counterfactual context. 3. Read the original ending: \\"It was really busy. He went to the ice cream section. The chocolate ice cream was all gone.\\" - This is what we'll be modifying. 4. Consider the counterfactual context: \\"One day he went to the movie theater.\\" - This changes the story's setting to a movie theater, and we'll need to adapt the original ending accordingly. 5. Write a new story ending using the counterfactual context and remaining as close to the original ending as possible: New Story Ending: \\"It was really crowded. He went to the concession stand.

Garry Kimovich Kasparov (Russian: Garri Kimovich Kasparov, Russian pronunciation: ['garjI 'kjim@vjItc ka'spar@f]; born Garik Kimovich Weinstein, 13 April 1963) is a Russian, and formerly Soviet, chess grandmaster, former world chess champion, writer, and political activist, who many consider to be the greatest chess player of all time. From 1986 until his retirement in 2005, Kasparov was ranked world No. 1 for 225 out of 228 months. His peak rating of 2851, achieved in 1999, was the highest recorded until being surpassed by Magnus Carlsen in 2013. Kasparov also holds records for consecutive professional tournament victories (15) and Chess Oscars (11). As a teenager, Kasparov tied for first place in the USSR Chess Championship in 1981-82. His first win in a superclass-level international tournament was scored at Bugojno, Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1982. He earned a place in the 1982 Moscow Interzonal tournament, which he won, to qualify for the Candidates Tournament. At age 19, he was the youngest Candidate since Bobby Fischer, who was 15 when he qualified in 1958. At this stage, he was already the No. 2-rated player in the world, trailing only World Chess Champion Anatoly Karpov on the January 1983 list. Kasparov's first (quarter-final) Candidates match was against Alexander Beliavsky, whom he defeated 6-3 (four wins, one loss). Politics threatened Kasparov's semi-final against Viktor Korchnoi, which was scheduled to be played in Pasadena, California. Korchnoi had defected from the Soviet Union in 1976, and was at that time the strongest active non-Soviet player. Various political maneuvers prevented Kasparov from playing Korchnoi, and Kasparov forfeited the match. This was resolved by Korchnoi allowing the match to be replayed in London, along with the previously scheduled match between Vasily Smyslov and Zoltan Ribli. The Kasparov-Korchnoi match was put together on short notice by Raymond Keene. Kasparov lost the first game but won the match 7-4 (four wins, one loss). In January 1984, Kasparov became the No. 1 ranked player in the world, with a FIDE rating of 2710. He became the youngest ever world No. 1, a record that lasted 12 years until being broken by Vladimir Kramnik in January 1996; the record is currently held by Magnus Carlsen. Later in 1984, he won the Candidates' final 8 1/2 -4 1/2 (four wins, no losses) against the resurgent former world champion Vasily Smyslov, at Vilnius, thus qualifying to play Anatoly Karpov for the World Championship. That year he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), as a member of which he was elected to the Central Committee of Komsomol in 1987.

This article: In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose death could not be determined to be accident or suicide?, what is it ?

Is telepathy real? What is the process? Choose from: (I) no (II) yes The answer is:","completion":"(I) no The two questions are not the same as they address different topics. The first question focuses on theories related to poverty, while the second question explores the concept of telepathy. Question 1: What are the theories of poverty? There are several theories that explain the existence of poverty in society. Some major theories include: 1. Individualistic Theory: This theory suggests that poverty is a result of an individual's personal characteristics, choices, and abilities. According to this theory, the lack of financial stability arises from poor choices and inadequate skills. 2. Structural Theory: Structural theory attributes poverty to systemic factors, such as social and economic structures that prevent people from accessing resources, job opportunities, and education. This theory holds various social systems, such as governments and institutions, accountable for perpetuating poverty. 3. Culture of Poverty Theory: This theory emphasizes the role of cultural values and norms in the continuation of poverty. This perspective suggests that generations of impoverished people develop specific values, mindsets, and behaviors that perpetuate poverty within their families and community. 4. Dependency Theory: This theory focuses on the impact of historical and current global economic relations on the poverty experienced by developing nations. According to this view, poverty is a result of the unequal distribution of resources and exploitation of weaker economies by wealthier ones. Question 2: Is telepathy real? What is the process? Telepathy refers to the ability to transmit and receive information between individuals by using thoughts or mental images without any verbal or physical communication. Currently, there is no scientific evidence to prove that telepathy is real. However, there are numerous claims and anecdotal accounts that suggest the possibility of its existence. The process of telepathy is widely believed to involve the following steps: 1. Sender: An individual, referred to as the \\"sender,\\" generates a thought, emotion, or mental image to communicate with another person. 2. Transmission: The sender focuses on the subject with the intent to communicate the message mentally. The process could involve various mental techniques such as visualization, concentration, or meditation. 3. Receiver: The \\"receiver\\" is the person who picks up on the sender's thought, emotion, or mental image without any verbal or physical cues. 4. Interpretation: The receiver interprets the received message and responds, either by acknowledging the message or providing feedback, which may include completing the telepathic communication process by sending their thoughts back. Despite ongoing speculation and research, there is no conclusive evidence or widely-accepted scientific explanation that telepathy is a real phenomenon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This equation looks a little tough, but let's break it down. We're trying to find 'u'. The equation is -46 = -23*u - 23*u. You see how -23*u appears twice? You can add those together to make it simpler. This is called combining like terms. -23*u and -23*u makes -46*u. So, the equation turns into -46 = -46*u. To solve for 'u', we have to reverse what's being done to 'u'. Something is being multiplied by 'u', so we need to do the opposite of multiplying, which is dividing. Let's divide both sides of the equation by -46. This leaves us with 'u' on one side and 1 on the other side. Therefore, the answer is u = 1. Because when we multiply -46 by 1, we get -46.

That way, you can go back to your normal hair color after playing! You'd want a dark color like black, dark brown, or even dark purple!

Sources confirm to The Hollywood Reporter that the network is looking to bring back the former Steve Carell starrer for another season. Carell, however, will not return. A search is underway to find a new star to take over as the show's Michael Scott-like regional manager of paper supply company Dunder Mifflin. NBC and producers Universal Television declined comment. TV Line was first to report the news. Sources told THR in August that The Office may be revived with a new cast and creator Greg Daniels attached. At the time, NBC and producers Universal Television said those rumors were not true. That speculation has now grown more real as the network is said to be in talks for a revival. The Office ran for nine seasons on NBC as part of the network's Thursday comedy brand. The show — which made stars out of Carell, Rainn Wilson, John Krasinski, Jenna Fischer, Craig Robinson, Ellie Kemper and Mindy Kaling, among others — was an awards-season staple, taking home multiple Emmys, Golden Globes and other top prizes. Carell exited after season seven, with The Office continuing on for two additional cycles before the star returned for the series finale in 2013. Creator Greg Daniels, who adapted the show from the British comedy starring Ricky Gervais, told THR in November 2016 that he was happy with how the NBC series ultimately ended. \\"I feel like I did in the finale what that would have been because I jumped forward in time as, like a reunion of the characters, and so, to me, I think that was it. It said everything that the show had to say,\\" he told THR when asked if he'd be open to a U.S. follow-up as Gervais was plotting a movie revival of his own. \\"Personally, I feel like we left on a good note. I’m not that anxious to open it up again myself, but I would be interested to see what David Brent’s up to. But also I think the American show became so much of an ensemble and to not have the whole ensemble there would just feel kind of, I don’t know, less than. So I don’t want to criticize what he’s doing, I think that’s great, but I’m okay with us having had our finale.\\" News of a potential continuation of The Office comes as NBC has found ratings and awards-season fortune with its Will & Grace revival. (The reboot scored an early renewal ahead of its return in September.) ||||| NBC is getting ready to put pen to paper on a revival of The Office. Sources confirm to TVLine exclusively that the Peacock network is eyeing a continuation of the beloved workplace comedy for the 2018-2019 season. The revival would once again be set at Dunder Mifflin’s Scranton, PA., branch, and feature a mix of new and old cast members. Steve Carell, who starred as the branch’s regional manager, Michael Scott, for seven of the comedy’s nine seasons, will not be involved in the new series. The search for a new RM/boss is said to be already underway. TV Reboots and Revivals: A Complete Guide Launch Gallery Launch Gallery NBC declined to comment on or confirm any details of this story.

Use the following highlights to write an article: Over 190 million employment and salary records of American citizens have been shared by their employers with credit rating agencies. This allows anyone signing up to their subsidiary companies to view salary and health insurance details of one-third of adults in the U.S. Article:","completion":"Title: Over 190 Million Employment and Salary Records of Americans Shared with Credit Rating Agencies Introduction Unbeknownst to many, employers across America have been sharing over 190 million employment and salary records of American citizens with credit rating agencies. This staggering statistic, which includes sensitive salary and health insurance information, means that approximately one-third of all adults in the U.S. have had their personal details exposed, leaving them available for viewing by anyone who signs up with the subsidiary companies of these credit rating agencies. This article dives into the implications of this data sharing practice, offering in-depth insight into the ethical and privacy concerns that the general public should be aware of. Hidden Data Sharing Practices The data sharing agreement between employers and credit rating agencies comes as a shock to many, as they have unknowingly revealed their salary and health insurance details to entities that could potentially misuse the sensitive information. Such practices have raised significant questions about the ethics and privacy implications of such an agreement, with experts calling for more transparency in the processes. From a legal standpoint, the sharing of this data by employers becomes questionable more so because employment and salary records are not primarily intended for credit assessment purposes. This large-scale sharing of personal information intensifies the ongoing debate around data protection and privacy rights. Looking Deeper Into Employment and Salary Record Sharing With over 190 million records being shared, it’s crucial to consider who gains access to these records and how the data could be misused. Individuals who sign up with subsidiary companies of credit rating agencies gain access to these records, leading to not only potential identity theft but also financial fraud. One of the most significant concerns is that insurance companies could use the health insurance information shared to identify those who present a higher risk and either charge them exorbitantly or even deny coverage outright. Such discriminatory practices would pose a severe constraint on access to affordable health care and further limit an individual's choice of insurance providers. The Need for Better Transparency and Regulations Given the potential negative implications of such a massive data-sharing agreement, it is vital that better transparency is offered to the public, as well as adequate legal protection. As it stands now, the sharing of employment and salary records is still unclear, presenting a substantial risk to personal and financial security for millions of Americans. Several pro-active steps could be taken: - Employers should be required to provide comprehensive information on the data sharing process to their employees, including notification of any data sharing arrangements. - Regulation authorities should scrutinize the practices of credit rating agencies to ensure high ethical standards and privacy concerns are addressed. - Clear-cut policies outlining the use of employment, salary, and health insurance information could be developed and implemented to protect citizens from potential misuse of their data. - Legal requirements should be in place compelling credit rating agencies and their subsidiaries to protect and respect the personal information received, holding them responsible if there's an instance of a data breach or misuse. Conclusion The current practice of sharing over 190 million employment and salary records of American citizens with credit rating agencies highlights the precarious state of personal data protection and privacy rights today. The implications of this massive data sharing agreement, from identity theft to the potential for discriminatory practices, cannot be overlooked. As it stands now, a renewed focus on transparency, regulation, and legal requirements has become essential to protect the sensitive personal information of millions of Americans and safeguard against potential misuse."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I always have stayed away from hospitals. People died or were born. But now I thought I might get some idea if I went down to where it was all happening, the being born and the dying. Mostly the dying. It was the dying that interested me. I sat on a bench in a sort of waiting room. I wanted to call it a green room; it wasn't a place where the patients would wait to be called by the doctor; it was a place where the relatives would wait while the patient was in their room. It had a coffee bar, and comfortable couches, with trendy, muted colors on the walls and floor. Everything was clean and modern without being cold, a homogenized balancing act designed to keep everyone calm during their stressful time. It was a green room; patients were \\"guests\\"; their families were \\"guests\\" as well. Here was where the families would sit and be feted while they waited to be called out to perform, to smile and encourage or to don faces of appropriate mournfulness.

Set beside the Imperial Valley in southeastern California, the Salton Sea area was supposed to be Hollywood's answer to the Riviera back in the '50s. But its developers failed to anticipate the raw sewage that would run up the New River from Mexico and make survival impossible for many aquatic species. Rotting fish guts and toxic debris soon littered the shoreline. Construction projects were abandoned and yet another impotent vision of luxury tourism was left flaccid. Thanks again, trash!

Background: Sanders was born on September 8, 1941, in Brooklyn, New York City. His father, Elias Ben Yehuda Sanders, was born on September 14, 1904, in Slopnice, Poland (then the Austro-Hungarian province of Galicia), to a Jewish family; in 1921, the 17-year-old Elias immigrated to the United States, where he became a paint salesman. His mother, Dorothy \\"Dora\\" Sanders (nee Glassberg), was born in New York City on October 2, 1912, to Jewish immigrant parents from Poland and Russia. Sanders became interested in politics at an early age: \\"A guy named Adolf Hitler won an election in 1932. Context: Sanders was a consistent critic of the Patriot Act. As a member of Congress, he voted against the original Patriot Act legislation. After its 357-to-66 passage in the House, Sanders sponsored and voted for several subsequent amendments and acts attempting to curtail its effects, and voted against each re-authorization. In June 2005, Sanders proposed an amendment to limit Patriot Act provisions that allow the government to obtain individuals' library and book-buying records. The amendment passed the House by a bipartisan majority, but was removed on November 4 of that year in House-Senate negotiations and never became law. In March 2006, after a series of resolutions passed in various Vermont towns calling for him to bring articles of impeachment against George W. Bush, Sanders stated that it would be \\"impractical to talk about impeachment\\" with Republicans in control of the House and Senate. Still, Sanders made no secret of his opposition to the Bush Administration, which he regularly criticized for its cuts to social programs. Sanders was a vocal critic of Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan; in June 2003, during a question-and-answer discussion with the then-Chairman, Sanders told Greenspan that he was concerned that Greenspan was \\"way out of touch\\" and \\"that you see your major function in your position as the need to represent the wealthy and large corporations\\". In October 2008, after Sanders had been elected to the Senate, Greenspan admitted to Congress that his economic ideology regarding risky mortgage loans was flawed. In 1998, Sanders voted and advocated against rolling back the Glass-Steagall Legislation provisions that kept investment banks and commercial banks separate entities.

You could read in its beautifully printed brochure that the school was designed to help all those \\"children of wealthy parents, who are too busy to learn during the day due to the time spent on the difficult task of maintaining our country's high ranking in the very competitive field of computer games.\\" In other words: when a parent wanted to have some peace and quiet, he or she would leave the kid at home in front of the computer with a bag of chips. When the kid had enough, which normally happened in the evening, he would go to school for about two hours. The creator of PEES and its first principal was Krzycho Jedynak, a former junior high PE teacher in Potylica, a computer games fan and the winner of, as we could read in the beautifully printer brochure, \\"a local Amiga gaming championship\\". Understanding exactly the needs of his future students, he planned to open classes of the following profiles: platform PSP (one group), platform PC (three groups), platform GB (one) and platform Mac (cancelled due to a lack of interest). The school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person whose baton Monteux studied under? Monteux's first high-profile conducting experience came in 1895, when he was barely 20 years old. He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor.

Trivia question: Lebanese-American professor/author Nassim Taleb coined the term '(What colour/color What creature?)' referring to an unpredictable random event that has a vast societal/political/economic impact? And the answer is?","completion":"The answer to the trivia question is 'Black Swan.' Lebanese-American professor and author Nassim Nicholas Taleb coined the term \\"Black Swan\\" to refer to an unpredictable and rare event that has significant and far-reaching societal, political, or economic impact. The concept was introduced in his 2001 book \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" and was later expanded upon in his 2007 bestselling book \\"The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable.\\" The term is derived from the old European belief that all swans were white since no one had ever seen a black swan. Thus, a black swan was seen as an impossibility, just like the rare, unforeseen, and highly impactful events Taleb describes. However, when black swans were discovered in Australia in the 17th century, the term's meaning evolved to convey the notion that a perceived impossibility might, in fact, be possible. In his work, Taleb explores the idea that our reliance on mathematical models and historical patterns often leads us to underestimate the likelihood and consequences of highly improbable events. He also suggests that successful individuals and organizations must learn to adapt and prepare for these high-impact, unpredictable events known as Black Swans.

Nicholas Lezard described post-punk as \\"a fusion of art and music\\". The era saw the robust appropriation of ideas from literature, art, cinema, philosophy, politics and critical theory into musical and pop cultural contexts. Artists sought to refuse the common distinction between high and low culture and returned to the art school tradition found in the work of artists such as Captain Beefheart and David Bowie. Among major influences on a variety of post-punk artists were writers such as William S. Burroughs and J.G. Ballard, avant-garde political scenes such as Situationism and Dada, and intellectual movements such as postmodernism. Many artists viewed their work in explicitly political terms. Additionally, in some locations, the creation of post-punk music was closely linked to the development of efficacious subcultures, which played important roles in the production of art, multimedia performances, fanzines and independent labels related to the music. Many post-punk artists maintained an anti-corporatist approach to recording and instead seized on alternate means of producing and releasing music.

For most of his life, John had frequented the nearby professional running track, which was designed for athletes to train on. The controlled environment of the track provided a firm, level surface, with clear markings for distance and lanes. It was a place John felt most comfortable with; a sanctuary where he could focus solely on his physical fitness and mental fortitude without intrusion of the numerous distractions that one faces on the streets. The track was only 400 meters in length, providing a space where John could keep an eye on his surroundings at all times. This was a much different experience compared to the bustling and unpredictable nature of the streets. The sense of order, routine, and consistency provided him with an environment that allowed him to thrive in his running pursuits. As John took a walk on the street for the first time, he quickly realized how ill-prepared his body and mind were for the onslaught of stimuli and distractions that came with this new terrain. The uneven pavement under his feet, pedestrians seemingly springing out of nowhere, cars honking their horns aggressively, traffic lights changing at unexpected times, the cacophony of advertisements, and smells of food from a nearby restaurant — all of these things utterly overwhelmed him. Breathing so heavily, John felt uncertainty cloud his mind. His breathing, usually rhythmic and controlled, was thrown off by the constant distractions and diverse environment. He found himself panting, struggling to inhale the polluted air that encompassed the cityscape. This forced him to confront the reality that his training on the short track had not prepared him for a real-world experience outside the fabricated boundaries of the sports facility compound. With every pounding step echoing on the concrete pavement, John physically and mentally navigated this foreign and intimidating world. He realized how valuable it was to gain experience beyond the comfort of his familiar track. Over time, he knew that he would gain adaptability and versatility in both his training and his mindset. As John continued to venture on his walks in the streets, he began to understand that there was a need for the adaptation and integration of experiences from the short track and the grander scope of life. It was a lesson in resilience, adaptability, and personal progression. With each breath, John learned to embrace the challenges and unpredictability of the streets, slowly building his confidence and welcoming the change that his running journey had taken. In the end, the distinct qualities of both the short track and the bustling streets offered John invaluable lessons. The confinement of the track allowed him to build a strong foundation and discipline, and the streets brought him face to face with the complexity of life. The amalgamation of these experiences shaped him into a resilient and well-rounded individual, both on and off the track."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? maladjusted teens in a downward narcotized spiral .","completion":"The phrase \\"maladjusted teens in a downward narcotized spiral\\" can be considered negative for several reasons. We can break down the phrase into two parts – \\"maladjusted teens\\" and \\"downward narcotized spiral\\" – to better understand the implications behind these words and why the overall sentiment is negative. 1. Maladjusted teens: \\"Maladjusted\\" refers to someone who is unable or unwilling to adjust to or cope with a particular situation in a healthy or appropriate manner. In this case, it is applied to \\"teens.\\" Adolescence is a crucial time for identity formation, socialization, and emotional growth. Being maladjusted implies that the teenagers in question are struggling to deal with the challenges of adolescence, which is not a positive situation. Such struggles can lead to various emotional, social, and psychological challenges, negatively affecting their mental health, relationships, and overall well-being. 2. Downward narcotized spiral: This part of the phrase concerns drug addiction or substance abuse. \\"Narcotized\\" refers to being under the influence of a narcotic substance, while \\"downward spiral\\" describes a steadily worsening situation that may be difficult to escape or reverse. Combining these terms, the \\"downward narcotized spiral\\" indicates a vicious cycle of escalating drug use and its deteriorating consequences on the teens' lives. This has numerous negative implications, such as: - Health issues: The use of narcotic substances can cause severe short and long-term health problems, including dependence, addiction, and even fatal overdose. - Emotional and psychological consequences: Drug abuse can lead to emotional disturbances, such as anxiety, depression, and mood disorders. Moreover, it can exacerbate pre-existing mental health problems. - Social and interpersonal struggles: Substance abuse often causes conflicts in relationships, leading to isolation, damaged friendships, and strained family interactions. - Educational and career disruption: Maladjusted teenagers who are caught in a downward narcotized spiral may struggle academically, lowering their chances of achieving educational and career goals. - Legal problems: Engaging in illegal drug use is against the law, and may lead to legal consequences, further exacerbating the negative situation. In conclusion, the phrase \\"maladjusted teens in a downward narcotized spiral\\" is decidedly negative, touching upon issues related to emotional and social struggles, substance abuse, and their detrimental effects on adolescents' lives. This description paints a concerning picture of teenagers who may require support and intervention to overcome these challenges and break free from a potentially damaging and dangerous cycle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what gets changed into natural gas due to heat and pressure?\\" is \\"oxygen\\", given that heat and pressure change the remains of dinosaurs into natural gas? A:","completion":"No, the right answer to the question \\"what gets changed into natural gas due to heat and pressure?\\" is not \\"oxygen\\". The formation of natural gas is a complex process that involves multiple factors and reactions, and the primary components that get transformed into natural gas are dead organic materials, primarily from plants and microscopic organisms, rather than oxygen. The formation of natural gas occurs over millions of years through a process called diagenesis and catagenesis. During this process, heat and pressure transform decaying organic materials into hydrocarbons, which are compounds composed of hydrogen and carbon atoms. Oxygen is not the primary element that gets transformed into natural gas – instead, the organic materials are mainly composed of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and smaller amounts of sulfur and other trace elements. The misconception that heat and pressure transform the remains of dinosaurs into natural gas may stem from the fact that natural gas is sometimes inaccurately referred to as a \\"fossil fuel\\" in general terms. In actuality, oil and coal are primarily derived from remains of plants and ancient microscopic marine organisms rather than dinosaurs. As the dead organic material accumulates and gets buried beneath layers of sediment, heat and pressure cause it to undergo chemical and physical changes. In the early stages of diagenesis, the organic material turns into a waxy substance called kerogen through the loss of oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. As heat and pressure continue to increase during catagenesis, the kerogen transforms into liquid hydrocarbons (crude oil) and subsequently into gaseous hydrocarbons (natural gas). Therefore, the right answer to the question \\"what gets changed into natural gas due to heat and pressure?\\" is the organic material from dead plants and microscopic organisms, rather than oxygen. The heat and pressure acting on these organic materials create a series of chemical and physical transformations leading to the formation of natural gas, which mainly consists of hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane. The process also involves some reduction of oxygen content, but oxygen in itself does not get transformed into natural gas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This week they will talk again. Tim read about the Greenhouse Effect while Norm read about the mini-Ice ages. Which friend learned less about the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increasing? Answer:","completion":"Tim learned less about the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increasing. This is because he focused on the Greenhouse Effect, which is primarily about the way certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, trap heat and warm the planet. While greenhouse gases do contribute to the trapping of terrestrial radiation, and thus to global warming, Tim's focus was more on the overall mechanism and consequences of the Greenhouse Effect. On the other hand, Norm read about mini-Ice Ages, which occur when the Earth experiences periods of significantly cooler temperatures mainly due to decreased solar activity and natural climate variability. During mini-Ice Ages, less terrestrial radiation is trapped, and the planet cools down, leading to a reduction in global temperatures and a temporary decline in the overall rate of global warming. Since Norm's focus was on these colder periods, he would have learned more about the reduction of trapped terrestrial radiation in relation to the Earth's cooling. In summary, Tim learned less about the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increasing, as he focused on the Greenhouse Effect, whereas Norm's focus on mini-Ice Ages would have provided him with more information about the reduction of trapped terrestrial radiation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ranveer Singh Bhavnani (born 6 July 1985) is an Indian actor who appears in Hindi films. He is the recipient of several awards, including two Filmfare Awards, and is among the highest-paid actors in the country. After completing a bachelor's degree from Indiana University Bloomington, Singh returned to India to pursue his career in films. He made his acting debut in 2010 with a leading role in Yash Raj Films' romantic comedy Band Baaja Baaraat. Singh was born on 6 July 1985 into a Sindhi family in Mumbai, to Anju and Jagjit Singh Bhavnani. His grandparents, Sunder Singh Bhavnani and Chand Burke, moved to Mumbai from Karachi, Sindh, (present-day Pakistan) during the Partition of India. He has an elder sister named Ritika Bhavnani. Singh is the maternal cousin of actress Sonam Kapoor and producer Rhea Kapoor, daughters of actor Anil Kapoor and wife Sunita Kapoor (nee Bhavnani). Singh explains that he dropped his surname Bhavnani, since he felt that the name would have been \\"too long, too many syllables\\", thus downplaying his brand as a \\"saleable commodity\\". Singh always aspired to be an actor, participating in several school plays and debates. Once when he had gone for a birthday party, his grandmother asked him to dance and entertain her. Singh remembers that he suddenly jumped in the lawn and started dancing to the song \\"Chumma Chumma\\" from the 1991 action film, Hum. He felt the thrill of performing and was interested in acting and dancing. However, after he joined H.R. College of Commerce and Economics in Mumbai, Singh realised that getting a break in the film industry was not at all easy, as it was mostly people with a film background who got these opportunities. Feeling that the idea of acting was \\"too far-fetched\\", Singh focused on creative writing. He went to the United States where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Indiana University. At the university, he decided to take acting classes and took up theatre as his minor. After completing his studies and returning to Mumbai in 2007, Singh worked for a few years in advertising as a copywriter, with agencies like O&M and J. Walter Thompson. He then worked as an assistant director, but left it to pursue acting. He then decided to send his portfolio to directors. He would go for all kinds of auditions, but did not get any good opportunities, while only getting calls for minor roles: \\"Everything was so bleak. It was very frustrating.

This presented a significant challenge to Rachel, as she relied heavily on public transportation and ride-sharing services for her daily travels and errands. However, in this particular situation, Rachel's usual options were not viable due to a variety of unforeseen circumstances. Firstly, the public transportation system was experiencing delays and service disruptions because of ongoing maintenance work. This made it difficult for Rachel to plan her trip around bus or train schedules and to guarantee that she would be able to reach the store in a timely manner. Not only were there delays, but her closest bus stop was temporarily closed, forcing her to walk several blocks to an alternative stop, further complicating her journey. Secondly, the use of ride-sharing services, like Uber and Lyft, was not a practical option for Rachel at that time. She had recently lost her smartphone and was unable to access the apps needed to request a ride. Moreover, due to a sudden surge in demand, the prices for these services had skyrocketed, putting them well beyond her budget. Faced with these challenges, Rachel called upon her friend Elena for assistance. Elena had access to a personal vehicle, providing her with the flexibility and mobility that Rachel lacked. Furthermore, Elena was familiar with the area and knew the location of the store where Rachel's medication was available, making her a perfect candidate for the task. Recognizing the urgency and importance of her friend's situation, Elena graciously agreed to help Rachel obtain her medication. She stopped by the store on her way home from work, ensuring that she could complete the errand efficiently and without delay.

Article:The asylum-seekers, from Sri Lanka and the Philippines, housed Mr Snowden for two weeks when he fled the US after leaking thousands of files. A government spokesman said that there were no substantial grounds for believing that the claimants would face danger in their home countries. The group, who are also seeking asylum in Canada, have 14 days to appeal. The asylum-seekers - a Sri Lankan couple with two children, a Sri Lankan man and a Filipino mother with a daughter - were introduced to Edward Snowden by their lawyer, Robert Tibbo. He brought him to their homes in 2013 just after the former National Security Agency contractor revealed he had leaked classified information to the press revealing widespread US government surveillance. The identity of the group, who sheltered him for about two weeks, only became public shortly before the release of an Oliver Stone film about the whistleblower. \\"We now have less than two weeks to submit appeals before the families are deported,\\" Mr Tibbo said, calling the decision \\"completely unreasonable\\". There are currently 8,956 asylum seekers in Hong Kong awaiting a decision on their case, according to the Immigration Department. But the territory only recognised 72 people as refugees between 2009 and December 2016, the South China Morning Post reported in February. Most spend years in limbo waiting for the government - which is not a signatory to the UN refugee convention, but considers claims for protection on the grounds that those sent home could be tortured - to process their case. The lawyers for the asylum seekers believe they are being treated unfairly by the Hong Kong government. The proof? They say the four adults all arrived in Hong Kong at different times, submitted their applications separately and made different claims. Their asylum cases had little in common. Instead what unites them is that they all fed and sheltered Edward Snowden. Their main lawyer, Robert Tibbo, told me the fact that all the cases were activated and decided at the same time suggested his clients were singled out because of their relationship with Mr Snowden. Another one of their lawyers, Marc-Andre Sequin, said their cases had been expedited because their plight had drawn attention to the \\"embarrassing\\" way in which Hong Kong treated asylum seekers. A spokesman for the Hong Kong government denied these accusations. Marc-Andre Seguin, a Canadian lawyer representing the group in their Canadian application, told RTHK that \\"clearly there is targeting here and our clients have reason for concern\\". Two of the Sri Lankan refugees say they are being illegally pursued by police from their own country who travelled to Hong Kong in late 2016. Sri Lankan police have denied the allegations.

He wished to make it a forest. The good doctor had some interesting ideas about planting trees.He never watered his new trees.Once I asked why,he said,\\"If you water them,each baby tree will grow weaker and weaker. Otherwise,they will have to grow deep roots to look for water under the earth by themselves.\\" He planted some oaks, and instead of watering them every morning,he beat them with a rolled-up newspaper.I asked him why he did that,and he said it was to get the trees' attention. Dr Gibbs died two years after I left home.I always walked by his house and looked at the trees that I'd watched him plant about twenty -five years ago.They're very big and strong now. I also planted two trees several years ago.I carried water to them for a whole summer.I sprayed them.However,after two years of caring too much,whenever a cold wind blows in, they shake a lot. Life is hard,whether we want it to be or not. What we need to do is try our best to make our roots reach deep into the brave heart,so when the rain falls and the wind blows,we could face them strongly and won't be beaten down. Question: Why did Dr Gibbs treat his trees in that way? Options: A: Because he wanted to make them grow better. B: Because he wanted to work off his anger.

There may be no motion in stagnant areas; for example, in parts of Alaska, trees can establish themselves on surface sediment deposits. In other cases, glaciers can move as fast as 20–30 m (70–100 ft) per day, such as in Greenland's Jakobshavn Isbræ (Greenlandic: Sermeq Kujalleq). Velocity increases with increasing slope, increasing thickness, increasing snowfall, increasing longitudinal confinement, increasing basal temperature, increasing meltwater production and reduced bed hardness. What makes some glaciers stagnant? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"Some glaciers become stagnant due to a combination of factors that reduce their movement. These factors can include: 1. Lack of slope: Glaciers move more quickly when on a steeper incline, as the force of gravity pulls the ice downhill. In flatter areas, the force of gravity is less effective at causing movement, leading to stagnation. 2. Decreasing thickness: Thinner glaciers exert less pressure on their base, which can result in less basal sliding motion. As a glacier thins over time, its movement may slow down and eventually become stagnant. 3. Low snowfall: Glaciers accumulate mass from snowfall, which then compacts into ice and drives glacier movement. In areas where snowfall is limited, there may be insufficient mass accumulation to cause significant motion. 4. Limited longitudinal confinement: Glaciers are more likely to move faster when they are confined within narrow valleys, as this confinement can help to channel the ice flow. In wider, more open areas, this channeling effect is reduced, which can lead to slower-moving or stagnant glaciers. 5. Low basal temperature: If the temperature at the base of a glacier is too low, the ice may become frozen to the underlying bedrock, preventing any sliding movement. This can result in a stagnant glacier, even if other conditions are favorable for movement. 6. Decreased meltwater production: Meltwater is an essential lubricant for glacier movement. When there is less meltwater available, the sliding motion of a glacier may be impeded, leading to stagnation. 7. Bed hardness: If the underlying bedrock or till is particularly hard, it can provide greater resistance to the glacier's movement, slowing it down or even causing it to become stagnant."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"Dealing with crickets in your yard can be important to minimize damage to plants and mitigate the noise they create. Accomplishing this goal involves a multi-faceted approach focused on habitat modification, natural predators, barriers to entry, and, if necessary, chemical control. Below are several effective steps to take in dealing with crickets in your yard. 1. Habitat modification: Crickets thrive in damp, dark, and cluttered areas. By eliminating their preferred habitat, you can make your yard less attractive to them. a. Remove debris such as leaf piles, wood piles, and heaps of yard trimmings. b. Keep the grass cut short and well-maintained. This will expose the crickets to their natural predators. c. Limit the amount of standing water in your yard by fixing leaky faucets and ensuring proper drainage. d. Trim shrubs, branches, and other vegetation near your home to allow sunlight to penetrate and reduce hiding places for crickets. 2. Natural predators: Encouraging the presence of natural predators in your yard can help reduce the cricket population by providing a natural form of pest control. a. Attract birds to your yard by installing bird feeders, birdhouses, and birdbaths. Many bird species feed on crickets. b. Provide habitat for reptiles, particularly lizards and frogs, which are known to eat crickets. Construct small rock piles, logs, or other sheltering places for them. c. Encourage beneficial insects, such as spiders and ground beetles, which also feed on crickets. Planting a variety of native plants can help attract these helpful insects. 3. Barriers to entry: Preventing crickets from entering your home is an effective way to mitigate damage and annoyance. a. Seal gaps, cracks, and openings around your foundation, windows, and doors with caulk or another appropriate sealant. b. Install window screens, door sweeps, and weatherstripping to further block entry points. c. Outdoor lighting can attract crickets at night. Switch to yellow or sodium vapor bulbs to reduce cricket attraction. 4. Traps: Using traps can help decrease the cricket population in your yard. a. Create homemade traps by filling shallow dishes or jars with a mix of water and molasses or sugar to attract the crickets. Place these traps around the area with high cricket activity. b. Use store-bought cricket traps or sticky traps, placed in prime cricket locations. 5. Chemical control: In severe cases, you may need to resort to chemical control to deal with crickets in your yard. a. Apply insecticides labeled for cricket control, such as carbaryl, permethrin, or cyfluthrin, following the instructions on the product label. It's best to target areas where crickets are breeding or hiding, rather than indiscriminate spraying. b. Use bait containing insecticides, placing it in areas with high cricket activity. Follow the provided instructions to use these products safely and effectively. By employing a combination of these strategies, you can effectively deal with crickets in your yard and create a more pleasant and peaceful outdoor environment. Don't forget to monitor your yard regularly to ensure that cricket populations remain under control."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Critical analysis of Beiderbecke's work during his lifetime was sparse. Surprisingly, his innovative playing initially received greater attention and appreciation among European critics than those in the country of his birth. The British music trade magazine \\"Melody Maker\\" published a number of reviews of his recordings and assessments of his cornet playing. In the April 1927 issue, bandleader Fred Elizalde stated: \\"Bix Bidlebeck (sic) is considered by Red Nichols himself and every other trumpet player in the States, for that matter, as the greatest trumpet player of all time\\". The magazine's editor, Edgar Jackson, was equally fulsome in his praise: \\"Bix has a heart as big as your head, which shines through his playing with the warmth of the sun's rays\\" (September 1927 issue); \\"The next sixteen bars are a trumpet solo by Bix, and if this doesn't get you right in the heart, you'd better see a vet….\\" In Blackboard Jungle, a 1955 film starring Glenn Ford and Sidney Poitier, Beiderbecke's music is briefly featured, but as a symbol of cultural conservatism in a nation on the cusp of the rock and roll revolution. Brendan Wolfe, the author of Finding Bix, spoke of Beiderbecke's lasting influence on Davenport, Iowa: \\"His name and face are still a huge part of the city's identity. There's an annual Bix Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Festival, and a Bix 7 road race with tens of thousands of runners, Bix T-shirts, bumper stickers, bobble-head dolls, the whole works.\\" In 1971, on the 40th anniversary of Beiderbecke's death, the Bix Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Festival was founded in Davenport, Iowa, to honor the musician. In 1974, Sudhalter and Evans published their biography, Bix: Man and Legend, which was nominated for a National Book Award. In 1977, the Beiderbecke childhood home at 1934 Grand Avenue in Davenport was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\\"Bix: 'Ain't None of Them Play Like Him Yet\\", a 1981 film documentary on Beiderbecke's life directed and produced by Brigitte Berman, featured interviews with...

Although Hutchins said he enjoys a wide range of music -- from Pink Floyd and Arcade Fire to Christian bands such as Hillsong United -- he said he has to be careful of what music he listens to, for the same reason he temporarily turned off the Beatles. Hutchins, a 16-year-old graced with poise and thoughtfulness, is one of many teenagers who say that some part of popular culture, with its ubiquitous references to sex, drugs and violence, has harmed him. Last year, Hutchins and his Christian youth group attended an Acquire the Fire rally in Atlanta, Georgia, he said.

Aboard a US Navy P-8A Poseidon reconnaissance plane, CNN got a view from 16,500 feet of low-lying coral reefs turned into garrisons with five-story buildings, large radar installations, power plants and runways sturdy enough to carry large military aircraft. During the flight the crew received six separate warnings from the Chinese military, telling them they were inside Chinese territory and urging them to leave. \\"Leave immediately and keep out to avoid any misunderstanding,\\" a voice said. The US Navy jet flew past four key artificial islands in the Spratly chain where China has built up fortifications: Subi Reef, Fiery Cross Reef, Johnson Reef and Mischief Reef. On Subi Reef, the Poseidon's sensors picked up 86 vessels, including Chinese coast guard ships, moored in a giant lagoon, while on Fiery Cross Reef rows of hangers stood alongside a lengthy runway. \\"It was surprising to see airports in the middle of the ocean,\\" said Lt. Lauren Callen, who was leading the air combat crew aboard the Navy flight. Each time the aircraft was challenged by Chinese military, the US Navy crew's response was the same. \\"I am a sovereign immune United States naval aircraft conducting lawful military activities beyond the national airspace of any coastal state,\\" the response said. \\"In exercising these rights guaranteed by international law, I am operating with due regard for the rights and duties of all states.\\" CNN has reached out to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment. CNN gets rare access on board a US military surveillance flight over the hotly-disputed islands in the South China Sea. Competing claims The Chinese government staunchly maintains large areas of the South China Sea have been part of the country's territory \\"since ancient times.\\" Beijing's \\"nine-dash line\\" extends more than one thousand kilometers from its southernmost province, taking in more or less the entirety of the waters, through which the United Nations estimates one-third of global shipping passes. The South China Sea is also believed to contain rich oil and natural gas reserves that have yet to be fully explored. Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei all claim overlapping portions of the sea which spans 3.6 million square kilometer (1.4 million square miles), but the most far-reaching claims have been made by China. Beijing's sovereignty claims are considered by most other countries as unsubstantiated, a view backed by an international tribunal in 2016. Despite this however, little has changed in China's approach to the region in recent years. To reinforce its claims of sovereignty, Beijing has been reclaiming land on and around reefs and shoals to construct artificial islands which are then militarized with airfields and radar equipment. China has spent much of the past two years fortifying these islands, including placing missiles on the Spratly island chain during naval exercises in April. This is despite a promise made by President Xi Jinping to then-US President Barack Obama in 2015 that the Chinese government would not be militarizing the artificial islands. The US Navy's P8-A Poseidon plane which carried a CNN crew from Okinawa, Japan, over the South China Sea on August 10. Rapid expansion The last time CNN was given access to a US Navy mission over the South China Sea was in September 2015, when the aircraft was also warned off by Chinese military. Since then, Beijing's island building in the contested waters has moved forward at a rapid pace. Flying over Fiery Cross Reef on Friday, a five-story building was visible, as well as a large radar installation, which looked like neatly arranged golf balls on the Navy plane's infrared camera. Though no Chinese missiles were seen on Friday's flight over the South China Sea, Navy officers said some of the structures seen could potentially be used to house them. Cmdr. Chris Purcell, who leads Patrol Squadron Four which undertook Friday's mission, said the US has been doing these flights for five decades and they show US commitment to maintaining free passage in international waters. \\"The reason we're here hasn't changed,\\" Purcell said. \\"The reason (the Chinese) are here has changed.\\" Within hours of the trip, Chinese state tabloid Global Times posted a reaction to CNN's report on its Chinese-language website. The article called for all readers to \\"give a thumbs-up to Chinese servicemen\\" for their defense of China's territory. China claims US sparking militarization Beijing says its growing military presence in the South China Sea is necessary to protect its sovereignty, blaming Washington and its allies for tensions in the region. Chinese military exercises in April included the largest naval parade in the country's history, with President Xi Jinping overseeing drills that included 10,000 troops, 48 naval vessels and 76 fighter jets. Beijing points to the regular US Navy patrols and flyovers of the South China Sea as an example of US militarization and provocations, and a justification for the increased Chinese military presence. \\"By playing up the so-called China's militarization in the South China Sea, certain people in the US are staging a farce of a thief crying \\"stop thief\\",\\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in May . \\"It is self-evident to a keener eye that who is militarizing the South China Sea.\\" In the past year, the US has stepped up freedom of navigation operations in the region, sailing US naval vessels within miles of China's artificial islands across the South China Sea. The exercises , which the US also conducts in other parts of the world, assert the navy's right to travel wherever it pleases in international waters, a vital component of Washington's naval power across the world. Time may be running out to effectively challenge China's claims in the South China Sea however. Adm. Philip Davidson, the recently installed head of the US Pacific Command, told Senators during a confirmation hearing in April that China is already very firmly entrenched. \\"China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios short of war with the United States,\\" Davidson said. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"The article discusses increased tensions over the militarization of the South China Sea, in particular China's rapid expansion on the islands such as the Spratly chain. Despite international concern and an international tribunal ruling against China's territorial claims to the sea, China has continued to assert its sovereignty with artificial land construction and militarization, including placing missiles on the Spratly island chain during naval exercises. The US, on a navy P-8A Poseidon reconnaissance flight recently, has challenged this by maintaining their right of free passage in international waters, even as the Chinese military warned them off their territory. The article also highlights that the South China Sea is significant for its believed reserves of oil and natural gas and significant shipping traffic. Other countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei also lay claim to overlapping parts of the sea, but China's assertions have been the most extensive."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: The theory of plate tectonics demonstrates that the continents of the Earth are moving across the surface at the rate of a few centimeters per year. This is expected to continue, causing the plates to relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a hydrosphere. With the loss of either of these, continental drift will come to a halt. The production of heat through radiogenic processes is sufficient to maintain mantle convection and plate subduction for at least the next 1.1 billion years.At present, the continents of North and South America are moving westward from Africa and Europe. Researchers have produced several scenarios about how this will continue in the future. These geodynamic models can be distinguished by the subduction flux, whereby the oceanic crust moves under a continent. In the introversion model, the younger, interior, Atlantic ocean becomes preferentially subducted and the current migration of North and South America is reversed. In the extroversion model, the older, exterior, Pacific ocean remains preferentially subducted and North and South America migrate toward eastern Asia.As the understanding of geodynamics improves, these models will be subject to revision. In 2008, for example, a computer simulation was used to predict that a reorganization of the mantle convection will occur over the next 100 million years, causing a supercontinent composed of Africa, Eurasia, Australia, Antarctica and South America to form around Antarctica.Regardless of the outcome of the continental migration, the continued subduction process causes water to be transported to the mantle. After a billion years from the present, a geophysical model gives an estimate that 27% of the current ocean mass will have been subducted. If this process were to continue unmodified into the future, the subduction and release would reach an equilibrium after 65% of the current ocean mass has been subducted. I am facing a new situation today: Two friends were in college. Hank studied plate tectonics, while his buddy Alex studied Earth's atmosphere. They were both very fascinated by the subjects. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which student learned more about mantle convection? Answer:","completion":"Hank learned more about mantle convection, as he studied plate tectonics which directly involves the process of mantle convection."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Given the below context: The cuisine of Rwanda is based on local staple foods produced by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (manioc). Many Rwandans do not eat meat more than a few times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called Ikigage made from sorghum and urwagwa, made from bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange. Bralirwa manufactures soft drink products from The Coca-Cola Company, under license, including Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite, and a range of beers including Primus, Mützig, Amstel, and Turbo King. In 2009 a new brewery, Brasseries des Mille Collines (BMC) opened, manufacturing Skol beer and a local version known as Skol Gatanu; BMC is now owned by Belgian company Unibra. East African Breweries also operate in the country, importing Guinness, Tusker, and Bell, as well as whisky and spirits. Guess a valid title for it!

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: It is important to keep a balance between staying in touch with home and working to establish a new community where you are. Strike up conversations with people who seem interesting. This might be someone in your dorm or someone in one of your classes. The first few days or weeks of college, summer camp, or studying abroad can be a great opportunity to make friends. Take advantage of situations where you're not the only new person around. If you're studying or working in a different country, try a local consulate, expatriate society, or university international society to find other people who are sharing your experience of being away from home. Talking about feelings of unhappiness with people who are sharing your experiences can be helpful. Think about taking up a hobby or joining a club. Or, you can volunteer with a local nonprofit organization. These are great ways to find people with common interests. Keeping yourself in your past home or place may keep you from accomplishing goals in your new place or establishing new connections and friendships. Sometimes when we are away from home, our daily routine and even habits might change. This type of change makes the new environment seem even more foreign. To help prevent large changes like this, try to continue some of your familiar habits, even in your new place. For instance, if you have moved away for college and are missing Taco Tuesday nights with your family, try to implement a new Taco Tuesday with your dorm roommates or new group of friends. Or if you are away on summer camp and you do certain things to prepare for bed every night, try to continue this routine. These type of routines often offer structure and familiarity, so try to add some of these into your new environment. Step outside with your camera or smart phone. A camera can be a great way to see your new location in a new light. By keeping your mind active and focused on your new surroundings, you can turn your attention away from homesickness. It's also a great way to document your experiences while away from home. To get the most out of your experience, particularly if you're living abroad, break out of your comfortable cocoon and try new things. For example, try new foods. Food can often be the most defining element of a culture. Trying the local foods and finding something that the natives eat that you also enjoy can go a long way towards making you feel comfortable in a new place. Go to cultural events. Even if you are away at college in a different state, you can still sample the different cultural events that you might not get in your hometown. Culture shock involves feelings of confusion, doubt, or nervousness caused by being in a new place. This can be especially hard for people living in a new country, but it can also happen if someone moves away to college in a city from a rural area. The trick is not to let it get the better of you. In particular, if you're living abroad, try these strategies to help overcome culture shock: Learn the rules of living in your host country. Try to understand how and why the local people act the way they do. Their behavior and customs may be different from your own, but they are probably typical for the area. Take time to learn the language. It always helps to understand as much as possible of what people are saying. They will appreciate your effort to communicate with them in their language, even if it is just a few simple phrases, and it will make your daily life much easier. Approach the experience with a positive attitude and an open mind. Approaching your experience as an adventure is likely to help you have a good experience.","completion":"It's important to find a balance between staying connected to home and making new friends when you're away.

TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Dancing in public is not allowed in Iran, but thousands could hardly contain themselves at a recent presidential campaign rally in the capital city, Tehran. Supporters hope Zahra Rahnavard will become Iran's future first lady. On this day, the deafening cheers were not for presidential hopeful Mir Hossein Mousavi, but rather for his wife -- a woman some are calling Iran's Michelle Obama. The comparisons to the first lady of the United States stem from the role Zahra Rahnavard is playing in her husband's quest for the presidency. Never in the history of Iranian presidential elections has a candidate put his wife in the forefront of his campaign. The overwhelming majority were young voters, many of whom said they attended because of","completion":"Rahnavard. As an accomplished academic, artist, and former chancellor of Alzahra University, she inspired the youth with her message of hope, change, and empowerment. The bold move by Mousavi to include his wife in campaigning highlighted a shift in Iranian politics, recognizing the significant role of women in the society and their potential contributions to the country's future. In the weeks leading up to the election, the momentum surrounding Mousavi and Rahnavard's campaign grew exponentially. Women, in particular, felt more included in the political process than ever before and were determined to make their voices heard. They organized rallies, went door-to-door to distribute campaign materials, and engaged in conversations about the future of Iran with their families and friends. Mousavi's approval rating climbed he was considered the front-runner by election day. As the election results started coming in, it became clear that Mousavi had secured a massive victory. Celebrations erupted across the country, with people taking to the streets to rejoice in the triumph of democracy. For the first time, Iran had elected a President who prioritized inclusivity, equal rights for women, and building stronger international relations. During their time in office, President Mousavi and First Lady Zahra Rahnavard successfully implemented progressive reforms in the fields of education, healthcare, and the economy. They addressed the high rate of inflation, which had plagued Iran for years, by introducing effective fiscal policies. Thanks to their efforts, the Iranian economy eventually stabilized and experienced a period of remarkable growth. The Mousavi administration also focused on restoring Iran's global reputation, engaging in diplomatic talks with Western countries and fostering new alliances. As their foreign policy shifted, economic sanctions were lifted, paving the way for positive international relations and cooperation. Rahnavard continued to play a crucial role during her husband's presidency, actively promoting gender equality and women's rights. She established pioneering initiatives to eliminate gender-based discrimination in the workplace and educational institutions and worked tirelessly to ensure women had equitable access to opportunities in all spheres of life. The impact of President Mousavi's and Zahra Rahnavard's leadership improved the lives of millions and significantly changed the political landscape in Iran. Their eight-year tenure marked a new chapter in the country's history – one in which tolerance, unity, and progress became the guiding principles of governance. As their term came to an end, the Iranian people cast their ballots to elect a successor. Taking cues from Mousavi's and Rahnavard's successful approach, many of the candidates featured their spouses in the campaigns, addressing pressing issues like climate change, technology advancements, and income inequality. The legacy left behind by Mousavi and Rahnavard paved the way for the subsequent generation of inspired Iranian leaders. The country progressed in areas of civil rights, education, and international relations. Many credit their visionary leadership coupled with the strength and perseverance of the Iranian people for this success. In the years that followed, Iran’s political landscape evolved, and it became increasingly common for female candidates to run for office, breaking the previous barriers set in the male-dominated political sphere. Zahra Rahnavard, often referred to as \\"Iran's Michelle Obama,\\" remains an enduring symbol of women's empowerment and change for millions in Iran and across the globe.

One needs a BA in education and then a special education certificate such as a certificate in learning disabilities, emotional disabilities or cross categories which means covering all the subjects.A certified new special educate teacher needs to _ a current special education teacher for at least, a year because there is that much to know and practice. Working with the students is the biggest reward.However, the paperwork is huge with requesting more year after year.If you are good at doing about ten things at the same time, then you may be the right person for the job. No day is the same. Parent and government expectations are high. A sense of empathy(the ability of feeling and sharing another person's feelings) and one hundred percent prepared to help your students is important. Also, if you are a special education teacher working in the high school, it is your job to make sure your special education students are able to be employed after they graduate, and then the special education teacher needs to stay in touch with the special students a year after they graduate to make sure they are employed and can support themselves.

The two groups have long worked together and foreigners are known to fight alongside Somali militants. The announcement comes as al-Shabab is under pressure on several fronts. Is al-Shabab on the back foot?Profile: Ayman al-ZawahiriQ&A: Who are al-Shabab?'Lifeline' US-Somalia remittances on hold Africa Union troops supporting the forces of the UN-backed government have taken control of the capital, Mogadishu, while both Kenya and Ethiopia have sent forces into Somalia to push back the Islamists. Al-Shabab, however, still controls many southern and central areas of the country. However, correspondents say al-Shabab's policy of banning many foreign aid agencies from areas it controls during the region's worst drought in 60 years has lost the group some of its popular support. The United Nations says that although the famine in Somalia is officially over, a third of the population still needs urgent feeding. BBC Somali editor Yusuf Garaad Omar says the merger of al-Shabab and al-Qaeda has the potential to change the dynamics of the conflict in Somalia. During the 15-minute Arabic-language video posted on jihadist websites, Zawahiri said the move was \\"good news\\" for al-Qaeda. Analysts say the announcement helps boost al-Qaeda after its leader Osama Bin Laden was killed last year. \\"Al-Qaeda needs to project power and influence, particularly given its own operational impotence,\\" Australian analyst Leah Farrall told Reuters news agency. \\"Al-Shabab's acceptance under the al-Qaeda umbrella probably came with permission from Zawahiri for the group to launch external operations against the West.\\" This week, the London-based Royal United Services Institute think-tank warned that about 50 Britons were training with al-Shabab and could return to attack the UK. Last week, William Hague was also in Mogadishu, the first visit by a British foreign secretary in 20 years. The UK government is holding a conference in London on 23 February to try to find a political solution to Somalia's problems, and tackle piracy and extremism. Somalia has been without an effective central government since 1991 and since then, has been convulsed by conflict. What was that article about?","completion":"The article primarily discusses the alliance of Al-Shabab, a Somali extremist group, with Al-Qaeda, an international terrorist organization. Al-Shabab, being under pressure as it tries to maintain control in Somalia, has been weakened due to various causes. Provision of aid has been cut off by them to those regions they control, gaining the group some antipathy among the locals. This strategic policy error is especially notable given that these regions are currently grappling with the impacts of the worst drought the area has faced in six decades. The UN has declared the famine in Somalia to be officially over, but still sees an urgent need for local population aid. Africa Union troops along with the forces of the UN-backed government have taken control over the Somali capital, Mogadishu, and both Kenya and Ethiopia have sent their forces into Somalia in an attempt to push back the Islamist group. However, Al-Shabab still has authority over many central and southern parts of the country. The acceptance of Al-Shabab by Al-Qaeda has provided the latter with a significant strategic boost, particularly after the death of its former leader, Osama Bin Laden. This announcement of obedience by Ahmed Abdi Godane (Mukhtar Abu Zubair), the Al-Shabab leader, has thrust Al-Qaeda back into relevance and allowed it to project its influence by permitting Al-Shabab to instigate external operations against the West. The article also includes the warning from the Royal United Services Institute that around 50 Britons who are currently training with Al-Shabab could potentially inflict harm upon returning to the UK. In this scenario, Britain appears to be taking proactive steps, as evident from the recent visit of British foreign secretary William Hague to Mogadishu, the first in 20 years. The UK government is expected to hold a conference in London in an effort to find a political solution to the issues plaguing Somalia, particularly piracy and extremism. Overall, the socio-political landscape of Somalia, devoid of a central governing authority since 1991, continues to be chaotic and characterized by conflict, with this recent alliance of Al-Shabab and Al-Qaeda adding a new dynamic to the ongoing unrest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Opt for a smaller, intimate location where it is easy to converse. For example, book a corner table in a tiny, romantic restaurant. You can also try a first date at a quiet coffee shop. If you go out to a bar, make sure it's quiet. Bars with loud music and huge crowds are unlikely to win a cancer woman's favor. Some think Cancer women love traveling. A good way to plan a date is planning short trips. Take her away for the weekend on occasion to somewhere she has never been before. A Cancer woman will appreciate this gesture. You do not need to spend a fortune on a trip. A day trip to a nearby city can be a great way to spend a Saturday with a Cancer woman. Remember that Cancer women prefer intimate settings. When planning activities for a day trip, look for locations that are quiet and low-key over loud bars and crowded restaurants. Some think Cancer women prefer it if their partner makes the first move. They are unlikely to initiate physical contact or the first kiss. If a cancer woman seems engaged with you, try brushing her hand, touching her arm, or leaning in for a kiss. If you're planning something like a birthday party for a Cancer woman, smaller is generally better. Cancer women have a few close relationships and prefer to spend time with small groups of people. Gather a Cancer woman's close friends for events rather than inviting, say, everyone from her office or casual acquaintances from school. You can, for example, have a birthday party for your Cancer woman in your home. Invite a few of her closest friends and plan low-key activities like board games. If you take a Cancer woman out for her birthday, invite only a handful of friends and choose a quiet location. Those who believe in astrology find Cancer women appreciate sincerity in a partner more than their career, material possessions, or education. Romantic gestures should come from a place of sincerity. Rather than trying to impress her with an expensive date night, go for something personal for her. For example, you don't have to spend a lot of money on a fancy restaurant. Instead, plan an intimate picnic lunch in area that's personally meaningful for you, like the park where you first met. Summary:","completion":"Cancer women are believed to prefer intimate and quiet settings over rowdy and crowded places. When planning a date, avoid loud bars and choose a cozy restaurant or coffee shop. Short trips and weekend getaways are also appreciated by Cancer women, as they love traveling and exploring new places.

Here is a news article: × Girl shoots at father after pulling gun on wife in El Paso County CALHAN, Colo. — A girl fired a gun at her father after he pulled a firearm on his wife during a domestic violence incident Wednesday night, the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office said. Deputies were called about 7:20 p.m. to the 6200 block of South Calhan Road on a report of a shooting, the sheriff’s office said. Deputies found that an argument between the father, 38-year-old Robert Williams, and his daughter escalated to the point that Williams pulled out a handgun and pointed it at his wife and daughter. The sheriff’s office said Williams then told the girl to go to another room and get another firearm so they could “duel.” After a struggle, a round was fired by Williams. The girl then fired a shot at Williams. No one was hit by either bullet.

Article: The next generation of smart phone could combine the date from its gyroscopes with a built-in compass to allow you to track your indoor movements even without GPS. Research described it in the international Journal of Innovative Computing and Applications by Shahid Ayub of Lancaster University, and his colleagues there and at HW Communications, suggests that the embedded inertial sensors in many smart phones have added the facility to be used for localization and tracking applications. The primary benefit of using smart phones is that no additional infrastructure would need to be installed for monitoring personnel movements in a wide variety of situations not least staff, equipment and inventory movements in warehouse facilities, shopping malls and factories. In contrast, other technology being proposed would require new equipment,such as RFID technologies. However, smart phones do not yet have the ability to pinpoint their location without recourse to the GPS system, which is not accessible indoors and has the added disadvantage of using up battery power very quickly even if it could be used. Inertial navigation only provides the necessary information to a specified starting point the team says. This is useful for anyone with a non-GPS smart phone who wishes to track the route they take when walking or jogging if they specify their starting point. The team suggests that pedestrians indoors could be positioned using a combination of the smart phone accelerometer and an built-in digital compass, something that will become available in future smart phones. They have now investigated the potential of three different smart phone placement modes: idle, hand held and listening, which could be used with pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) techniques to allow users to record the path they follow or for various kinds of workplace or other monitoring requirements. \\"The technique could be used in underground tube stations, airports , train stations where there is no infrastructure installed for tracking or...

Even though it was a mind-numbing, bathe-in-gasoline-to-slough-the-shame-from-my-soul kind of sex, it didn't matter. At the end of the day we were just objects to each other. We couldn't talk about anything else. We'd tried before, but it had usually led to an afternoon of power-fucking in every changing room on Rodeo Drive. It was a fun ride, but nothing more.

Both Seti II and Amenmesse have been suggested although the fact that that Siptah later changed his royal name or nomen to Merneptah Siptah after his Year 2 suggests rather than his father was Merneptah. If correct, this would make Siptah and Seti II half-brothers since both of them were sons of Merneptah. - A sarcophagus (plural, sarcophagi) is a box-like funeral receptacle for a corpse, most commonly carved in stone, and usually displayed above ground, though it may also be buried. The word \\"sarcophagus\\" comes from the Greek \\"sarx\\" meaning \\"flesh\\", and \\"phagein\\" meaning \\"to eat\\", hence \\"sarcophagus\\" means \\"flesh-eating\\"; from the phrase \\"lithos sarkophagos\\". Since \\"lithos\\" is Greek for \\"stone\\", \\"lithos sarcophagos\\" means, \\"flesh-eating stone\\". The word also came to refer to a particular kind of limestone that was thought to decompose the flesh of corpses trapped within it. - Not to be confused with Amun - her - khepeshef , a son of Ramesses II , and Amun - her - khepeshef , a son of Ramesses III. The Egyptian prince Amenherkhepshef was the son of Ramesses VI and Queen Nubkhesbed .

She was the Great Royal Wife of Pharaoh Ramesses VI and mother of Pharaoh Ramesses VII, Princess Iset (God's Wife of Amun) and Princes Amenherkhepshef and Panebenkemyt. - Limestone is a sedimentary rock, composed mainly of skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as coral, forams and molluscs. Its major materials are the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO). - Ramesses VI Nebmaatre-Meryamun (also written Ramses and Rameses) was the fifth ruler of the Twentieth dynasty of Egypt who reigned from 1145 to 1137 BC and a son of Ramesses III by Iset Ta-Hemdjert. His royal tomb, KV9, is located near Tutankhamun's tomb in the Valley of the Kings. - Iset Ta-Hemdjert or Isis Ta-Hemdjert, simply called Isis in her tomb, was an Ancient Egyptian queen of the twentieth dynasty; the Great Royal Wife of Ramesses III and the Royal Mother of Ramesses VI. - Usermaatre Setepenre Meryamun Ramesses VII (also written Ramses and Rameses) was the sixth pharaoh of the 20th dynasty of Ancient Egypt. He reigned from about 1136 to 1129 BC and was the son of Ramesses VI. Other dates for his reign are 1138-1131 BC. The Turin Accounting Papyrus 1907+1908 is dated to Year 7 III Shemu day 26 of his reign and has been reconstructed to show that 11 full years passed from Year 5 of Ramesses VI to Year 7 of his reign. - Tomb KV13, located in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, was cut and decorated for the burial of the noble Bay of the Nineteenth Dynasty.

Does \\"Fabric also can be made from recycled or recovered cotton that otherwise would be thrown away during the spinning, weaving, or cutting process.\\" contain the correct answer to \\"Besides new cotton fibers, what type of fibers can be used to make cotton products?\\"","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"Fabric also can be made from recycled or recovered cotton that otherwise would be thrown away during the spinning, weaving, or cutting process.\\" contains the correct answer to the question \\"Besides new cotton fibers, what type of fibers can be used to make cotton products?\\" According to this statement, besides new cotton fibers, recycled or recovered cotton fibers can be used to make cotton products. These recycled or recovered fibers are essentially the waste materials that could have been discarded during various stages of the manufacturing process, such as spinning, weaving, or cutting. Recycling or recovering cotton fibers is an environmentally friendly practice that helps reduce waste and contribute to a more sustainable textile industry. Utilizing these waste materials not only conserves resources but also minimizes the environmental impact of the production process. The use of recycled cotton fibers can help decrease water and energy consumption and reduce the need for harmful chemicals. Moreover, using recycled or recovered cotton in textile production can also provide additional benefits, such as: 1. Cost savings: By reducing the amount of raw materials needed, companies can save money on purchasing new cotton fibers. 2. Unique properties: Recycled cotton fibers can sometimes have unique properties, such as a softer feel or a more textured look, which may be appealing to consumers. 3. Waste reduction: Incorporating recycled cotton fibers into the production process helps divert waste from landfills and contributes to a circular economy, where resources are continuously reused and recycled. 4. Market differentiation: Brands that use recycled or recovered cotton can position themselves as environmentally responsible and cater to eco-conscious consumers, which can provide a competitive advantage in the market. It is important to note that while using recycled or recovered cotton fibers in textile production has numerous advantages, there can be some challenges associated with the process. For example, the quality of the recycled fiber might not be as high as that of new fibers, and there could be some technical hurdles when blending recycled fibers with other materials. However, technological advancements and increased efforts toward sustainable production practices are consistently working towards addressing these challenges and improving the overall quality and usability of recycled cotton fibers in textile products."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Why do vectors have components and scalars don't? Do those questions have the same meaning? Available choices: [1]. no; [2]. yes;","completion":"Scalars and vectors are two types of physical quantities used in physics and mathematics. Scalars are quantities that have only magnitude, such as mass, temperature, and distance. Vectors, on the other hand, have both magnitude and direction, such as velocity, force, and acceleration. Vectors have components because they have both magnitude and direction. To represent a vector, we need separate components to specify each aspect of its direction and magnitude. These components are usually represented in terms of coordinates, like the x, y, and z coordinates, each corresponding to a specific direction. The need for components stems from the fact that one can break down any vector into its components, which are scalar multiples of unit vectors in the respective directions. On the other hand, scalars have no direction and are only characterized by their magnitude. Because scalars are unidirectional quantities, there is no need for components to describe their behavior, as there's no direction to quantify. Now, coming to the third question: \\"Do those questions have the same meaning? Available choices: [1] no; [2] yes,\\" let's analyze it. The first two questions are about the nature of scalars and vectors, asking for a basic definition, and exploring the reasons why vectors have components while scalars do not.

Firstly, the app's utility is undeniable. This package is pivotal to the Android ecosystem, offering a medley of functions that keeps your device functioning smoothly and connects various Google services. It ensures Google applications like Google Play, Maps, and others are updated and synchronised properly. Its functionality regarding the maintenance of other apps is a standout. Performance wise, it runs quite nicely in the background without consuming a large portion of system resources. The consistency it brings to my Android device is fairly commendable. However, it has its fair share of shortcomings. Occasionally, the app might cause excessive battery drain, which can be somewhat annoying. Furthermore, the lack of transparency around its operations can be puzzling for some users. It is not always clear what exactly the app is doing or why certain functions are necessary. Although it can be apparent when it falters (given it affects other applications), it's often unnoticed when it does its job right - a sign of good design but offers little user engagement. In conclusion, com.google.android.gms is a quintessential part of our Android devices, a 'silent hero' if I may say. However, it could serve its purpose better with some improvements in terms of power efficiency and clearer user communication.

Movie title: A Bittersweet Life Movie plot: Kim Sun-woo (Lee Byung-hun) is a high ranking mobster and enforcer for Kang (Kim Yeong-cheol), a cold and calculating crime boss to whom he is unquestionably loyal. The two share concerns over business tensions with Baek Dae-sik (Hwang Jung-min), a son from a rival family, which is when Kang assigns Sun-woo what is perceived to be a simple errand while he is away on a business trip â to shadow his young mistress, Hee-soo (Shin Min-ah), whom he fears is having an \\"affair\\" with another man, giving Sun-woo the mandate to kill her (and her paramour) if he manages to discover it. As he performs his duty â following Hee-soo, and escorting her to a music recital one day â he becomes quietly enthralled by the girl's beauty and innocence as glimpses into his lonely, empty personal life become more prevalent. When he does come to discover Hee-soo's lover directly in her home, he fiercely beats him and prepares to inform Kang, but his attraction to her causes him to hesitate. He thus spares the two on the condition that they no longer see each other again, earning him Hee-soo's enmity. Meanwhile, Sun-woo continues to be embroiled in personal business with Baek Dae-sik over having beaten up several of his henchmen earlier for overstaying their welcome at the hotel. He is then threatened by one of his enforcers to apologize, but he adamantly refuses, fueled by his frustrations over Hee-soo. As he relaxes in his apartment later one night, he is suddenly kidnapped by Baek's men to be tortured, but before they can do so they receive new orders via phone call and he is abruptly carried off to Kang, who has returned from overseas and has found out about his attempted cover-up of Hee-soo's affair. Kang's men torture him into confessing why he lied until he is left alone to think about his answer. A daring but messy escape follows, after which Sun-woo plans his revenge. Help from one of Sun-woo's loyal men provides him with money and new clothes to go about his plan: he secretly delivers Hee-soo a gift to make amends and... A:","completion":"In the movie \\"A Bittersweet Life,\\" Sun-woo (played by Lee Byung-hun) escorts Hee-soo (played by Shin Min-ah) to a music recital one day. He follows her and performs various tasks as assigned by his boss, Kang (played by Kim Yeong-cheol), who suspects Hee-soo of having an affair with another man. Sun-woo's duty is to monitor Hee-soo and determine if she is cheating, with a mandate to kill her and her alleged lover if he confirms the affair. Over the course of his surveillance, Sun-woo begins to be captivated by Hee-soo's beauty and innocence, which prompts him to reflect on his own isolated and empty personal life. When he ultimately discovers the evidence of Hee-soo's affair, Sun-woo struggles with the conflicting emotions his duty and his growing feelings for her evoke. Instead of following through with Kang's orders, Sun-woo spares Hee-soo and her lover's lives under the condition that they cease their relationship. This decision, driven by his attraction to Hee-soo, garners her resentment and sets off a series of events that further intertwine Sun-woo's personal and professional challenges. As Sun-woo navigates the escalating tensions between his mobster affiliation and his relationship with Hee-soo, viewers are presented with a thoughtful exploration of loyalty, human nature, and the consequences of our choices.

A: stay hungry B: cook pasta C: feed his guests Answer:","completion":"Remy decided to cook pasta in order to address his own hunger as well as the hunger of his guests. The context provided suggests that Remy was faced with a situation where both he and his guests were hungry, and as a considerate host, he wanted to ensure the needs of his guests were met. In this context, the best answer to the question \\"Why did Remy do this?\\" is option C: feed his guests. Option C is the most suitable answer because it takes into consideration the shared hunger between Remy and his guests. It implies that Remy's primary goal in cooking the pasta was to provide a meal that would satisfy everyone’s hunger and ensure his guests had a pleasant experience at his home. Additionally, the act of cooking pasta for his guests demonstrates Remy's hospitality and the notion that he prioritizes the well-being of his visitors. Option A - stay hungry - does not adequately answer the question as it contradicts the context provided. Staying hungry would not address the issue at hand, which is the shared hunger between Remy and his guests. To \\"stay hungry\\" would mean that no action was taken to resolve the situation. Option B - cook pasta - while it does represent the action that Remy took and indicates an effort to address the problem, it does not provide a comprehensive answer to why Remy did this. Cooking pasta was a means to an end, but it does not address the intent behind the action, which was to satisfy the hunger of both Remy and his guests and ensure their well-being during their visit.

Specifically, substantial efforts were made against the large ports of Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Sunderland on the English east coast. In Newcastle-upon-Tyne, on 9 April 1941, the German Luftflotte 2 deployed 120 bombers in a five-hour attack, dropping 150 tons of high explosives and 50,000 incendiaries. This intense bombardment resulted in extensive damage to sewer, rail, docklands, and electric installations, severely disrupting city’s infrastructural framework. The focus then shifted to Sunderland on 25 April, where once again, Luftflotte 2 orchestrated a bombing raid, with 60 bombers dropping 80 tons of high explosive and 9,000 incendiaries. The extensive bombing took a heavy toll on the city, causing significant damage and disruption. Following Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Sunderland, a further attack took place on the Clyde, at Greenock, on 6 and 7 May. The geographical spread and intensity of the attacks indicate that these regions were significant strategic targets based on their port status and potential to disrupt English maritime movements and cripple regional industry. Despite the massive scale of damage, these attacks by the Germans failed to prevent maritime movements or cripple the industry in these regions. These attacks, therefore, were focused on industrial areas that the Germans considered to be strategic targets in the north of England but failed to achieve their broader military objectives."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the band member who was upset when a past band member visited the studio and no one initially recognized him? After a tour of the UK performing Dark Side, Pink Floyd returned to the studio in January 1975 and began work on their ninth studio album, Wish You Were Here. Parsons declined an offer to continue working with them, becoming successful in his own right with the Alan Parsons Project, and so the band turned to Brian Humphries. Initially, they found it difficult to compose new material; the success of The Dark Side of the Moon had left Pink Floyd physically and emotionally drained. Wright later described these early sessions as \\"falling within a difficult period\\" and Waters found them \\"tortuous\\". Gilmour was more interested in improving the band's existing material. Mason's failing marriage left him in a general malaise and with a sense of apathy, both of which interfered with his drumming.Despite the lack of creative direction, Waters began to visualise a new concept after several weeks. During 1974, Pink Floyd had sketched out three original compositions and had performed them at a series of concerts in Europe. These compositions became the starting point for a new album whose opening four-note guitar phrase, composed purely by chance by Gilmour, reminded Waters of Barrett. The songs provided a fitting summary of the rise and fall of their former bandmate. Waters commented: \\"Because I wanted to get as close as possible to what I felt ... [that] indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd.\\"While Pink Floyd were working on the album, Barrett made an impromptu visit to the studio. Thorgerson recalled that he \\"sat round and talked for a bit, but he wasn't really there\\". He had changed significantly in appearance, so much so that the band did not initially recognise him.

Information: - Leeches are segmented worms that belong to the phylum Annelida and comprise the subclass Hirudinea. Like the oligochaetes, such as earthworms, leeches share a clitellum and are hermaphrodites. Nevertheless, they differ from the oligochaetes in significant ways. For example, leeches do not have bristles and the external segmentation of their bodies does not correspond with the internal segmentation of their organs. Their bodies are much more solid as the spaces in their coelom are dense with connective tissues. They also have two suckers, one at each end. - Euhirudinea, the true leeches, are an infraclass of the Hirudinea. These clitellate annelids are of somewhat unclear relationships; namely the relationships of Hirudinea with oligochaetes are in need of revision. It may be that the presumed sister taxon of the Euhirudinea, the Acanthobdellidea, turns out to be more distantly related, as was already the case with the Branchiobdellida. Thus, eventually Euhirudinea might become a junior synonym of Hirudinea. - The proboscisless leeches, Arhynchobdellida, are classified as an order of the Hirudinea. But leech taxonomy and systematics will eventually be revised in due time, not because there are many uncertainties about their phylogeny, but because the major clades of clitellate annelids - and whether the clitellates are themselves a clade - have not been fully elucidated. For example, the \\"true leeches\\" (Euhirudinea) might actually be synonymous with the Hirudinea, as all other leech-like annelids might not be very closely related to the true leeches. - Anatomy. Form and function. Depending on the species, an adult earthworm can be from long and wide to long and over wide, but the typical \\"Lumbricus terrestris\\" grows to about long. - In biology, a hermaphrodite is an organism that has reproductive organs normally associated with both male and female sexes. Many taxonomic groups of animals (mostly invertebrates) do not have separate sexes. In these groups, hermaphroditism is a normal condition, enabling a form of sexual reproduction in which either partner can act as the \\"female\\" or \\"male\\". For example, the great majority of tunicates, pulmonate snails, opisthobranch snails and slugs are hermaphrodites. Hermaphroditism is also found in some fish species and to a lesser degree in other vertebrates. Most plants are also hermaphrodites. - A clade (from , \\"klados\\", \\"branch\\") is a group of organisms that consists of a common ancestor and all its lineal descendants, and represents a single \\"branch\\" on the \\"tree of life\\". - The Hirudiniformes are one of the currently - accepted suborders of the proboscisless leeches ( Arhynchobdellida ) . Their most well - known member is the European Medical Leech , Hirudo medicinalis , and indeed most of the blood - sucking \`\` worms '' as which leeches are generally perceived belong to this group . In general , though some leeches suck blood , many are predators which hunt small invertebrates . The Arhynchobdellida were formerly divided into two groups , denoted by presence or absence of toothed jaws . But this does not represent a natural division , as has now been determined - the most primitive proboscisless leeches are not found among the jawed blood - sucking forms as was generally believed , but among the jawless predators . \`\` Jawed leeches '' - termed \`\` Gnathobdellae '' or \`\` Gnathobdellida '' - are exclusively found among the Hirudiniformes , but the order contains a number of jawless families as well . The jawed , toothed forms make up the aquatic Hirudidae and the terrestrial Haemadipsidae and Xerobdellidae ( sometimes included in the preceding but worthy of recognition as an independent family ) . These might actually form a clade , which would then be placed at superfamily rank , but it seems that the Hirudidae might rather be close relatives of the carnivorous Haemopidae instead . Many of the most well - known leeches belong to this family , most notably the medical leeches , such as the European species , already mentioned , which is prominent among these . Other medical Hirudiniformes of lesser importance are for example other species of the genus Hirudo , the North American Medical Leech ( Macrobdella decora ) , and the Asian Medical Leech ( Hirudinaria manillensis ) . Among the better - known bloodsucking land leeches are the Indian Leech ( Haemadipsa sylvestris ) and the yamabiru or Japanese Mountain Leech ( Haemadipsa zeylanica ) . - The clitellum is a thickened glandular and non-segmented section of the body wall near the head in earthworms and leeches, that secretes a viscid sac in which the eggs are deposited. It is present about behind the anterior end of the body (around the 14th, 15th and 16th segments). Its main function is to store the eggs of the worm. - The coelom (, plural coeloms or coelomata ) (from \\"koîlos\\", hollow, cavity) is the main body cavity in most animals and is positioned inside the body to surround and contain the digestive tract and other organs. In developed animals, it is lined with a mesodermal epithelium. In other animals, such as molluscs, it remains undifferentiated. - Biological systematics is the study of the diversification of living forms, both past and present, and the relationships among living things through time. Relationships are visualized as evolutionary trees (synonyms: cladograms, phylogenetic trees, phylogenies). Phylogenies have two components, branching order (showing group relationships) and branch length (showing amount of evolution). Phylogenetic trees of species and higher taxa are used to study the evolution of traits (e.g., anatomical or molecular characteristics) and the distribution of organisms (biogeography). Systematics, in other words, is used to understand the evolutionary history of life on Earth. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'instance of' with 'taxon'.

I have a new situation: Jacob is performing a chemistry experiment using two different liquids. Before starting the experiment, Jacob is told that liquid A molecules have strong intermolecular forces, while liquid B molecules have weak intermolecular forces. Jacob now has to decide how to use this information to guide him as he develops the experimental procedures for these two liquids. But I can use this background: Vapor pressure is a measure of the pressure exerted by a gas above a liquid in a sealed container. While viscosity and surface tension increase as the strength of intermolecular forces increase, vapor pressure decreases . This is because the stronger the intermolecular forces are, the harder it is for liquid molecules to escape into the gas phase. Vapor pressure a measure of how much of a substance is in the gas phase when that substance is at equilibrium; that is, the number of molecules in the gas and liquid phases are not changing. The more molecules that are able to escape into the gas phase, the higher the vapor pressure. Vapor pressure is also proportional to temperature. As temperature increases, vapor pressure also increases. What is an answer for this question: Which liquid will have lower viscosity? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, we can deduce the answer step-by-step: Step 1: Identify the relationship between intermolecular forces and viscosity. From the given background, we know that viscosity increases as the strength of intermolecular forces increases. Step 2: Determine the intermolecular forces in the liquids. We are told that liquid A molecules have strong intermolecular forces, while liquid B molecules have weak intermolecular forces. Step 3: Apply the relationship between intermolecular forces and viscosity to the liquids. Since liquid A has strong intermolecular forces, it will have a higher viscosity. Conversely, liquid B, with its weak intermolecular forces, will have a lower viscosity. Step 4: Answer the question. Liquid B will have lower viscosity due to its weak intermolecular forces."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the review provided by the customer, it is evident that they were dissatisfied with the product in question, which seems to be a film. There are various indications within the review that point towards a negative experience and disappointment with the film's content and presentation. Firstly, the customer has titled the review \\"Forgettable,\\" which suggests that the film did not leave a lasting impression, and they found it to be unremarkable and easily forgettable. This is a clear indication of dissatisfaction, as a praiseworthy or satisfying product would typically leave the consumer with positive memories or a favorable impression. Secondly, the customer used strong negative language such as \\"self-indulgent,\\" \\"unnecessary,\\" \\"misguided,\\" and \\"yawn\\" to describe the film. These words express dissatisfaction with the film's execution, as the customer seemed to find it pretentious, boring, and not living up to its intended message. Moreover, the customer makes a specific point about the film being a \\"dull, almost silly, attempt to present a 'serious' philosophical piece.\\" This statement indicates that they felt the film failed to meet its intended goals and did not deliver the thought-provoking experience it set out to achieve. As a result, the product did not meet the customer's expectation, thus leading to dissatisfaction. Finally, the customer's statement, \\"I can't say anymore, mainly because I'm boring myself with the effort,\\" demonstrates that they are so dissatisfied with the film that discussing it further would be a tedious effort. This statement further highlights the customer's disinterest and negative experience with the product. In conclusion, the customer's review of the film clearly exhibits a strong level of dissatisfaction due to its forgettable nature, negative language used to describe the product, criticism of the film's intentions, and the lack of enthusiasm for further discussion. All these factors combined reveal a dissatisfied customer and a less-than-positive experience with the product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write highlights for this article: Tyler Perry has, for the first time, revealed graphic details about the sexual, physical and emotional abuse he says he suffered as a child. \\"I'm tired of holding this in,\\" Tyler Perry wrote on his Web site, \\"... so I've decided to give some away.\\" Perry recounts in a message posted on his Web site and in an e-mail to fans that a prescreening of the film \\"Precious,\\" due out later this year, dislodged \\"some raw emotions and brought me to some things and places in my life that I needed to deal with but had long forgotten. It brought back memories so strong that I can smell and taste them.\\" Perry is an executive producer of the movie, which tells the tale of Claireece \\"Precious\\" Jones, an illiterate, obese 16-year-old girl from Harlem who is emotionally and physically abused. The 40-year-old producer says he can identify with the character, and he recalls a number of incidents from his childhood. Emmitt Perry Sr., a construction worker, uttered profane insults at him and relentlessly beat and belittled him, Perry says. The random, violent beatings were commonplace until Perry was 19, he said. \\"You ... jackass! You got book sense but you ain't got no ... common sense,\\" he quotes his father as saying. \\"I heard this every day of my childhood,\\" says Perry. Attempts to reach Emmitt Perry Sr. for comment were unsuccessful. Tyler Perry was born Emmitt Perry Jr. but changed his name to distance himself from his father. One night when his mother was gone, Perry says, his drunken father \\"got the vacuum cleaner extension cord and trapped me in a room and beat me until the skin was coming off my back.\\" Perry says that while at a playmate's house when he was about 10 years old, his friend's scantily clad mother locked the friend in the bathroom and told Perry to leave. \\"I was at the front door trying to get out, when she came in and laid on the sofa and asked me if I wanted the key. I told her I had to go home as it was getting dark. \\"She put the key inside of herself and told me to come get it, pulling me on top of her,\\" Perry writes on his site. Perry said he was sickly as a child, and that made his father angry. His grandmother contended the family was wasting money on allergy shots. She said Perry had germs on him. One day when Perry's mother was away, he said, his grandmother decided \\"to kill those germs on me once and for all. She gave me a bath in ammonia.\\" The violence in the home caused Perry's mother to pack up the car with him and his sisters and drive from Louisiana to California. Her husband reported the car stolen, and the family members went to jail until the father came to get them. Perry said his father beat his mother all the way home. The producer said he got through by turning to God, and he forgave his tormentors to help himself heal. Perry, who previously has spoken publicly in more general terms about his childhood abuse, explains his latest revelations this way: \\"I'm tired of holding this in. I don't know what to do with it anymore, so I've decided to give some away.\\" In October 2008, he told Ebony magazine: \\"I tell people, if you're thinking about suicide, all that stuff I've attempted and thought about it. If you think about it, life gets better. The key to life when it gets tough is to keep moving. Just keep moving.\\" Perry also is the writer, director and actor in boisterous comedies such as \\"Madea's Family Reunion\\" and \\"I Can Do Bad All By Myself.\\"","completion":"Renowned media mogul Tyler Perry has recently shared, in a brutally honest account, the harrowing details of the sexual, physical, and emotional abuse he faced as a child. He explained that watching the film \\"Precious\\", which he was involved in as an executive producer, brought back memories so intense that they felt palpable. The movie's central character, Claireece \\"Precious\\" Jones, is an illiterate, obese teenage girl facing severe abuse, with whom Perry feels a deep connection. Perry traces the abuse back to his childhood, where his father, Emmitt Perry Sr., a construction worker, would relentlessly brutalize and belittle him. This continued until he was 19 years old. Perry changed his name and distanced himself from his father, highlighting one particular incident that illustrated the severity of the beatings he received. In one incident, his father used a vacuum cleaner extension cord to whip him, causing the skin on his back to peel off. Perry also recounts a sickening episode of sexual abuse that occurred when he was just 10 years old. His friend's half-naked mother locked the friend in the bathroom and proceeded to force Perry into a sexually abusive encounter. This type of abuse, coupled with his father's violence, led Perry to suffer from poor health and constant sickness in his childhood, which only served to fuel his father's fury. His grandmother believed this to be the result of germs, and in one traumatic event, she forcibly bathed him in ammonia to eliminate the so-called germs. Recognizing the violence in their household, Perry's mother attempted to escape with her children from Louisiana to California. However, their journey ended prematurely due to the car being reported stolen by Perry's father. The family ended up in jail, where Perry's father eventually picked them up. Perry stated that the entire drive back to Louisiana was filled with violence as his father beat his mother. Despite enduring such unimaginable pain and suffering, Perry managed to survive and persevere by turning to God and seeking solace in his faith. By forgiving his abusers, Perry was able to heal and move forward with his life. His strength and determination are now channeled into his work and success, serving as an important message to others that life can and does improve, even in the darkest of times."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: T HE CLOSER THE STATE of Oklahoma comes to killing Richard Glossip, the more evidence emerges to suggest the state is preparing to murder an innocent man. On Monday, Glossip’s legal team released dozens of pages of documents that cast new doubt on his already questionable conviction. At a press conference in front of the Oklahoma State Capitol, defense attorney Don Knight called on Gov. Mary Fallin to issue a stay of execution in order to consider the materials, which include newly obtained affidavits from people with varying connections to the case. The collection provides new context to the flawed case against Glossip, lending credence to his claims of innocence and further exposing leads police failed to pursue and information jurors never heard at either of his two trials. Yet thus far the state appears unmoved. On Monday Oklahoma City District Attorney David Prater called the press conference — which included famed anti-death penalty activist Sister Helen Prejean — “a bullshit PR campaign.” Glossip remains set to die at 3 p.m. Wednesday. As The Intercept has reported, Glossip was twice tried and sentenced to die for the 1997 killing of his boss, Barry Van Treese, in a grisly crime the state prosecuted as a murder for hire. His conviction hinged on the testimony of a man named Justin Sneed, who admitted he beat Van Treese to death with a baseball bat, but claimed that Glossip, his supervisor at the time, coerced him into committing the crime in exchange for money and job security. Sneed said Glossip was afraid Van Treese was going to fire him from his position managing the Best Budget Inn, the seedy Oklahoma City motel where they worked, so Glossip convinced Sneed to kill him. But there was no corroborating evidence to back up Sneed’s story — no physical evidence linked Glossip to the crime — and transcripts show how Oklahoma City police detectives steered Sneed toward implicating Glossip during his interrogation. Sneed’s story has evolved considerably over the years — today there is mounting evidence to show that Sneed, afraid of being sentenced to die, was compelled to point the finger at Glossip in order to save himself. Particularly damning are the words of Sneed’s own grown daughter, O’Ryan Justine Sneed, who last year wrote a letter to the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board asking it to spare Glossip, saying that her dad was considering recanting his testimony, which now threatened the life of an innocent man. Justine Sneed has refused to talk about the case beyond the letter, even as Sneed’s own mother has since raised doubts about the state’s official story. But as Glossip’s execution nears, others have been emboldened to speak out. The affidavits released by Glossip’s lawyers on Monday come from individuals who undermine the claims of some of the prosecution’s key players — not only of Sneed, but also those of the police detectives who elicited Sneed’s confession. One affidavit comes from 27-year-old Michael G. Scott, who after watching an August episode of Dr. Phil that focused on the case, contacted Glossip’s attorney Don Knight. Scott describes how he met Justin Sneed in 2006, while incarcerated at Joseph Harp Correctional Facility, a medium security prison in Lexington, Oklahoma. (State records confirm that Scott was first convicted and jailed in Oklahoma just before his 18th birthday, in 2005. He left prison in 2010.) Scott says he lived in a cell across from Sneed, who spoke “on more than one occasion” about how he had implicated Glossip in Van Treese’s murder in order to save himself. “Among all the inmates, it was common knowledge that Justin Sneed lied and sold Richard Glossip up the river,” Scott told a private investigator. He recalled a specific instance when Sneed was “fixing some food, and laughing with (other prisoners) about setting Richard Glossip up for a crime Richard didn’t do.” Scott said he never told anyone what he heard — “Honestly, there seemed to be many other things that I saw or heard that were much worse” — but upon seeing the case on TV this summer, “I realized just how important this information was,” and decided to come forward. Another affidavit comes from a man named Johnny Lombardi, who worked as a defense attorney in Oklahoma between 2006 and 2013 and caught wind of Glossip’s impending execution while doing post-conviction work on a separate, unrelated case. That case involves a man named Marty Williams, currently serving life without parole for a 1991 murder in Oklahoma City, a crime he swears he did not commit. The lead police detectives in Williams’ case were the same pair who got Justin Sneed to implicate Richard Glossip in the murder of Barry Van Treese: Oklahoma City Police Detectives Bob Bemo and William Cook. In his affidavit, Lombardi says Williams told him Bemo and Cook interrogated him using “coercive techniques,” threatening him with the death penalty and refusing to let him use the restroom to the point where he “was forced to urinate on himself.” Lombardi further says that, according to Williams, Bemo and Cook had previously tried to blame him for a different unsolved murder years earlier, “despite the fact there was neither any physical evidence or direct witness observation” to link him to the crime. Finally, Lombardi describes a recent interview with a different incarcerated individual, who claimed that Bemo and Cook had “a reputation for police tactics in that neighborhood in order to obtain confessions” and that Williams had been wrongfully convicted — “set up by the police.” Regardless of happened to Williams, of course, his claims do not prove police misconduct in Glossip’s case. And it remains unclear why Bemo or Cook would want to pin the murder of Barry Van Treese on Glossip when they already had a suspect in custody, Sneed, who admitted he carried it out. (Bemo has not responded to multiple emails and Cook is deceased.) But Lombardi’s affidavit is bolstered by Dr. Richard Leo, PhD, an expert on police interrogation tactics who has written extensively about false confessions and who reviewed Sneed’s interrogation transcripts. In a 13-page affidavit signed on September 9, Dr. Leo stressed that the notion that Glossip had masterminded the murder “first came from investigators, not Justin Sneed.” The transcripts show how police “feed Justin Sneed their theory that Richard Glossip was the mastermind of this homicide.” Such tactics, he states, “are substantially likely to increase the eliciting of false statements.” T HE STATE OF OKLAHOMA has repeatedly said that, regardless of any last-minute claims by his supporters, the courts have had their say in the case of Richard Glossip. But the same could be said for the 10 people who have been exonerated from Oklahoma’s death row — as The Intercept reported this summer, four of them were sent to die partly on the basis of false snitch testimony. What’s more, as in many such cases, much of the evidence now coming to light never made it to court. They are bits and pieces of information that should have been uncovered, if not by police in 1997, then certainly by Glossip’s defense attorneys before trial. One critical component comes from a man who could have undermined Sneed’s credibility on the stand by showing that Sneed lied about the extent of his drug use in the months leading up to Van Treese’s murder. An affidavit signed by a former drug dealer named Richard Barrett challenges the state’s characterization of Sneed as a hapless kid who was entirely under Glossip’s control, suggesting a more logical basis for why Sneed might have killed Van Treese. In its opening argument at Glossip’s 2004 trial, the state cast Sneed as a simple drifter — a man of limited intelligence who “didn’t want money or need money,” as prosecutor Connie Smothermon told the jury. Sneed, who first arrived in Oklahoma City as part of a roofing crew from Texas, admitted on the stand that he quit that job because of his burgeoning drug use, but he said he just used marijuana — “and a little bit of crank.” But according to Barrett, who says he dealt drugs several times per week at the Best Budget Inn, Sneed regularly shot meth with a needle in Room 102, the same room where he would later kill Van Treese. Barrett said he saw Sneed’s drug use firsthand — and that he often saw him “tweaking,” a sign that someone is high on meth. He also said that Sneed was stealing from the motel, its parking lot, and the surrounding area, in order to pay for his meth habit. Sneed traded everything from food stamps to car stereos to a nickel-plated .38 handgun for the drug, Barrett states. Such thieving was common among the addicts he knew, Barrett adds, saying many would “do anything to get more of the drug, even kill.” “Based on my own experience,” Barrett says in his affidavit, “I believe Justin Sneed was addicted to methamphetamine in a bad way.” Barrett’s affidavit also introduces another regular at the Best Budget Inn who was apparently never questioned by police (the Oklahoma City Police Department refused to release its records in the case): Richard Glossip’s brother, Bobby, who facilitated Barrett’s drug dealing at the motel. The Glossip brothers, Barrett said, did not seem to get along. Richard had nothing to do with Bobby’s drug business; when Richard would come to Room 102, “He mostly came to tell us to quiet down.” Glossip has told The Intercept that while “Bobby and me used to be pretty close when we were younger,” they were not at the time of the murder. Glossip knew Bobby was dealing drugs, including to Sneed. “Unfortunately, my brother was the one selling to him,” Glossip said this summer. While Sneed’s drug addiction does not itself provide a basis for murder, Barrett’s description of meth users as paranoid thieves who can turn violent on a dime was affirmed by San Francisco psychiatrist Pablo Stewart, who provided yet another affidavit to Glossip’s legal team. Stewart said that when used intravenously, as Barrett claims Sneed did regularly, meth produces symptoms such as those “consistent” with a person suffering from a psychotic episode — they become “prone to frenzied actions that can lead to ‘overkill’ behaviors.” In one of his first versions of the story upon being interrogated by police, Sneed said he had only meant to knock out Barry Van Treese in order to steal money from him — not kill him. Even if Sneed was trying to downplay his culpability to police, Stewart states in his affidavit that he considers this to be a plausible scenario — “a person under the influence of methamphetamine, or suffering from the psychotic symptoms caused by long term use, will use a baseball bat and beat a victim to death in a frenzy, even if the intent is just to knock that person out with one blow.” If such expert opinion sounds a bit too neatly tailored now, it is precisely the sort of testimony that should have been presented by Glossip’s attorneys at trial. Barrett, too, might have been a critical witness. He says he failed to come forward until now because he had heard that his fingerprints were found in Room 102 and he feared he would be implicated in the murder. It was a call from his own mother that convinced him to finally tell Glossip’s lawyers what he knew. W ITH GLOSSIP’S EXECUTION one day away, a coalition of supporters spent Tuesday in Oklahoma City, holding a vigil and publicly urging Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin to spare Glossip’s life. Glossip’s defense team has sent a letter to Fallin outlining additional evidence they are currently seeking in order to clear their client, and asking for a 60-day stay in order to pursue it. “Since we began investigating this case,” they write, “and once publicly highlighting it, we have received tip after tip — telephone messages at 1:00 a.m., and emails at all hours. Such information is still pouring in, but we have not been able to investigate all of it.” Their fear, they say, is that a critical tip “may later prove innocence, but too late.” “We respectfully request the opportunity to avoid that tragedy.” The Next to Die, an initiative by the Marshall Project, provides a countdown to upcoming executions. ||||| OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Attorneys for an Oklahoma death row inmate are making a last-minute effort to spare their client's life just hours before his scheduled execution, arguing they have new evidence to support his claim that he was framed.

(Associated Press) Richard Eugene Glossip's attorneys asked the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals late Tuesday to stop his lethal injection, saying they uncovered new details in the case, including a signed affidavit from an inmate who served time with Justin Sneed, who also was convicted of the killing and is serving a life sentence. \\"We're asking for a stay of execution to give the court more time to review this new evidence, which we think casts grave doubt on Richard's guilt,\\" said Mark Henricksen, one of Glossip's attorneys. Glossip, 52, is scheduled to be executed Wednesday afternoon at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. He was convicted of ordering the 1997 beating death of Barry Van Treese, who owned the motel where Glossip worked. Sneed was the prosecution's key witness and testified that Glossip masterminded the killing because he was afraid Van Treese was about to fire him for embezzling money and poorly managing the motel. Sneed was sentenced to life in prison in exchange for his testimony. A fellow inmate, Michael Scott, said in an affidavit that he heard Sneed say \\"he set Richard Glossip up, and that Richard Glossip didn't do anything.\\" Glossip maintained his innocence Tuesday in a brief telephone interview with The Associated Press and said he remains optimistic his lethal injection will be halted. \\"They'll never take that from me,\\" Glossip said. \\"I'll hope for the best. I won't let it bring me down. \\"If you've got to go out... you don't want to be bitter and angry about it.\\" Glossip's case has drawn attention from death penalty opponents, and his family and supporters rallied Tuesday at the Oklahoma Capitol. They want Republican Gov. Mary Fallin to issue a 60-day stay to give Glossip's attorneys more time to investigate new leads. But the governor said in a statement Wednesday that she remains convinced of Glossip's guilt, and \\"after carefully reviewing the facts of this case multiple times\\" has no plans to issue a stay. Among his supporters is Hollywood actress Susan Sarandon, who played a nun in the movie \\"Dead Man Walking.\\" The woman Sarandon portrayed, anti-death penalty advocate Sister Helen Prejean, serves as Glossip's spiritual adviser and plans to attend his execution Wednesday. Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater, whose office prosecuted Glossip before Prater was elected, said he's reviewed boxes of evidence and is convinced of Glossip's guilt. \\"Mr. Van Treese would not be dead but for Mr. Glossip offering what Mr. Sneed thought was half of 10,000 to kill Barry Van Treese,\\" Prater said. \\"(Glossip) set everything into motion.\\" Van Treese's wife, Donna, wrote in a letter to Oklahoma's Pardon and Parole Board last year that the loss of her husband has been devastating to her and her family. \\"As the wife, I lost the most important person to me: my husband and the father to my children,\\" Donna Van Treese wrote. \\"I have had a very hard time just moving on one day at a time, and physically I have been under more stress than any one person should endure in a lifetime.\\" Glossip's execution is scheduled for 3 p.m. Wednesday. Department of Corrections spokeswoman Terri Watkins said the time was moved from 6 p.m. so the process didn't disrupt a shift change and meal time at the facility, and so that media and execution witnesses would be off the prison grounds before dark. ___ Follow Sean Murphy at www.twitter.com/apseanmurphy ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"In Oklahoma, Richard Glossip, a man whose case is full of doubts, is scheduled to be executed soon. Glossip was convicted of ordering the 1997 killing of his boss, Barry Van Treese, but his conviction was based on the testimony of a man named Justin Sneed, who admitted he killed Van Treese with a baseball bat. Sneed claimed that Glossip, his supervisor at the time, forced him to commit the crime in exchange for money and job security. However, there was no corroborating evidence to support Sneed's story and no physical evidence linking Glossip to the crime. A fellow inmate, Michael Scott, said in an affidavit that he heard Sneed say \\"he set Richard Glossip up, and that Richard Glossip didn't do anything.\\" Glossip's supporters are asking for a stay of execution in order to give more time to review the new evidence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Therefore, you should not validate the suggested answer. A more detailed and appropriate answer should include the following information: Poison dart frogs, belonging to the family Dendrobatidae, are primarily found in the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. Their habitat ranges from countries like Nicaragua and Costa Rica in Central America, to regions including the Amazon rainforest, the Andean slopes, and the Guiana Shield in South America. The range of habitats extends across countries such as Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Suriname, Guyana, and French Guiana. They can also be found on some islands near the mainland, including Trinidad, Tobago, and the Isla del Coco. These small, brightly colored amphibians thrive in the humid and wet environments of rainforests, where they can be found in various microhabitats such as leaf litter on the forest floor, tree branches, or near streams and small water bodies. Their vibrant coloration serves as a warning to predators, as many poison dart frog species secrete toxic alkaloids through their skin. In conclusion, if you need to provide a more accurate and detailed answer to the question, you should mention that poison dart frogs are primarily found in the tropical rainforests of Central and South America, including countries such as Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, and several others in the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: With almost two years left of my law degree, and with no intention of doing anything so idiotic as actually attending lectures or studying law, I had plenty of time to come up with my next bid for online fame. The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation. My days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week. And with that, The Friday Thing was born. To promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday. We created an official website explaining our demands, registered a web address - letsgetitoff.com (snigger) - and sent a press release to the media. Clearly we had tapped into a seam of strong feeling among the nation's overworked... Why did narrator had plenty of time? - not enough information - He was a school magazine publisher - He had no intention of studying - He was famous The answer is:","completion":"The narrator had plenty of time for several reasons. Firstly, he mentions that he had no intention of attending lectures or studying law during the remaining two years of his law degree. By not dedicating time to his studies, he freed up a significant amount of time for pursuing other interests and projects. Secondly, his background as a school magazine publisher had taught him the challenges and time-consuming nature of printing and distributing physical magazines. With this experience, he was able to recognize the potential benefits and efficiencies of creating an online magazine, as opposed to a traditional print publication. Moreover, the narrator had already gained some fame through his previous online ventures such as the Zingin.com newsletter. This fame not only provided him with the platform to pursue new creative projects but also established connections with influential people in the comedy industry, such as Charlie Skelton. These connections allowed the narrator to brainstorm and develop ideas for new projects with other talented individuals, which ultimately led them to conceive the idea of The Friday Thing. Overall, the narrator's disinterest in his law studies, his experience in the publishing world, and his established fame and connections within the creative industry provided him with ample time and opportunity to come up with new ideas and projects for attaining further online fame. This abundance of time and resources was essential in allowing him and his collaborators to create and promote their new project, The Friday Thing, an innovative and entertaining weekly comedy ezine tailored for the Internet generation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Options: - closet - hallway - hot room - home - office Explain why a human would choose \\"office\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"office\\" as the answer to the question above because the situation described takes place within an office environment. The electric fan, as a personal item, was placed on the desk and was causing disturbance due to its loud noise. Since the office is the location where the issue occurred and where the other affected people are, it makes sense to directly address the problem there by turning off the fan. The other options – closet, hallway, hot room, and home – are not as appropriate. Turning off the fan in a closet would imply that the user would need to physically move the fan into the closet, which is impractical and does not directly address the problem. Similarly, moving it to the hallway or hot room would not sufficiently resolve the issue, as it would still be located within the shared work environment. As for 'home,' turning off the fan at home might solve the noise issue for the day, but it wouldn't be practical in the long term. The fan's owner would presumably still need the fan on hot days or if they're feeling warm. Therefore, the best choice is to turn off the fan in the office, where the noise is an immediate nuisance.

The ground-attack aircraft of the USAF are designed to attack targets on the ground and are often deployed as close air support for, and in proximity to, U.S. ground forces. The proximity to friendly forces require precision strikes from these aircraft that are not possible with bomber aircraft listed below. They are typically deployed as close air support to ground forces, their role is tactical rather than strategic, operating at the front of the battle rather than against targets deeper in the enemy's rear. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What part of a battle line are the precision strike aircraft of the USAF deployed?","completion":"The precision strike aircraft of the United States Air Force (USAF) are typically deployed along the front lines and close to friendly ground forces during battles, providing close air support (CAS) and tactical assistance. The primary mission of these ground-attack aircraft is to target enemy positions, vehicles, and infrastructure, while minimizing the risk of collateral damage or friendly fire incidents. To achieve this level of precision, these aircraft are equipped with advanced targeting systems and specialized weaponry. In general, the precision strike aircraft of the USAF are deployed in the following areas of a battle line: 1. Forward Edge of the Battle Area (FEBA) - This is the foremost part of the battle line where friendly and enemy forces engage in direct combat. Precision strike aircraft are often called upon to deliver CAS and engage high-priority targets in this area, such as enemy bunkers, artillery positions, and armored vehicles, to give friendly forces a tactical advantage. 2. Close Proximity to Friendly Ground Forces - Since close air support is a critical role for ground-attack aircraft, they are frequently deployed in close proximity to friendly ground forces. This allows the aircraft to react quickly to changing battlefield conditions and effectively coordinate with ground troops to identify and target enemy forces. 3. Battle Lines' Immediate Rear Areas - While the primary role of precision strike aircraft is to provide CAS, they may also be used to engage enemy forces just beyond the front lines. This could include targeting enemy reinforcement routes, supply lines, and command and control centers to disrupt enemy operations and weaken their ability to fight. Additionally, precision strike aircraft may be deployed to provide close air support for special operations forces conducting deep-strike missions or operating far behind enemy lines. These missions often require a high level of precision and coordination with ground units to avoid detection and successfully eliminate critical enemy targets. In conclusion, the precision strike aircraft of the USAF are deployed along the battle lines, primarily at the Forward Edge of the Battle Area, in close proximity to friendly ground forces, and in the immediate rear of the battle lines to provide critical close air support, engage high-priority targets, and minimize the risk of collateral damage and friendly fire incidents."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Rumble in the Bronx Movie plot: Ma Hon Keung (Jackie Chan), is a Hong Kong cop who comes to New York to attend the wedding of his Uncle, Bill (Bill Tung) and Whitney. The couple are in the process of selling their successful multicultural supermarket to Elaine (Anita Mui). Keung soon finds himself defending those around him against the actions of a biker gang, led by Tony (Marc Akerstream), but becomes targeted. Among them is Nancy (FranÃ§oise Yip), a lingerie model/dancer and the elder sister of Danny (Morgan Lam), whom Keung befriends after being introduced by his neighbour, Uncle Bill. Realising the errors of her ways, a relationship forms between Nancy and Keung, but the small-time gangsters become the victims of a much larger and more effective criminal syndicate led by White Tiger (Kris Lord), when a member named Angelo (Garvin Cross) steals illegal diamonds after a deal goes bad. Both Keung and the gang find themselves coming to a truce as they try to overcome the syndicate, who are determined to retrieve the diamonds by any means. Answer:","completion":"A Hong Kong cop in the movie titled \\"Rumble in the Bronx\\" is the protagonist Ma Hon Keung, portrayed by Jackie Chan. The film revolves around Ma Hon Keung's adventures in New York City as he gets entangled in various conflicts while attending his uncle's wedding. The movie plot centers around Ma Hon Keung being drawn into personal battles against the members of a biker gang led by Tony (Marc Akerstream), who have been causing trouble in the neighborhood. Keung's actions in defending the people around him make him a target for the gang, and he also crosses paths with Nancy (Françoise Yip), a lingerie model/dancer, and her younger brother Danny (Morgan Lam). Through their interactions, Keung and Nancy form a relationship, and Nancy starts to see the errors of her ways. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the biker gang's actions are more than just small-time criminal activities—they are actually involved with a larger, more dangerous criminal syndicate led by White Tiger (Kris Lord). The situation escalates when Angelo (Garvin Cross), a member of the syndicate, steals illegal diamonds after a deal goes sour, prompting the organization to take drastic measures in order to recover the precious stones. In this complex web of crime, betrayal, and violence, Keung and the biker gang find themselves in an unlikely truce as they attempt to take on the powerful syndicate together. It is through their unified efforts that they may have a chance to expose White Tiger's operation and, in the process, navigate their own personal crises and transformation. To determine whether investing in this film proposal is worth it, you should consider the following factors: 1. The genre and target audience: \\"Rumble in the Bronx\\" falls into the action-comedy genre and will likely appeal to a wide range of viewers, including fans of Hong Kong cinema, Jackie Chan enthusiasts, and action-comedy fans in general. 2. The cast: The film features a notable cast, most prominently Jackie Chan, who was already an established martial artist and actor in the international market by the time the movie was released. Other cast members like Anita Mui and Françoise Yip bring additional star power to the film. 3. The storyline and themes: The film's plot weaves together elements of action, comedy, and drama to create a compelling story of personal growth, unlikely alliances, and high-stakes conflict. These themes may resonate with viewers looking for both entertainment and deeper meaning in their film choices. 4. The budget and potential for return on investment: Consider the overall production costs (e.g., locations, special effects, stunts, etc.) and compare them against expected box office returns and other revenue streams (e.g., streaming deals, DVD sales, merchandise, etc.) to assess if the investment is likely to yield a solid return. 5. The film's marketing strategy: An effective marketing campaign will be crucial in generating awareness, buzz, and ultimately ticket sales for the movie. Evaluate the proposed marketing strategy and consider whether it's apt to reach the intended audience and generate excitement for the film. By carefully analyzing these factors, you can make an informed decision about whether or not to invest in the film proposal for \\"Rumble in the Bronx.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Olivia, who initially tries to resist falling for Dougy, finds herself drawn to him as they have a series of coincidental encounters in the neighborhood.

One day, Olivia's best friend, Sarah, reveals that she has been researching Dougy's mysterious past and shares her findings.

He reveals that his muse was a former love whose life was ruined by the media frenzy surrounding their relationship. Devastated by the consequences of his fame, Dougy retreated from the public eye and struggled to find inspiration again. Act 4: Touched by his vulnerability and willingness to share such a deeply personal story, Olivia empathizes with Dougy's struggles. It becomes clear to Olivia that Dougy's enigmatic nature was not a deliberate attempt to deceive, but rather a means to protect himself from further heartbreak and chaos.

Together, they find inspiration in one another as Dougy refines his artistic talents and Olivia pens her greatest love story yet.

The green jersey is a distinctive racing jersey worn by the leader in a subsidiary competition. - The Tour de France is an annual multiple stage bicycle race primarily held in France, while also occasionally making passes through nearby countries. The race was first organized in 1903 to increase sales for the newspaper \\"L'Auto\\"; which is currently run by the Amaury Sport Organisation. The race has been held annually since its first edition in 1903 except when it was stopped for the two World Wars. As the Tour gained prominence and popularity the race was lengthened and its reach began to extend around the globe. Participation expanded from a primarily French field, as riders from all over the world began to participate in the race each year. The Tour is a UCI World Tour event, which means that the teams that compete in the race are mostly UCI WorldTeams, with the exception of the teams that the organizers invite. - The Great Dividing Range, or the Eastern Highlands, is Australia's most substantial mountain range and the third longest land-based range in the world.

The width of the range varies from about to over . - The Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) is part of the French media group, EPA (Éditions Philippe Amaury). It organises sporting events including the Tour de France, Vuelta a España and ParisNice professional cycle road races, and the Dakar Rally. In 2008 it began the Central Europe Rally, a rally raid endurance race in Romania and Hungary. - The points classification is a secondary competition in the Tour de France, that started in 1953. Points are given for high finishes in a stage and for winning intermediate sprints, and these are recorded in a points classification. It is considered a sprinters' competition. The leader is indicated by a green jersey which has become a symbol for the points classification in the sense that when a cyclist wins the points classification. - Robbie McEwen ( born 24 June 1972 in Brisbane , Queensland ) is an Australian former professional road bicycle racer .

It was initially the basis of a season long competition for rankings points, created for 2005 to replace the UCI Road World Cup series, which ended at the end of the 2004 season (although the World Cup did not include any stage races). The ProTour was the subject of continuing disputes involving the UCI, cycling teams, and the organizers of the world's most prominent bicycle races (most notably, the Grand Tours), and in 2009 and 2010 the ranking element of the ProTour was superseded by the UCI World Ranking. For 2011, the ProTour and World Ranking were fully merged into the UCI World Tour. ProTour status for teams relabelled UCI ProTeams will continue as the highest level of registration, and will carry the right and obligation to participate in all World Tour races. - The UCI World Tour (20092010: \\"UCI World Ranking\\") is the premier annual male elite road cycling tour.

But good luck telling that to President Donald Trump or a dozen or so Democrats contemplating a White House bid two years from now. Trump has already been out on the campaign trail testing themes for his expected re-election bid. \\"Our new slogan for 2020. Do you know what it is? Keep America great!\\" Trump told cheering supporters at a recent rally in Elkhart, Indiana. But Trump also made it clear he is concerned about this year's congressional midterm elections, in which opposition Democrats are favored to make gains. \\"And all of the great momentum that we are having as a country on jobs, on safety, on security, on our military — it is all at stake in November,\\" Trump warned at the Indiana rally. 2020 is expected to produce a bumper crop of Democratic presidential contenders who will vie for their party's nomination. Those in the group range from the well-known like former Vice President Joe Biden and 2016 contender Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to a younger, less recognizable contingent that includes California Senator Kamala Harris and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Several potential Democratic presidential contenders spoke about the party's future at a recent conference in Washington hosted by the Center for American Progress, a Democratic-leaning public policy institute in Washington. Among the speakers was Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who said Democrats face an uphill battle to win back control of Congress this year because of long-standing Republican advantages in winning a majority in the House of Representatives. \\"We can't climb that hill by ignoring the millions of Americans who are angry and scared about the damage this president and this Republican Party have done to our democracy,\\" Warren told the conference to a round of applause. \\"We can't ignore it and we shouldn't want to ignore it.\\" Where did Trump state \\"Our new slogan for 2020.

Instantly we see that Ken is enchanted with Bruges while Ray loathes the place. It is revealed that due to what happened in London they have no choice but to follow orders, stay in Bruges, lay low and wait for further instructions from Harry (Ralph Fiennes). Ray asks Ken how long he thinks they will have to stay in Bruges; Ken responds that he doesn't know, maybe two weeks. Again, we see that Ray is not happy about spending two weeks, let alone two hours, in Bruges. To add insult to injury it is Christmas and there is only one available room in the city (although at least it has two twin beds). During one of the first scenes in the hotel room Ken alludes to the incident in London indicating that they wouldn't be in Bruges if not for what happened, driving Ray to abruptly cut Ken off and retreat to the bathroom where he cries, distressed over whatever it was that occurred.Later Ray makes comments about Harry sending them to, say...the Bahamas...instead of this \\"bleeping\\" city of Bruges. Ken advises Ray to make the best of it, for starters why don't they climb up the tower in the square and take a look at the view. Ray snidely says, \\"no, he can see the 'bleeping' view just 'bleeping' fine from where he 'bleeping' is. Rays takes a seat (rather frustratedly) on a park bench and Ken goes off to climb the tower. The cost of going up the tower is 5 Euros for which Ken has change but is one coin short. Ken asks the cashier/guard to give him a break but the guy impatiently points out to Ken the sign that clearly states 5 Euros. Ken isn't pleased at having to break a large bill or the cashier's refusal to cut him some slack but he pulls out a 50 Euro note and gives it to the cashier anyway putting the 4.90 in change back in his pocket (important later).

Now we know that getting along with other people is something that we can work at. It is possible to act in such a way that other people will like us better. One way is being unselfish, not wanting everything from our friends. Another way is to look for good points, not bad points in other people. It is surprising how successful this treasure hunt can be. You do not have to be spineless in order to be popular. In fact, you will be liked or loved if you are not afraid to stand up for your rights . But do it politely and pleasantly. Being friendly and polite to your group, to other people and to strangers and especially to those who do not look important or do not interest you is one way to develop a good character. You cannot expect to be perfect, and you must learn not to be unhappy when you make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes, and no one is to be blamed if he does not refuse to learn from them. Many young people become discouraged when they know in themselves qualities that they do not like--selfishness, laziness, and other unpleasant qualities. Just remember that we all have some of these faults and have to fight against them. At the same time, it is important to remember that while you are probably no worse than others, the best way to be happy is to think yourself above other people. When something is wrong, it is good sense to try to make it right. Perhaps you do not like a teacher or a classmate. Try to see why, and look at yourself, too, to be sure that you are not doing anything to make that person dislike you. Some day, things may turn out all right when you have to learn to get along the best with the situation, without thinking too much about it. Worrying never helps in a situation you cannot change. Question: The purpose for the writer to write the passage is to _ . Answer: Select from the following. (i) train you to be perfect (ii) show you the way to be happy (iii) tell you how to act when you dislike a person (iv) teach you how to be popular among your friends The answer is:","completion":"(ii) show you the way to be happy"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Yahoo Has Another Mixed Quarter (Reuters) – Yahoos quarterly earnings fell short of Wall Street expectations on Monday in what may be the company’s last financial report before it sells its core business. Yahoo reported adjusted earnings of 9 cents per share, short of the 10 cents that analysts expected. It also announced a 482 million write-down on the value of Tumblr, the social media service that it acquired in 2013 for 1.1 billion. Total revenue rose to 1.31 billion from 1.24 billion a year earlier, though that seeming improvement was the result of a change in the way the cost of acquiring traffic is counted. After deducting fees paid to partner websites for traffic, revenue fell to 841.2 million from 1.04 billion. Revenue in the company’s emerging businesses, which CEO Marissa Mayer calls Mavens – mobile, video, native and social advertising – showed some life, rising 25.7% to 504 million in the second quarter ended June 30. Gross search revenue for the quarter was 765 million, a 17% decrease from the same period last year. The company posted a net loss of 439.9 million, or 46 cents per share, compared with a loss of 21.6 million, or 2 cents per share, a year earlier. “If search continues to decline as much as it has that’s something that’s going to be called into question,” said JMP Securities analyst Ronald Josey. Yahoo is in the process of auctioning off its search and advertising business and is expected to choose a winner this week. The company said its board has made “great progress on strategic alternatives” but did not comment further on the auction process. Verizon Communications and AT&T are said to be in the running, as well as private equity firm TPG Capital and a consortium lead by Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert and backed by billionaire Warren Buffett. Yahoo’s fortunes have waned under Chief Executive Marissa Mayer, who has made little progress in her attempts to gain ground against newer, bigger Internet players such Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google. The tepid progress in turning around the business attracted pressure from activist investors who pushed Yahoo to launch an auction of its core business in February. Yahoo has also said it could spin off the business. Yahoo’s shares yhoo were little changed at 37.92 in trading after the bell.

But students at Tibbett Middle School know that it's the small acts that make the world a better place. Eighth-graders from New Mexico, US, took part in the Random Acts of Kindness Week from Feb 10 to 14. During the week, they tried their best to do kind things for others, or for the environment. Celeste Murray, an English teacher at the school, started the activity. \\"I believe the world is changed by little things,\\" she told the local newspaper. Over the week, Murray said she has seen changes in her class. Previously, she asked her students to push the chairs in after class. Now, the students do it by themselves. \\"The teachers will have less work,\\" said Elisa Castaneda, one of Murray's students. Jordan Marshall, another eighth-grader, spent the week giving out praise . \\"It makes that person's day ,\\" she said. \\"Besides helping others, the activity made students feel that they can make a difference,\\" Murray said.

Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Two friends studied permaculture together. Bill studied about mycorrhiza, while Red studied about hugel kultur. But I can use this background: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. What is an answer for this question: Which friend learned less about surface areas of root systems? Answer:","completion":"In this situation, Red learned less about surface areas of root systems. Here's the step-by-step justification: 1. Bill studied mycorrhiza, which is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. 2. In a mycorrhizal association, the mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant's root system to improve water and mineral nutrient absorption. 3. Red studied hugel kultur, which is a gardening technique focusing on creating raised garden beds by piling up logs, branches, and other organic materials to decompose in mounds. While hugel kultur does involve the soil and how it affects plant growth, it does not specifically focus on the surface area of root systems. 4. Comparison: Bill's study topic (mycorrhiza) directly relates to surface areas of root systems, while Red's study topic (hugel kultur) relates more to the overall soil environment and gardening techniques. From this comparison, it can be concluded that Red learned less about surface areas of root systems than Bill did."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Dawn Nguyen of Rochester, New York, faces charges over allegedly lying when she purchased an AR-15 rifle -- a .223-caliber weapon -- and 12-gauge shotgun that the gunman had with him during the attack.

The question seeks to identify a particular aspect that women had less of, and the answer provides a clear reference to their rights.

Answer the above question based on the context below: After the release of Highway 61 Revisited in August 1965, Dylan set about hiring a touring band. Guitarist Mike Bloomfield and keyboard player Al Kooper had backed Dylan on his new album and at Dylan's controversial electric debut at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Bloomfield chose not to tour with Dylan, preferring to remain with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. After backing him at concerts in late August and early September, Kooper informed Dylan he did not wish to continue touring with him. Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman, was in the process of setting up a grueling concert schedule that would keep Dylan on the road for the next nine months, touring the U.S., Australia, and Europe. Dylan contacted a group who were performing as Levon and the Hawks, consisting of Levon Helm from Arkansas and four Canadian musicians: Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson. They had come together as a band in Canada, backing American rocker Ronnie Hawkins. Two people had strongly recommended the Hawks to Dylan: Mary Martin, the executive secretary of Grossman, and blues singer John Hammond, Jr., son of record producer John Hammond, who had signed Dylan to Columbia Records in 1961; the Hawks had backed the younger Hammond on his 1965 album So Many Roads.Dylan rehearsed with the Hawks in Toronto on September 15, where they were playing a hometown residency at Friar's Club, and on September 24, they made their debut in Austin, Texas. Two weeks later, encouraged by the success of their Texas performance, Dylan took the Hawks into Studio A of Columbia Records in New York City.

However, many Chinese do not sleep well, and many do not pay enough attention to sleep. The Chinese Medical Doctor Association released the 2013 China Sleep Quality Index on March 19 to mark World Sleep Day - March 21. According to the index, nearly a quarter of Chinese people don't sleep well. Half said that they feel tired after getting up and 15 percent people have trouble falling asleep. Ye Jingying, a sleep expert at Beijing Tongren Hospital, says: \\"If people often wake up during the night, or always feel weak and tired in the day, they should pay attention to their sleep pattern .\\" Many people play with their cell phones or iPads before sleeping. The report said that this is one of the main reasons for bad sleep. Other reasons include stress and bad moods. How to sleep well? Above all, get enough sleep. Seven to nine hours of sleep every night is perfect for an adult, and eight to nine hours is best for a teenager. Forming good sleep habits is important. The report suggested that people need to keep away from digital devices for at least an hour before sleep. The lights keep their brains excited for a long while. Other suggestions include: try to go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends and during holidays, and do the same relaxing things before bed each night, like listening to soft music. Which of the following helps teenagers sleep well? A) They should do different things before sleeping. B) They should sleep for more than nine hours a day. C) They should not use any digital devices during the daytime. D) They'd better go to sleep and get up at the same time every day. The answer to this question is:","completion":"D) They'd better go to sleep and get up at the same time every day. Sleep is essential for maintaining good physical and mental health. Unfortunately, many Chinese people are not getting the quality and quantity of sleep they need. The 2013 China Sleep Quality Index revealed that nearly a quarter of Chinese people experience poor sleep, with half feeling tired upon waking and 15 percent having difficulty falling asleep. Sleep expert Ye Jingying suggests that individuals who often experience disrupted sleep or who feel consistently tired during the day should pay closer attention to their sleep patterns. One major reason for poor sleep quality is the use of electronic devices, such as cell phones and iPads, before bedtime. The blue light emitted from these screens can interfere with the body's production of melatonin, the hormone that signals when it's time to sleep. This, combined with stress and bad moods, can contribute to sleep problems. To improve sleep quality, it's important to establish healthy sleep habits. For adults, seven to nine hours of sleep per night is ideal, while teenagers should aim for eight to nine hours. One crucial habit is maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends and holidays. This helps regulate the body's internal clock and can improve sleep quality. In addition to maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, other strategies for better sleep include avoiding electronic devices for at least an hour before bedtime, creating a relaxing pre-sleep routine such as listening to soft music or reading a book, and maintaining a comfortable sleep environment. Following these suggestions can help individuals, including teenagers, achieve better sleep and promote overall health and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Texting affects learning and performing on test, a new study finds. So a Montana teen, Colin decided to test that. They asked 47 classmates to take part in a two-part experiment. The goal was to test how well these students understood written material. Each one had to read a paragraph or two about a certain topic, then answer questions about it. In the first part, the participants had 15 minutes to understand and then answer questions about six readings. Throughout this test, they met no distractions. During a new set of readings, the brothers sent messages to the participants' cell phones every 90 seconds. In each message, there were questions that required a reply. Participants should have scored better on the second test because it was easier. In fact, they scored worse when distracted by messages. Only a few students scored as well when replying to messages as they did when undistracted. But importantly, nobody performed better during the texting part. The brothers presented details of their findings at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. Boys and girls scored equally poorly while texting, the brothers noticed. Older participants didn't do any better than younger ones. And it didn't matter if a student thought he was good at multitasking. On average, the brothers found that even students who were confident of their abilities did just as poorly while texting. Surprisingly, even though the students remembered less of what they read while texting, most of them answered questions in messages perfectly. \\"Our teachers are very happy to see these results,\\" says Coler.

Louisiana A:","completion":"Title: \\"The Southern Crossroads\\" The Plot: Our film begins in the bustling streets of New York City, where we meet our enthusiastic group of five friends – a mix of diverse cultures, races, and occupations sharing a common friendship bond. Each character mirrors a unique personality. There's Lucy, a bubbly bookstore owner who loves mystery novels; Tom, a mathematician at a notable university; Claire, a quirky street artist; Jamie, a high-end corporate lawyer, and Tina, a strict yet loving elementary school teacher. Despite their different backgrounds, they share an unexplained fascination for the rich culture, music, and mystique of the southern bayous, Louisiana. One evening, during their habitual meetings at their usual Upper West Side cafe, they stumble across an old, dusty, antique looking map that Lucy had discovered in a rare book at her shop. The map illustrates what appears to be an esteemed treasure trail in Louisiana. Laughing it off initially as fiction, soon, the gang finds themselves increasingly intrigued by the idea of the map leading to a real treasure. This is where their road trip journey to Louisiana kicks off, turning life-long friends into fellow explorers, seeking an adventure they weren't prepared for. Their journey begins with a myriad of extraordinary stops and fascinating cultural encounters, highlighting the beauty and diversity of the USA while painting an impressive backdrop of landscapes, cityscapes, and unique characters they meet along the road trip. As the story evolves, they end up in New Orleans, where they are greeted with a vibrant city alive with music and nightlife. They savor the local cuisine, get lost in the rhythm of jazz music, and even partake in some voodoo mystique. However, soon the treasure quest picks up pace again. From the intricate tunnels of the Louis Cathedral, to the eerie tranquility of the Manchac swamp, to the hauntingly beautiful Houmas House Plantation, the group's journey wallows in the heart of Louisiana's charm. In their pursuit of the treasure, each adventure they face represents a testing path leading to inner self-discovery and awakening. The journey becomes two-fold: unraveling the secret of the map and confronting their own fears, insecurities, and hidden aspirations. The climax hits as they unearth what seems to be the final point, an ancient crypt deep within the marshlands. With anticipation skyrocketing, they find not a treasure of gold, but the diary of a long forgotten bayou musician. The diary's entries reveal tales of love, music, culture, and interracial bonds during times of severe divisions. The real treasure was the rich, hallowed cultural heritage of Louisiana embodied in this diary. The movie concludes on a thoughtful, sentimental note as the group realizes that the actual treasure was not materialistic. Instead, it was the unforgettable adventure, the shared experiences, and the ability to value the inherent beauty and wealth in art, culture, and shared human experiences. From New York City's skyscrapers to Louisiana's mystifying landscapes, the characters return home, not filled with gold, but filled with a lifetime of stories to tell."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer to this question? normochromic pertains to what aspect of a blood cell?","completion":"To answer this question, I will utilize my internal database and knowledge-based systems to cross-reference the term \\"normochromic\\" with relevant associations in the context of blood cells. Here is my step-by-step approach: 1. Step 1: Understanding the term The first step is to understand the term \\"normochromic\\". This term has a prefix \\"normo-\\" which implies normal and the suffix \\"-chromic\\" which is related to color. Hence, the term generally refers to a normal color. 2. Step 2: Contextual association The next step involves associating this term with the context provided, which is that of blood cells. 3. Step 3: Surmising the answer Blood cells – particularly red blood cells or erythrocytes - have certain observable characteristics, which include their size, shape, and color. In medical terminology, the color of a blood cell is often used as an indicator of hemoglobin levels. A red blood cell with normal color is referred to as \\"normochromic\\". The term \\"normochromic\\" is therefore associated with the color of blood cells, which is an indicator of the normal concentration of hemoglobin inside the cell. A normochromic blood cell has a normal amount of hemoglobin, which gives the cell its red color. So, \\"normochromic\\" pertains to the color aspect of a blood cell, which is a reflection of the normal levels of hemoglobin within the cell. This is essential as hemoglobin is the protein that carries oxygen throughout the body. In a blood test report, normochromic is often referred to in association with red blood cells to indicate that they have normal hemoglobin concentration, which is a sign of health. A deviation from this might indicate a health problem, such as anemia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Once that access is gained, the army will take care of the situation, presumably neutralizing Kitchell as a threat or enemy. Step 2: Analyze the claim The claim, \\"We will never be able to get at Kitchell.\\", directly contradicts the original statement. The original statement implies that there will be a point in the future when access to Kitchell is achieved. Step 3: Determine whether the claim follows from the original statement As the claim is in direct opposition to what the original statement implies, it does not follow that \\"We will never be able to get at Kitchell.\\" Conclusion: The statement \\"We will never be able to get at Kitchell\\" does not follow from the original statement \\"Then we will be able to get at Kitchell, and the army will settle him for good and all!\\".

Q: Glucose and fructose are considered this type of sugar? A: Answer:","completion":"Glucose and fructose are considered monosaccharides, which are a type of simple sugar. Monosaccharides are the most basic forms of carbohydrates and cannot be further broken down into simpler sugars. They serve as the building blocks for more complex carbohydrates such as disaccharides and polysaccharides. Both glucose and fructose have the same molecular formula, C6H12O6, but they differ in their molecular structure. This structural difference gives them their unique properties and roles in biological processes. Glucose, also known as dextrose or blood sugar, is an essential energy source for living organisms. It is carried in the blood and used as the primary fuel for cells, including the brain and the muscles. Glucose is also important for various metabolic processes and can be combined with other simple sugars to form more complex carbohydrates, such as cellulose and glycogen. Fructose, on the other hand, is primarily found in fruits, honey, and some vegetables. It is sometimes called fruit sugar due to its natural abundance in fruits. While fructose is also used as a source of energy, its metabolism is slightly different from that of glucose. Fructose is primarily metabolized in the liver, where it can be converted into glucose or stored as glycogen. The consumption of high amounts of fructose has been linked to various health issues, such as obesity and insulin resistance, mainly due to its rapid absorption and slower metabolism compared to glucose. In conclusion, glucose and fructose are both monosaccharides, or simple sugars, and play essential roles in the energy metabolism of living organisms. Although they share the same molecular formula, their distinct molecular structures confer different properties and roles in biological processes. The understanding of their differences and similarities can provide insights into various aspects of human nutrition and health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Artemis ‘happy’ with initial test run in new boat There’s another 72-foot America’s Cup catamaran flying on the bay – a positive step for a regatta badly in need of a boost. Artemis Racing took its first test run in its new boat, dubbed “Big Blue,” in winds as strong as 15 knots Wednesday. Helmsman Nathan Outteridge said it couldn’t have gone better. “It was a perfect day and exactly what our team needed,” he said. “We got the boat on the water and foiling, and we’re happy with how it was foiling.” He called the first sail “a massive tribute to all the guys who have been working so hard to get us back out there.” The Swedish team has been out of action while building its boat following a wreck May 9 that killed a crew member. Artemis will miss its seventh scheduled race in the Louis Vuitton Cup challenger series Thursday, so Luna Rossa will sail unopposed. It is not known when the Swedish team will enter the regatta, but it probably won’t happen until the semifinals start Aug. 6. “We’d like to hope Aug. 6 is achievable,” Outteridge said, “but we know how much work is ahead of us now, and we don’t have a lot of time. This was Day 1 for us while the other teams are on Day 70 or 80.” Passing the safety standards: All the teams in this year’s competition have submitted safety plans that satisfy regatta director Iain Murray and the Coast Guard, Cup officials said. That apparently puts an end to the controversy over rudder wings. Murray at one point threatened to tell the Coast Guard he didn’t think the racing was safe unless teams used the heavier rudders he recommended. He backed off that stance, and now it appears that everyone is satisfied. Hearing date set: A New York judge set a hearing date of Aug. 23 on a North Carolina group’s bid for an injunction to stop the America’s Cup. The Louis Vuitton Cup will already be racing its finals when the hearing occurs. African Diaspora Maritime sued the host Golden Gate Yacht Club in 2011, alleging it acted in bad faith in rejecting the group as an America’s Cup competitor. Naples ACWS investigated: America’s Cup CEO Stephen Barclay said he has not been contacted by Italian authorities investigating Naples Mayor Luigi de Magistris, his brother Claudio and other officials over suspected contract rigging in connection with the America’s Cup World Series. Naples hosted two series events the past two years. Tom FitzGerald is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. E-mail: tfitzgerald@sfchronicle.com.

And I was wondering What does Aubrey need to do before this? Possible answers: I. have their first dance as husband and wife II. be invited III. go somewhere else","completion":"Before attending their friend's wedding and enjoying the event, Aubrey would need to take care of several preliminary tasks. It is crucial to ensure proper preparations are made ahead of time to have an enjoyable, memorable experience. Some of these tasks include the following: 1. Receive an invitation: Aubrey needs to be invited to the event in the first place (as suggested in option II). Receiving a wedding invitation is essential to confirm their attendance, as it is a formal occasion. An invitation typically includes essential information such as the date, time, venue, dress code, and RSVP details. 2. RSVP: Upon receiving the wedding invitation, Aubrey should send an RSVP to the couple. This step helps the hosts in arranging suitable seating, catering, and other arrangements for the guests. 3. Choose an outfit: Aubrey must select appropriate attire that matches the wedding's dress code, style, and theme. It is crucial to adhere to the dress code to show respect and avoid unintentionally upstaging the bride and groom. 4. Arrange transportation and accommodation: Depending on the wedding location, Aubrey might need to plan their transportation to the venue. This step involves booking a flight, reserving a rental car, or exploring public transportation options. If the wedding is an out-of-town event, booking accommodation near the wedding venue would also be necessary. 5. Purchase a wedding gift: Selecting and purchasing a suitable wedding gift for the bride and groom can be a challenging task. It is essential to choose a thoughtful present that holds sentimental value or is useful to the couple. Aubrey could also consider contributing to the couple's registry if they have one. 6. Prepare for the ceremony and reception: As a guest, Aubrey must be aware of the event schedule and timings. This step involves knowing when to arrive at the ceremony, finding a seat in the designated guest area, and being acquainted with any unique traditions, customs, or rituals to be conducted during the wedding. 7. Participate in pre-wedding events: Often, the bride, groom, or close family members organize pre-wedding events such as rehearsal dinners, bachelor/bachelorette parties, or bridal showers. If Aubrey is invited to any of these events, they should be prepared to attend and actively participate. Note that option I (have their first dance as husband and wife) is not applicable in this scenario, as Aubrey is attending the wedding as a friend and not as part of the couple getting married. The first dance is usually reserved for the bride and groom. Option III (go somewhere else) might apply if the wedding festivities encompass multiple venues or require attending other events before the actual wedding day. In conclusion, attending a friend's wedding as a guest involves several essential steps, such as receiving an invitation, sending an RSVP, choosing an outfit, arranging transportation and accommodation, purchasing a wedding gift, and preparing for the wedding ceremony and other related events. By diligently executing these tasks, Aubrey can ensure a smooth, enjoyable experience at the wedding and create lasting memories."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

(CNN) -- The U.S. space shuttle program retired in 2011, leaving American astronauts to hitchhike into orbit. But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.

Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts.

It’s difficult (though not impossible) to start a meaningful conversation with a stranger or acquaintance. It might feel more comfortable to start a meaningful conversation with someone you’ve known for a while or already have some closeness in your relationship. You might not want to start a meaningful conversation with someone who’s often argumentative or focused on always being ‘right’. Think about someone you can engage with and share both speaking and listening. A meaningful conversation will often occur within a context that makes it meaningful. While some meaningful conversations can happen spontaneously, others may require some planning. Especially if it’s difficult to find time to meet up, choose a date and a time where both you and the other person can be present and fully engaged. For example, don’t have the conversation when one or both of you have a time constraint. Avoid busy or stressful days so that each person feels comfortable and not preoccupied or stressed. When talking, you don't want to be interrupted by surrounding noise. You probably also don’t want prying ears overhearing your conversation. Find a quiet place where you won’t be disturbed or interrupted. This might include somebody’s home or a private meeting room. For example, a restaurant may not be ideal as you may be interrupted or overheard. Look for a place with minimal distractions. Consider turning off your phone or the television so that it doesn’t interrupt your conversation. If your conversations are often scattered, disorganized, or tangential, you can pause to talk a moment to organize your thoughts. This helps keep the conversation on track, and can give you a confidence boost as well! If you know you're going to have a difficult conversation and want to prepare well in advance, you can also try writing down what you want to say to organize your thoughts!

Starting a conversation with something deep might be jarring or unexpected, so warm up with some small talk first. When you and the other person appear comfortable, bring up a more substantial topic. For example, ask how the person’s day is going or briefly talk about the weather.

In fact Codylily Parkin was suffering from a diabetic attack and had to be placed in a medically induced coma in an intensive care unit after her brain swelled dangerously.

'Two. nurses have been suspended and I’m told that they won’t return to work. until they have received extra training, but that’s not really enough in. my eyes.' Just a few hours before her collapse. Codylily was taken by her dad parents to an NHS Wallk-in Centre in. Rotherham town centre suffering from breathing difficulties, an. insatiable thirst and whitening of her tongue. Four days earlier her GP. had diagnosed vaginal thrush. Medics at the walk-in centre then diagnosed Codylily with oral thrush and she was sent back to the family home in Rotherham.

Codylily's father took her to Rotherham Walk-In Centre suffering from breathing difficulties, an insatiable thirst and whitening of her tongue. As soon as the paramedic arrived he said Codylily was slipping into a diabetic coma and she was rushed to hospital suffering from severe diabetic ketoacidosis. She was placed in an induced coma before being transferred to Sheffield Children’s Hospital ten miles away. She returned to Rotherham Hospital two days later and was allowed home on September 20th. Codylily now faces a lifetime of insulin dependence because of the diabetes. Mrs Parkin paid: 'The paramedic said straight away ‘She’s slipping into a diabetic coma’. We need to get her to hospital.

Answer based on context: Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas for the Kingdom of Castile and León in 1492. By 1580 this had unified with neighbouring kingdoms to form one Spanish kingdom. Private adventurers thereafter entered into contracts with the Spanish Crown to conquer the newly discovered lands in return for tax revenues and the power to rule. In the first decades after the discovery, the Spanish colonised the Caribbean and established a centre of operations on the island of Cuba. They heard rumours of the rich empire of the Aztecs on the mainland to the west and, in 1519, Hernán Cortés set sail with eleven ships to explore the Mexican coast. By August 1521 the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the Spanish. Within three years of the fall of Tenochtitlan the Spanish had conquered a large part of Mexico, extending as far south as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The newly conquered territory became New Spain, headed by a viceroy who answered to the Spanish Crown via the Council of the Indies. Cortés despatched Pedro de Alvarado with an army to conquer the Mesoamerican kingdoms of the Guatemalan Sierra Madre and neighbouring Pacific plain; the military phase of the establishment of the Spanish colony of Guatemala lasted from 1524 to 1541. The Captaincy General of Guatemala had its capital at Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala and covered a wide territory that also included the Mexican state of Chiapas as well as El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica. The Spanish imposed colonial rule over Yucatán between 1527 and 1546, and over Verapaz from the 16th to the 17th centuries, leaving the area between - essentially Petén and much of Belize - independent long after surrounding peoples had been subjugated. How many total years did the military phase of the establishment of the Spanish colony of Guatemala last?","completion":"The military phase of the establishment of the Spanish colony of Guatemala lasted from 1524 to 1541.

This article: On 7 May 1896, Sir Humphrey Francis de Trafford put the 1,183-acre (4,790,000 m2) estate up for auction, but it failed to reach its reported reserve price of £300,000 (£34.1 million as of 2019). There was much public debate, before and after the abortive sale, as to whether Manchester Corporation ought to buy Trafford Park, but the corporation could not agree terms quickly enough, and so on 23 June Ernest Terah Hooley became the new owner of Trafford Park, for the sum of £360,000 (£40.9 million as of 2019).On 17 August, Hooley formed Trafford Park Estates Ltd, transferring his ownership of the park to the new company – of which he was the chairman and a significant shareholder – at a substantial profit. The initial plans for the estate included a racetrack, exclusive housing and a cycle works, along with the development of the ship canal frontage for \\"all types of trade including timber\\". By that time the ship canal had been open for two years, but the predicted traffic had yet to materialise. Hooley met with Marshall Stevens, the general manager of the Ship Canal Company, and both men recognised the benefit that the industrial development of Trafford Park could offer to the ship canal, and the ship canal to the estate. In January 1897 Stevens became the managing director of Trafford Park Estates. He remained with the company, latterly as its joint chairman and managing director, until 1930. The company initially chose not to construct buildings for letting, and instead leased land for development. But by the end of June 1897 less than one per cent of the park had been leased, and so the park's existing assets were put to use until more tenants could be found. Trafford Hall was opened as a hotel in 1899, to serve prospective industrialists considering a move to the park, along with their key employees. It had 40 bedrooms, available to \\"Gentlemen only\\". The hall's stables and some other outbuildings were used for stock auctions and the sale of horses, from 1900 to 1902, and the ornamental lake was leased to... contains an answer for the question: What failed to reach its reserve price at auction?, what is it ?

Choices: - smile - be happy - laughing - falling down - talk The rationale to choose \\"be happy\\" as the answer is that: The answer is:","completion":"\\"Be happy.\\" The rationale for choosing \\"be happy\\" as the answer stems from several factors that need to be considered. These factors include the context of the situation, understanding of human emotions, various coping mechanisms and approaches to dealing with problems, and the relationship between the mother and daughter. 1. Context of the situation: The question mentions that the daughter is crying at her mother's death bed, which indicates a highly emotional and sensitive situation. Losing a loved one is one of the most painful and devastating experiences anyone can go through. Therefore, the response from the mother should be comforting and provide solace to the daughter in order to alleviate her pain and sadness. 2. Understanding of human emotions: Human emotions are complex and multifaceted, but at the core of them is the innate desire to feel happy and content. A mother's reassurance and guidance to her daughter would likely be focused on helping her acknowledge and process her grief, while simultaneously encouraging her to find happiness in life. \\"Be happy\\" serves as both an affirmation and a gentle reminder to the daughter that life will go on, and that it's essential to find happiness even after experiencing loss. 3. Coping mechanisms and approaches to dealing with problems: There are various ways to cope with and overcome issues, but cultivating happiness and positivity plays a significant role in a healthy and balanced life. By advising her daughter to be happy, the mother is encouraging her to focus on positive emotions and experiences, rather than dwelling on the loss and sadness she feels. This will not only help her daughter cope more effectively with her mother's passing but will also promote personal growth and resilience. 4. Relationship between mother and daughter: Mothers often serve as a primary source of love, support, and guidance for their children. In a time of immense sorrow and grief, it is natural for the mother to want her daughter to prioritize her well-being and find happiness. The phrase \\"be happy\\" encapsulates the depth of love and care that the mother has for her daughter, and it represents the mother's wish for her daughter to thrive even in her absence. Taking into account all these factors, it becomes clear that \\"be happy\\" is the appropriate and logical choice. The mother's reassurance to \\"be happy\\" is a beautiful and timeless piece of advice that transcends the bleakness of her death bed, encouraging her daughter to navigate through her own life in a positive and fulfilling manner. By choosing happiness, the daughter will be honoring her mother's memory and ultimately strengthening her own ability to face challenges and adversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The State Department will not renew the contract of security contractor Blackwater Worldwide when it expires in May, a senior State Department official said Friday. Heavily armed Blackwater guards scan downtown Baghdad, Iraq, from a helicopter in 2003. The decision was made after the Iraqi government refused last week to renew the firm's operating license because of a 2007 incident in which the Iraqi government says security guards -- then employed by Blackwater -- fired on and killed 17 Iraqis. Blackwater's latest \\"task order\\" expires in May, and the senior official said that \\"one of the conditions is that you have to have a license\\" to continue working in the country.

The incident led to strained relations between the United States and Iraq, putting the spotlight on the role of private security contractors in the war-torn country. Over the years, Blackwater Worldwide, which has since rebranded itself as Academi, has been under scrutiny for its aggressive behavior and questionable tactics while providing security for U.S. officials and diplomatic staff in Iraq. The 2007 tragedy, often referred to as the Nisour Square massacre, was just one of several incidents where Blackwater guards were accused by Iraqi authorities of using excessive and lethal force. Faced with these allegations and the Iraqi government's refusal to renew the firm's operating license, the State Department was left with no choice but to terminate Blackwater's contract. Critics argue that private security contractors like Blackwater often benefited from a lack of legal accountability, resulting in a sense of impunity and a disregard for Iraqi civilians' safety. In response to these concerns, the U.S. government has increased oversight and regulation of private security contractors and taken further measures to ensure better communication and coordination with the Iraqi government and military. Although Blackwater is no longer operating in Iraq, the long-lasting effects of the company's actions in the country continue to be felt. Several lawsuits and criminal prosecutions have stemmed from the Nisour Square incident, leading to the conviction of four former Blackwater employees in 2014 on charges ranging from murder to manslaughter and weapons violations. However, these convictions were later overturned or sentences reduced, and the U.S. government eventually reached a settlement with the company for violations of the Arms Export Control Act and International Trafficking in Arms Regulations. As the United States continues its efforts to rebuild Iraq and foster diplomatic relations, the legacy of Blackwater serves as a cautionary tale in the use and management of private security contractors. It highlights the importance of striking a balance between ensuring the safety of American personnel abroad and respecting the sovereignty and well-being of other nations and their citizens. With increased oversight and regulation, the hope is that future security contractors can learn from Blackwater's mistakes and help contribute to a more secure and stable Iraq moving forward."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The site was excavated in 1978 by a Soviet-Afghan team led by Greek-Russian archaeologist Viktor Sarianidi, a year before the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the discoveries made during this excavation are often referred to as the Bactrian gold. The name \\"Golden Hill\\" or \\"Golden Mound\\" may suggest the presence of gold deposits in the area, but it is important to fully understand the site and its context to determine if such an inference is valid. In the context of Tillya Tepe, the primary reason for its association with \\"gold\\" stems not from the presence of gold deposits but rather from the archaeological treasure that was discovered at the site. Tillya Tepe is particularly famous for its association with a collection of around 20,600 gold ornaments, coins, and other precious objects dating back to the 1st century BCE, which makes it one of the most significant and valuable archaeological finds in Afghanistan. These artifacts, which include gold jewelry, belts, buckles, crowns, and more, are believed to be connected to a culture of nomadic peoples (possibly the Kushans) that inhabited the regions of Bactria and Sogdiana. The discovery of these gold items at Tillya Tepe has provided a wealth of information about the craftsmanship, artistic styles, and cultural influences of that era, reflecting the exchange of ideas and techniques between the regions associated with the Silk Road trade routes. So, to infer that Tillya Tepe is known for gold deposits in the area might not be accurate, as the site is primarily known for its archaeological significance related to the discovery of the Bactrian gold treasure. Though the name \\"Golden Hill\\" or \\"Golden Mound\\" does have a connotation of gold linked to the location, this association is derived from the treasure trove of gold artifacts, rather than gold deposits themselves. As a result, it is more accurate to emphasize the archaeological value of the site and its connection to the Bactrian gold artifacts, rather than focusing on gold deposits in the area."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: What does Aura teach Flash to use? A telepathic communicator Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"Minds Apart\\" Step 1: Setting the premise The movie takes place in a futuristic society where humans are separated into distinct communities based on their inherent psychic abilities. Aura, a gifted teacher specialized in psychic communication, resides in the Telepath Community. Flash, a young and energetic man with latent psychic powers, lives in the neighboring community where people use technology for everyday communication. Step 2: Establishing character motivations and relationships Aura and Flash meet during a rare gathering of representatives from all communities, with the intention to facilitate innovation and unity. As an ambitious soul always eager to learn, Flash shows curiosity about Aura's abilities, which sparks her interest in helping him unlock his innate telepathic potential. Step 3: Introducing conflict Despite their basic psychic differences, Aura and Flash begin secretly meeting for lessons. They encounter a major setback when they discover a hidden plot, led by an influential leader from Flash's community, that seeks to dominate all other communities by controlling their psychics' powers and using them for their own benefit. Step 4: Building tension Aura and Flash work together to master the telepathic communicator, a powerful device that amplifies psychic connections and allows them to communicate instantaneously. Aura teaches Flash how to connect with other psychics across the communities, with the ultimate goal of rallying them against the malicious plot threatening their society's balance and freedom. Step 5: Climax As Flash's abilities grow stronger, the villainous leader begins to suspect their secret collaboration. He launches an aggressive and targeted attack on Aura, who is forced into hiding. In desperation, Flash uses the telepathic communicator to rally the psychics across all communities and successfully mobilizes them against their oppressors. Step 6: Resolution The combined psychic and technological forces, under the guidance of Aura and Flash, defeat the villain and his followers. This victory leads to a greater appreciation for the unique skills and abilities of all communities, encouraging cooperation and the sharing of knowledge. Step 7: Conclusion Aura and Flash's heroics not only save their society from tyranny but also pave the way for a more inclusive, harmonious world. Their personal bond, forged through the telepathic communicator, serves as an inspirational example of what can be achieved when people embrace their differences and unite for the greater good. The film ends with a hopeful message, emphasizing the transformative power of connection and unity."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Write some highlights for the following article: Detectives investigating the murder of two British tourists on the Thai island of Kao Tao are hunting for three men - two of whom they say raped the female victim while the third watched. The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were found on a beach on the holiday isle on September 15. A bloodstained garden hoe, believed to be the murder weapon, was found nearby. In the wake of heavy criticism over the investigation into their brutal deaths, police sought to allay fears that the killers had long escaped saying they were 'confident' that a significant breakthrough was on the horizon. The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were found on a beach on Koh Tao on September 15. The last known picture of the pair, together with a group at the sports bar called Choppers - they also went to the AC bar where a group of amateur footballers were celebrating the end of a tournament. 'Two of the suspects raped and killed Witheridge while another one witnessed the murder,' Pol Lt Gen Panya Mamen, commissioner of Provincial Police Region 8, said yesterday. 'We're confident we have a very high chance of finding the suspects,' the senior police officer said. 'I'm not worried [about high public expectations] because I know how much the probe has been progressing. We just have to follow forensic results.' Police have taken more than 200 DNA samples from men living and working in the area of the crime scene - most of them being migrant workers from Burma. But there have been no matches so far with the victims. Police have been taking DNA swabs and footprints of people on the island in a bid to find the killers. A group of Thai footballers are the latest people to be questioned by police amid fears that the hunt for the killers has stalled. A spokesman for the Royal Thai Police confirmed that DNA samples were taken from 'more than eight' footballers - who reportedly threw a late-night party at the AC nightclub where the victims spent their final hours - and officers were awaiting the results. The amateur footballers were allegedly at the nightclub celebrating the end of a tournament while the British backpackers were there. Police have offered a reward of 700,000 baht - roughly £13,300 - for information which leads to the arrests of the culprits. The murders – and Ms Witheridge's suspected rape – were the work of a group of at least three 'attackers', two of whom are Asian men, police have claimed, citing analysis of DNA and other evidence. Dressed in a pink top and white skirt, Hannah Witheridge looked happy and relaxed as she strolled past fruit stands and in and out of bars on the night before her murder. Investigating officers have said they believe sexual jealousy was the motive behind the murder of 23-year-old from Great Yarmouth in the early hours of September 15. A condom has recently been recovered from the crime scene which has the young woman's DNA on its outer skin. Police have already said that DNA recovered from her body has shown that two men took advantage of her on the morning of her death. 'The discovery of the condom is an important piece of evidence,' said provincial police commander General Kiattipong Kaosam-ang. 'Solving this crime is going to come down to DNA matches and we are working hard on this.' Her recently-met friend David Miller, 24, from Jersey died when he was attacked after - it is believed - he went to her aid when he found her in trouble near a group of boulders on the beach. The movements of David Miller and Miss Witheridge are not known afterwards though some locals claim to have seen them in a bar arguing with an Asian man. DNA found on a cigarette matches a sample taken from Miss Witheridge and police say they are hoping that matching it with a suspect would 'open the door' to finding who else was involved. 'There is no doubt the murder of Miss Witheridge was sexually motivated because none of her belongings or those of the English man were missing,' said General Kiattipong Kaosam-ang. 'Yes, the motivation for the attack is rape.' He said the attackers might have been smoking when they saw Miss Witheridge walking back to her guest house alone along the beach. Miss Witheridge's family said they are 'broken' by her death and revealed several days ago that they have returned to the UK with her body. In a statement, they said: 'As a family we feel enormous relief to have Hannah back at home where she belongs. 'We continue to work closely with officers to assist in the investigation and bring those responsible to justice. 'Our family is broken and require time to grieve in private - as do Hannah's many friends.'

This article: The Brownlow family, a dynasty of lawyers, began accumulating land in the Belton area from approximately 1598. In 1609 they acquired the reversion of the manor of Belton itself from the Pakenham family, who finally sold the manor house to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619. The old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house and remained largely unoccupied, since the family preferred their other houses elsewhere. John Brownlow had married an heiress but was childless. He became attached to two of his more distant blood relations: a great-nephew, also called John Brownlow, and a great-niece, Alice Sherard. The two cousins married each other in 1676 when both were aged 16; three years later, the couple inherited the Brownlow estates from their great-uncle together with an income of £9,000 per annum (about £1.35 million in present-day terms) and £20,000 in cash (equivalent to about £3.01 million now). They immediately bought a town house in the newly fashionable Southampton Square in Bloomsbury, and decided to build a new country house at Belton.Work on the new house began in 1685. The architect thought to have been responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, that it could have been the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a plasterer who worked at Belton to another of his patrons. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person from whom the couple inherited the Brownlow estates?, what is it ?

Question: When I first started out in the field, I was working at a private hospital in the locked psychiatric unit, and there was a call from one of the med floors requiring someone from our unit to assist with a problem of a young man who had bitten through his cotton restraints on his wrists. They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones. I had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20’s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium. The counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints. There was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, “ He will die before morning. “ I suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness. I was a trained therapist, and in this situation, I was unable to do anything, and was rendered powerless.

It was an amazing week for my husband and me--the trip of a lifetime. Months ago, when my husband told me that he would have a meeting in London, I told him my wish to go to Europe together with him. Then we asked his mother to look after our two children and started off. During the week's time, we visited London and Paris--as much as we could, Big Ben, the Eiffel Tower and so on. All these were beautiful places we expected to see before. We really had a fantastic time. On our last night in Paris, after we enjoyed the night sight of the Eiffel Tower, my husband called home. His mother answered the phone. In a second, my husband's face fell and looked so worried. I could feel there was something bad. \\"What's wrong?\\" I asked. He didn't answer and went on to listen. A few minutes later, he said sadly to me that Tony, our seven-year-old son, fell down from his bike and broke his leg. He must be sent to hospital at once. At that moment, Paris suddenly lost its charm . \\"I don't want to be here! I shouldn't be here! I should be home with my kids!\\" We hurried back to our hotel and then to the airport...

Whether you're studying English for self-improvement, to advance in your career, or for social reasons, you may encounter challenges, fatigue, and even self-doubt along the way. Nevertheless, with dedication and a solid plan in place, you can forge ahead and ultimately triumph in your quest to conquer the English language. This article offers crucial insights and practical advice on how to stay motivated, practice effectively, think in English, interact with native speakers, and learn from mistakes to accelerate your language learning process. Stay Motivated Motivation is the engine that fuels your journey to English fluency. At the onset, it's essential to identify the reasons and objectives for learning English, create realistic goals, and regularly assess your progress. These elements will help maintain a sense of purpose and direction in your studies. Moreover, it's vital to develop and maintain a positive mindset. Celebrate your achievements—no matter how small—and find inspiration in the progress of others through language-learning communities or by watching films, reading books, or listening to podcasts in English. Practice Every Day Consistency is critical in developing language skills. Dedicate time each day to engage in a variety of activities that encompass the four main language skills: reading, writing, speaking, and listening. Tailor your practice sessions according to your preferences and learning style. You may opt for language apps or online platforms, follow English-speaking YouTubers or podcasts, keep a journal, or participate in discussion forums. Integrate English into your daily routines, such as labeling objects at home, describing your activities, and setting your electronic devices to English. Train Yourself to Think in English To think in English, you must immerse yourself in the language and internalize its rhythm, expressions, and nuances. This mental shift may initially feel uncomfortable, but with time, it will become second nature. Try these strategies to train your mind to think in English: 1. Practice self-talk: Have conversations with yourself or describe your experiences and thoughts aloud or in your mind in English. 2. Visualize scenarios: Imagine hypothetical situations or real-life experiences, forming English sentences to describe the events or emotions. 3. Translate your thoughts: Whenever you think in your native language, try to mentally translate these thoughts into English. 4. Use English language media: Consuming English-speaking films, TV shows, and podcasts can help familiarize yourself with the flow of conversation and idiomatic expressions. Make Friends with English Speakers Interacting with native English speakers provides invaluable insights into the language's cultural contexts and allows you to practice real-life conversations. Forge friendships by joining language exchange groups, participating in online discussion forums or social media groups, or volunteering at local events or organizations. You may even find a language partner to engage in regular conversation practice, which will help improve your listening comprehension, pronunciation, vocabulary, and speaking skills. Don't Be Afraid to Make Mistakes Mistakes are an inevitable part of the learning process—embrace them as valuable opportunities for growth. Maintain a receptive attitude towards constructive feedback, and use it to assess your progress and inform your practice. Reflect on errors by analyzing and correcting them and actively seeking help and advice from peers, teachers, or native speakers. Through self-awareness, persistence, and continuous learning, your confidence and fluency in English will strengthen over time. Conclusion In conclusion, the road to English fluency is paved with challenges that can be surmounted through motivation, consistent practice, mental immersion in the language, making connections with native speakers, and embracing mistakes as learning opportunities. By adopting these strategies, you will not only accelerate your language learning but also cultivate an enriching and transformative experience that will enhance various aspects of your life. Stay dedicated to your mission, and watch as your world expands through the power of English."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Woodrow Wilson Guthrie (; July 14, 1912 - October 3, 1967) was an American singer-songwriter, one of the most significant figures in American folk music; his songs, including social justice songs, such as \\"This Land Is Your Land\\", have inspired several generations both politically and musically. He wrote hundreds of political, folk, and children's songs, along with ballads and improvised works. His album of songs about the Dust Bowl period, Dust Bowl Ballads, is included on Mojo magazine's 100 Records That Changed The World. Many of his recorded songs are archived in the Library of Congress. During the Dust Bowl period, Guthrie joined the thousands of Okies who were migrating to California looking for work, leaving his wife and children in Texas. Many of his songs are concerned with the conditions faced by these working-class people. During the late part of that decade, he achieved fame with radio partner Maxine \\"Lefty Lou\\" Crissman as a broadcast performer of commercial hillbilly music and traditional folk music. Guthrie was making enough money to send for his family, who were still living in Texas. While appearing on the commercial radio station KFVD, owned by a populist-minded New Deal Democrat, Frank W. Burke, Guthrie began to write and perform some of the protest songs that would eventually appear on Dust Bowl Ballads. While at KFVD, Guthrie met newscaster Ed Robbin. Robbin was impressed with a song Guthrie wrote about political activist Thomas Mooney, believed by many to be wrongly convicted in a case that was a cause celebre of the time. Robbin, who became Guthrie's political mentor, introduced Guthrie to socialists and Communists in Southern California, including Will Geer (who, in turn, introduced Guthrie to John Steinbeck). Robbin remained Guthrie's lifelong friend, and helped Guthrie book benefit performances in the Communist circles in Southern California. Notwithstanding Guthrie's later claim that \\"the best thing that I did in 1936 was to sign up with the Communist Party\\", he was never a member of the party. He was noted as a fellow traveler--an outsider who agreed with the platform of the party while not subject to party discipline. Guthrie wrote a column for the Communist newspaper, People's World. The column, titled \\"Woody Sez\\", appeared a total of 174 times from May 1939 to January 1940. \\"Woody Sez\\" was not explicitly political, but was about current events as observed by Guthrie. He wrote the columns in an exaggerated hillbilly dialect and usually included a small comic; they were published as a collection after Guthrie's death. Steve Earle said of Guthrie, \\"I don't think of Woody Guthrie as a political writer. He was a writer who lived in very political times.\\" With the outbreak of World War II and the non-aggression pact the Soviet Union had signed with Germany in 1939, the owners of KFVD radio did not want its staff \\"spinning apologia\\" for the Soviet Union. Both Robbin and Guthrie left the station. Without the daily radio show, his prospects for employment diminished, and Guthrie and his family returned to Pampa, Texas. Although Mary Guthrie was happy to return to Texas, Guthrie preferred to accept Will Geer's invitation to New York City and headed east.

He played college football at the University of Michigan from 1938 to 1940 and with the Iowa Pre-Flight Seahawks in 1942. Evashevski served as the head football coach at Hamilton College in 1941, Washington State University from 1950 to 1951, and the University of Iowa from 1952 to 1960, compiling a career record of 68-35-6. Evashevski's 1958 Iowa team went 8-1-1, winning the Big Ten Conference title and defeating the California Golden Bears in the 1959 Rose Bowl. \\"People in the Midwest are my people and I wanted to be back among them...And, of course, I don't have to tell you what I think of Big Ten football. It's the best in the country.\\" With those words, Evashevski left the Palouse in eastern Washington to become the University of Iowa's 19th head football coach. Evashevski nearly took the head coaching job at Indiana University, but Fritz Crisler urged him to consider Iowa. He felt that it would be easier to attain statewide support at Iowa than in Indiana, where Purdue University and the University of Notre Dame shared the spotlight. Evashevski was familiar with Iowa City from his stint with the Naval Pre-Flight School. Crisler was the man who recommended Evashevski to Iowa's athletic director, Paul Brechler. Crisler did warn Brechler, however, that Evashevski was \\"a tough, stubborn Polack, and you might have to put the reins on him.\\" In 1952, Iowa football had only had three winning seasons in the previous 16 years. Iowa had also gone without a Big Ten Conference title for three decades. A United Press International story named three football programs in 1952 with new coaches that would struggle to ever be competitive: Iowa, Indiana, and Pittsburgh. Iowa's first two opponents in 1952 were Pittsburgh and Indiana, and Iowa lost to both, starting the year 0-2. But Evashevski knew the Hawkeye program could be resurrected. When he came to Iowa, Evashevski was asked by a writer, \\"Do you think Iowa could ever really have a consistently winning team?\\" Evashevski snapped, \\"Why in the hell do you think I took the job?\\" Afterwards, a photographer noted, \\"I think that man truly believes he's the savior of Iowa football.\\" Entity:","completion":"The text is about Forest \\"Evy\\" Evashevski, an American football player, coach, and college athletics administrator."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Fourteen people were killed and another 60 were injured in Indonesia over a four-day period as a result of Cyclone Iggy, according to the country's National Disaster Management Agency. Most of those who died were struck by falling trees or debris from strong winds, said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. More than 2,000 homes were also damaged in 35 towns or cities in Java and Bali between Wednesday and Sunday, he said. The government has provided food and aid to the areas affected, the agency said. As of Sunday, Iggy was off the northwestern coast of Australia, said Tom Sater, meteorologist for CNN International. In anticipation of the storm,","completion":"Indonesian authorities had put in place evacuation plans and emergency response teams, allocating resources to manage the unfolding situation. However, the severity of Cyclone Iggy caught many residents by surprise, with its heavy rainfall, strong winds, and localized flooding in several provinces. Indonesia's President, Joko Widodo, expressed deep condolences for the victims and urged all related government agencies to work together in the aftermath of the cyclone to conduct search-and-rescue operations, provide medical help to the injured, and restore damaged infrastructure. He also urged residents in the affected areas to remain calm and follow the guidance of local authorities to ensure their safety. In the following weeks, the Indonesian government worked closely with local governments, the military, and humanitarian organizations such as the Indonesian Red Cross and international aid groups to provide much-needed relief to affected communities. Efforts were focused on clearing debris, restoring damaged infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and utilities, and providing temporary shelter for displaced families. Disaster management experts from around the world were invited to assess the situation and offer recommendations, aiming to improve Indonesia's emergency preparedness and response capabilities to minimize the loss of life and damage in future natural disasters. Weather agencies and researchers also collaborated on developing early warning systems, conducting investigations to understand the changing patterns of cyclones in the region. Meanwhile, Australia's Bureau of Meteorology kept a close eye on Cyclone Iggy as it approached the northwestern coast of Australia, issuing warnings and advice for residents and maritime vessels. The storm was projected to weaken as it moved further southward, reducing its impact on the Australian mainland. In the wake of Cyclone Iggy, the global community rallied behind Indonesia, offering condolences, financial support, and resources for rebuilding the affected communities. International organizations such as the United Nations, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank pledged assistance in the form of grants, loans, and technical assistance. Over time, with the collaborative efforts of national and international stakeholders, affected communities gradually recovered from the devastation left behind by Cyclone Iggy. They were able to rebuild their homes, schools, and businesses, while also addressing the broader challenges of climate change and disaster resilience. Although Cyclone Iggy left a tragic toll on human lives and property in Indonesia, it also served as a reminder of the importance of coordinated disaster preparedness and response efforts. The lessons learned and the progress made in the wake of this disaster have the potential to save many lives and mitigate the impact of future storms in the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He is a family friend, and in love with Cora, and proposes to her before they leave. She does not give him an answer. Major Heyward, the two women, and a troop of British soldiers march through the rugged countryside to reach the fort. They are led by a single guide, Magua, a warrior of the Huron tribe. Suddenly, Magua leads the party into an ambush, where many of the soldiers are killed, but Heyward and the women survive. The fight is interrupted by the arrival of Chingachgook and his sons, who kill the enemy warriors while Magua escapes. The major and the women are now stranded and the Mohicans and Hawkeye agree to accompany them the rest of the way. Hawkeye observes that Magua attempted to kill Cora, and asks Duncan about any ties to the Huron. During this trek, Cora begins to form a bond with Hawkeye, and Heyward notices.
