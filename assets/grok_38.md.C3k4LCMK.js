Help as much as you can. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Creating a self portrait is not your typical selfie! When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person that escapes a second murder attempt by Severance? Wellman Anthony Santee is a former race car driver who has turned to a life of crime since the death of his mother. Santee and his friend Eddie Turner bend the law for profit by hauling exotic stolen cars. Santee's latest assignment is to transport such goods across the desert, but a Highway Patrol officer pulls him over. Turner tries to reason with the cop but then a pair of cops named Frank Severance and Jack \\"Rudy\\" Rudisill show up. There is a gun battle in which Turner is killed, and Santee is wounded. Severance murders the highway patrolman and pins it on Santee. After recovering in a prison hospital, Santee escapes during transfer to the fictional San Gorgonio Penitentiary in order to escape another murder attempt on him by Severance and takes a hostage named Rita Marrick, not suspecting that she's a cop, while Rita keeps her identity a secret from Santee. Rita's partner Michael Agnos leads the search for Santee and Rita. As Santee eludes capture with the help of Eddie's widow and child, Severance and Rudisill home in on the investigation. Rita's sole escape attempt fails and nearly forces Santee to shoot law enforcers, as she begins harboring doubts about Santee's guilt. Santee releases Rita and invades Severance's home, forcing his wife Esther to provide the phone number of former associate Jimmy Shoeshine, from whom he demands payments due to him and Eddie.

Question: Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles.

Information: - A symphony is an extended musical composition in Western classical music, most often written by composers for orchestra. Although the term has had many meanings from its origins in the ancient Greek era, by the late 18th century the word had taken on the meaning common today: a work usually consisting of multiple distinct sections or movements, often four, with the first movement in sonata form. Symphonies are scored for string (violin, viola, cello and double bass), brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments which altogether number about 30100 musicians. Symphonies are notated in a musical score, which contains all the instrument parts. Orchestral musicians play from parts which contain just the notated music for their instrument. A small number of symphonies also contain vocal parts (e.g., Beethoven's Ninth Symphony). - Sound recording and reproduction is an electrical, mechanical, electronic, or digital inscription and re-creation of sound waves, such as spoken voice, singing, instrumental music, or sound effects. The two main classes of sound recording technology are analog recording and digital recording. - Chamber music is a form of classical music that is composed for a small group of instrumentstraditionally a group that could fit in a palace chamber or a large room. Most broadly, it includes any art music that is performed by a small number of performers, with one performer to a part (in contrast to orchestral music, in which each string part is played by a number of performers). However, by convention, it usually does not include solo instrument performances. - (Franz) Joseph Haydn (31 March 173231 May 1809) was a prolific Austrian composer of the Classical period. He was instrumental in the development of chamber music such as the piano trio and his contributions to musical form have earned him the epithets \\"Father of the Symphony\\" and \\"Father of the String Quartet\\". - A piano trio is a group of piano and two other instruments, usually a violin and a cello, or a piece of music written for such a group. It is one of the most common forms found in classical chamber music. The term can also refer to a group of musicians who regularly play this repertoire together; for a number of well-known piano trios, see below. - A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information. - Edison Records was one of the earliest record labels which pioneered sound recording and reproduction and was an important player in the early recording industry. - The term musical form (or musical architecture) refers to the overall structure or plan of a piece of music, and it describes the layout of a composition as divided into sections. In the tenth edition of \\"The Oxford Companion to Music\\", Percy Scholes defines musical form as \\"a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration.\\" - The Haydn Quartet , later known as the Hayden Quartet , was one of the most popular recording close harmony quartets in the early twentieth century . It was originally formed in 1896 as the Edison Quartet to record for Edison Records ; it took its new name when recording for other companies . The name was a homage to Joseph Haydn , the classical composer ; the spelling was later revised to Hayden , which reflects the way it was pronounced . The group disbanded in 1914 . - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores). What is the relationship between 'haydn quartet ' and 'choir'? A:","completion":"The Haydn Quartet, later known as the Hayden Quartet, was a popular close harmony quartet in the early twentieth century. They were originally formed as a vocal ensemble to record for Edison Records and took their name as a homage to the classical composer Joseph Haydn. The quartet consisted of four singers who harmonized together, similar to a small choir. A choir, on the other hand, is a larger group of singers who perform together, often divided into sections based on voice types (soprano, alto, tenor, bass). Choirs traditionally perform a wide range of vocal music, including sacred and secular pieces from various historical periods and styles. The relationship between the Haydn Quartet and a choir is that both are vocal ensembles, but the Haydn Quartet was a smaller, close harmony group while a choir generally consists of a larger number of singers performing in multiple voice parts. Each ensemble has its own specific repertoire and performance practices, but both focus on the art of vocal music and harmonization among singers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: which happen first Reza Khan promotion or Tehran being seized by the Russians,","completion":"Title: Reza Khan's Promotion and the Russian Seizure of Tehran: A Glimpse into Iran's Turbulent Past Introduction In the early twentieth century, Iran found itself in a state of political and social upheaval, with foreign powers vying for control over its vast oil resources and strategically crucial position. Two significant events that transpired during this period were the rise and promotion of Reza Khan and the seizure of Tehran by Russian forces. This article intends to provide an in-depth exploration of these two incidents and determine their chronological order while shedding light on their historical context and significance. The Rise of Reza Khan Reza Khan was a military officer of Cossack origin, serving in Iran's Persian Cossack Brigade, a unit that was trained and officered by Russians. Born in 1878 in the Alasht village, Mazandaran Province, Reza Khan rose through the military ranks rapidly, mainly due to his abilities and ambition. His military prowess was undeniable, and he was widely renowned as a skilled and disciplined soldier, which allowed him to win favor within the Iranian elite circle. In February 1921, Reza Khan, collaborating with journalist-turned-politician Sayyid Zia'eddin Tabatabaee, orchestrated a coup d'état. Amid the disarray resulting from the country's weak central government and domestic turmoil, Reza Khan led the Persian Cossack Brigade into Tehran. He successfully gained control of the capital, forcing the government to resign. After the coup, Sayyid Zia became the prime minister, while Reza Khan was appointed commander-in-chief of Iranian military forces. Over the next few years, Reza Khan consolidated his power, subdued regional revolts, and unified the country. Ultimately, he established the Pahlavi dynasty in 1925, declared himself Reza Shah Pahlavi, and ruled Iran until his forced abdication in 1941, under pressure from the British and Soviet forces. The Russian Seizure of Tehran Iran's weakness and vulnerability towards foreign intervention at the turn of the twentieth century, combined with the geopolitical rivalries between Britain and Russia, led to the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907. This agreement effectively divided Iran into spheres of influence. Russia took control of the northern part of Iran, while Britain gained control over the southern regions. During World War I, Iran had proclaimed neutrality. However, due to its strategic geographical location, it became a battleground for the Entente and Central Powers. In 1915, Russian forces seized Tehran, primarily to secure their influence within the country, maintain control over its northern regions, and counter potential threats from the Ottoman Empire and Central Powers. The Russian occupation of Tehran continued until 1917 when the Bolshevik Revolution engulfed Russia, leading the Russians to withdraw their troops from Iran. Chronological Order Based on the historical context, it becomes clear that the seizure of Tehran by Russian forces occurred before Reza Khan's rise in Iran's military and political hierarchy. The Russian takeover of Tehran took place in 1915 during World War I, while Reza Khan's coup d'état and subsequent promotion occurred in 1921, marking the beginning of a new era in Iranian history. Conclusion The early twentieth century Iran was a theater of geopolitical rivalries, foreign intervention, and domestic turmoil. The Russian seizure of Tehran in 1915, followed by Reza Khan's rise to power and promotion in 1921, were significant events that shaped the subsequent trajectory of the country. Understanding the chronology and context of these incidents helps shed light on Iran's tumultuous past and provides a deeper insight into the nation's historical narrative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After the second World Trade Center crash, Boston Center managers recognized that both aircraft were transcontinental 767 jetliners that had departed Logan Airport. Remembering the \\"we have some planes\\" remark, Boston Center guessed that Delta 1989 might also be hijacked. Boston Center called NEADS at 9:41 and identified Delta 1989, a 767 jet that had left Logan Airport for Las Vegas, as a possible hijack. NEADS warned the FAA's Cleveland Center to watch Delta 1989. The Command Center and FAA headquarters watched it too. During the course of the morning, there were multiple erroneous reports of hijacked aircraft. The report of American 11 heading south was the first; Delta 1989 was the second. NEADS never lost track of Delta 1989, and even ordered fighter aircraft from Ohio and Michigan to intercept it. The flight never turned off its transponder. NEADS soon learned that the aircraft was not hijacked, and tracked Delta 1989 as it reversed course over Toledo, headed east, and landed in Cleveland. But another aircraft was heading toward Washington, an aircraft about which NORAD had heard nothing: United 93. United Airlines Flight 93 FAA Awareness. At 9:27, after having been in the air for 45 minutes, United 93 acknowledged a transmission from the Cleveland Center controller. This was the last normal contact the FAA had with the flight. Less than a minute later, the Cleveland controller and the pilots of aircraft in the vicinity heard \\"a radio transmission of unintelligible sounds of possible screaming or a struggle from an unknown origin.\\" The controller responded, seconds later: \\"Somebody call Cleveland?\\"This was followed by a second radio transmission, with sounds of screaming.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose The machine is working at optimal performance happens, how will it affect put water filled ice trays into the freezer. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of \\"The machine is working at optimal performance\\" has an indirect effect on the process of putting water-filled ice trays into the freezer. Step-by-step analysis: 1. Put water in an ice cube tray: The perturbation has no direct effect on this step, but it could be argued that having the machine work at optimal performance leads to better availability of cold water, which might slightly affect the time it takes for the ice cubes to freeze. 2. Put the ice cube tray in the freezer: If the machine (refrigerator/freezer) is working at optimal performance, this means that the freezer is maintaining the desired temperature consistently and efficiently. As a result, the freezing process will be more effective and could potentially reduce the time it takes for the ice cubes to freeze. 3. Wait 5 to 6 hours: With the machine working at optimal performance, it is likely that the time it takes for the ice cubes to freeze might be reduced. So the waiting time might be affected slightly depending on the specific performance of the machine. 4. Take the ice cube tray out of the freezer: The perturbation doesn't have a direct effect on this step, as taking the ice cube tray out is a manual action irrespective of the performance of the machine. 5. Bend the tray slightly to get the ice cubes out and into a drink: The perturbation doesn't have a direct effect on this step either. However, because the machine is working at optimal performance, it could ensure that the ice cubes are uniformly frozen, making the release of the cubes from the tray a bit easier. Overall, the supposed perturbation does have an indirect effect on the process, mainly influencing the freezing time and potentially the ease of releasing the cubes from the tray."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does \\"From the 1980s, there have been changes in the role of the pet dog, such as the increased role of dogs in the emotional support of their human guardians.\\" correctly answer the question of When did the role of dogs change to be more than guardians or walking companions?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"From the 1980s, there have been changes in the role of the pet dog, such as the increased role of dogs in the emotional support of their human guardians.\\" correctly answers the question of when the role of dogs changed to be more than just guardians or walking companions. The 1980s marked a significant shift in society's understanding and appreciation of the human-animal bond, particularly the bond shared between humans and their pet dogs. This shift can be attributed to various factors that contributed to the evolving role of pet dogs in people's lives. 1. Research on the Human-Animal Bond: The 1980s saw an increase in scientific studies exploring the potential physical, mental, and emotional benefits that could be derived from human-animal interactions. Researchers found that interactions with pet dogs could lead to lower blood pressure, decreased stress levels, and improved overall well-being. This awareness contributed to a broader understanding of the value of pet dogs in providing emotional support and companionship, beyond their traditional roles as guards and walking companions. 2. Changing Family Dynamics: With the rise in nuclear families and single-person households during the latter part of the 20th century, people increasingly turned to pets, particularly dogs, to fill the emotional void left by living alone or with fewer human family members. Consequently, dogs began to play a more significant role in providing companionship, affection, and emotional support to their human guardians. 3. The Emergence of Animal-Assisted Therapy: As the emotional and psychological benefits of interacting with pet dogs came to light, mental health professionals started incorporating dogs into therapy sessions to help treat patients dealing with depression, anxiety, and other mental health disorders. This therapeutic approach further highlighted the emotional support capabilities of pet dogs and reinforced their evolving role in human lives. 4. Service and Emotional Support Animals: Around this time, the use of service animals and emotional support animals also began to gain more recognition and acceptance. Dogs became widely known for their ability to assist people with physical disabilities, as well as provide emotional support to individuals struggling with psychological or emotional challenges. 5. Media Influence: The 1980s and subsequent decades saw a growing number of television shows, movies, and books portraying pet dogs as beloved and indispensable members of the family. These portrayals further contributed to the evolving perception of dogs as companions and emotional support providers, in addition to their traditional roles. In conclusion, beginning in the 1980s, various factors contributed to the growing recognition of the emotional support capabilities of pet dogs, in addition to their traditional roles as guardians and walking companions. This shift in perception can be attributed to the increased awareness of the human-animal bond, changing family dynamics, the emergence of animal-assisted therapy, the growing acceptance of service and emotional support animals, and the influence of media portrayals. Today, pet dogs continue to play diverse and essential roles in people's lives, serving not only as protectors and walking companions, but also as invaluable sources of emotional support, affection, and companionship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One of the country's 13 provinces and territories, British Columbia is located in the westernmost part of Canada, surrounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west, the Rocky Mountains to the east, and the US state of Alaska to the northwest. It is rich in natural wonders and diverse wildlife, making it an ideal habitat for bald eagles. British Columbia's abundance of vast forests, rivers, and marine areas create a perfect environment for the bald eagle, which is known for its preference in nesting near bodies of water. The bald eagle's population in British Columbia is known to be one of the largest in the world, with thousands of these birds calling the region home. They can often be found along the Fraser River, the salmon-rich rivers and estuaries of southwestern British Columbia, and around Vancouver Island. In the winter months, spectators can witness the annual eagle migration, where thousands of these awe-inspiring birds gather to feed on salmon in areas like Brackendale, Squamish, and Harrison Mills. Moreover, British Columbia's commitment to environmental conservation has led to the protection of many key bald eagle habitats. The province's vast system of parks, protected areas, and wildlife management policies provide a safe haven for these magnificent creatures. This further ensures the future sustenance of bald eagle populations and allows them to thrive not just in the United States, but also in Canada's British Columbia. In conclusion, while the bald eagle is often associated with the United States as its national bird and an important symbol of freedom, the magnificent creature can also be found in Canada's western province of British Columbia. The province's stunning landscape of forests, rivers, and marine areas create a thriving habitat for these awe-inspiring birds, as well as a host of other diverse and unique wildlife, making British Columbia an essential part of the bald eagle's story."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: It's illegal for the police to attach a GPS unit to your car without your permission, as the U.S. Supreme Court settled in 2012.But if the police are in hot pursuit of a bank robber or other escaping criminals that threaten public safety, a GPS tracker is acceptable. But exactly how can the police GPS track a car that is moving fast? The answer to that question comes from StarChase,a new police technology being used by a small but growing number of law enforcement agencies.It allows the police to fire 4.5-inch glue-covered GPS bullet-like projectiles from an air gun fixed in their police cars.If the GPS tracker makes contact with the escaping robber's car, it'll stick no matter how fast the vehicle is going.That way, the police will have a constant read on the car's location and heading.Aside from simply apprehending criminals,it's believed this new technology could help save lives.If the police successfully fire a GPS unit at a speeding criminal,they can pull back from a high-risk chase.Chases can be incredibly dangerous to all involved,including innocent bystanders and other drivers.Once the GPS bullet connects,there's no need for the chase any longer. Now,predictably,a GPS-loaded gun isn't cheap. Police departments need to pay about 5.000 per vehicle for the technology,and individual GPS bullets cost as much as 250 each.That may sound expensive,but remember:The alternative is often thousands of dollars in property damage,and great human cost in injury and lost life.According to Star Chase,their GPS bullet system has an apprehension rate of 80%without any report of inury or property damage.If you'd like to learn more about the StarChase system,Popular Mechanics has just published a good article about it.There's also plenty more information available at the company's website.

Answer: The Indianapolis Colts' almost exclusive use of the hurry-up offense led to Manning using an array of gestures and verbal commands to call the play at the line of scrimmage rather than in the huddle . Question: what year did peyton manning get drafted Answer:","completion":"Peyton Manning, widely regarded as one of the greatest quarterbacks in the history of the NFL, was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts in the 1998 NFL Draft. He was selected as the first overall pick, setting the stage for a prolific career with the team. Manning played 14 seasons with the Colts, from 1998 to 2010, before signing with the Denver Broncos in 2012 after missing the entire 2011 season due to a neck injury that required multiple surgeries. His tenure with the Colts was marked by impressive milestones and team success. By utilizing a hurry-up offense, Manning was able to make quick adjustments at the line of scrimmage, keeping defenses off-balance and allowing the Colts to maintain control of the game. He accomplished this through the use of numerous gestures and verbal commands that enabled him to communicate play calls, audibles, and other vital information to his teammates without the need for a traditional huddle. Peyton Manning's career achievements include five NFL MVP awards, two Super Bowl championships (one with Indianapolis in Super Bowl XLI and one with Denver in Super Bowl 50), and a Super Bowl MVP award. He retired following the 2015 season after 18 years in the league, and in 2021, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. Manning's on-field intelligence, leadership, and mastery of the hurry-up offense set a new standard for quarterback play in the NFL, serving as a model and inspiration for many future players."},{"prompt":"Question: Information: - Philadelphia is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the fifth-most populous city in the United States, with an estimated population of 1,567,442 and more than 6 million in the seventh-largest metropolitan statistical area, .

Given the background: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease. and the situation: Margaret is a sophomore in high school who just started her Spring break. With a week off from school, her family is spending some time driving out of state to visit her grandma, Kathy, who has a cabin up in the snowy mountains. Margaret always enjoys spending time with her grandma because she has interesting stories and makes some of the best pie around. Also, they always go skiing when visiting the cabin so Margaret is excited for that. Answer the following question: Who would be more likely to get lost on the mountain? Answer:","completion":"Given the background information and situation, it is more likely that Kathy, Margaret's grandmother, would be at a higher risk of getting lost on the mountain as compared to Margaret. There are several reasons that contribute to this conclusion, which I will outline below. 1. Age-related health issues: As mentioned in the background information, during late adulthood individuals face an increased risk of developing health issues such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer. These conditions may cause general weakness and even affect Kathy's stamina and endurance, making it more difficult for her to navigate the mountain terrain. A decline in physical health can also impact Kathy's cognitive abilities, which could further increase the chances of her getting lost. 2. Sensory and reflex decline: As people age, their sensory and reflex capabilities tend to decline. This means that Kathy's ability to see, hear, and react to changes in her environment may be diminished compared to Margaret's. Difficulty in interpreting sensory cues might make it harder for Kathy to recognize landmarks or follow a specific path while skiing, increasing the likelihood of her losing her way. 3. Weak immune system: A weakened immune system in older adults also makes them more susceptible to illnesses, which may impact their overall energy levels and physical capabilities. If Kathy were to fall ill while on the trip, her ability to navigate the mountain and keep track of her surroundings could be significantly impeded, putting her at greater risk of getting lost. 4. Increased prevalence of arthritis: The majority of older adults develop arthritis, which can cause pain, stiffness, and limited mobility. If Kathy has arthritis, it may affect her ability to ski, walk, or move comfortably through the snowy mountain environment. This discomfort and limited mobility may further contribute to her getting disoriented or lost on the mountain. 5. The risk of Alzheimer's disease: One in four older adults is at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, which can cause memory loss, confusion, and disorientation. If Kathy is one of those affected by Alzheimer's or has any other form of dementia, she may struggle with remembering routes, recognizing landmarks, or maintaining a clear sense of direction while on the mountain, substantially raising her chances of getting lost. In contrast, Margaret is a young, energetic, and presumably healthy high school sophomore. Her age and physical abilities give her an advantage in navigating the mountain and reducing the likelihood of getting lost. However, it is essential to consider that regardless of age, anyone can get lost in unfamiliar terrain, so it's crucial for both Margaret and Kathy to take necessary precautions, such as using maps, skiing with a buddy, and staying on designated trails."},{"prompt":"Facts: - discipline: road - updated: 2011-10-23 - birth date: 22 july 1988 - fullname: rasa leleivytė - name: rasa leleivytė - currentteam: vaiano - solaristech - birth place: vilnius , lithuania Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of rasa leleivytė .","completion":"Rasa Leleivyte, born on July 22, 1988 in Vilnius, Lithuania, is a professional road cyclist.

In a sodium chloride (NaCl) compound, the sodium (Na) carries a positive charge, and the chloride (Cl) carries a negative charge. To understand this better, let's look into the atomic structure and the nature of these ions in a more detailed manner. The sodium atom consists of 11 protons and 11 electrons. The protons are positively charged particles located in the nucleus of the atom, while electrons are negatively charged particles that orbit around the nucleus in distinct energy levels. The sodium atom has the electron configuration 1s²2s²2p⁶3s¹. The single electron in its outermost energy level (3s¹) tends to be removed easily in a process called ionization, resulting in the formation of a sodium ion (Na⁺) with a net positive charge due to the loss of one negatively charged electron. Na → Na⁺ + e⁻ The chloride atom, on the other hand, has 17 protons and 17 electrons. The electron configuration of a chlorine atom is 1s²2s²2p⁶3s²3p⁵, meaning it has five electrons in its outermost energy level and needs one more electron to achieve a stable electronic configuration. Chlorine atoms tend to gain one electron from other elements, resulting in the formation of a chloride ion (Cl⁻) with a net negative charge due to the addition of one negatively charged electron. Cl + e⁻ → Cl⁻ When sodium and chloride ions combine to form sodium chloride (NaCl), they do so through a process called ionic bonding. In this process, the sodium atom transfers its single outermost electron to the chlorine atom, creating a positively charged sodium ion (Na⁺) and a negatively charged chloride ion (Cl⁻). The electrostatic force between these oppositely charged ions holds them together in a crystal lattice structure. In summary, sodium and chloride ions have equal but opposite charges, with sodium ions carrying a positive charge (Na⁺) and chloride ions carrying a negative charge (Cl⁻). These ions form ionic bonds to create the compound sodium chloride (NaCl), which is commonly known as table salt."},{"prompt":"What key details about charlie fetoai can be extracted from the following bio?

It is the main river in eastern Afghanistan and is separated from the watershed of the Helmand by the Unai Pass. The Kabul River passes through the cities of Kabul and Jalalabad in Afghanistan before flowing into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan some north of the Durand Line border crossing at Torkham. The major tributaries of the Kabul River are the Logar, Panjshir, Kunar, Alingar, Bara and Swat rivers. - Afghanistan (Pashto/Dari: , \\"Afnistn\\"), officially the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, is a landlocked country located within South Asia and Central Asia. It has a population of approximately 32 million, making it the 42nd most populous country in the world. It is bordered by Pakistan in the south and east; Iran in the west; Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan in the north; and China in the far northeast. Its territory covers , making it the 41st largest country in the world. - The Kunar River (Urdu,), also called the Chitral River or the Kama River, is about 480 km long, located in northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, and eastern Afghanistan. The river system is fed by melting glaciers and snow of the Hindu Kush mountains. It is also part of the Indus watershed basin. - Durrani or Abdali is the name of a prominent Sarbani Pashtun tribal confederation in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Originally known by their ancient name \\"Abdali\\", which may derive from the more ancient \\"Ebodalo\\" (Bactrian: \\"\\" / \\"Hephthalites\\"). They have been called \\"Durrani\\" since the beginning of the Durrani Empire in 1747. The number of Durrani is estimated to be roughly 16% of the population of Afghanistan or 5 million individuals. Durrani are found throughout Afghanistan and Pakistan; although large concentrations are found in southern Afghanistan, they are also found to a lesser extent in east, west and central Afghanistan.

Often it starts as brief periods of abnormal beating which become longer and possibly constant over time. Most episodes have no symptoms. Occasionally there may be heart palpitations, fainting, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, or chest pain. The disease is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, dementia, and stroke. It is a type of supraventricular tachycardia. High blood pressure and valvular heart disease are the most common alterable risk factors for AF. Other heart-related risk factors include heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, and congenital heart disease. In the developing world valvular heart disease often occurs as a result of rheumatic fever. Lung-related risk factors include COPD, obesity, and sleep apnea. Other factors include excess alcohol intake, diabetes mellitus, and thyrotoxicosis. However, half of cases are not associated with one of these risks. A diagnosis is made by feeling the pulse and may be confirmed using an electrocardiogram (ECG). A typical ECG in AF shows no P waves and an irregular ventricular rate. AF is often treated with medications to slow the heart rate to a near normal range (known as rate control) or to convert the rhythm to normal sinus rhythm (known as rhythm control). Electrical cardioversion can also be used to convert AF to a normal sinus rhythm and is often used emergently if the person is unstable. Ablation may prevent recurrence in some people. Depending on the risk of stroke either aspirin or anti-clotting medications such as warfarin or a novel oral anticoagulant may be recommended. While these medications reduce this risk, they increase rates of major bleeding. Atrial fibrillation is the most common serious abnormal heart rhythm. In Europe and North America, as of 2014, it affects about 2% to 3% of the population. This is an increase from 0.4 to 1% of the population around 2005. In the developing world about 0.6% of... - Afghan (Pashto also Persian: ; see \\"etymology\\") refers to someone or something from Afghanistan, in particular a citizen of that country. Prior to the rise of the nation as Afghanistan, it was used by Persian speakers and those influenced by the Persian language to denote the Pashtun people. In modern times, \\"Afghan\\" is rarely used as an ethnic term for the Pashtuns, but is rather used as the national demonym for all citizens of Afghanistan Pashtuns, Tajiks, and also a large number of Hazaras, Uzbeks, Aimaqs, Turkmens, Balochs, Nuristanis, Pashayis, Pamiris, Arabs, and others. According to the \\"Encyclopædia Iranica\\", the word Afghan (afn) in current political usage means any citizen of Afghanistan, regardless of their tribal or religious affiliation. According to the 1964 Constitution of Afghanistan, all Afghans are equal in rights and obligations before the law. The fourth article of the current Constitution of Afghanistan states that citizens of Afghanistan consist of Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazara, Uzbek, Turkmen, Aymaq, Arab, Baluch, Pashayi, Nuristani, Qezelbash, Gujjars, Brahui, and members of other tribes. - Faisal Ahmad Shinwari ( or Fazal Hadi Shinwari ) ( 1927 -- February 21 , 2011 ) was the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Afghanistan from 2001 until 2006 .

Traditional homelands of Tajik people included present-day Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. - Stroke is when poor blood flow to the brain results in cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. They result in part of the brain not functioning properly. Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, feeling like the world is spinning, or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred. If symptoms last less than one or two hours it is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or mini-stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache. The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent. Long-term complications may include pneumonia or loss of bladder control. The main risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure. Other risk factors include tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, previous TIA, and atrial fibrillation. An ischemic stroke is typically caused by blockage of a blood vessel, though there are also less common causes. A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by either bleeding directly into the brain or into the space between the brain's membranes. Bleeding may occur due to a ruptured brain aneurysm. Diagnosis is typically with medical imaging such as a CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan along with a physical exam. Other tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood tests are done to determine risk factors and rule out other possible causes. Low blood sugar may cause similar symptoms. Prevention includes decreasing risk factors, as well as possibly aspirin, statins, surgery to open up the arteries to the brain in those with problematic narrowing, and warfarin in those with atrial fibrillation. A stroke or TIA often requires emergency care. An ischemic stroke, if detected within three to four and half hours, may be treatable with a medication that can break down the clot. Aspirin should be used. Some hemorrhagic strokes benefit from... - The blood vessels are the part of the circulatory system that transports blood throughout the human body. There are three major types of blood vessels: the arteries, which carry the blood away from the heart; the capillaries, which enable the actual exchange of water and chemicals between the blood and the tissues; and the veins, which carry blood from the capillaries back toward the heart. The word \\"vascular\\", meaning relating to the blood vessels, is derived from the Latin \\"vas\\", meaning vessel. A few structures (such as cartilage and the lens of the eye) do not contain blood vessels and are labeled. - Hamid Karzai (Pashto/Persian: ; born 24 December 1957) served as President of Afghanistan for almost ten years, from 7 December 2004 to 29 September 2014.

Write highlights for this article: Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown may have been slightly premature when he queried whether Radamel Falcao's lifeless outing at Deepdale on Monday night could have been his last in a Manchester United shirt. The misfiring Colombian is on loan at Old Trafford for the rest of the season, and United have a £43million option to make the deal permanent. But here are 10 reasons why they should not. Radamel Falcao was hauled off on the hour mark after yet another poor display for Manchester United. Falcao, pictured with Wayne Rooney on Monday night, has managed only four goals form 19 matches. It was another disappointing night for Falcao as he failed to complete the 90 minutes against Preston. Because he is not worth it... When you pay £6m to loan someone and then stump up £285,000-a-week in wages you expect something substantial in return. That has simply not happened. Even given United's spending power and windfalls from the adidas partnership and new TV deal this is a player who, so far, has not done anything to show why they should splash out £43m to secure his services permanently. Falcao is replaced by Ashley Young with United losing 1-0. They went on to win the fifth-round tie 3-1. Lies, damn lies and statistics... A Scots poet once said that statistics are used like a drunk uses a lamppost – for support and not illumination. However, they present a compelling case when it comes to the Colombian. With a paltry four goals in 19 games, Falcao has completed 90 minutes on a mere five occasions. At Deepdale, an hour yielded no shots on or off target, no assists and the grand total of 18 passes. The Colombian international made his way to the touchline once he realised his number was being held up. That miss against West Ham... Falcao can justifiably point to a lack of chances during his stint in a United shirt. The free-flowing red marauders of recent years now seem a distant memory as Louis van Gaal's men struggle to create openings. However, at Upton Park he was given a glorious opportunity. Clean through and with only the keeper to beat Falcao failed to control and prodded a tame volley wide. It was the kind of opportunity you would have expected him to relish and summed up a miserable season. Falcao spurned a brilliant chance against West Ham which summed up his disappointing season at United. Powerless at Preston... You would have thought Falcao, a man who has shone on the biggest stages, would have been licking his lips at a trip to a League One side. Not so much. Over the course of a difficult hour he failed to trouble an admittedly hard-working and physical third-tier backline and it surprised nobody apart from himself when he was hooked to gleeful cries of 'What a waste of money' from the home support. Impact on the rest of the team... It is just not working. Look at Monday night. After 60 minutes United were a goal down and heading for their earliest end to a hunt for honours in a season for 28 years. One-paced and one-dimensional, they were playing into burly Preston's hands. Off came Falcao, replaced by Ashley Young, and almost immediately they were playing with width and pace on their way to scoring three goals. This was not the first time Falcao's withdrawal has had a positive impact - something that will not have bypassed the meticulous Van Gaal. Ashley Young celebrates with Marouane Fellaini after the big Belgian fired United into the lead at Preston. Fellaini struck in the second half as Man United completed their comeback against the League One side. Injury doubts persist... This, simply put, is not the same player as the goal machine who succumbed to an anterior cruciate ligament injury last January. He is not sharp and still seems desperately short of match fitness. Falcao has now made 19 appearances for United - will he will ever regain the sharpness that made him one of European football's hottest properties? Jorge 'mouth' Mendes... The so-called super agent is an influential man and one who has a longstanding relationship with United. But when he starts criticising the manager you have to wonder if he needs reminding of who pays the bills. Earlier this month Mendes made the bold claim that Falcao would be firing at United if Sir Alex Ferguson was still manager. With that latest attack he may have sealed his client's fate. Agent Jorge Mendes appeared to suggest that Falcao would have had more success with former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson rather than under the current regime of Louis van Gaal. Not what United need... Van Gaal's relatively late arrival at Old Trafford meant that, for the second summer in a row, there was a lack of proper planning behind the club's moves in the transfer window. As a result, the Dutchman appears to have ended up with pieces from separate jigsaws. He knows that United need pace up front – that's why he's started untested rookie James Wilson ahead of Falcao more than once. With targets already identified for this summer United will not make the same mistakes twice. Falcao, pictured here during his side's 0-0 draw at Cambridge, appears to be short on confidence. Confidence issues... When you own a gold-plated mobile phone, pick up £285,000-a-week and have God-like status in your homeland you would imagine confidence is not an issue. But for Falcao it clearly is. The pressure of playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world coupled with the feeling that this season is a test created by the £43m clause appear to be weighing heavily on his shoulders. A striker without confidence is a striker without goals. Old father time... Van Gaal has always been a fan of promoting youth, something he did to great effect at Ajax. Falcao turned 29 earlier this month. If the deal was to be made permanent he would be looking for at least a three-year agreement which would take him to 32. United have moved away from their policy of not signing players without a resale value recently but in this case Falcao's age as well as his form is likely to count against him.","completion":"In light of Radamel Falcao's frustrating time at Manchester United, there are several reasons to consider why United should not permanently sign the Colombian striker. 1. Falcao has not demonstrated a significant return on investment. Manchester United paid a £6m loan fee and £285,000-a-week in wages, but so far, he has not justified that expense. 2. Falcao's statistics reveal a lackluster performance at Old Trafford, managing only four goals in 19 games and rarely completing a full 90 minutes. 3. The Colombian has spurned multiple scoring chances, including a glaring miss against West Ham, which underlines his below-par form. 4. Falcao's showing against Preston illustrated his inability to impose himself against lower-division teams, further questioning his value to United. 5. United's improved play after Falcao's substitution in several matches indicates that his presence may damage the overall performance of the team. 6. Falcao's injury woes persist, as he has not looked the same player since suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury in January 2014. 7. Whispers of discontent have emerged from Falcao's camp, with his agent, Jorge Mendes, voicing criticism of manager Louis van Gaal. 8. Falcao is not the player Van Gaal needs to bolster United's attack, as the manager is searching for pace and dynamism, which the Colombian has failed to demonstrate. 9. Confidence issues are plaguing Falcao, and the pressure of playing for a top club like United seems to be weighing heavily on his shoulders. 10. At 29 and with a hefty price tag, Falcao's age and lack of resale value might deter United from pursuing him as a long-term option."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now, let's analyze the story: At step 3, both Elizabeth and Ella are in the living room, and they both know the persimmon is in the green suitcase. Since Ella exits the living room at step 4, she is not aware that Elizabeth moves the persimmon from the green suitcase to the green box at step 5. This scenario aligns with scenario (3): an individual has a false belief about another individual's beliefs since Elizabeth has a belief about what Ella knows.

I was stationed on the Isle of Grain – a ghastly place but the first line of defence against invasion – and in our battalion of the Suffolks we had a number of professional musicians. So we formed an orchestra and played in the equivalent of the NAAFI during our spare time. I was the principal cello and we were conducted by the bandmaster, one Lieutenant Bonham. The other boys knew that I was longing to conduct and one day when Bonham fell ill with 'flu, they thought \\"old Barby\\" – as I was known – should have a go. It was really rather romantic – I was scrubbing the floor in the Officers' Mess when they came and invited me to take over. We did the Light Cavalry overture and Coleridge-Taylor's Petite Suite de Concert but I can't say I recall the rest of the programme. While in the army, Barbirolli adopted the anglicised form of his first name for the sake of simplicity: \\"The sergeant-major had great difficulty in reading my name on the roll-call. 'Who is this Guy Vanni?' he used to ask. So I chose John.\\" After demobilisation he reverted to the original form of his name, using it until 1922.On re-entering civilian life, Barbirolli resumed his career as a cellist. His association with Edward Elgar's Cello Concerto began with its première in 1919, when he played as a rank and file member of the London Symphony Orchestra. He was the soloist at another performance of the concerto just over a year later. The Musical Times commented, \\"Signor Giovanni Barbirolli was not entirely equal to the demands of the solo music, but his playing unquestionably gave a considerable amount of pleasure.\\" At the Three Choirs Festival of 1920 he took part in his first Dream of Gerontius, under Elgar's baton, in the LSO cellos. He joined two newly founded string quartets as cellist: the Kutcher Quartet, led by his former fellow student at Trinity, Samuel Kutcher, and the Music Society Quartet (later called the International Quartet) led by André Mangeot.

He later pleaded guilty to the felony of cocaine possession and two other misdemeanor charges: cannabis possession and possession of a \\"smoking device\\". After Dick completed an 18-month drug diversion program, a judge dismissed the felony and misdemeanor drug charges against him. On December 4, 2004, Dick was arrested for indecent exposure after he exposed his buttocks at a local McDonald's. On July 16, 2008, Dick was arrested in Murrieta, California, on suspicion of drug possession and sexual battery. He exposed the breasts of a 17-year-old girl when he allegedly grabbed and pulled down her tank top and brassiere. During a search of his person, police reported finding a small quantity of cannabis and one alprazolam (Xanax) tablet (for which Dick did not have a prescription) in his front pants pocket. He was released from jail after posting 5,000 bail. Dick eventually pleaded guilty to misdemeanor battery and marijuana possession. He was sentenced to three years probation, had to pay about 700 in fines, and was ordered to wear an alcohol-monitoring bracelet for one year. On January 23, 2010, Dick was arrested about 4 a.m. at a bar in Huntington, West Virginia, on charges of sexual abuse after reportedly groping a bartender and a patron. He was released from jail after pleading not guilty and posting 60,000 bail. On June 29, 2011, Dick was formally indicted by a Cabell County Grand Jury for two counts of first degree sexual abuse. Dick pleaded not guilty during a formal arraignment in Cabell County Circuit Court in Huntington on July 29, 2011. After receiving the not guilty plea, Judge Paul Ferrell set a trial date of January 17, 2012. After several delays, on May 21, 2012, Dick was given a six-month pre-trial diversion.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"In what year does the passage first mention Rahmon receiving scrutiny?\\" Context: \\"The nation almost immediately fell into civil war that involved various factions fighting one another; these factions were often distinguished by clan loyalties. More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses that led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The passage first mentions Emomali Rahmon, the president of Tajikistan, receiving scrutiny in 2010. It was in this year that Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). This scrutiny was primarily due to the Tajik Government's censorship and repression of media. The OSCE asserted that numerous Tajik and foreign websites were being censored. Additionally, it is mentioned that the government instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses. These inspections apparently led to the cessation of printing activities for several independent newspapers, marking a significant suppression of media freedom. As such, the year that Rahmon first encountered listed scrutiny in this passage was 2010."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Carousel is the second musical by the team of Richard Rodgers (music) and Oscar Hammerstein II (book and lyrics). The 1945 work was adapted from Ferenc Molnar's 1909 play Liliom, transplanting its Budapest setting to the Maine coastline. The story revolves around carousel barker Billy Bigelow, whose romance with millworker Julie Jordan comes at the price of both their jobs. He participates in a robbery to provide for Julie and their unborn child; after it goes tragically wrong, he is given a chance to make things right. The cast album of the 1945 Broadway production was issued on 78s, and the score was significantly cut--as was the 1950 London cast recording. Theatre historian John Kenrick notes of the 1945 recording that a number of songs had to be abridged to fit the 78 format, but that there is a small part of \\"Soliloquy\\" found on no other recording, as Rodgers cut it from the score immediately after the studio recording was made. A number of songs were cut for the 1956 film, but two of the deleted numbers had been recorded and were ultimately retained on the soundtrack album. The expanded CD version of the soundtrack, issued in 2001, contains all of the singing recorded for the film, including the cut portions, and nearly all of the dance music. The recording of the 1965 Lincoln Center revival featured Raitt reprising the role of Billy. Studio recordings of Carousel's songs were released in 1956 (with Robert Merrill as Billy, Patrice Munsel as Julie, and Florence Henderson as Carrie), 1962 and 1987. The 1987 version featured a mix of opera and musical stars, including Samuel Ramey, Barbara Cook and Sarah Brightman. Kenrick recommends the 1962 studio recording for its outstanding cast, including Alfred Drake, Roberta Peters, Claramae Turner, Lee Venora, and Norman Treigle. Both the London (1993) and New York (1994) cast albums of the Hytner production contain portions of dialogue that, according to Hischak, speak to the power of Michael Hayden's portrayal of Billy. Kenrick judges the 1994 recording the best all-around performance of Carousel on disc, despite uneven singing by Hayden, due to Sally Murphy's Julie and the strong supporting cast (calling Audra McDonald the best Carrie he has heard). The Stratford Festival issued a recording in 2015.","completion":"This text is about the musical \\"Carousel,\\" created by the team of Richard Rodgers (music) and Oscar Hammerstein II (book and lyrics). First staged in 1945, Carousel is an adaptation of Ferenc Molnar's 1909 play, \\"Liliom.\\" The musical shifts the setting from Budapest to the coast of Maine and tells the story of carousel barker Billy Bigelow and his love affair with millworker Julie Jordan. Their romance leads to the loss of their jobs and Billy's involvement in a tragic robbery, offering him a chance to make amends. The discussion further highlights recordings and adaptations of Carousel through the years, such as the original 1945 Broadway production's cast album, the 1950 London cast recording, the 1956 film adaptation, and various studio recordings released between 1956 and 1987. Theatre historian John Kenrick provides critiques on these recordings and recommends the 1962 studio recording featuring Alfred Drake, Roberta Peters, Claramae Turner, Lee Venora, and Norman Treigle. The text also mentions the 1993 London and 1994 New York cast albums of the Hytner production, both of which highlight Michael Hayden's portrayal of Billy.

The \\"magnificent and accurate\\" Shakespeare edition which Boydell began in 1786 was to be the focus of his enterprise—he viewed the print folio and the gallery as offshoots of the main project. In an advertisement prefacing the first volume of the edition, Nicol wrote that \\"splendor and magnificence, united with correctness of text were the great objects of this Edition\\". The volumes themselves were handsome, with gilded pages that, unlike those in previous scholarly editions, were unencumbered by footnotes. Each play had its own title page followed by a list of \\"Persons in the Drama\\". Boydell spared no expense. He hired the typography experts William Bulmer and William Martin to develop and cut a new typeface specifically for the edition. Nicol explains in the preface that they \\"established a printing-house ... [and] a foundry to cast the types; and even a manufactory to make the ink\\". Boydell also chose to use high-quality wove Whatman paper. The illustrations were printed independently and could be inserted and removed as the purchaser desired. The first volumes of the Dramatic Works were published in 1791 and the last in 1805. Boydell was responsible for the \\"splendor\\", and George Steevens, the general editor, was responsible for the \\"correctness of text\\". Steevens, according to Evelyn Wenner, who has studied the history of the Boydell edition, was \\"at first an ardent advocate of the plan\\" but \\"soon realized that the editor of this text must in the very scheme of things give way to painters, publishers and engravers\\". He was also ultimately disappointed in the quality of the prints, but he said nothing to jeopardize the edition's sales. Steevens, who had already edited two complete Shakespeare editions, was not asked to edit the text anew; instead, he picked which version of the text to reprint.

In the message Jim tells her that he meant what he said \\"in front of the girls the other night.\\" The message cuts off with \\"That you?\\" as he switches to answer an incoming call. The message leaves Linda looking mystified.Later she has resumed her chores when the doorbell rings. It's Sheriff Reilly (Marc Macaulay). He tells a stunned Linda that Jim died in a car accident \\"yesterday\\". As shock rings in her ears, he explains that Jim died instantly, hit by a jackknifed truck at mile marker 220. She declines the sheriff's offer of help - she's going to tough it out - and looks up as a flock of crows takes wing. She turns back into the house bewildered, tears streaming down her stony face.

Answer:","completion":"Given the context, Sasha would likely feel a combination of positive emotions after making many friends at the summer camp. It is important to note that emotions can differ based on individual personalities and experiences; however, based on the information provided, we can make some general assumptions about Sasha's feelings. 1. Happy: It is natural for people to feel happy when they make new friends and form connections with others. Establishing friendships can lead to shared experiences, teamwork, and camaraderie, which contribute to one's overall happiness. Therefore, Sasha would likely feel happy after making several friends at the camp. 2. Content: Feeling a sense of contentment is often linked to experiencing balance and satisfaction in one's life. By making new friends, Sasha might feel accomplished and content with their social life at the camp, creating a sense of belonging and inclusiveness. 3. Grateful: It's common for individuals to feel a sense of gratitude when they are able to form connections with others. Sasha may feel grateful for the opportunity to attend the summer camp and create long-lasting relationships, cherishing the memories made with each friend. 4. Confident: Forming friendships can have a positive impact on one's self-esteem and confidence. As Sasha builds connections with others and feels accepted by her new friends, it's likely that their self-confidence will grow as well. 5. Excited: Making friends in a new environment can generate excitement about future interactions and experiences. Sasha may be looking forward to spending time with her new friends, exploring various activities at the camp, and creating memories together. This anticipation can contribute to a sense of excitement. 6. Secure: Close friendships can provide emotional support and a safe space for individuals to express their thoughts and feelings. The connections Sasha forms at the camp may lead to a sense of security and trust in their relationships, fostering a positive atmosphere in which they feel comfortable discussing personal matters. 7. Nostalgic: After the summer camp has ended, Sasha might feel nostalgic for the time spent with her new friends. Reminiscing about memorable moments and shared experiences can evoke sentimental feelings, while also strengthening the bonds formed during the camp. In summary, given the context that Sasha made many friends at the summer camp, it is safe to assume a range of positive emotions would emerge as a result, including happiness, contentment, gratitude, confidence, excitement, security, and nostalgia. The specific intensity and combination of these emotions could vary based on Sasha's personality and individual experiences throughout the camp, but overall, it is clear that developing friendships would contribute to a positive emotional state."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After a few days of feeling terrible his brother comes by to check his temperature noting that it is 100.6°F. Given a person is recovering from a fever, will their body temperature be increasing or decreasing? Hint: White blood cells also make chemicals that cause a fever. A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest at this temperature. When the temperature is higher, the pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the temperature to kill them. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells. In these ways, a fever helps the body fight infection. Answer:","completion":"Given that a person is recovering from a fever, their body temperature will be decreasing. In the case of James, his body temperature is currently 100.6°F, which is higher than the normal body temperature of 98.6°F. This elevated temperature is a result of his body's immune response, specifically from the white blood cells, to fight off the bacterial infection causing his strep throat. As the body fights off the infection, the pathogens reproduce more slowly due to the raised temperature, and the immune system produces more white blood cells. Once the infection is under control or eliminated, the body will no longer need this elevated temperature. Consequently, the body temperature will decrease back to its normal range, indicating that recovery from the fever is taking place."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It was one of the last western colonial European powers to give up its overseas territories (among them Angola and Mozambique in 1975), turning over the administration of Macau to the People's Republic of China at the end of 1999. Consequently, it has both influenced and been influenced by cultures from former colonies or dependencies, resulting in immigration from these former territories for both economic and/or personal reasons. Portugal, long a country of emigration (the vast majority of Brazilians have Portuguese ancestry), has now become a country of net immigration, and not just from the last Indian (Portuguese until 1961), African (Portuguese until 1975), and Far East Asian (Portuguese until 1999) overseas territories. An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country's African possessions gained independence in 1975.

Movie title: Star Wars: The Clone Wars Movie plot: During the Clone Wars, Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi lead a small Republic clone army against the Separatist droid army on the planet Christophsis. Awaiting reinforcements, the two Jedi greet a shuttle carrying the young Jedi Ahsoka Tano, who insists that she has been assigned by Jedi Master Yoda to serve as Anakin's Padawan. Anakin begrudgingly accepts Ahsoka's apprenticeship, and the two succeed in deactivating the Separatists' energy field while Obi-Wan stalls the droid army commander, allowing a Republic victory, which makes Ahsoka earn Anakin's respect. Following the battle, Yoda arrives and informs the Jedi that crime lord Jabba the Hutt's son Rotta has been kidnapped. Anakin and Ahsoka are tasked with retrieving the Huttlet, while Obi-Wan is sent to Tatooine to negotiate with Jabba over a potential treaty between the Hutts and the Republic. Anakin and Ahsoka find Rotta on the planet Teth, where they are ambushed by Separatist forces led by Count Dooku's apprentice Asajj Ventress, discovering that Dooku hopes to frame the Jedi for Rotta's kidnapping. The Jedi manage to escape the trap along with R2-D2 and hijack a derelict transport with which they travel to Tatooine. Obi-Wan, alerted by Anakin, arrives on Teth and defeats Ventress in a lightsaber duel, though she manages to escape. Meanwhile, Senator PadmÃ© Amidala, Anakin's secret wife, learns of Anakin's mission and fears for his safety. She decides to contact Jabba's uncle Ziro in Coruscant. The Hutt refuses to cooperate, apparently believing that it is the Jedi who are responsible for the situation. PadmÃ©, however, soon discovers that Ziro has actually conspired with Dooku to have Rotta killed in order for Jabba to have Anakin and Ahsoka executed in return, which will force the Jedi Council, led by Yoda, to take Jabba into custody and allow Ziro to seize power over the Hutt clans.

A:","completion":"In the animated feature film Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Ahsoka Tano takes the real Rotta, son of Jabba the Hutt, to Tatooine. Specifically, this event unfolds as part of the film's primary plotline. After learning that Rotta has been kidnapped, Jedi Master Yoda assigns Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, the mission of retrieving the young Huttlet. This is a critical task as it also involves negotiating a potential treaty between the Hutts and the Republic. On their journey, Anakin and Ahsoka find Rotta on the planet Teth, where they themselves become engulfed in an ambush orchestrated by Separatist forces led by Count Dooku's apprentice, Asajj Ventress. It is revealed that Count Dooku plotted to frame the Jedi for the kidnapping of Rotta to disrupt the establishment of an alliance between the Hutts and the Republic. Despite being in a challenging situation, the two Jedi manage to escape the trap alongside their droid companion, R2-D2. They then hijack a derelict transport to escape the dangerous planet. Their chosen destination is Tatooine, as this is where Obi-Wan Kenobi, another Jedi Knight, is negotiating with Jabba the Hutt. Thus, Tatooine is ultimately where Ahsoka takes the real Rotta. The storyline continues with various subplots involving other important characters, such as Senator Padmé Amidala (Anakin’s secret wife) and Jabba's uncle, Ziro. However, the journey of Ahsoka with Rotta to Tatooine stands as a pivotal plot point in a complex narrative that intertwines galactic politics, questions of trust, and thrilling battles, which are the hallmarks of a Star Wars saga. This turn of events also reflects the crucial roles of Anakin and Ahsoka in the Star Wars franchise, showing their determination and resilience in the face of difficulties, and their commitment to their mission in the name of peace and justice. The sequence of how Anakin and Ahsoka manage to rescue Rotta and get him to Tatooine sets the stage for the rest of the film and influences subsequent events. It adds depth to the narrative and increases the stakes, enhancing the overall drama and tension of the film, thus making it potentially an appealing investment proposal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Different wavelength electromagnetic radiations have different uses. John is a physicist. He needed to find appropriate wavelength electromagnetic radiations for his experiments. To that end, he selected three electromagnetic radiations, microwaves, infrared light, and visible light. He noted microwaves as case A, infrared as case B, and visible light as case C. Hint: Infrared (IR) light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 0.7 and 300 micrometers, which corresponds to a frequency range between 430 and 1 THz respectively. IR wavelengths are longer than that of visible light, but shorter than that of microwaves. Infrared may be detected at a distance from the radiating objects by \\"feel.\\" Infrared sensing snakes can detect and focus infrared by use of a pinhole lens in their heads, called \\"pits\\".

Q:- Water in the clouds becomes very cold - The cold water forms ice crystals - The ice crystals grow by absorbing surrounding water droplets - Form snowflakes What might be the last step of the process? A:","completion":"The last step of the process involves the falling of the snowflakes to the ground. As the snowflakes grow in size and mass by accumulating more ice crystals and water droplets, they eventually become too heavy for the upward currents in the clouds to support them. When this happens, the snowflakes begin to descend towards the ground due to the force of gravity. As the snowflakes fall through the atmosphere, they might encounter varying temperature and humidity conditions. If the temperature remains below freezing throughout their descent (i.e., 0°C or 32°F), the snowflakes will maintain their solid state and reach the ground as snow. Upon impact with the surface, snow will accumulate and cover it, leading to a blanket of snow, commonly seen in colder climates and higher altitudes during the winter months. However, if the snowflakes pass through a layer of warmer air (above 0°C or 32°F) during their descent, they may partially or entirely melt, transforming from ice crystals into water droplets. This process is called melting. Depending on the atmospheric conditions, the droplets may either reach the ground as rain or undergo another phase change called refreezing, where they turn back into ice crystals or snowflakes before reaching the ground. This latter scenario leads to the formation of sleet or freezing rain. In summary, the last step in the process of snowflake formation is the falling of these snowflakes to the ground, where they either remain as snow or undergo melting or refreezing, depending on the temperature and humidity conditions they encounter while descending through the atmosphere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this and answer the question After running imperial military affairs in the states of Coahuila and Durango, General Agustín Enrique Brincourt made preparations to invade the state of Chihuahua. On July 8, 1865 Brincourt crossed the Nazas River in northern Durango, heading toward Chihuahua. On July 22 Brincourt crossed the banks of Río Florido into Ciudad Jiménez; one day later he arrived at Valle de Allende where he sent Colonel Pyot with a garrison to take control of Hidalgo del Parral. Brincourt continued through Santa Rosalia de Camargo and Santa Cruz de Rosales. President Juárez remained in the state capital until August 5, 1865 when he left for El Paso del Norte (present-day Ciudad Juárez) due to evidence that the French were to attack the city. On the same day, the President named General Manuel Ojinaga the new governor and placed him in charge of all the republican forces. Meanwhile, General Villagran surprised the imperial forces in control of Hidalgo de Parral; after a short two-hour battle, Colonel Pyot was defeated and forced to retreat. At the Battle of Parral, the French lost 55 men to the Republican forces. On August 13, 1865, the French forces with an estimated 2,500 men arrived at the outskirts of Chihuahua City, and on August 15, 1865, General Brincourt defeated the republican forces, taking control of the state capital. Brincourt designated Tomás Zuloaga as Prefect of Chihuahua. Fearing the French would continue their campaign to El Paso del Norte, President Juárez relocated to El Carrizal, a secluded place in the mountains near El Paso del Norte, in August 1865, . It would have been easy for the French forces to continue in pursuit of President Juárez across the border, but they feared altercations with American forces. General François Achille Bazaine ordered the French troops to retreat back to the state of Durango after only reaching a point one days travel north of Chihuahua City. General Brincourt asked for 1,000 men to be left behind to help maintain control over the state, but his request was denied. After the death of General Ojinaga, the Republican government declared General Villagran in charge of the fight against the Imperial forces. The French left the state on October 29, 1865. President Juárez returned to Chihuahua City on November 20, 1865 and remained in the city until December 9, 1865 when he returned to El Paso del Norte.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: In what year did the colony established by Robert Cavelier de La Salle fail?, using the article: The French colonization of Texas began with the establishment of a fort in present-day southeastern Texas. It was established in 1685 near Arenosa Creek and Matagorda Bay by explorer Robert Cavelier de La Salle. He intended to found the colony at the mouth of the Mississippi River, but inaccurate maps and navigational errors caused his ships to anchor instead 400 miles (640 km) to the west, off the coast of Texas. The colony survived until 1688. The present-day town of Inez is near the fort's site. The colony faced numerous difficulties during its brief existence, including Native American raids, epidemics, and harsh conditions. From that base, La Salle led several expeditions to find the Mississippi River. These did not succeed, but La Salle did explore much of the Rio Grande and parts of east Texas. During one of his absences in 1686, the colony's last ship was wrecked, leaving the colonists unable to obtain resources from the French colonies of the Caribbean. As conditions deteriorated, La Salle realized the colony could survive only with help from the French settlements in Illinois Country to the north, along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. His last expedition ended along the Brazos River in early 1687, when La Salle and five of his men were murdered during a mutiny. Although a handful of men reached Illinois Country, help never made it to the fort. Most of the remaining members of the colony were killed during a Karankawa raid in late 1688, four children survived after being adopted as captives. Although the colony lasted only three years, it established France's claim to possession of the region that is now Texas. The United States later claimed, unsuccessfully, this region as part of the Louisiana Purchase because of the early French colony. Spain learned of La Salle's mission in 1686.

Several competing Shan States came to dominate the entire northwestern to eastern arc surrounding the Irrawaddy valley. The valley too was beset with petty states until the late 14th century when two sizeable powers, Ava Kingdom and Hanthawaddy Kingdom, emerged. In the west, a politically fragmented Arakan was under competing influences of its stronger neighbours until the Kingdom of Mrauk U unified the Arakan coastline for the first time in 1437. Who was involved merger of the smaller states into the two largest factions of Myanmar ?","completion":"The merger of the smaller states into the two largest factions of Myanmar, the Ava Kingdom and the Hanthawaddy Kingdom, was a result of the political developments and power dynamics that emerged after the collapse of the Pagan Empire. The main groups involved in this process included the Burmans, the Shan migrants, and other local ethnic groups. 1. The Burmans: The Burmans, after the fall of the Pagan Empire, continued to hold significant influence in the region. Despite the political fragmentation, their presence and influence in the region were crucial to the formation of the Ava Kingdom in the late 14th century. The Ava Kingdom, also known as the Inwa Kingdom, emerged in the Upper Irrawaddy valley and had a predominantly Burman population. This Burman-led kingdom played a major role in consolidating power and unifying some of the smaller states in the area. 2. The Shan migrants: The Shan people arrived in the region along with the Mongol invasions and chose to stay behind after the Mongols retreated. They established several competing Shan States that dominated the entire northwestern to the eastern arc surrounding the Irrawaddy valley. These Shan States played a crucial role in shaping the region's political landscape during this period of fragmentation. Their influence also contributed to the emergence of the Ava Kingdom, which was influenced by both Burman and Shan cultures and power structures. 3. Other local ethnic groups: Various other local ethnic groups also played a role in the merger of the smaller states into the two largest factions. For instance, the Mon people were largely responsible for the formation of the Hanthawaddy Kingdom in the Lower Irrawaddy valley. This kingdom became a powerful and influential force in the region and played a key role in unifying territories along the coastline. 4. Neighboring powers: Neighboring countries and kingdoms, such as the Ayutthaya Kingdom of present-day Thailand and the Kingdom of Mrauk U in Arakan, also had a role to play in this consolidation process, either directly or indirectly, through political alliances, trade routes, and rivalries. To summarize, the merger of the smaller states into the two largest factions of Myanmar, the Ava Kingdom, and the Hanthawaddy Kingdom, involved multiple groups, including the Burmans, the Shan migrants, and other local ethnic groups. Their interactions and power dynamics shaped the political and territorial landscape of the region, ultimately giving rise to these two powerful kingdoms in the late 14th century."},{"prompt":"Q: Kai climbed to the top of the mountain.

It is a special night for noted astronomer Ted Lewis, who is preparing a special anniversary dinner with steaks for his beautiful, adoring wife Lana while observing the annual meteor shower of the Perseids. In another part of town, Tammy, a waitress at small local diner with big plans for the future, looks out her window and is excited to see a shooting star, which she takes as a good sign for her dreams. Suddenly \\"something shoots overhead and crashes\\" in the nearby mountains. Assuming it is a fallen meteorite, Ted wants to investigate in person. He reaches the supposed meteorite, which turns out to be an alien spaceship. Then his body is usurped by Urp, a well-meaning, tall, and metallic alien. Urp has discovered that the other passenger of his ship, the one-eyed monster known as Ghota has escaped. He needs to retrieve it and uses a human body to blend in with the locals.The Ghota consumes people in order to grow, multiply, and conquer. Its unquenchable appetite could mean the end of life on Earth. Urp is the only one who knows how to stop the hideous extraterrestrial. He enlists the aid of Tammy, the only human in town willing to believe and trust in his mission. The local police - including Chief Dawson and Officer Vern - are confirmed skeptics and offer little help. Together, Urp and Tammy must hunt down the Ghota and neutralize it before it consumes all the local inhabitants and uses the human fuel to multiply and conquer the world.

His profession as a funeral director, in which the Sultenfuss' residence is also a funeral parlor, has led Vada to develop an obsession with death as well as disease. Vada also thinks that she killed her own mother, since her mother died giving birth to her. She regularly tends to her invalid grandmother (Ann Nelson), who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. Harry's brother Phil (Richard Masur), who lives nearby, also stops by frequently to help out the family.Vada is teased by other girls because her best friend, Thomas J. Sennett (Macaulay Culkin), is unpopular and a boy. Their summer adventures from first kiss to last farewell introduce Vada to the world of adolescence.Vada's summer begins well. She befriends Shelley Devoto (Jamie Lee Curtis), the new make-up artist at her father's funeral parlor, who provides her with some much needed guidance.

Tough: Home Secretary Theresa May will push ahead with plans to 'deport first and hear an appeal later' Banks will be forced to carry out background checks to stop illegal immigrants opening accounts. The proposal – one of several in the long-awaited Immigration Bill – would force managers to check potential customers against a database of foreigners known to be in the country illegally. Applicants for a driving licence would also have to prove they were in Britain legally. Those who are unable to do so would be turned down. Ministers said the law would stop. illegal immigrants using public services and discourage them from coming. to Britain in the first place. The. stricter rules follow elements of the Bill already announced, such as. requiring private landlords to check the immigration status of tenants. Temporary. migrants, such as foreign students, would also have to make a. contribution to the NHS before they could use GP and hospital services,. following concerns about the cost of health tourism to the taxpayer. However, ministers are thought to have dropped a proposal to make GPs check the immigration status of new patients. Home. Secretary Theresa May will push ahead with plans to ‘deport first and. hear an appeal later’ in cases involving foreign criminals, terrorists. and illegal immigrants. Mrs. May told BBC News: 'I think most members of the public - if you’re. working hard - you want to know that people who are being given access. to rented accommodation to various other public services, to things like. bank accounts and driving licences, you want to say \\"well, hang on a. minute - if they’re here illegally, if they have no right to be here in. the UK, why is it that people are able to have access to these things?\\". 'Surely the Government should do something about it, and that is exactly what we’re doing.' She went on: 'Crucially,. in the Bill what we’ll be doing is addressing the issue that people get. fed up when they feel that people are able to come into the country and. access the health service without having contributed to it. 'So we will be asking for a surcharge. - there’ll be a sort of levy on people who are going to be coming here. to be staying for a while to contribute so that people can feel it’s. fair that actually people are being asked to contribute to public. services such as the NHS.' The proposal would force bank managers to check potential customers against a database of foreigners known to be in the country illegally. The shake-up of immigration law will let the Government remove dangerous migrants from the country while their cases proceed instead of having to let them remain in Britain for years during their appeal. In addition, the list of grounds for appeal will be slashed from 17 to just four. This is a response to the debacle of the deportation of Abu Qatada, who was flown home to Jordan in July after a 12-year legal battle. It is expected to cut the 68,000 cases lodged against the Government every year by more than half. The Bill will also:. Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: ‘The Bill will stop migrants using public services to which they are not entitled, reduce the factors which encourage people to come to the UK and make it easier to remove people who should not be here. ‘We welcome the brightest and best migrants who want to contribute to our economy and society. ‘Hard-working people deserve an immigration system that is fair to British citizens and legitimate migrants and tough on those who abuse the system and flout the law.’ Net migration has been cut by a third since 2010 but ministers fear a voter backlash if thousands of Romanians and Bulgarians come to Britain when border controls end in 2014. David Hanson, Labour's shadow immigration minister, said: 'Theresa May has a history of promising big and pretending all is well, but the Government is continuing to fail on immigration policy. 'This Government is still failing on immigration even on its own measures, with net migration now going up again rather than being in the tens of thousands as the Prime Minister promised.'

From the lower floors of the building, escaping through windows is possible, learn the best way of leaving through windows with the least chance of serious injury . The second floor windows are usually not very high from the ground. An average person, hanging by the finger-tips will have a drop of about six feet to the ground. It is about the height of an average man. Of course, it is safer to jump a short way than to stay in a burning building. Windows are also useful when you are waiting for help. Be sure to keep the door closed, or smoke and fire may be drawn into the room. Keep your head low at the window to be sure you get fresh air rather than smoke that may have leaked into the room.

Andy Dolan. Last updated at 9:17 AM on 28th February 2012. A grandfather who was so scared of being burgled that he slept downstairs in his armchair was throttled to death by a serial thief who had been released early. Paul Cox had taken to spending nights in his living room two years earlier after becoming the victim of burglaries only months apart. But his fear of being targeted again became a reality when he was killed by drunken intruder Cory Youlden, who escaped with a bag of coins and Mr Cox’s car. Serial offender: Murderer Cory Youlden had been out of prison on licence for just three months when he savagely strangled Paul Cox (right) The disabled grandfather’s body was. found hours later, slumped at the foot of his chair in the home he had. lived in for 55 years. Mr Cox died just four days before his 84th. birthday. Yesterday, Youlden, who had 24 other convictions, was jailed for life with a minimum tariff of 22 years for the savage crime. He carried out the attack three months. after being released on licence, half-way through a 42-month sentence. for three street robberies. After strangling Mr Cox in a headlock, he tried to erase forensic evidence by cleaning up with bleach, the court heard. He then left the house at Rednal,. Worcestershire, in his victim’s Ford Focus, having taken the keys along. with the cash from Mr Cox’s pocket. Prosecutor Alex Warren said Youlden,. 23, smashed a bay window to break in to the semi-detached home in the. early hours, after storming out of his girlfriend’s home during a row. The barrister added: ‘Mr Cox had been burgled on two previous occasions. in 2009. ‘He had started sleeping downstairs in a chair with a hammer because he was afraid of further burglaries.’ Mr Warren said that after a. confrontation in the rear sitting room – where Mr Cox was sleeping with. an electric fire on for warmth – Youlden left his victim ‘dead or. dying’. He said footprints matching Youlden’s. shoes were discovered upstairs while the defendant’s fingerprints were. found on the smashed window pane. Scene: Mr Cox was found dead in the living room of his home in Rednal, Worcestershire, in June last year. Police were called after a neighbour noticed Mr Cox’s car was missing. Mr Cox, who had separated from his. wife 40 years ago, suffered from coronary heart disease, was blind in. one eye and partially deaf, the court heard. He had carried out his national. service in the Royal Engineers, stationed in Palestine and Egypt, and. spent much of his working life as an engineer and toolmaker for. Cadbury’s. A post-mortem examination found the pensioner died of pressure to the neck. Youlden was arrested two days after the killing in June. By then he had sold Mr Cox’s car for £400. It was found burned out. Stephen Lineham QC, defending, told. Worcester Crown Court Youlden had had a ‘wretched life’, having been. fostered at 11 months and later adopted. Youlden, whose address was given as a hostel in Birmingham, admitted murder, theft and burglary earlier this month. Jailed: Worcester Crown Court (pictured) heard that Youlden had served half of a 42-month sentence for a string of street robberies when he murdered Mr Cox. The court heard the father of one, who. was first convicted at 14, had a string of burglaries and robberies to. his name. Judge Robert Juckes QC said Mr Cox had offered Youlden ‘little. by way of resistance’ but was nevertheless held in a headlock for. between 15 and 20 seconds. He told the defendant: ‘You not only killed him but you left him on the ground after taking from him money and keys. ‘You are a young man with an appalling record of burglary.’ Mr Cox is survived by his son Greg, 58, daughter Jane, 54, a brother and two grandchildren. In a statement, the family said it is. they ‘who feel they have the life sentence’, adding Mr Cox had been. living independently, ‘still able to enjoy life, have a pint, watch. sport and spend time with his family’. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Williamson, of West Mercia Police, said Youlden was ‘deceitful, callous and calculated’. The ‘tragic and brutal killing of a vulnerable man’ was ‘all the more senseless because Youlden gained very little, he added.

What is the full name of the person that thought the fairies were cardboard cutouts? Answer the above question based on the context below: In mid-1917 nine-year-old Frances Griffiths and her mother—both newly arrived in the UK from South Africa—were staying with Frances' aunt, Elsie Wright's mother, in the village of Cottingley in West Yorkshire; Elsie was then 16 years old. The two girls often played together beside the beck (stream) at the bottom of the garden, much to their mothers' annoyance, because they frequently came back with wet feet and clothes. Frances and Elsie said they only went to the beck to see the fairies, and to prove it, Elsie borrowed her father's camera, a Midg quarter-plate. The girls returned about 30 minutes later, \\"triumphant\\".Elsie's father, Arthur, was a keen amateur photographer, and had set up his own darkroom. The picture on the photographic plate he developed showed Frances behind a bush in the foreground, on which four fairies appeared to be dancing. Knowing his daughter's artistic ability, and that she had spent some time working in a photographer's studio, he dismissed the figures as cardboard cutouts. Two months later the girls borrowed his camera again, and this time returned with a photograph of Elsie sitting on the lawn holding out her hand to a 1-foot-tall (30 cm) gnome. Exasperated by what he believed to be \\"nothing but a prank\\", and convinced that the girls must have tampered with his camera in some way, Arthur Wright refused to lend it to them again. His wife Polly, however, believed the photographs to be authentic. Towards the end of 1918, Frances sent a letter to Johanna Parvin, a friend in Cape Town, South Africa, where Frances had lived for most of her life, enclosing the photograph of herself with the fairies. On the back she wrote \\"It is funny, I never used to see them in Africa. It must be too hot for them there.\\"The photographs became public in mid-1919, after Elsie's mother attended a meeting of the Theosophical Society in Bradford. The lecture that evening was on \\"fairy life\\", and at the end of the meeting Polly Wright showed the two fairy photographs taken by her daughter and niece to the...

Britain's request for military assistance from the Dominions at the outbreak of the Chanak Crisis the previous year had been turned down by Canada and South Africa, and Canada had refused to be bound by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. After pressure from Ireland and South Africa, the 1926 Imperial Conference issued the Balfour Declaration, declaring the Dominions to be \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another\\" within a \\"British Commonwealth of Nations\\". This declaration was given legal substance under the 1931 Statute of Westminster. The parliaments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State and Newfoundland were now independent of British legislative control, they could nullify British laws and Britain could no longer pass laws for them without their consent.

As young adults, Billy sells drugs and Andy does deliveries for him. One night, Trevor delivers instead and gets busted by narcs. 5 years later, Trevor is released from jail and learns his girlfriend Laura is now with Billy. Trevor gets back with her and decides to rob a local mobster. Trevor wants some cash to buy Laura some gifts and Andy was told by some local mobsters that they are investing money with huge profits and he wants some cash to buy in. However, their robbery is very sloppy and the head mobster quickly figures out what happened. However, he and Andy's grandfather were good friends, so he tells Andy and Trevor that they can work off what they owe by smuggling stolen diamonds. Billy finds out what is going on and is mildly amused by it until he realizes that Trevor has gotten back together with Laura behind his back. He retaliates by convincing the mobsters that Trevor is a junkie and is stealing the diamonds that he is supposed to be delivering to supply his habit. He also convinces the diamond dealer that Trevor cannot be trusted with real diamonds and he gives him fake diamonds instead. When he delivers them to the mob, they quickly spot them as fakes and assume Trevor switched them. Billy figured by doing this, the mobsters would send a goon to kill Trevor and with him out of the picture, he could have Laura back with no blood on his hands. However, since he was the one to notify the mobsters, they tell him if he wants Trevor dead he has to do the killing himself. He finds Trevor at Laura's house having just made love and kidnaps him at gunpoint. He takes Trevor to a field to kill him. Even though Trevor begs for his life and Billy struggles with his conscience for the briefest of moments, he pulls the trigger anyway, killing Trevor in cold blood. Answer:","completion":"In the given context, it is the local mobsters who tell Billy that he has to kill Trevor himself. Billy, who was already seeking a way to get rid of Trevor due to his rekindled relationship with Laura, convinces the mobsters that Trevor is a junkie and is stealing the diamonds meant for delivery. He further manipulates the diamond dealer to give Trevor fake diamonds, which eventually leads the mobsters to believe that Trevor had switched the diamonds.

His family relocated to Wyoming and his father opened a trading post at Fort Bridger. He attended school in a couple of small towns. At one point, his father took him to an Arapaho Sun Dance where he sat on the lap of Chief Yellow Calf and played a tom-tom made from buffalo skin. Hardin played drums for the high school band in Hurley, Missouri before losing his sight at the age of 16 in a farm accident on July 4, 1932, involving a dynamite cap. After learning the principles of music in several schools for blind young men across middle America, he taught himself the skills of ear training and composition. He studied with Burnet Tuthill and at the Iowa School for the Blind. He then moved to Batesville, Arkansas where he lived until 1942, when he got a scholarship to study in Memphis, Tennessee. Although the majority of his musical training was self-taught by ear, he learned some music theory from books in braille there. In 1943 Hardin moved to New York, where he met noted classical music luminaries such as Leonard Bernstein and Arturo Toscanini, as well as legendary jazz performer-composers such as Charlie Parker and Benny Goodman, whose upbeat tempos and often humorous compositions would influence Hardin's later work. One of his early street posts was near the famed 52nd Street nightclub strip, and he was well-known to many jazz musicians and fans. By 1947 Hardin had adopted the name \\"Moondog\\" in honor of a dog \\"who used to howl at the moon more than any dog I knew of\\".

He believed that terms such as \\"tonal\\", \\"modal\\" and \\"serial\\" are misleading analytical conveniences. For him there were no modal, tonal or serial compositions, only music with or without colour. He said that Claudio Monteverdi, Mozart, Chopin, Richard Wagner, Mussorgsky and Stravinsky all wrote strongly coloured music.In some of Messiaen's scores, he notated the colours in the music (notably in Couleurs de la cité céleste and Des canyons aux étoiles...)—the purpose being to aid the conductor in interpretation rather than to specify which colours the listener should experience. The importance of colour is linked to Messiaen's synaesthesia, which he said caused him to experience colours when he heard or imagined music (he said that he did not perceive the colours visually). In his multi-volume music theory treatise Traité de rythme, de couleur, et d'ornithologie (\\"Treatise of Rhythm, Colour and Birdsong\\"), Messiaen wrote descriptions of the colours of certain chords. His descriptions range from the simple (\\"gold and brown\\") to the highly detailed (\\"blue-violet rocks, speckled with little grey cubes, cobalt blue, deep Prussian blue, highlighted by a bit of violet-purple, gold, red, ruby, and stars of mauve, black and white. Blue-violet is dominant\\").When asked what Messiaen's main influence had been on composers, George Benjamin said, \\"I think the sheer ... colour has been so influential, ... rather than being a decorative element, [Messiaen showed that colour] could be a structural, a fundamental element, ... the fundamental material of the music itself.\\", what would be the answer ?

The reviewer starts by providing a context of the skits and jokes, mentioning that they are reminiscent of the type of content one would see on a Burlesque stage in the first half of the 20th Century, which may arouse the viewer's curiosity. They acknowledge that some jokes are appropriate for all ages, while others may be considered risqué. The admission that some jokes might be familiar to the older generation provides insight into the content’s characteristic humor. Despite these seemingly mixed observations, the reviewer acknowledges that the show is not too bad for what it sets out to accomplish. This statement suggests that the overall production quality and humor are adequate enough to entertain its intended audience. The mention of Robin Williams may also attract those interested in his performance, though the reviewer notes that his role is interchangeable with others. The only caveat the reviewer offers is the reminder that the content is representative of an older style of entertainment and may hold more historical value than modern comedic appeal or titillation. This statement is not necessarily negative, as it prepares potential viewers for what to expect and encourages them to appreciate the historical context of the show.

The equation given is: -309 = 97a + 724a - 67631 First, let's simplify the right-hand side by combining like terms: -309 = (97 + 724)a - 67631 -309 = 821a - 67631 Now, rearrange the equation by adding 67631 to both sides: 67631 - 309 = 821a 67322 = 821a To solve for \\"a\\", divide each side of the equation by 821: a = 67322 / 821 a ≈ 82 So, the solution to the equation -309 = 97a + 724a - 67631 is approximately a = 82.

(CNN) -- Food banks across the country kicked into high gear for the holiday season this week in an effort to feed America's hungry. But a few instead homed in on an often overlooked casualty of hard times -- the family pet. \\"It's the forgotten pets that go by the wayside,\\" said Ann King, founder of an Atlanta-based nonprofit group called Save Our Pets Food Bank. Appalled by tales of pet owners compelled to hand over their cats and dogs to shelters, King formed her organization in 2008 in an effort to provide cash-strapped owners a way to keep their canine and feline friends. Each year, between 3 million and 4 million cats and dogs in shelters are euthanized, according to The Humane Society of the United States, a Washington-based animal advocacy group. \\"I've had people say to me, 'I'm down to my last half bag (of pet food) and I don't know what to do,'\\" King said. \\"People sometimes just cry because they need help.\\" But King, also the pet food bank's executive director, said that unlike traditional food banks, her group doesn't typically benefit from a resource boost around the holidays. \\"Most people don't think to give to us and funding is a big problem,\\" she said. \\"A lot of the homeless shelters also don't allow pets. So a lot people often just drive up to the local animal control centers and push their dogs out,\\" unable to feed them, she added. Some people, out of work or under-employed, are forced to live in their cars but still refuse to say goodbye to their animal companions, she noted. \\"They don't want to turn their pets over to shelters, because many of the shelters are full and (their pets) will be put to sleep,\\" King said. \\"People don't realize that pets, they're family too.\\" One such family member is a 12-year-old German shepherd named Giorgio -- a favorite of Nadine Turner's late husband, who died of prostate cancer more than a decade ago. \\"He loved that dog,\\" said Turner, 57, who became homeless earlier this year after moving to Atlanta in search of work. \\"He's the last link that I have to my husband. \\"Whatever I do, I have to do my best to keep him alive.\\" Turner, a former business owner and insurance broker from Oakland, California, said she lost her business in 2009. Bunking with friends, she was ultimately forced to camp out on a park bench with her dog near a Kroger food market in downtown Atlanta. \\"No shelter would take me and that dog,\\" she said. She eventually turned to King's organization, which paid a week's motel bills, plus Giorgio's food and medicine. \\"I now have a job lined up with another Insurance company,\\" as well a prospective apartment for rent, noted Turner. But she still must find a way to pay a 350 deposit. \\"If I can't, me and Giorgio will be back in front of that Kroger's.\\" Turner's story is not unusual, noted King, whose group currently works with about 500 other food banks nationwide. She also partners with corporations such Del Monte and Mars, as well as the Halo Pet Foundation, headed by comedian and talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres. Since 2008, King's organization has swelled to more than 30 volunteers. And through corporate and private donors, it's shelled out more than a million pounds of pet food, trucking and mailing the donations to thousands of down-on-their-luck families. Nationwide networks, such as Rescue Bank -- with which King is affiliated -- have helped to connect the efforts of like-minded organizations. \\"Rescue Bank is doing for pets what the food bank network has successfully done for people in this country for more than 40 years,\\" said Debra Fair, vice president at Mars Petcare US. \\"This partnership is the perfect way to give much-needed support to the shelter and rescue communities and change the lives of homeless pets everywhere.\\" What was this article about?","completion":"This article discusses the efforts of food banks and nonprofit organizations to address the issue of hunger in America, focusing specifically on the often overlooked issue of feeding family pets during difficult times.

The article notes that between 3 million and 4 million cats and dogs in shelters are euthanized each year, according to The Humane Society of the United States. Many homeless shelters do not allow pets, and as a result, pet owners who are unable to afford food or shelter for their pets often feel forced to leave them at animal control centers or live in their cars with them.

How to wet sand a car Determine if wet sanding is right for your car. Wet sanding can be an excellent way to restore your paint to its original luster, but it isn't always the best option. Deep scratches that reach the metal, for instance, often cannot be repaired through wet sanding alone.","completion":"Step 1: Gather the necessary materials Before beginning the wet sanding process, make sure to gather all the necessary materials. This includes water, a spray bottle, sandpaper in varying grits (typically ranging from 1000 to 3000 grit), a sanding block or pad, microfiber towels, a bucket, and automotive soap. Step 2: Clean the car Wash the car thoroughly with automotive soap and water. This will remove dirt, grime, and debris, and minimize the chances of accidentally introducing scratches while wet sanding. Step 3: Soak the sandpaper Soak the sandpaper in water for at least 15 minutes before using it. This ensures that the sandpaper is properly saturated and prevents it from becoming too abrasive on the car's surface. Step 4: Begin wet sanding Starting with the lowest grit sandpaper (usually around 1000 grit), wrap the sandpaper around your sanding block or pad. Fill the spray bottle with water and begin spraying the area to be sanded. This helps to lubricate the sanding process and prevent scratches. Using even pressure, sand the area using a back-and-forth motion, occasionally spraying more water as needed. Step 5: Move to higher grit sandpapers As the deepest scratches and imperfections are removed, switch to higher grit sandpapers (e.g., from 1000 to 1500, then to 2000, and finally to 3000 grit). Ensure that the sandpaper is properly soaked before using it. This gradual progression helps to refine the surface and create a smoother, more even finish. Step 6: Rinse and dry After completing the wet sanding process, rinse the sanded area with water to remove any sanding residue. Dry the area thoroughly using a clean microfiber towel. Step 7: Inspect and repeat if necessary Inspect the sanded area for any remaining imperfections. If there are still noticeable scratches or uneven areas, repeat steps 4 through 6 until you're satisfied with the results. Step 8: Apply polish and wax Once the wet sanding process is complete and the desired level of smoothness has been achieved, apply car polish to the area to further refine the surface and enhance the paint's shine. Finally, apply a high-quality car wax to seal and protect the paint. By following these steps, you can effectively wet sand your car and restore its paint to its original condition. Keep in mind that wet sanding can lead to a loss of paint thickness, so it should be done sparingly and only when necessary to repair significant scratches and imperfections."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You may refuse by saying \\"Thank you for inviting me, but I will not be able to come. \\" If, after accepting, you are unable to go, be sure to tell those who are expecting you as soon as possible that you will not be there. Although it is not necessarily expected that you give a gift to your host, it is considered polite to do so, especially if you have been invited for a meal. Flowers, chocolate, or a small gift are all appropriate. A thank-you note or telephone call after the visit is also considered polite and is an appropriate way to express your appreciation for the invitation. Question: What can you do when a British friend says \\" Drop in any time\\"? Answer: Answer:","completion":"When a British friend says \\"Drop in any time,\\" it is important to understand that this expression is often used to make you feel welcome and does not necessarily mean that they expect you to arrive at their home unannounced. In British culture, it is more polite and appropriate to telephone your friend before visiting them at home to ensure that it is a suitable time for them to receive guests. If you were to visit your British friend, it would be best to respect their personal space and avoid dropping in unexpectedly, as this may result in an uncomfortable or inconvenient situation. Instead, you can use this expression as an indication that they are open to spend time together and cultivate an ongoing relationship. When you do plan to visit your friend, make sure to be respectful of their schedule and preferences. If you receive a written invitation for an event that requests an RSVP, be sure to respond promptly, letting the person who sent the invitation know whether or not you plan to attend. If you're unable to attend after initially accepting the invitation, it is important to inform the host as soon as possible to avoid any confusion or disappointment. When visiting a British friend, especially if you have been invited for a meal, it is considered polite to bring a gift for your host. Some appropriate small gifts include flowers, chocolates, or a token that reflects the host's interests. Additionally, it is nice to express your appreciation for the invitation and the time spent together by sending a thank-you note or making a telephone call after the visit. This thoughtful gesture is valued in British culture and can help strengthen your friendship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Hachette Book Group Inc. filed the suit in Manhattan Supreme Court Monday against “The Usual Suspects” actor for the 110,000 advance they paid him for a book that originally had a December 2009 deadline. The book, tentatively titled \\"Ready to Get Dangerous?\\", was part of a two book deal that Baldwin signed in 2007 with Hachette.

Q:Given the below context: In 1965, the activity on the main island diminished, but at the end of May that year an eruption began at a vent 0.6 km (0.37 mi) off the northern shore. By 28 May, an island had appeared, and was named Syrtlingur (Little Surtsey). The new island was washed away during early June, but reappeared on 14 June. Eruptions at Syrtlingur were much smaller in scale than those that had built Surtsey, with the average rate of emission of volcanic materials being about a tenth of the rate at the main vent. Activity was short-lived, continuing until the beginning of October 1965, by which time the islet had an area of 0.15 km2 (0.058 sq mi). Once the eruptions had ceased, wave erosion rapidly wore the island away, and it disappeared beneath the waves on 24 October.During December 1965, more submarine activity occurred 0.9 km (0.56 mi) southwest of Surtsey, and another island was formed. It was named Jólnir, and over the following eight months it appeared and disappeared several times, as wave erosion and volcanic activity alternated in dominance. Activity at Jólnir was much weaker than the activity at the main vent, and even weaker than that seen at Syrtlingur, but the island eventually grew to a maximum size of 70 m (230 ft) in height, covering an area of 0.3 km2 (0.12 sq mi), during July and early August 1966. Like Syrtlingur, though, after activity ceased on 8 August 1966, it was rapidly eroded, and dropped below sea level during October 1966.Effusive eruptions on the main island returned on 19 August 1966, with fresh lava flows giving it further resistance to erosion. The eruption rate diminished steadily, though, and on 5 June 1967, the eruption ended. The volcano has been dormant ever since. The total volume of lava emitted during the three-and-a-half-year eruption was about one cubic kilometre (0.24 cu mi), and the island's highest point was 174 metres (571 feet) above sea level at that time.Since the end of the eruption, erosion has seen the island diminish in size.

Read this: The first appearance of the term 'affirmative action' was in the National Labor Relations Act, better known as the Wagner Act, of 1935.:15 Proposed and championed by U.S. Senator Robert F. Wagner of New York, the Wagner Act was in line with President Roosevelt's goal of providing economic security to workers and other low-income groups. During this time period it was not uncommon for employers to blacklist or fire employees associated with unions. The Wagner Act allowed workers to unionize without fear of being discriminated against, and empowered a National Labor Relations Board to review potential cases of worker discrimination. In the event of discrimination, employees were to be restored to an appropriate status in the company through 'affirmative action'. While the Wagner Act protected workers and unions it did not protect minorities, who, exempting the Congress of Industrial Organizations, were often barred from union ranks.:11 This original coining of the term therefore has little to do with affirmative action policy as it is seen today, but helped set the stage for all policy meant to compensate or address an individual's unjust treatment.[citation needed] Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): Who did employers routinely hire?","completion":"The passage does not explicitly mention who employers routinely hired.

Day initially lived a bohemian lifestyle before gaining fame as a social activist after her conversion. She later became a key figure in the Catholic Worker Movement and earned a national reputation as a political radical, perhaps the most famous radical in American Catholic Church history. In the Catholic Worker in May 1951, Day wrote that Marx, Lenin, and Mao Tse-Tung \\"were animated by the love of brother and this we must believe though their ends meant the seizure of power, and the building of mighty armies, the compulsion of concentration camps, the forced labor and torture and killing of tens of thousands, even millions.\\" She used them as examples because she insisted that the belief that \\"all men are brothers\\" required the Catholic to find the humanity in everyone without exception. She explained that she understood the jarring impact of such an assertion: Peter Maurin was constantly restating our position, and finding authorities from all faiths, and races, all authorities. He used to embarrass us sometimes by dragging in Marshall Petain and Fr. Coughlin and citing something good they had said, even when we were combating the point of view they were representing. Just as we shock people by quoting Marx, Lenin, Mao-Tse-Tung, or Ramakrishna to restate the case for our common humanity, the brotherhood of man and the fatherhood of God. In 1970, Day emulated Maurin when she wrote: the two words [anarchist-pacifist] should go together, especially at this time when more and more people, even priests, are turning to violence, and are finding their heroes in Camillo Torres among the priests, and Che Guevara among laymen. The attraction is strong, because both men literally laid down their lives for their brothers. \\"Greater love hath no man than this.\\" \\"Let me say, at the risk of seeming ridiculous, that the true revolutionary is guided by great feelings of love.\\" Che Guevara wrote this, and he is quoted by Chicano youth in El Grito Del Norte.

The first question is about transferring contacts from a basic mobile phone to a smartphone, while the second question is about making free calls to mobiles or landlines in India from a smartphone or Android device. I can provide solutions for both questions. 1. Importing contacts from basic mobile to smartphone: Step 1: Check if the basic mobile phone has Bluetooth or an option to export contacts to a file (usually .vcf file format). Step 2a (Bluetooth Method): If the basic mobile supports Bluetooth, enable Bluetooth on both devices and make sure they're discoverable. Pair the devices and send contacts from the basic mobile to the smartphone. Step 2b (File Method): If the basic mobile can export contacts to a vCard (.vcf) file, save this file to the phone's storage or a microSD card. Transfer the file to the smartphone using a card reader, data cable, or via Bluetooth if available. Step 3: On the smartphone, locate the transferred .vcf file in the file manager app or contact app. Import the contacts by tapping on the file and following the prompts. 2. Calling a mobile or landline anywhere in India from a smartphone/Android for free: Step 1: Ensure that your smartphone is connected to the internet, either through Wi-Fi or mobile data. Step 2: Download and install a free calling app from the Google Play Store or App Store. Popular options include WhatsApp, Skype, Google Duo, and Viber. Step 3: Sign up or log in to the chosen app, and grant the necessary permissions it requests, such as access to your microphone and contacts. Step 4: Search for the contact you want to call within the app. If they too have the same app installed, you can make a free call over the internet.

Many innovations in automobile design were originally developed for economy cars, such as the Ford Model T and the Austin Mini. Gordon Murray, the Formula 1 and Mclaren F1 designer, said when designing his new Murray T.25 city car: \\"I would say that building a car to sell for six thousand pounds and designing that for a high volume production, where you have all the quality issues under control is a hundred times more difficult than designing a Mclaren F1, or even a racing car. It is certainly the biggest challenge I've ever had from a design point of view.\\" The alternative approach other than innovating to build a low cost car, is build a stripped down no frills version of a conventional car. - Walter Elias \\"Walt\\" Disney (December 5, 1901December 15, 1966) was an American entrepreneur, animator, voice actor and film producer.

He was presented with two Golden Globe Special Achievement Awards and an Emmy Award, among other honors. Several of his films are included in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress. - Herbie the Love Bug is an anthropomorphic 1963 Volkswagen Beetle , a character that is featured in several Disney motion pictures starting with the 1968 feature film The Love Bug .

These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue.

Will you be driving down a road to ruin without even knowing it this weekend? First on \\"20/20,\\" the change to something on the highway you never knew about.... Oh, damn! Here's David Muir. Good evening. Will you be driving down a road to ruin without even knowing it this weekend? First on \\"20/20,\\" the change to something on the highway you never knew about. Some say it killed their loved ones. Brian Ross, asking the tough questions, looking out for you. Reporter: Just after midnight on interstate 40 in North Carolina, where a guardrail meant to protect, almost killed. We need to get somebody out here quick. I'm starting to bleed to death. All right, sir. I'm trying to locate you. Reporter: The motorist hit the guardrail head-on after nodding off and was trapped in his car, bleeding out. I'm going to die. We're trying to get some help. Reporter: The long steel rail, seen in this photo from behind the driver and passenger seats, sliced through the SUV like a thick, sharp spear and then cut off his legs. I've lost my legs in a wreck. You're saying you lost both your legs, sir? Yeah. Reporter: 36-year old jay Traylor did survive, able to save his life with a makeshift tourniquet, but not his legs. In the wreck, this one was gone. Then, I had to make the choice to lose that one, too. Reporter: It wasn't supposed to happen. This test film from 15 years ago shows how a guardrail is supposed to absorb the impact, even in a head-on crash at 62 miles per hour. The truck hits what is called the end terminal, which like a sled on a rail, moves along the guardrail absorbing the impact and deflecting and spewing the rail off to the side. That's not what happened with jay Traylor. Had the guardrails done their job, I probably would've walked away just going, \\"Damn, I'm an idiot.\\" Reporter: Traylor and a growing number of accident victims across the country are suing the company that makes the guardrails, Trinity industries of Texas. Among the allegations that the company tried to save a few dollars by quietly making some slight changes in the design of what's called the Trinity et-plus. This is the original five inch et-plus. And this is the modified four-inch et plus. And that makes a significant difference? It makes all the difference in the world. Reporter: This animation shows what lawyers suing Trinity say happens with the original, gliding along the rail and diverting it to the side. And what they say can happen with the modified version. The thinner terminal jams up, breaks off and the rail drives through the vehicle. The impact is the guardrail does not have the room to expand like it needs to, to save your life. Reporter: 31-year old Rebecca dryer, a single mom from Pennsylvania, says she too was a victim of the change in the guardrail design, which pierced her car and cut off her right leg. I didn't understand what happened 'cause I didn't realize that it essentially was a spear that came through my car. Reporter: Rebecca, among those now suing Trinity, became angry and upset as she looked at the photos from her accident, the first time she had seen them. I very well could have not walked away from that. Wow. That's me? Reporter: By some estimates, there are now a half million of the re-designed Trinity guardrail terminals on highways across the country. Almost every state uses them. This failed. This is a classic failure. Reporter: But Trinity never told the federal highway administration about the changes until this man came along -- josh harman, the owner of a small, competing guardrail company who became entangled in a patent lawsuit with Trinity and had access to internal documents. You looked at the highway specs submitted to the federal government? Yes, sir. Were they in there? No, none of this was disclosed. Absolutely none of this. Reporter: Trinity officials call harman a liar and an opportunist, out to make a buck by stirring up frivolous lawsuits. He says he's out to prove a rash of accidents are tied to the guardrail changes kept secret from the government. They call you a sleazy operator. Oh, I'm sure they do. If I'm crazy, it's irrelevant. It's killing people. That's the most important thing. What I am has no bearing whatsoever. The fact that I found it, let's address that. Reporter: The company says the changes harman is talking about were \\"Inadvertently omitted\\" when it submitted documents to the federal highway administration. But an internal company e-mail obtained by ABC news shows Trinity engineers actually discussed keeping the change secret. Quote, \\"I'm feeling that we could make this change with no announcement,\\" unquote. So, even that one inch change should have been reported to the federal highway administration? Absolutely. You have to ask, why would they change it? What's the motivation for changing the one inch? Reporter: Harman says it is all about the bottom line, trying to increase profits at Trinity -- something the company denies. But according to the same internal Trinity e-mail, the engineers calculated that shaving off an inch would save about 2 for each end terminal. \\"That's 50,000 a year and 250,000 in five years by using the four-inch channel,\\" the memo reads. That's one of the motivations. The other motivation is reusability. And these changes, no question, ruin the terminal where it's not reusable. And that means millions to them. If you have an accident, the highway department has to buy a new one? You have to buy a new one. Reporter: Trinity has turned over two sets of safety crash tests to defend itself with federal highway officials and prove its modified version performs just as well as the original. And despite the growing evidence of gruesome accidents, federal officials accepted Trinity's defense, saying its new version meets federal safety standards. Mr. Artimovich, I'm Brian Ross from ABC news. Reporter: The official who made that decision is nick artimovich, who declined to talk with us until we showed up at an industry conference earlier this week. Why did you make that decision? Based on the evidence that was presented to us. And you think they're safe now on the highways? As I've said, please talk to our office of public affairs. You can't answer that question? No. Whether they're safe? Safety is a relative matter. Reporter: Artimovich is the same official who once expressed concern \\"That it is hard to ignore the fatal results.\\" But after Trinity officials asked for what they called an \\"Intimate\\" meeting with M, artimovich decided there was no problem with the new guardrail terminals. I did meet with Trinity. And do you feel they're safe? They have the met the crash testing as required. And what about the fatal accidents that you have been talking about? I'd really ask you to, to our office of public affairs. Reporter: So, the modified guardrails remained and remain on the road, including on this highway in Missouri where brad able, a father of four, ran into one earlier this year. It was a known defect. It was a defect that Trinity industries had known long before this accident in January, 2014. And when it locked up, it speared, punctured the driver side door and killed brad able. Reporter: The fact is, on a high-speed highway, any guardrail or stationary object presents a potential hazard. Trinity says the aftermath pictures of the fatal and serious accidents don't prove anything. That each accident has its own unique circumstances and that their product has a proven record of safety. Even so, federal highway officials told \\"20/20\\" this week that a nationwide review of the safety of all guardrails will soon begin. For Rebecca dryer, still dealing with the loss of her leg, not soon enough. They know what's wrong with them. Change them back, change the heads back to the ones that were safe, that weren't failing, that weren't having these problems. 'Cause how many more people do you want to lose limbs and go through all of this? So, what do you make of that? Is there something on the roads you want investigated?

New York City Answer:","completion":"Title: The Big Apple Circus Plot: The Big Apple Circus is a heartwarming film that revolves around a struggling yet talented circus troupe from a small Midwestern town called Sunnyside. Coined as the \\"Sunny Skies Circus Troupe,\\" the team aspires to be recognized and prove their worth in the world of circus arts and entertainment. When a renowned New York City Broadway event producer, Victor Mansfield, discovers the troupe's awe-inspiring performances, he invites them to showcase their talent in New York City as part of a prestigious annual circus festival. In the beginning, the Sunny Skies Circus Troupe is initially hesitant as they grapple with the possibility of leaving their hometown and have doubtful thoughts about competing against much larger circus acts. Their leader, Ethan, encourages the troupe to grasp the opportunity to chase their dreams and achieve the recognition they deserve. Together with the team's determination and passion, they embark on a journey to prepare for the performances of their lives. As the troupe arrives in New York City, they are overwhelmed by the grandness of everything in the so-called \\"concrete jungle.\\" It is here that the members of the Sunny Skies Circus Troupe must confront their fears and rattle against all odds. With a blend of comedy, drama, and thrilling moments, the film explores the character arcs of the troupe members, such as Veronica, the trapeze artist overcoming her fear of heights, and Oliver, the magician, honing his skills to deliver a mind-boggling performance for New Yorkers. The film also highlights the troupe's growing bonds as they navigate the city together and experience its vibrant culture. As the days inch closer to the grand performance at the annual circus festival, tensions run high, heightened by the mounting pressure and expectations to succeed on such a massive platform. A rival circus troupe, Sky High Flyers, consistently taunts and attempts to undermine the Sunny Skies Circus Troupe throughout the film. The rival team's leader, Darius, is especially eager to stop the newcomers from stealing the spotlight. However, the Sunny Skies Circus Troupe remains focused on their goal and works tirelessly to perfect their acts. On the day of the grand performance, unexpected mishaps occur, such as essential props going missing and dangerous traffic delaying their arrival at the venue. Instead of giving up, the troupe bands together, using their wit and ingenuity to overcome the hurdles that stand in their way. They arrive at the festival just in time, ready to perform their hearts out. In the end, the Sunny Skies Circus Troupe astonishes the crowd with a breathtaking fusion of circus art, athleticism, and entertainment. New Yorkers laud their performance, while Victor is left in awe of their potential. Moreover, they manage to win the hearts of the rival troupe, who grudgingly show admiration for their success. Filled with laughter, tears, and excitement, The Big Apple Circus is a testament to the enduring power of friendship, dreams, and triumph. The film concludes on a high note, as the Sunny Skies Circus Troupe shows the world that the greatest success stems from believing in one's talents and hard work, regardless of where they come from."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Via a flashback, we learn about the couple's humble beginnings and discover how they worked their way into the world of the nouveau riche. David is a Santa Rosa attorney with no clients, working on construction jobs with his law partner Robert Townsend to support his bride, who serves as the struggling firm's secretary. Finding herself pregnant, Joyce schemes to land Swanson, a former factory worker with a valuable steel-making patent, as a client. She succeeds at getting him to hire David alone, and when her plot eventually is discovered, Robert quits. David is furious with his wife, but she placates him by convincing him her sole intent was to help him and their unborn child. Back in the present, Joyce is forced to admit to her daughters their father has left her when a society columnist questions his move. She learns from a friend David has been seen with another woman and hires a private detective to investigate. Another flashback, and David, now an executive in Swanson's company, announces he has been transferred to San Francisco but wants to live in the suburbs. Joyce, longing for the excitement of city living, changes his mind. Eventually she meets Emily Hedges, and the two, bonded by their social-climbing aspirations, become close friends. An additional flashback which occurs in the not-so-distant past reveals Robert Townsend, in desperate need of 15,000, arrives at the Ramsey home to request a loan, and Joyce tells him David is away on business and she is unable to help him. Her husband learns of her lie and comes to his former partner's aid, accusing Joyce of being callous. Guess a valid title for it!

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Chocolat Context: The film begins with an adult woman named France, walking down a road toward Douala, Cameroon. While walking, she is picked up by William J. Park (Emmet Judson Williamson), an African American who has moved to Africa and is driving to Limbe with his son. As they ride, France's mind drifts and we see her as a young girl in Northern French Cameroon where her father was a colonial administrator. The story is conducted through the eyes of young France, showing her friendship with the \\"houseboy\\", ProtÃ©e, as well the sexual tension between him and her young and beautiful mother, AimÃ©e. The conflict of the film comes from the discomfort created as France and her mother attempt to move past the established boundaries between themselves and the native Africans. This is brought to a head through Luc Segalen (Jean-Claude Adelin), a Western drifter who stays with the Dalens family after a small aircraft crashes nearby. He makes public the evident sexual attraction between AimÃ©e and ProtÃ©e, prompting the mother to act on her desire. This results in a fight between Luc and ProtÃ©e, who consequently loses his in-house job and is moved to work outdoors in the garage as a mechanic. The title Chocolat comes from the 1950s slang meaning \\"to be cheated\\", and thus refers to the status in French Cameroon of being black and being cheated. Towards the end of the film, France's father reveals a central theme of the film as he explains to her what the horizon line is. He tells her that it is a line that is there but not there, a symbol for the racial boundary that exists in the country. This line is not a physical one but is still one that people widely recognize.

Article: Shundagarh is a village on India's east-facing coast.It is a village of simple mud and grass houses built on the beach just above the waterline.The Khadra Hills rise immediately behind the village,to a height of one hundred and fifty meters.A simple,good-hearted old man,whose name was Jalpur,farmed two small fields on the very edge of these hills.From his fields he could see the fishing boats that travelled up and down the coast.He could see the children playing on the sands;their mothers washing clothes on the flat stones where the Shiva River flowed into the sea;and their fathers landing the latest catch or repairing nets and telling stories that had no end. All Jalpur owned in the world were the clothes he wore day in and day out,the miserable hut that he slept in at night,a few tools and cooking pots--and his fields.The corn that he grew was all that made life possible.If the weather was kind and the harvest was good,Jalpur could live happily enough--not well,but happily.When the sun was fierce,and there was little or no rain,then he came close to the line between life and death. Last year the weather had been so kind,and the harvest promised to be so good,that Jalpur had been wondering whether he could sell all that he had and live with his son farther up the coast.He had been thinking about doing this for some years.It was his dearest wish to spend his last days with his son and his wife.But he would go only if he could give;he would not go if it meant taking food out of the mouths of his grandchildren.He would rather die hungry than do this. On the day when Jalpur decided that he would harvest his corn,sell it,and move up the coast,he looked out to sea and saw a huge wave,several kilometers out,advancing on the coast and on the village of Shundagarh.Within ten minutes everyone in Shundagarh would be drowned.Jalpur would have shouted,but the people were too far away to hear.He would have run down the hill,but he was too old to run.He was prepared to do anything to save the people of Shundagarh,so he...

The paragraph states that the population was 12,943 at the 2010 census, and it also mentions a decrease in the population due to the creation of the Newington Forest CDP. However, this information does not provide any indication of the population trend between 2010 and 2020 or make projections for the future. There are several factors to consider when projecting population trends, such as birth rates, death rates, and migration patterns. Without this pertinent data, it is not possible to accurately determine whether the population of Newington would decrease by 2020. Furthermore, it is important to recognize that population trends can be influenced by a wide range of factors, including socio-economic changes, demographic shifts, and government policies, among others. Long-term predictions require a comprehensive analysis of multiple data sources and a careful evaluation of these factors and their potential impact on population growth or decline. In conclusion, based solely on the information provided in the paragraph, it is not possible to confirm the statement \\"Newington's population will decrease by 2020.\\" Additional data sources and trend analyses would be needed to make an informed projection regarding the population of Newington in 2020 and beyond."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Reactions from Americans are mixed. More than half of the people questioned in a survey think e-cigarettes should be controlled by the US Food and Drug Administration, but 47 percent believe the e-cigarettes should be available to the smokers who want to quit. \\"In the hunt for a safter cigarette, e-cigarettes are becoming a popular choice among those either trying to quit.\\"or looking to replace standard tobacco smoke with an alternative that manufacturers claim to be safer, \\"Zogby International, which conducted the survey, said in a statement. About half of the 4,611 adults who took part in the survey had heard about e-cigarettes, which are battery-powered, or rechargeable cigarettes that vaporize a liquid nicotine solution. They do not produce smoke but a water vapor without smell. Sold mostly on the Internet, e-cigarettes were first made in China. Last year the World Health Organization (WHO) warned against using e-cigarettes, saying there was no evidence to prove they were safe or helped smokers break the habit. The WHO said people who smoke e-cigarettes breathe in a fine fog of nicotine into the lungs. Nearly a third of people questioned in the survey think that e-cigarettes should be allowed in places where smoking is forbidden, because they don't produce smoke, but 46 percent disagree. Men who were aware of the availability of e-cigarettes were more likely than woman to say they should be a choice available to smokers who want to quit. Young people, aged 18-29, and singles were the groups most open to trying e-cigarettes. Smoking is the single largest cause of preventable death worldwide, according to the WHO.

Possible answers: make sure they weren't bleeding, ignore the bruise, ask other people about her bruise The answer is:","completion":"Skylar will most likely want to make sure they weren't bleeding, and then assess the severity of the injury. After a fall at an ice-skating rink, it is a normal instinct for a person to examine the area for injuries, such as cuts or bruises. In this case, Skylar has noticed a bruise, which suggests that she has already gone through the initial examination of the area to assess any injuries sustained. Based on this context, there are several reasons why Skylar would want to ensure that she isn't bleeding before taking any further steps: 1. Prioritize her well-being: Before doing anything else, Skylar would want to make sure that there are no additional injuries, such as cuts or abrasions that may cause bleeding. This is essential as any bleeding could indicate a more severe injury that might need immediate medical attention. 2. Prevent further injuries: If Skylar were bleeding, she would want to prevent further injuries by promptly attending to the wound and halting any bleeding. This could involve applying pressure to the area, elevating the injured limb, or seeking help from others if necessary. 3. Safety and hygiene: Ice-skating rinks can be chilly and wet, which could cause any open wounds to become more susceptible to infection. Ensuring that she isn't bleeding can provide Skylar with the peace of mind to continue her ice-skating session without worrying about potential infection or complications. After making sure that she is not bleeding, Skylar might choose to ignore the bruise if it is small and not causing significant pain or discomfort. Alternatively, if the bruise is large, painful, or causes her concern, Skylar might approach other people at the rink to seek their opinions or ask if they have experienced a similar injury. This could provide her with reassurance and advice to properly care for her injury based on their experiences. In conclusion, the most likely action Skylar would want to take after falling at an ice-skating rink and discovering a bruise is to first make sure she isn't bleeding, and then decide on further actions based on the severity and discomfort of the injury. This could involve ignoring the bruise if it is not hindering her ability to continue skating, or seeking advice from others if she has concerns about the injury."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Rocky II Context: On New Year's Day, 1976, Apollo Creed has successfully defended his heavyweight title in a split decision, he and Rocky are taken to the same hospital. Apollo challenges Rocky to a rematch, but Rocky declines and officially retires from boxing. His girlfriend Adrian supports his choice, and so do his doctors, who reveal he will require surgery for a detached retina, which could lead to permanent blindness. In a private moment, Rocky goes to see a recuperating Apollo, and wants a truthful response if Apollo gave his all in the fight, to which Creed agrees. After Rocky is released from the hospital, he enjoys the benefits of his life's changes: Rocky's new fame attracts an agent who sees Rocky as a potential endorsement and sponsorship goldmine, and his sudden wealth encourages him to propose to Adrian. She happily accepts, and they marry in a small ceremony. Soon after, Rocky and Adrian happily learn that Adrian is pregnant. Meanwhile, fueled by hate mail, Apollo becomes obsessed with the idea that a rematch is the only way to prove that Rocky's performance was simply a fluke. Determined to rectify his boxing career's only blemish, Apollo ignores all pleas by his friends and family to forget the fight and move on to other potential opponents, and instead demands his team do whatever necessary to goad Rocky out of his hiatus and have a rematch with him. Rocky at first seems unaffected by Apollo's smear campaign, but his inexperience with money causes him to run into financial problems. After largely unsuccessful attempts to find employment, Rocky visits Mickey Goldmill, his trainer and manager, at his gym to talk about the possibility of returning to boxing. At first, Mickey declines, concerned about Rocky's health, but he soon accepts after Apollo publicly insults Rocky. Adrian confronts Rocky about the danger of returning to boxing and reminds him of the risk to his eyesight. Rocky argues he knows nothing else, so this is the only way he can provide.

Rowling's widely popular Harry Potter series, the residents of 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, are the Dursley family, who are the relatives and guardians of the story's protagonist, Harry Potter. Little Whinging is a fictitious suburb located in the county of Surrey, England. The Dursley family consists of Vernon Dursley, his wife Petunia Dursley (née Evans), and their spoiled son Dudley. Vernon and Petunia represent the epitome of a typical, narrow-minded suburban English family who display immense disapproval towards anything out of the ordinary. They have strong prejudices against the wizarding world due to Petunia's bitterness caused by her long-standing jealousy of her sister, Lily Potter (née Evans), Harry's mother. The Dursleys took in the orphaned Harry at a very young age after his parents were tragically murdered by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort. However, the Dursleys treated Harry poorly during his time with them, forcing him to wear Dudley's old clothes and occupy the small cupboard under the stairs as his bedroom until he was given Dudley's second bedroom. The Dursleys tried their best to keep Harry's wizarding heritage a secret, never telling him the truth about his parents or his magical abilities. Despite their cruel treatment towards Harry, the Dursleys remained his legal guardians, and he returned to 4 Privet Drive every summer during his time at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, as he was under magical protection at the residence due to his mother's sacrifice. The house at 4 Privet Drive serves as a significant symbol representing Harry's connection to the non-magical or Muggle world, and the location works as a stark contrast to the magical world he goes on to discover and embrace. Even though Harry's interactions with the Dursleys result in unpleasant experiences for the most part, the unpleasant household ultimately plays an essential role in shaping Harry's character throughout the series. It is during his time at 4 Privet Drive that Harry learns essential values such as humility, resilience, and the importance of friendship and family. The relationship between Harry and the Dursleys provides readers with one of the many examples of Rowling's exploration of the numerous complexities and gray areas found within human nature."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The parents of a toddler who lost both legs and an arm to meningitis are battling for a new vaccine to be introduced across the UK. Tommy Brown contracted the deadly disease at just five months old. He was given just a five per cent chance of survival after also developing blood poisoning and his heart stopping, meaning doctors had to bring him back from the dead. Now, a year after their ordeal, Tommy's parents Julie and Dean are campaigning for a revolutionary new meningitis vaccine to be made available to children across the NHS. Fourteen-month-old Tommy Brown (with mother Julie, father Dean and sister Ellie) contracted meningitis B at just five months old. He lost both legs, his right arm and the fingers of his left hand and was given just a five per cent chance of survival. Ms Tuckey, 37, said: 'Injuries and all, we prayed Tommy would live. It makes me cry to see him alert and looking about, then looking at where his hands and legs used to be, as if he is wondering where they are. 'It was so painful to see him suffer and go through the operations. But he is remarkable and is superb at adapting, we're lucky to still have our beautiful boy.' The ordeal began when mother-of-four Ms Tuckey, 37, and Tommy's father, Dean Brown, 28, saw their son's temperature skyrocket to over 37C. They took Tommy to his doctor, but his temperature continued to rise and he was eventually diagnosed with a throat infection. But by the morning, the youngster had a purple rash across his body and was rushed to Walsall Manor Hospital, where meningitis and septicaemia were finally diagnosed. Doctors also had to revive him as he technically died in A&E. The family is backing a campaign for a new vaccine to be introduced across the UK. It will protect against meningitis B, the most deadly form that Tommy had. Tommy's parents were then shocked to be told that he would have to lose one of his legs between the knee and ankle. But, after a five-hour operation, he had to have both legs, right hand and left hand fingers amputated in March 2012, followed by painful skin grafts. Ms Tuckey, who has three other children, Elle, 10; Demi, 18 and Lee, 19, said: 'It was a nightmare. I didn't go home for six weeks, I suffered bad dreams every night and spoke to a psychologist to help me cope with things. 'It was hard to see our clever boy, who was starting to move around in his walker, learn to cope without his limbs. 'But we know he will do us proud and achieve whatever he puts his mind to.' He was also dubbed 'the miracle boy' as the hospital told his parents 'we've never known a child so poorly. survive so many amputations, so young'. Marvel: Tommy was dubbed 'the miracle boy' by hospital. His mother Julie said: 'We were told the staff had never known a child so poorly survive so many amputations, so young' Tommy is now learning to walk using his new prosthetic. legs and can even kick a football. The. family are now assisting with the Meningitis UK and Meningitis Trust's. new national Meningitis B: Beat it Now roadshow and petition. The. UK has one of the highest Meningitis B incidence rates in the world,. affecting an average of 1,870 people each year. Meningitis B is the most. deadly form of the condition. One in 10 people affected will die and. one in four will be left with life-changing after-effects such as brain. damage or limb loss. Developed by pharmaceutical giant Novartis, Bexsero would be the first Meningitis B vaccine to be licensed for use in the UK. Hope: Tommy is now learning to walk using his new prosthetic legs and can even kick a football. Next month, the independent Joint. Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises the. Government on vaccination, will suggest whether Bexsero should be in the. childhood immunisation schedule. Meningitis UK and Meningitis Trust is a charity for the research and prevention of the disease and provides support services and after-care for sufferers. Mr Brown said: 'We strongly support the campaign as we don't want anyone else to go through what we have, it still impacts on us now and will for life. 'It's a horrendous disease that kills or leaves people like our Tommy with awful after-effects. 'It's simple - there should be no question - the Government needs to act and put this vaccine on the NHS immediately. 'It will save so many lives and stop others from suffering like Tommy, so everyone should rally behind Beat it Now.'

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Choices: (1). no (2). yes","completion":"(1). No The two questions are inquiring about different aspects of quitting smoking. The first question specifically asks about quitting smoking tea, while the second question is more general, asking about the effects of quitting smoking in general, without specifying a substance. Now let me provide detailed explanations for both questions: 1. What happens after you quit smoking tea? Quitting smoking tea can lead to several positive changes in your body and overall health. However, it's worth mentioning that smoking tea is a less common practice compared to smoking tobacco, and its health effects are not as widely researched. Typically, tea is consumed in the form of a beverage and provides a multitude of health benefits. When someone quits smoking tea, they may experience the following effects: - Improved lung function: Just like with quitting smoking tobacco or other substances, quitting smoking tea allows the lungs to gradually heal and recover from any damage caused by the smoke and toxins. Breathing may become easier and coughing may subside as the respiratory system clears excess mucus and debris. - Reduced risk of health complications: While smoking tea might not be as harmful as smoking tobacco, the risk of various health complications, including respiratory problems, heart problems, and cancers, may decrease after quitting smoking tea. - Heightened senses: As nicotine and other toxins are eliminated from the body, one's sense of taste and smell may improve. - Withdrawal symptoms: Some individuals may experience withdrawal symptoms after quitting smoking tea, such as irritability, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating. These symptoms usually resolve within a few days to a couple of weeks. 2. What happens after you quit smoking? Quitting smoking, particularly tobacco products like cigarettes, has numerous immediate and long-term health benefits. Some of the positive changes a person experiences after quitting smoking include: - Within 20 minutes: Heart rate and blood pressure begin to return to their normal levels. - Within 12 hours: Carbon monoxide levels in the bloodstream decrease, allowing for improved oxygen delivery to the body. - Within 2-12 weeks: Circulation improves, lung function increases, and physical activity becomes easier. - Within 1-9 months: Coughing and shortness of breath reduce as the lungs' ability to clear mucus and debris improves. The risk of respiratory infections also decreases. - Within 1 year: Risk of coronary heart disease is reduced by about 50%. - Within 5 years: The risk of stroke reduces, eventually reaching that of a non-smoker. - Within 10 years: The risk of lung cancer is lowered by 50%, and the risk of other cancers (such as mouth, throat, esophagus, bladder, cervix, and pancreas) also decreases. - Within 15 years: The risk of coronary heart disease becomes equivalent to that of a non-smoker. In addition to these health benefits, quitting smoking also leads to an improved sense of taste and smell, improved appearance of skin and teeth, increased life expectancy, and financial savings. In summary, although the two questions inquire about quitting smoking, they focus on different substances and, therefore, are not the same. Quitting smoking tea might bring some benefits related to lung function and reduced risk of health complications, while quitting smoking tobacco comes with a more extensive range of documented health improvements. Both habits, however, entail some level of risk, and quitting is typically beneficial to one's overall health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Sicily is a melting pot of a variety of different cultures and ethnicities, including the original Italic people, the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Saracens, Normans, Swabians, Aragonese, Lombards, Spaniards, French, and Albanians, each contributing to the island's culture and genetic makeup. About five million people live in Sicily, making it the fourth most populated region in Italy. In the first century after the Italian unification, Sicily had one of the most negative net migration rates among the regions of Italy because of the emigration of millions of people to other European countries, North America, South America and Australia. Like the South of Italy and Sardinia, immigration to the island is very low compared to other regions of Italy because workers tend to head to Northern Italy instead, due to better employment and industrial opportunities.

In New York City, 1934, jazz singer Dot Clark and her shady gangster boyfriend, Louie The Lug (\\"An Earful of Music\\"), are introduced. After having an affair with the deceased Professor Edward Wilson, Dot is now technically his common-law wife and heiress to 77 million. She has to go to Egypt to claim the money, and sets off with Louie in hopes of getting the cash. Former assistant to Edward Wilson, Gerald Lane, informs the law offices of Benton, Loring, and Slade of Professor Wilson's death and the fact that Edward's son, Eddie Wilson, Jr, is the rightful heir to the money. Mr. Slade, the lawyer, goes to a barge in Brooklyn where Eddie is living with his adopted father, Pops, an old stevedore, and his three sons, Oscar, Adolph, and Herman, who roughhouse Eddie. However, Eddie is managing to live a nice life nonetheless, with his girlfriend, Nora 'Toots', and his care for all the kids on the barge. He dreams of the day when he will have enough money to live his own life outside of the dirty barge (\\"When My Ship Comes In\\"). Moments later, Eddie is informed that he has inherited the 77 million and boards a ship bound for Egypt to claim the money. Aboard the ship is Colonel Henry Larrabee, a gentleman from Virginia who sponsored Eddie, Sr's exploration endeavors and wants a share of the money, as well. Eddie befriends his beautiful niece, Joan, and Dot and Louie realize that they are not the only ones traveling to Egypt.

Paragraph: Electric charge is a physical property. It occurs between particles or objects. It causes them to attract or repel each other. They do not even have to touch. This is unlike the typical push or pull you may be familiar with. All electric charge is based on the protons and electrons in atoms. A proton has a positive electric charge. An electron has a negative electric charge. Forces on Charged Objects Most atoms are balanced electrically. They have the same number of positive and negative charges. Therefore, the number of protons equals the number of electrons. Neutrons do not matter as they have no charge. When an object loses some electrons, it becomes positively charged. There are now more protons than electrons inside the atom. The lost electrons may remain free. Or, they may attach to another object. The new object now has more electrons than protons. It then becomes negatively charged. Question: \\"How will increasing neutrons affect the particle's charge?\\" Answer: \\"Increasing neutrons in a particle will make it's charge even more neutral\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: OPT: (I). no; (II). yes;","completion":"Answer: (I). no The given answer is incorrect because increasing the number of neutrons will not affect a particle's charge.

Answer:","completion":"The last step of the hibernation process for animals would be the awakening and reemergence from hibernation. As the season transitions from cold, snowy weather to warmer, more favorable conditions, the animals' internal clocks and environmental cues, such as increasing temperatures and daylight, stimulate them to wake up from their hibernative state. Upon awakening, the animals gradually regain their normal body processes, with their heart rate, breathing rate, and metabolic functions returning to their regular levels. This process may take several hours or even a few days, depending on the species and the duration of hibernation. Once fully awake, the animals will typically experience an increased appetite to replenish the energy reserves they lost during hibernation. They will spend much of their time foraging for food, as they need to regain weight and strength to ensure their survival and reproductive success in the upcoming season. Additionally, they may need to drink water to rehydrate themselves after the long period of inactivity. Following this period of recovery, the animals will resume their usual behavioral patterns, including social interactions, establishing territories, and mating. This marks the completion of the hibernation cycle, as the animals now focus on reproduction and survival throughout the warmer months, preparing themselves for the next cycle of hibernation when the seasons change again."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He prefers using fly fishing tackle and is planning a fishing trip up North with his buddies. They decided to take their trip in May when everyone can get off work over the Memorial Day holiday. Sam enjoys shad fishing as well, but the only time he and his buddies are able to take off work is during their slow season in March. and a hint : Shad are also valued as a sport fish that exhibit complex and little-understood feeding behavior while spawning. Unlike salmon, shad retain the ability to digest and assimilate food during the anadromous migration. Like other fish, their feeding instinct can be triggered by a variety of factors such as turbidity and water temperature. Anglers use both spinning and fly fishing tackle to pursue shad. Spin fisherman use a shad dartjig or a flutter spoon. Some anglers use a downrigger to place the artificial lure at the desired depth and location. This is usually in the channel, or deepest part of the river. Migrating shad tend to occupy the lower portion of the water column which makes this the typical depth of choice for fishing. In the North, April through June is when shad spawn in coastal rivers and estuaries once water temperatures have reached 58 degrees Fahrenheit (14 °C). Fishing conditions typically improve as water temperatures warm and flow decreases. Please answer this question : Who will have worse fishing conditions and likely catch less shad on their fishing trip, Jeff or Sam? A:","completion":"Sam will likely have worse fishing conditions and catch less shad on his fishing trip compared to Jeff. Sam and his buddies are going shad fishing in March, which is earlier than the typical shad spawning season in the North that occurs from April through June when water temperatures reach around 58 degrees Fahrenheit (14 °C). Fishing conditions generally improve as water temperatures warm and flow decreases, which is more aligned with Jeff's fishing trip in May during the Memorial Day holiday.

His data showed that in the beginning or twentieth century there were hardly any loss of ozone layer. He categorized that time period as time A. Further inquiry revealed that things didn't go well at the end of twentieth century - when there were severe loss of ozone layer. He categorized that time as time B. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would skin cancer be more prevalent or less prevalent in time A than in time B? The answer to this question is:","completion":"skin cancer would likely be more prevalent in time B than in time A. This reasoning is largely based on the role ozone layer plays in shielding life on Earth from the harmful effects of the Sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The ozone layer serves as Earth's natural sunscreen, absorbing most of the Sun's harmful UV rays. UV radiation is a known cause of skin cancer, as these high-energy particles can damage DNA in skin cells and lead to uncontrolled cell growth, eventually forming cancer. In Time A, the start of the twentieth century, Keith's studies show hardly any loss of the ozone layer. This suggests that the ozone layer was most likely close to its natural state, effectively protecting life on Earth from the majority of the Sun's harmful UV radiation. As a result, the rate of skin cancers caused by UV radiation exposure would have likely been lower, since individuals would have been less likely to be exposed to the DNA-damaging effects of UV radiation in significant amounts. In contrast, in Time B, which refers to the end of the twentieth century, severe loss of the ozone layer was experienced. This loss would significantly reduce the Earth's natural protection against the Sun's UV radiation, leading to higher levels of UVB, a particularly harmful type of UV radiation that could reach the Earth's surface. With more UV radiation permeating through, the risk of skin DNA damage and therefore skin cancer would increase correspondingly. It's vital to remember that while the ozone layer plays a significant role in regulating UV radiation levels, there are other factors that can influence skin cancer rates. These include behaviors and practices related to sun exposure, genetic factors, and the use of sun-protective measures. However, based largely on the status of the ozone layer, one would expect skin cancer to be more prevalent in Time B than in Time A. Overall, preserving the ozone layer is of upmost importance to prevent the rise of health issues related to increased UV exposure, including skin cancer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One way to find out is by using the ultimatum game, created by economist Werner Guth.Jack is given a pile of money and proposes how it should be divided with Jill.Jill can accept Jack's \\"ultimatum\\", otherwise the deal is off, and neither gets anything. Suppose Jack and Jill don't care about fairness, just about accumulating cash.Then Jack can offer Jill as little as he likes and Jill will still accept.After all, a little money is more than no money.But imagine, instead, that Jack and Jill both care only about fairness and that the fairest outcome is equality.Then Jack would offer Jill half the money; and Jill wouldn't accept otherwise.

Context: U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Saturday slammed China's militarization of disputed South China Sea islands, insisting that weapons systems recently deployed in the area were meant to intimidate and coerce Beijing's neighbors. The comments came during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian defense forum in Singapore. In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\\" Mattis said. Specifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam. \\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\\" Mattis added. Though much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China. Beijing has begun projecting power beyond its borders, most notably through the construction and militarization of islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea. China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan. Last week, the United States disinvited China from the Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC), a major international maritime exercise to be held later this year, citing Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea.

Article: Washington----A screaming intruder made it onto the front lawn of the White House Sunday while President Obama was at home before being caught by Secret Service officers. Secret Service spokesman Eric Zahren recognized the man as 40-year-old Brian Lee Patterson, whose last known address was in Albuquerque, N.M. Patterson has been caught trying to get onto the White House grounds at least three times before Zahren said. The bearded man, wearing blue jeans and a white T-shirt that read \\"God Bless America\\" jumped the fence outside the White House and ran across the north lawn while repeatedly crying, \\"I am a victim of terrorism!\\" Members of the Secret Service emergency response team, including one holding a barking dog, ran after Patterson with their guns and surrounded him near the row of cameras set up for television stand-ups. \\"I have intelligence information for the president,\\" he said, waving his arms in the air. \\"I'm not afraid of you.\\" Patterson screamed at the officers who were ordering him to lie ground with guns drawn. Patterson finally kneeled on the ground and was taken into custody shortly before 4 p.m. He cut his hand jumping the fence and was taken to George Washington University Hospital for treatment and was to appear in court Monday, Zahren said. Zahren said Patterson was charged with unlawful entry for the last time he jumped the fence, in February. He faces the same charge for Sunday's incident and also a contempt of court charge for disobeying the judge's orders to stay away from the White House. Question: Patterson didn't say _ .

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Because of their long life, fast switching times, and their ability to be seen in broad daylight due to their high output and focus, LEDs have been used in brake lights for cars' high-mounted brake lights, trucks, and buses, and in turn signals for some time, but many vehicles now use LEDs for their rear light clusters. The use in brakes improves safety, due to a great reduction in the time needed to light fully, or faster rise time, up to 0.5 second faster[citation needed] than an incandescent bulb. This gives drivers behind more time to react. In a dual intensity circuit (rear markers and brakes) if the LEDs are not pulsed at a fast enough frequency, they can create a phantom array, where ghost images of the LED will appear if the eyes quickly scan across the array. White LED headlamps are starting to be used. Using LEDs has styling advantages because LEDs can form much thinner lights than incandescent lamps with parabolic reflectors. What types of light can LEDs form better than incandescent? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"LEDs can form better types of light than incandescent in several ways, which include: 1. Directional lighting: LEDs emit light in a specific direction, which makes them efficient in creating focused and well-directed lighting. In comparison, incandescent bulbs emit light in all directions, requiring the use of reflectors and diffusers to direct and focus the light, which can lead to energy loss. 2. Smaller and thinner lights: LEDs are compact in size, allowing for the creation of much smaller and thinner lighting fixtures compared to incandescent lamps with parabolic reflectors. This gives designers more flexibility in terms of styling, especially in automotive lighting designs. 3. Faster rise times: LEDs have fast switching times and can light up fully in a fraction of a second, which is faster than incandescent bulbs. This feature is particularly advantageous for automotive brake lights and turn signals, providing drivers with more reaction time and improving overall safety. 4. High visibility during daylight: Due to their high output and focus, LEDs can be seen clearly even in broad daylight. This feature makes LEDs an ideal choice for brake lights, turn signals, and rear light clusters in vehicles. 5. Better color rendition: LEDs produce more vibrant and saturated colors compared to incandescent bulbs, which tend to have a yellowish hue that may distort the true colors of objects. This allows for better visibility, improved aesthetics, and easier identification of illuminated objects. 6. Longer lifespan: LEDs have a significantly longer life compared to incandescent bulbs, often lasting for tens of thousands of hours before they need to be replaced. This reduces maintenance and replacement costs, making LEDs a more cost-effective choice in the long run. In summary, LEDs can form better types of light in terms of directionality, size, rise time, daylight visibility, color rendition, and lifespan compared to incandescent light sources."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have a little math problem here that we need to solve for d. Here's the problem: 302 * d + 77 * d = -3032 Now, imagine you have 302 d's (like 302 little toy cars), and then you add 77 more d's (like 77 little toy cars). How many d's (toy cars) do you have in total? That's right, you just add them up: 302 + 77 = 379. So now you have 379 d's (like 379 little toy cars). But our problem says that these 379 d's are equal to -3032. So, 379 * d = -3032 Now, we need to find out how much just 1 d (1 little toy car) is worth. To do that, we need to divide -3032 by 379, the total number of d's (little toy cars) we have. -3032 divided by 379 is approximately -8. So, d is around -8. That means, each little toy car (d) is worth about -8 points. I hope this helps and makes sense!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The term can also be applied to a person who leads others to more abstract goals such as knowledge or wisdom. - Guru Ram Das (15341581) was the fourth of the ten Gurus of Sikhism. He was born on 24 September 1534 in a poor Hindu family based in Lahore, part of now Pakistan. His birth name was Jetha, he was orphaned at age 7, and thereafter grew up with his maternal grandmother in a village. - Guru (. IAST: \\"guru\\") is a Sanskrit term that connotes someone who is a \\"teacher, guide, expert, or master\\" of certain knowledge or field. In pan-Indian traditions, \\"guru\\" is someone more than a teacher, traditionally a reverential figure to the student, with the \\"guru\\" serving as a \\"counselor, who helps mold values, shares experiential knowledge as much as literal knowledge, an exemplar in life, an inspirational source and who helps in the spiritual evolution of a student.\\" The term also refers to someone who primarily is one's spiritual guide, who helps one to discover the same potentialities that the \\"guru\\"s already realized. - A teacher (also called a school teacher or, in some contexts, an educator) is a person who helps others to acquire knowledge, competences or values. - Sanskrit (English pronunciation:; written in Devanagari script ; : or ', originally ', \\"refined speech\\") is the primary sacred language of Hinduism and \\"Mahyna\\" Buddhism, a philosophical language in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. It was also a literary language that was in use as a \\"lingua franca\\" in ancient and medieval South Asia. It is a standardised dialect of Old Indo-Aryan, originating as Vedic Sanskrit and tracing its linguistic ancestry back to Proto-Indo-Iranian and Proto-Indo-European. Today it is listed as one of the 22 scheduled languages of India and is an official language of the state of Uttarakhand. As one of the oldest Indo-European languages for which substantial written documentation exists, Sanskrit holds a prominent position in Indo-European studies. - Pakistan (or ), officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, is a federal parliamentary republic in South Asia on crossroads of Central Asia and Western Asia. It is the sixth-most populous country with a population exceeding 200 million people. It is the 36th largest country in the world in terms of area with an area covering . Pakistan has a coastline along the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest and China in the far northeast respectively. It is separated from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's narrow Wakhan Corridor in the north, and also shares a maritime border with Oman. - Expert is defined differently in varying academic fields. Psychology defines an expert using superior performance; sociology considers that expertise is a label given to an individual by a group and is interested in the power held by experts; philosophy stresses the kind of knowledge held by experts but not novices. Informally, an expert is someone widely recognized as a reliable source of technique or skill whose faculty for judging or deciding rightly, justly, or wisely is accorded authority and status by peers or the public in a specific well-distinguished domain. An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive knowledge or ability based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study. Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study. An expert can be believed, by virtue of credential, training, education, profession, publication or experience, to have special knowledge of a subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may officially (and legally) rely upon the individual's opinion. Historically, an expert was referred to as a sage (Sophos). The individual was usually a profound thinker distinguished for wisdom and sound judgment. - Hindu refers to any person who regards themselves as culturally, ethnically, or religiously adhering to aspects of Hinduism. It has historically been used as a geographical, cultural, rather than a religious identifier for people indigenous to South Asia. - Lahore is the capital city of the Pakistani province of Punjab. It is the second largest and most populous city in Pakistan,and the 32nd most populous urban city in the world. The city is located in the north east part of Punjab province, near the border with India.

Movie plot title: A Shot in the Dark Movie plot: Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers) is called to the country home of millionaire Benjamin Ballon (George Sanders) to investigate the murder of his chauffeur, Miguel Ostos. The chauffeur was having an affair with one of the maids, Maria Gambrelli (Elke Sommer), and attacked her in her bedroom after she broke off with him. Miguel was shot and killed in her bedroom and Maria was found with the smoking gun in her hand, but claims no knowledge of how it got there as she maintains she was knocked unconscious. All evidence points to Maria as the killer, but Clouseau is convinced of her innocence because he has developed an immediate attraction to her. Realizing Clouseau has been inadvertently assigned to a high profile case, Commissioner Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) has him removed and personally takes charge of the investigation. Dejected, Clouseau returns home. He is awakened in the early hours of the morning by an apparent attempt on his life by a Chinese assassin. When the phone rings, the life or death struggle ceases and it becomes apparent that his assailant is his valet, Kato (Burt Kwouk), to whom Clouseau has given instructions to attack him when he least expects it to keep his senses sharp. The Inspector is reinstated to the Ballon case and immediately orders Maria Gambrelli's release from prison, as he is convinced she is shielding the real killer, who Clouseau suspects is Ballon himself. A series of additional murders of the Ballon staff follows. Each time the evidence points to Maria, who is continually arrested, only to have Clouseau release her again despite the growing number of murder charges laid at her feet. Clouseau's actions embarrass the SÃ»retÃ© in the press, but Commissioner Dreyfus is unable to remove him from the case because Ballon has exerted political influence to keep the unorthodox and seemingly incompetent detective assigned to the investigation.

Answer:","completion":"Clouseau was called to investigate the murder of millionaire Benjamin Ballon's chauffeur, Miguel Ostos, because he was an Inspector of the French police force, the Sûreté. At the beginning of the movie, the case comes across as a straightforward murder. It appears that Miguel Ostos had been involved in an affair with Maria Gambrelli, one of the maids, and attacked her in her bedroom. Miguel was subsequently shot in Maria's bedroom, with Maria found holding the smoking gun. Despite the seemingly clear evidence, Clouseau becomes convinced of Maria's innocence and believes she is protecting the real killer. Inspector Clouseau's determination to solve the case and prove Maria's innocence becomes even stronger when Clouseau develops an attraction to her. The plot further thickens as more murders of the Ballon staff occur, and each time, Maria is implicated, arrested, but then released by Clouseau. As the investigation continues, Clouseau's unorthodox and seemingly incompetent methods become a source of embarrassment for the Sûreté, particularly Commissioner Dreyfus. However, Ballon's political influence keeps Clouseau assigned to the case, despite Dreyfus's attempts to remove him. Throughout the movie, Clouseau's persistence in the investigation and his commitment to proving Maria's innocence lead to numerous comedic mishaps, further frustrating Commissioner Dreyfus and ultimately driving him to a nervous breakdown. In conclusion, Inspector Clouseau was called to investigate the murder of Miguel Ostos because it was his role as an Inspector of the French police force, the Sûreté. His involvement in the case led to a series of intense, and at times, hilarious situations and encounters, testing his sleuthing and deductive reasoning skills."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a list of colors, which can change your life. Blue/Purple Blue is considered to be peaceful and calming and it has the same effect on our health. The blue / purple color in food is due primarily to their anthocyanins which are antioxidants that are particularly heart healthy and may help support healthy blood pressure. Out of all the blue and purple foods available, blueberries are considered to have the highest antioxidant level. An analysis of the latest data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study found that people who eat purple and blue fruits and vegetables are at a reduced risk for high blood pressure and are less likely to be overweight. A food and health expert says that blue and purple color foods can prevent blood mass formation, and they also lower the risk of cancer. Foods that contain blue and purple colors are: reddish eggplant (especially the skin), blueberries, blackberries, purple grapes, etc. Green We all know that we should eat green as green symbolizes nature. The green foods are rich in isothiocyanates, which help resist cancer.

If Sasha is innocent, they might feel confused or upset about being accused. Step 3: Determine the most likely action Sasha would take based on their feelings and motivations. If Sasha is guilty, they might want to either confess to their actions or deny any involvement and try to come up with an alibi or explanation. If Sasha is innocent, they might want to defend themselves and offer any evidence or information that could help clear their name.

I can't stand his rage. I'm scared for me and the kids,\\" she wrote. Neighbors and friends have described the family as happy and loving, but it has become apparent that there were underlying issues going unaddressed. Police investigation revealed that there had been domestic trouble in the Boren family, and that Joshua Boren had been struggling with mental health issues, including depression and PTSD stemming from his work as a police officer. The local community is still reeling from the shocking event, and many are questioning how a man who was trained to protect and serve could commit such a terrible act against his own family. A memorial has been set up outside the family home, where mourners are stopping by to pay their respects and offer condolences. In the wake of this unthinkable tragedy, the community has come together to support each other and remember the lives of Kelly, her mother Marie, and her two children Jaden and Haley. School officials have set up counseling services for students and families affected by the devastating loss. As the community grieves, they emphasize the importance of recognizing and addressing mental health issues and the need for resources to support individuals and families in crisis. The local police department has vowed to re-evaluate its protocols when it comes to officers' mental health and well-being and how those concerns are addressed. The investigation into this tragedy continues, with authorities piecing together the details of Joshua Boren's life in an effort to understand why a decorated police officer, who had received commendations for his bravery and service, could perpetrate such an act. Unfortunately, as the community mourns and tries to come to terms with this senseless act, there may never be an answer that truly explains the painful loss experienced by the Boren family and their loved ones."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The US and other nations say there is growing evidence of Russian complicity in the crash. Meanwhile, heavy fighting is reported in the main rebel-held city of Donetsk.

The United States and Ukraine have criticized the rebels for what they say has been evidence of tampering and concealment at the crash site. Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, said at a briefing in Kiev that Ukrainian emergency responders had been forced to turn over recovered bodies to the separatists. And other Ukrainian officials said that the roadblocks to getting experts into the site, and the bodies away from it, all lay with the rebels. At the site itself, there was little sense of any order. Instead of a crime scene marked with police tape, helicopters scouring its 13 square miles and specialists poring over every detail, the area was a post-Soviet free-for-all playing out in a war zone, where most of the trappings of a modern state have fallen away. With the police mostly gone, for example, militiamen now respond to traffic accidents. “This is a disaster like no other,” said Michael Bociurkiw, the spokesman for the European security agency mission. The standard response, he said, is, “You secure the area, and then you go about the established business.” He added: “That hasn’t happened here.

Cows grazed in one of the fields near the fuselage. Army green stretchers, some with dark splotches of blood, lay on the matted grass near the road. “Body!” shouted one of the men who was wearing large, yellowish, mittenlike gloves and no mask. They dug harder, yanking unsuccessfully at a large hunk of metal that lay heavily on an unrecognizable body part.

A fourth asked: “Does anyone have a shovel?” American intelligence officials have said a proper investigation could answer crucial questions about who is responsible for shooting down the plane, but the hopes for retrieving anything useful from the site are dwindling with each passing day. Photo Two days after the crash, potentially decisive evidence was lying, seemingly undiscovered, in a recently harvested field about five miles from the central crash site: a large curled sheet of metal, apparently part of the outside of the plane, that had multiple, even holes torn into it. A weapons expert who reviewed photographs said the holes were consistent with a blast from a missile of the type American officials believe brought down the plane. Distrust poisoned the process. One rebel leader, Alexander Borodai, said Sunday that the plane’s flight recorder, which contains details about the plane’s status before it went down, had surfaced, but that he wanted to give it to international experts, not Ukrainians. Officials in Kiev have accused the rebels of trying to spirit the recorder to Moscow and released audio recordings that they claimed proved it. And Ukraine’s government said Sunday that it had captured 23 rebels who were all Russian passport holders. Nikolai, a coal mine worker, had driven 35 miners from their morning shift in a large, rusty white bus with blue stripes to help with the search. The miners walked seven in a line with an emergency worker, combing the fields for bodies and plane parts. Nikolai — who would give only his patronymic, Vasilievich, and not his last name — recently had his own tragedy. On Tuesday, a bomb hit his apartment building, killing his brother. Villagers blame the Ukrainian military, which they say was aiming at a nearby rebel base, though Ukraine denies that. “Tomorrow he would have been 55,” Mr. Vasilievich said, eating seeds in the shade of his bus. He blames the Ukrainians for shooting down the passenger jet, a common sentiment here.

He told of a small pack of foxes that ran through the wreckage at night, attracted by the smell. “They could have done it all with helicopters by now, flying over the fields,” said the rebel, who identified himself only as Vova, holding a rifle made in 1954. “Grief should bring people together.” Also gone was a trigger-happy rebel nicknamed Mosquito with a penchant for firing into the air when people disobeyed him. The European security agency monitors left the crash site on Friday after hearing shooting. But on Sunday they were walking around the site again, protected by guards, many of whom wore the blue camouflage pants and maroon berets of Ukraine’s disbanded special police. Since the crash on their doorsteps, villagers from Grabovo have gathered for prayers and laid flowers along the road. Yellow daisies rested on one piece of black metal at the site, and beside it lay a small stuffed doll in a purple dress, left as a tribute. President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine has claimed that rebels stole credit cards from the wreckage. One villager, Elena, who declined to give her last name, strongly disputed that. “That is a sin, a big sin in our faith,” she said. “This is a cemetery. Who would take from it?” ||||| Aleksander Borodai, a leader of pro-Russian rebels, handed over the two black box recorders from Flight MH17 shot down over Ukraine to Malaysian officials Tuesday morning. (Reuters) Aleksander Borodai, a leader of pro-Russian rebels, handed over the two black box recorders from Flight MH17 shot down over Ukraine to Malaysian officials Tuesday morning. (Reuters) After days of resistance, pro-Russian rebels on Monday yielded some ground in the crisis surrounding downed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 — handing over passengers’ bodies, relinquishing the plane’s black boxes and pledging broader access for investigators to the crash site. The developments offered some hope that an international investigation might clarify how the civilian jet carrying 298 passengers and crew members was shot down Thursday over territory held by the separatists in eastern Ukraine. Experts warned, however, that the site had been compromised. The breakthroughs came after days of international outrage over scenes of bodies decaying in meadows under a hot sun. The U.N. Security Council and world leaders had demanded that the rebels allow professional investigators unfettered access to the site. Still, underlining the intensity of the broader conflict, combat continued in eastern Ukraine. A rebel leader said he was skeptical about discussions to reach a temporary truce in the fight with the pro-Western government of Ukraine, which would have made it easier for experts to study the crash site. For its part, the Ukrainian military on Monday pressed an assault near Donetsk’s city center, 40 miles from the area of the crash. Artillery strikes hit targets near the Donetsk railway station and airport, including residential buildings, witnesses said. The government denied aiming at civilian facilities. 1 of 63 Full Screen Autoplay Close July 30, 2014 July 28, 2014 July 25, 2014 July 24, 2014 July 23, 2014 Wednesday July 22, 2014 Tuesday July 21, 2014 Monday July 20, 2014 Sunday Skip Ad × Picking up the pieces from Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 View Photos As hundreds of volunteers were combing the crash site for bodies and debris, friends and family members were trying to cope with their loss.

Sergei Karpukhin/Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. The Malaysia Airlines jet, the recovery of passengers’ bodies and the ensuing investigation have all fallen victim to the conflict that has raged since spring between the Ukrainian government and separatist groups that are armed, and in some cases led, by Russians. The Malaysian airliner was struck by a missile that Ukraine, the United States and many other governments believe was fired by separatists, though the rebels and Moscow have denied it and blamed Kiev instead. The rebels had allowed onlookers to roam around the crash site and had limited access to investigators while they dickered with international and Ukrainian authorities seeking to retrieve the bodies and assess evidence. Early Tuesday, the rebels handed over what they said were the plane’s black boxes. The transfer took place in a ceremony with a Malaysian delegation in the rebel-controlled regional administration building in Donetsk. The train carrying the bodies of Flight 17’s passengers is expected to arrive in Kharkiv around midday Tuesday, some 18 hours after it left the town of Torez near the crash site. A team of forensics experts from the Netherlands, France, Malaysia and Australia -- all countries whose citizens died in the crash -- are awaiting its arrival at a closed military base in the city of Kharkiv, said Esther Naber, a spokeswoman for the team. The forensics experts will take the 282 bodies and prepare them more properly for transport back to the Netherlands, she said. That involves placing the victims’ remains in better body bags and laying them in sealed coffins, she said. “That’s going to take some time,” she said, “because of the sad fact we have so many victims.” While it is possible the task could be completed by Tuesday evening, it is more likely that the bodies will not be flown back to the Netherlands until Wednesday morning, she said. All the bodies will be taken to the Netherlands for identification. View Graphic Satellite image of the debris field near Hrabove Late Monday, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said he had reached an agreement with Alexander Borodai, a rebel leader, for a Malaysian team to take custody of the two black-box data recorders from rebel fighters who had retrieved them and previously refused to turn them over. He also said international investigators would be guaranteed safe access to the crash site. Meanwhile, three Dutch investigators, whose access to the crash site was previously blocked by the Russian-backed separatists, began gathering evidence Monday. In an interview with CNN, Borodai insisted the separatists were eager for the bodies to be collected quickly. He said the rebels had been hampered by statements from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) that the separatists were responsible for any bodies that were moved. “It got to the point where it resembled, if not a horror movie, then black humor,” he said. “When an old woman comes to our rebel groups and says: ‘Look, there is a body of a headless man [that] fell through the roof straight onto my bed. Please take this man away.’ But the rebels say no, because they are following instructions.” Underscoring the antagonism that contributed to the delays, Borodai told reporters in Donetsk that the bodies and the objects that the rebels believed to be the black boxes would be handed over to “foreign experts, but not to the Ukrainian side.” He said that he was doubtful that talks with the OSCE on a temporary truce with the Ukrainian military would yield fruit. “I am not very optimistic about this meeting,” he said. “The previous ones had no results.” Even as final negotiations progressed over the train carrying the bodies, the Ukrainian military attacked the center of Donetsk. Its central train station was partially evacuated for several hours, although trains continued to run and the facility was not damaged, a representative of the station said. Ukrainian military authorities made no apologies for carrying out an assault just miles from where the team of international observers was gathering to inspect the scene of the plane crash. “This is a planned offensive,” said a military spokesman, Vladislav Seleznev. The military was trying to push rebels away from the airport, he said. “Aviation and artillery are not aiming at civilian residences. Their only aim is to block the terrorists and fighters.” Ukrainian President Petro Poro­shenko announced that the investigation into the crash would be based in the Netherlands. In remarks carried by the Ukrainian Interfax news agency, he described the rebels as “barbarians” who murdered 298 innocent people and then looted children’s toys from the luggage that dropped from the sky. He said the rebels had committed three crimes — shooting down the plane, treating the bodies with negligence and disrespect, and tampering with evidence. In Kharkiv, where the train bearing the bodies was headed, the focus was on getting the victims’ remains home. “I’m here because I hope I can help,” said Marina Kravchenko, an English-language teacher who volunteered to work at a government call center fielding inquiries from relatives of the passengers. “I don’t know what else to do.” Morello reported from Kharkiv. Annie Gowen in Kuala Lumpur, Natasha Abbakumova and Karoun Demirjian in Moscow, and Karen DeYoung in Washington contributed to this report. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"In 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) was shot down over eastern Ukraine, resulting in the deaths of 298 passengers and crew members. Pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine were accused of hindering the investigation and tampering with evidence, such as impeding access to the crash site, cutting off the flow of bodies to Amsterdam, and handling wreckage without proper equipment. Ukrainian military forces continued on their offensive despite pressure from world governments to hold the investigation without incident. The pro-Russian rebels eventually handed over the plane's black-box data recorders to a Malaysian team and allowed international investigators into the crash site.

Movie title: House of Wax Movie plot: Professor Henry Jarrod (Vincent Price) is a talented wax figure sculptor with a wax museum in 1890s New York City. He specializes in historical figures, featuring sculptures of John Wilkes Booth, Joan of Arc, and one of Marie Antoinette, which he considers his masterpiece. When his business partner Matthew Burke (Roy Roberts) demands more sensational exhibits to increase profits, Jarrod refuses. Jarrod then gives a private tour to renowned art critic Sidney Wallace. Wallace, deeply impressed with Jarrod's sculptures, agrees to buy Burke out, but will not be able to do so until after he returns from a continental trip. That same night, Burke deliberately sets the museum on fire, intending to claim the insurance money. In the process, he fights off Jarrod, who is desperately attempting to save his precious sculptures. Burke splashes kerosene over Jarrod's body and leaves him to die in the fire. Miraculously, Jarrod survives, but with severe injuries including crippled hands. He builds a new House of Wax with help from deaf-mute sculptor Igor (Charles Bronson) and another assistant named Leon Averill. Jarrod now concedes to popular taste and includes a \\"Chamber of Horrors\\" that showcases both historical crimes and recent events, such as the apparent suicide of his former business partner Burke. In reality, Burke was murdered by a cloaked, disfigured killer who then staged the death as a suicide. Burke's fiancÃ©e, Cathy Gray (Carolyn Jones), is murdered soon afterward. Her body mysteriously disappears from the morgue. Cathyâs friend Sue Allen (Phyllis Kirk) visits the museum and is troubled by the strong resemblance of the Joan of Arc figure to her dead friend. Jarrod explains he used photographs of Cathy when he made the sculpture. Unsatisfied, Sue returns after hours and uncovers the horrifying truth behind the House of Wax: many of the figures are wax-coated corpses, including Cathy and Burke.

This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned. She told me she appreciated the humor of the situation so there was no “hard feelings.” According to the above context, answer the following question.

Movie title: Spanglish Movie plot: The film starts with Cristina Moreno applying to Princeton University. She tells the story of her childhood in her college essay. Flor Moreno (Paz Vega) is a poor, Mexican single mother who is hired as the housekeeper for John (Adam Sandler) and Deborah Clasky (Téa Leoni), their kids Bernice (Sarah Steele) and Georgie (Ian Hayland), and Deborah's alcoholic mother Evelyn Wright (Cloris Leachman), a rich American family in Los Angeles. John is head chef at a popular restaurant, Deborah is a former businesswoman turned stay-at-home mother, and Evelyn is a former jazz singer. Flor speaks very little English. She does not mention that she has a daughter, Cristina (Shelbie Bruce). John, Evelyn, Georgie and Bernice are very likeable; Deborah, however, is uptight, her behavior often upsetting both households. Summer comes and Flor is needed 24/7 at the Claskys' summer home. Unable to communicate well in English, Deborah finds a neighbor to interpret. Flor reveals that she is unable to maintain these hours because she has a daughter, so Cristina is invited to come stay with them. Cristina interprets for her mother. She impresses Deborah, who begins to treat her like a daughter, taking Cristina shopping, getting her hair done, enrolling her in a private school, and showing her more love than she does the sensitive Bernice. Flor becomes unhappy when it appears that Cristina is influenced by Deborah, in part because she wants Cristina to keep in touch with her Mexican roots and working-class values, and partly because Deborah is overstepping her bounds. Flor objects to Deborah's actions to John, who apologizes. Flor loses her temper when she finds out that John has given Cristina over 600 in cash for a minor task.

The Embargo Act of 1807, adopted during the Napoleonic Wars, and the War of 1812 significantly curtailed Boston's harbor activity. Although foreign trade returned after these hostilities, Boston's merchants had found alternatives for their capital investments in the interim. Manufacturing became an important component of the city's economy, and by the mid-19th century, the city's industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance. Until the early 20th century, Boston remained one of the nation's largest manufacturing centers and was notable for its garment production and leather-goods industries. A network of small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the surrounding region facilitated shipment of goods and led to a proliferation of mills and factories. Later, a dense network of railroads furthered the region's industry and commerce. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What act was put in place during the Napoleonic wars and the war of 1812?","completion":"The act put in place during the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812 was the Embargo Act of 1807. This act significantly curtailed Boston's harbor activity, as it aimed to halt all foreign trade to protect American interests and to pressure Britain and France, who were engaged in warfare, into recognizing the rights of neutral countries like the United States. However, this act had massive economic consequences and was ultimately repealed in 1809, and Boston's merchants found alternative ways to invest their capital during this period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Cholesterol Cholesterol, from the Ancient Greek chole- (bile) and stereos (solid) followed by the chemical suffix -ol for an alcohol, is an organic molecule. It is a sterol (or modified steroid), a type of lipid molecule, and is biosynthesized by all animal cells, because it is an essential structural component of all animal cell membranes; essential to maintain both membrane structural integrity and fluidity. Cholesterol enables animal cells to dispense with a cell wall (to protect membrane integrity and cell viability), thereby allowing animal cells to change shape rapidly and animals to move (unlike bacteria and plant cells, which are restricted by their cell walls). Is this statement correct \\"is cholesterol an essential component of the cell membrane\\"?","completion":"Yes, the statement is correct. Cholesterol is an essential component of the cell membrane. It plays a vital role in maintaining both the structural integrity and fluidity of the cell membrane, which are important for the proper functioning of cells.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Who created the characters? Context: Just as Lee explores Jem's development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society, Scout realizes what being female means, and several female characters influence her development. Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, \\"Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child.\\" A:","completion":"The creator of the characters in this context is the author, Harper Lee.

He was sent to prison, where he committed suicide. Samantha Finley (Erin Marie Hogan), her older brother Thomas (Shane Van Dyke), and their mother Ellen (Fia Perera) believe that Ellen has been making contact with her deceased husband, David. Soon the family claims that a demon is haunting them. At first, they think it is David, but after a series of horrible attacks on Samantha, they suspect otherwise. One night the camera records Ellen sitting up in bed and leaving her bedroom. She walks into the living room, where she writes something on a piece of paper. She then crumples the paper and walks back down the hallway. Thomas finds the paper under Samantha's pillow and sees that it spells out the word \\"MARON\\". Thomas suggests that Ellen and Samantha stay at a hotel while he sets up traps around the house with bells and wire. When the bells ring, Thomas investigates.

In New Orleans, Mr. Haynie practiced law for one year, then joined the legal department of Johnson & Johnson in New Jersey. During World War II, Mr. Haynie joined the Naval Air Transport Service, quickly earned his pilot's wings and spent the war flying transport planes all over the South Pacific and up to Alaska. After the war, Mr. Haynie, who had been stationed in Alameda, settled in San Francisco. \\"I decided I wanted to get into the construction business,\\" he said in an interview years later, \\"but I didn't like home building. I liked the big jobs.\\" He worked for a while at the big contractor Swinerton & Walberg and then, during the latter part of the 1940s, met Edward T. Haas, a prominent local builder. \\"We were chasing the same jobs,\\" Mr. Haynie said a few years later. \\"The result was that we decided to team up.\\" The firm became Haas and Haynie and was responsible for projects that included St. Mary's Square garage in San Francisco, the Hillsdale Shopping Center and the IBM plant in San Jose. Mr. Haynie also built the Mauna Kea Hotel and golf course and the Kahala Hilton Hotel in Hawaii and the Ironwood golf course in Palm Desert (Riverside County). \\"Golf was the thing he loved most of all,\\" his wife, Eugenia Haynie, said Tuesday. \\"And he loved life and had many, many friends around the world.\\" In addition to his wife, Mr. Haynie is survived by two daughters, Catherine Haynie of Williamsburg, Va., and Carla Haynie of Arroyo Grande (San Luis Obispo County). Friday's memorial service will be at 10:30 a.m. at First Presbyterian Church, 1500 Easton Ave., Burlingame. The family suggests contributions to the Ross Resnick Lighthouse for the Blind, 215 Van Ness Ave., San Francisco CA 94102, or to one's favorite charity, in Mr. Haynie's memory.","completion":"A memorial service is scheduled for Robert M. Haynie, a renowned builder and developer responsible for iconic buildings like the Fairmont Hotel Tower in San Francisco and the Japanese cultural center, as well as several hotels and golf courses in California and Hawaii. Mr. Haynie passed away at the age of 86 on October 6 at the Magnolia Gardens Nursing Home in Burlingame. Born in Dendron, Virginia, he was raised in New Orleans and graduated from Tulane University's law school. After a brief period practicing law and working at Johnson & Johnson, he served as a pilot in the Naval Air Transport Service during World War II. Post-war, he moved to San Francisco and pursued a career in construction, working with Edward T. Haas to found the firm Haas and Haynie. The memorial service will take place at the First Presbyterian Church in Burlingame, with the family suggesting contributions to Ross Resnick Lighthouse for the Blind or a favorite charity in Mr. Haynie's memory."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Identify the emotions present in the text by comparing them to the list of emotions ['joy', 'sadness', 'surprise', 'fear', 'anger']. 3. Determine which emotion from the list does not fit the context of the text. 4. Provide the incorrect emotion label as a single, unambiguous answer. Step 1: Translating and understanding the text in English - \\"The funniest thing is that they didn't say no to me;)\\" The text implies a positive situation and a hint of surprise in the context, with a touch of humor. Step 2: Identifying the emotions present in the text: - The word \\"смешное\\" (funniest) indicates a sense of 'joy' in the context. - The phrase \\"мне не отказали\\" (they didn't say no to me) implies the presence of a 'surprise' element. Step 3: Since the text conveys largely positive and surprising emotions and is in a light-hearted tone, we can determine that 'anger', 'fear', and 'sadness' are irrelevant to the input text. The context of the text doesn't indicate any of those emotions. Answer: Since the question requires an unambiguous answer, I will select one emotion as the most incorrect emotion label. In this case, I think 'anger' is the most irrelevant emotion in the context of the given text."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Output:","completion":"Hannah bought 17 soymilk exactly, and they are sold in packages of 2 or 3. Let's denote the number of packages of 2 as x, and the number of packages of 3 as y. Therefore, the equation can be formulated as: 2x + 3y = 17 We are to find possible values for y (large packs with 3 soymilk). To do this, we will test different values for x and see if they result in a valid value for y: 1. If x = 0: 2(0) + 3y = 17 0 + 3y = 17 3y = 17 y = 17/3 Since y is not a whole number in this case, this is not a valid solution. 2. If x = 1: 2(1) + 3y = 17 2 + 3y = 17 3y = 15 y = 15/3 y = 5 In this case, we get a whole number for y, so if Hannah buys one pack of 2 soymilk (x = 1) and five packs of 3 soymilk (y = 5), she would have 17 soymilks in total.

This article: Holst's settings of Indian texts formed only a part of his compositional output in the period 1900 to 1914. A highly significant factor in his musical development was the English folksong revival, evident in the orchestral suite A Somerset Rhapsody (1906–07), a work that was originally to be based around eleven folksong themes; this was later reduced to four. Observing the work's kinship with Vaughan Williams's Norfolk Rhapsody, Dickinson remarks that, with its firm overall structure, Holst's composition \\"rises beyond the level of ... a song-selection\\". Imogen acknowledges that Holst's discovery of English folksongs \\"transformed his orchestral writing\\", and that the composition of A Somerset Rhapsody did much to banish the chromaticisms that had dominated his early compositions. In the Two Songs without Words of 1906, Holst showed that he could create his own original music using the folk idiom. An orchestral folksong fantasy Songs of the West, also written in 1906, was withdrawn by the composer and never published, although it emerged in the 1980s in the form of an arrangement for wind band by James Curnow. In the years before the First World War, Holst composed in a variety of genres. Matthews considers the evocation of a North African town in the Beni Mora suite of 1908 the composer's most individual work to that date; the third movement gives a preview of minimalism in its constant repetition of a four-bar theme. Holst wrote two suites for military band, in E flat (1909) and F major (1911) respectively, the first of which became and remains a brass-band staple. This piece, a highly original and substantial musical work, was a signal departure from what Short describes as \\"the usual transcriptions and operatic selections which pervaded the band repertoire\\". Also in 1911 he wrote Hecuba's Lament, a setting of Gilbert Murray's translation from Euripides built on a seven-beat refrain designed, says Dickinson, to represent Hecuba's defiance of divine wrath. In 1912 Holst composed two psalm settings, in which... contains an answer for the question: What suite written for military band remains a brassbands staple?, what is it ? Answer:","completion":"The suite written for military band that remains a brass band staple is Holst's \\"First Suite in E-flat\\" (1909).

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Your breath and thought largely determine your behavior. Wake up early and do 15 minutes of yoga every morning. When you feel stressed, take a break and meditate. This can be enormously calming. You'll feel more comfortable and your body will relax. Learn yoga by using a video online or going to a local class. Learn how to meditate by practicing calming breathing techniques in a quiet place. You can do yoga or meditation virtually anywhere, even in the middle of a conversation. Do yoga stretches on an airplane or meditate for a few seconds when you feel nervous during a party. Physical activity is scientifically proven to reduce stress, fight anxiety, and boost self-esteem. Exercise also releases pleasure-inducing endorphins. Even just 15 minutes of exercise a day can help you settle down and be happy. Exercise doesn't have to be in the gym. You can go for a run or play pick up basketball with friends. In fact, exercising with friends can be more fun and more beneficial than working out alone. Set a work out plan and stick to it. Decide when and how often you want to work out. Aim to exercise significantly four times a week, while still getting some physical activity every day. Walking or riding your bike to work rather than driving is a great way to work in exercise to your everyday routine. Exercise also has enormous health benefits like increased energy levels and a stronger heart, both of which will help you calm down and be more confident. Doctors recommend seven to nine hours of sleep every night. When you're sleep deprived, you're more at risk for anxiety and depression. However, when you're well rested, you're more likely to stay calm and composed in social situations. Beware of oversleeping. Sleeping ten hours or more can make your problems worse. Avoid caffeine and chocolate. These will keep you up late and independently act as stimulants which increase anxiety symptoms. Nicotine is a stimulant that leads to greater anxiety levels and lower self esteem. Drinking also acts as an unhealthy crutch. It can seem like a good solution, but in reality alcohol increases your chances of an anxiety attack. Make a plan to quit smoking. Tell your family and friends what you're doing, and go to meetings. Use nicotine patches and reward yourself for going without a cigarette. Similarly, make a plan to quit drinking or cut back significantly. Always be conscious of how much you're drinking. If you're having trouble, consider going to alcoholics anonymous. About 13 percent of the population suffers from some kind of social anxiety so you are not alone. Self-help doesn't work for everybody, and at some point, you need to get help. Tell your family and friends about your condition first. They want to help you and they can give you the same or better help that a therapist would give you. Don't self-medicate. Seek a doctor first. They'll refer you to a specialist who can give you beta blockers or antidepressants to fight the symptoms of social anxiety. They won't fight the underlying cause, however. If you stop taking your medication, the problem will likely come back full force. Always try self-help methods first, but there's nothing to be ashamed about in seeking professional help. In fact, it can be incredibly difficult and brave. Summary:","completion":"To help stay calm and be more confident, try doing some things like yoga, exercise, and meditation. It's important to get enough sleep and not use things like caffeine, chocolate, nicotine, and alcohol, which can make you feel more anxious.

Grill the halibut for 5 minutes on each side.","completion":"Title: Grilled Halibut with Honey-Lemon-Soy Marinade Introduction Grilled halibut is a delicious and nutritious meal option, perfect for those who enjoy eating light and flavorful fish. The combination of butter, honey, lemon, soy sauce, pepper, and garlic creates a unique marinade that brings out the natural flavors of the halibut. This article will provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to prepare grilled halibut with this delectable marinade. Ingredients - 4 halibut fillets - 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted - 3 tablespoons honey - Juice of 1 lemon - 3 tablespoons soy sauce - 1/2 teaspoon black pepper - 2 garlic cloves, minced Instructions 1. Gather and measure ingredients Before you begin, it's essential to have all your ingredients prepared and measured. To make the honey-lemon-soy marinade, gather the following: melted butter, honey, lemon juice, soy sauce, black pepper, and minced garlic. Having the correct measurements ensures the right balance of flavors in the marinade. 2. Mix the marinade Next, combine the measured butter, honey, lemon juice, soy sauce, pepper, and garlic in a bowl. Use a spoon to thoroughly mix these ingredients, ensuring that all the items are evenly distributed within the mixture. The consistency of the marinade should be slightly thick but still easy to brush onto the halibut fillets. 3. Prepare the halibut fillets Before you start grilling, it is important to properly prepare the halibut fillets. Rinse them under cold water, then pat each fillet dry with a paper towel. This helps to remove any excess moisture that could prevent the marinade from adhering to the surface of the fish. 4. Apply the marinade Using a pastry brush or a spoon, generously coat both sides of each halibut fillet with the honey-lemon-soy marinade. Be sure to cover the entire surface of each fillet, as this will help the flavors to penetrate the fish while it is grilling. Allow the marinated halibut to rest for 10-15 minutes to absorb the flavors. 5. Grill the halibut Preheat an outdoor grill or stovetop grill pan over medium-high heat. Once heated, place the marinated halibut fillets on the grill and cook them for approximately 5 minutes on each side. The total cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the fillets, so check the doneness of the fish by using a fork to flake the thickest part of the fillet. The halibut should be cooked through but still tender and flaky. 6. Serve and enjoy Once your halibut fillets are cooked to your desired level of doneness, remove them from the grill and transfer them to a serving platter. Garnish the fish with lemon wedges and fresh herbs, if desired. Enjoy your grilled halibut with honey-lemon-soy marinade alongside your favorite side dishes, such as steamed vegetables, rice, or salad. Conclusion Grilled halibut with honey-lemon-soy marinade is a scrumptious, easy-to-prepare dish that rivals any restaurant-style seafood meal. It's a versatile recipe that can be adapted to personal tastes and preferences. Whether you're cooking for yourself, family, or friends, this quick, satisfying meal is sure to become a go-to favorite."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. When you get sick, your body springs to action. Your body starts to fight the illness. Thats why you want to eat right and get plenty of sleep. You need a strong immune system to fight off illness. Plants dont have an immune system. That does not mean they do not get sick. Plants are affected by disease just like us. Typically, their first line of defense is the death of part of the plant. This prevents the infection from spreading. Many plants also produce special chemicals to fight disease. For example, willow trees produce a chemical to kill the bacteria. The same compound is used in many acne products. You can see a picture of a willow tree in Figure Plants may be smarter than we think. No, they cannot talk to each other. They may be able to send messages, though. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What are two ways plants can fight off disease?\\" is \\"Through the death of part of the plant, and by producing special chemicals to fight off disease\\"?","completion":"Yes, that is correct. The paragraph states that there are two primary ways in which plants can fight off disease: 1. Through the death of part of the plant: This process, also known as localized cell death or programmed cell death, helps to prevent the infection from spreading within the plant. By sacrificing a specific area of the plant, it isolates the infection and stops it from reaching other parts, thereby preserving the overall health and well-being of the plant. 2. By producing special chemicals to fight off disease: Plants can synthesize and release various chemical compounds, also known as phytochemicals or secondary metabolites, that have the ability to combat diseases. These compounds can help in preventing, reducing, and managing the effects of diseases that affect the plant. The example given in the paragraph is the willow tree which produces a chemical that has antibacterial properties and is also used in acne products. Hence, both the death of part of the plant and the production of special chemicals are key strategies employed by plants to fight off diseases and maintain their health. Additionally, it is worth noting that, while plants may not have an immune system similar to humans or animals, their unique defense mechanisms enable them to survive and thrive in their environments."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"- arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\" pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands. - The Glomma or Glåma is the longest and largest river in Norway . The 621 - kilometre ( 386 mi ) long river has a drainage basin that covers a full 13 % of Norway 's area , all in the southern part of Norway . - The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate. - A drainage basin or catchment basin is an extent or an area of land where all surface water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point at a lower elevation, usually the exit of the basin, where the waters join another body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea, or ocean. Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River. - Antarctica (US English , UK English or ) is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At , it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula. - Svalbard (formerly known by its Dutch name Spitsbergen) is a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean. Situated north of mainland Europe, it is about midway between continental Norway and the North Pole. The islands of the group range from 74° to 81° north latitude, and from 10° to 35° east longitude. The largest island is Spitsbergen, followed by Nordaustlandet and Edgeøya. - Jan Mayen is a volcanic island in the Arctic Ocean and a part of Norway. It is long (southwest-northeast) and in area, partly covered by glaciers (an area of around the Beerenberg volcano). It has two parts: larger northeast Nord-Jan and smaller Sør-Jan, linked by a wide isthmus. It lies northeast of Iceland (495 km (305 mi) NE of Kolbeinsey), east of central Greenland and west of the North Cape, Norway. The island is mountainous, the highest summit being the Beerenberg volcano in the north. The isthmus is the location of the two largest lakes of the island, Sørlaguna (South Lagoon), and Nordlaguna (North Lagoon). A third lake is called Ullerenglaguna (Ullereng Lagoon). Jan Mayen was formed by the Jan Mayen hotspot. - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\". - Peter I Island is an uninhabited volcanic island in the Bellingshausen Sea, from Antarctica. It is claimed as a dependency of Norway, and along with Queen Maud Land and Bouvet Island comprises one of the three Norwegian dependent territories in the Antarctic and Subantarctic. Peter I Island is long and , slightly larger than Staten Island. The tallest peak is the ultra and tall Lars Christensen Peak. Nearly all of the island is covered by a glacier and it is surrounded most of the year by pack ice, making it inaccessible almost all year round. There is little life on the island apart from seabirds and seals. - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - An estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body of brackish water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it, and with a free connection to the open sea. - Jämtland (Norwegian: \\"Jemtland\\"; Latin: \\"Iemptia\\") or Jamtland is a historical province (\\"landskap\\") in the center of Sweden in northern Europe. It borders to Härjedalen and Medelpad in the south, Ångermanland in the east, Lapland in the north and Trøndelag and Norway in the west. Jämtland covers an area of 34,009 square kilometres, 8.3% of Sweden's total area and is the second largest province in Sweden. It has a population of 112,717, the majority of whom live in \\"Storsjöbygden\\", the area surrounding lake Storsjön. Östersund is Jämtland's only city and is the 24th most populous city in Sweden. - The Faroe Islands (Irish: \\"Na Scigirí\\") are an archipelago between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic approximately halfway between Norway and Iceland, north-northwest of mainland Scotland. The area is approximately with a 2016 population of 49,188. The islands are an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark. - Bouvet Island (Norwegian: Bouvetøya, previously spelled Bouvet-øya) is an uninhabited subantarctic high island and dependency of Norway located in the South Atlantic Ocean at . It lies at the southern end of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and is the most remote island in the world, approximately south-southwest of the coast of South Africa and approximately north of the Princess Astrid Coast of Queen Maud Land, Antarctica. - Bohuslän is a Swedish province in Götaland, on the northernmost part of the country's west coast. It is bordered by Dalsland to the northeast, Västergötland to the southeast, the Skagerrak arm of the North Sea to the west, and the county of Østfold, in Norway, to the north. - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. What entity does 'glomma' has the relation 'mouth of the watercourse' with?

Please answer the following question: A red giant star is a star with a mass like the Sun that is in the last phase of its life, when Hydrogen fusion reactions in the core decrease due to the lack of fuel. With the gravitational collapse of the core, the fusion reactions now occur in a shell surrounding the core. The outer layer of the star expands enormously up to 1000 times the size of the Sun. When the Sun becomes a red giant, its volume will include the orbit of Mercury and Venus and maybe even Earth. The increased size increases the luminosity even though the outer layer cools to only 3000 K or so. The cooler outer layer causes it to be a red star. After a few more million years, the star evolves into a white dwarf-planetary nebula system. Two stars have just been discovered that are identical in terms of chemical composition. The scientist who discovered them was given the right to name them, and he chose the names Enterprise and Vader. As said before, these stars are very similar, but the main difference is that Vader is a red giant, and Enterprise is not. Scientists are very eager to study these two newly discovered stars and see if they can learn anything new from them. Which star has more hydrogen reactions in its core? A:","completion":"A: The Enterprise star has more hydrogen reactions in its core than the Vader star. Step-by-step explanation: 1. The given information tells us that Vader is a red giant star, while Enterprise is not. This implies that they are in different stages of their stellar evolution. 2. Red giant stars, like Vader, have depleted hydrogen fuel in their cores, and as a result, hydrogen fusion reactions decrease in the core. 3. In a red giant, the fusion reactions occur mainly in a shell surrounding the core, whereas for a star like Enterprise, which is not in the red giant phase, fusion reactions are still taking place in its core. 4. Since hydrogen fusion reactions are the primary energy source for most stars, and given that Enterprise is not in its red giant phase, it can be concluded that Enterprise has more hydrogen reactions in its core than Vader."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You shouldn’t add your fish’s favorite rock or plant into the bucket or container with them. The fish should be the only thing in the bucket, except the water from your tank. Any extra items may move around and harm your fish. Fish need to stay at their normal water temperature. Any fluctuations in water temperature can cause your fish to get sick. Try to keep your fish’s water the same temperature of their normal aquarium. This means you should transport them in the part of your vehicle where you can use the air conditioner or heater. You can also use insulation to the transportation container. This can help regulate the temperature. Check the fish’s temperature to make sure it doesn’t get too hot or too cold. Transporting the fish in a darker state can help keep them from getting too stressed. Fish are active and awake during the day when it is bright outside. At night, they are less active. Place something over the fish if they are in a container where they can get light during the day. For example, you may place a sheet or rug over the container.

Their children may be fluent in Mandarin and accomplished violinists, but pushy mums can expect little thanks. A study found that ‘helicopter mothers’ who hover over and control their children’s lives are resented. And the bossier they are, the more the discontent builds. Resentment: 'Helicopter mothers' who hover over and control their children's lives can expect little thanks in the future, a study suggests. Researcher Professor Jean Ispa, from the University of Missouri, said: 'Children flourish when they have opportunities to make choices about what they do, particularly in play situations.' The University of Missouri team studied videos of children playing with their mothers. 'Mothers who are highly directive do not allow that kind of choice. In our study, the children were playing with some toys, and the very directive mothers were making the decisions about how to play, what to play and how quickly to play,' the professor said. 'Children flourish when they have opportunities to make choices about what they do' Professor Jean Ispa, University of Missouri. More than 2,000 children were taped when they were aged one, two and three and again before they started school. The pushy mothers tended to correct their children, rather than simply allowing them to have fun. For instance, when a child tried to put a plastic cow into a toy barn through the window, the mother would show them how to put it through the door instead. Bossy: Mothers who constantly correct young children may be stifling their creativity. And if a child was playing with a pretend kitchen set, the controlling mother might not let the child touch the fake burners on the stove. Professor Ispa, an expert in human development, said that while mothers might think they are helping the their children by correcting them, they may instead be stifling their creativity. Their interference may also mean their children find spending time with them less enjoyable. However, warm and caring parenting cancels out some of the negative effects of bossiness, according to the report published in the journal Parenting: Science and Practice. Professor Ispa said: 'Even if mothers were very directive, if they were also warm, the negative effects of high directiveness lessened. 'We know that children, regardless of culture, need to feel loved. 'Children take in the meaning of what their mothers are trying to do, so if a mum is being very directive and is generally a very warm person, I think the child feels, \\"My mum is doing this because she cares about me, and she's trying to do the best for me.\\" 'If that warmth is missing, then the child might feel, \\"My mum is trying to control me, and I don't like it.\\"' She added that as the children got older, the mothers tended to become less bossy, perhaps because they trusted them more. British head teachers have warned of the peril of 'helicopter parents', saying that ambitious mothers and fathers are condemning middle-class children to years of stress and anxiety. And some parents are still hovering over their children when they leave school. Universities have complained about parents joining their sons and daughters for freshers' week, with some even sleeping in their children's dorms. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"This article highlights a study that found out that 'helicopter mothers', who tend to hover over and control their children's lives, are resented by their children. Researchers from the University of Missouri studied videos of children playing with their mothers and found that highly directive mothers who made decisions about how to play and what to play stifled their children's creativity and decision-making abilities. Over 2,000 children were observed at various ages, and it was found that pushy mothers often corrected their children instead of simply allowing them to have fun, inherently leading to less enjoyable interactions. However, the study also found that the warm and caring nature of a mother could partially cancel out the negative effects of bossiness. Professor Jean Ispa, the leading researcher, argued that a warm and loving approach could make children interpret their mother's directiveness as caring and doing the best for them. The article mentions that as children grow older, mothers tend to become less overbearing, possibly due to increased trust. In conclusion, the important aspects of the article are the findings that helicopter mothers may negatively impact their children's creativity and enjoyment, but warm and caring parenting could help to lessen those negative effects.

But whether potassium intake could prevent stroke or death wasn't clear,\\" said Smoller, professor of the department of population health at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY. Researchers studied 90,137 women, aged from 50 to 79 for an average 11 years. They looked at how much potassium the women consumed, as well as if they had strokes, including ischemic strokes , or died during the study period. Women in the study were stroke-free at the start and their average dietary potassium intake was 2,611 mg/day. Results of this study are based on potassium from food, not supplements. The researchers found: Women who ate the most potassium were 12 percent less likely to suffer stroke in general and 16 percent less likely to suffer an ischemic stroke than women who ate the least. Women who ate the most potassium were 10 percent less likely to die than those who ate the least. Among women who did not have high blood pressure, those who ate the most potassium had a 27 percent lower ischemic stroke risk and 21 perc ent reduced risk for all stroke types, compared to women who ate the least potassium in their daily diets.

'The Amazing Spider-Man' slings its first web [Trailer] [Updated] There's a bit of deja vu in seeing a young, fragile loner get bitten by a spider only to realize he's been given superpowers. It's been only nine years since we watched Tobey Maguire do it, and now Andrew Garfield is going through the paces again in this new, apparently leaked trailer for Marc Webb's \\"The Amazing Spider-Man.\\" [Updated, 2:43 p.m. July 19: It looks as though Sony has taken down the trailer. So if you haven't watched it yet, you'll have to take our word for it. But it should be online officially soon enough Updated, 10:28 a.m. July 20: And the trailer is now officially available; you can check it out below.] The teaser, which will probably debut properly at this weekend's Comic-Con, begins when a young Peter Parker is abandoned by his parents, then gives way to a somewhat disoriented-looking youth (Garfield) and the fateful accident, before ending with Spider-Man climbing and swinging across rooftops, which we see from his perspective. If the tone in Sam Raimi's original had a kind of light seriousness, this replicates the feat, minus the light. There is ominous music, moody lighting and serious, cryptic statements like: \\"We all have secrets. The ones we keep are the ones that are kept from us.\\" If Webb's film is supposed to be more of an everyday coming-of-age high school story, there's not much evidence of it here; the teaser has many of the stylized touches we've come to expect from modern comic-inspired movies. More details on \\"The Amazing Spider-Man\\" later this week at this blog and on sister blog Hero Complex, the bastion of all things Comic-Con. Andrew Garfield as tortured Spider-Man?

A Florida woman was arrested earlier this week after police say she broke into the home she previously shared with her ex-boyfriend and their three young children and threatened to chop off the childrens' heads with a machete. According to authorities in Valusia County, Florida, police were called to the home of Carlos Quinones about 4 p.m. Tuesday after his ex-girlfriend, 32-year-old Alisa Lynn Williams - while wielding a machete - broke into the house and threatened the former couples' 7-year-old twin boys and 6-year-old daughter. When police first arrived at the home, they found Williams sitting on the porch covered in blood, according to an arrest report first obtained by the Daytona Beach News-Journal. Mommy dearest: police in Florida say Alisa Williams threatened to chop off the heads of her three young children with a machete. Quinones told authorities that Williams barged into the home with the machete before being disarmed and pushed out the door by Quinones and his father. According to the report, two neighbors overheard Williams saying she was going to 'cut off their heads,' referring to the three children. After Quinones removed Williams from the home, she attempted to get. back in by breaking a window and climbing through the shards of broken. glass, which cut her.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Sam Houston was the fifth son of Major Samuel Houston and Elizabeth Paxton. Houston's paternal ancestry is often traced to his great-great grandfather Sir John Houston, who built a family estate in Scotland in the late seventeenth century. His second son John Houston emigrated to Ulster, Ireland, during the Ulster plantation period. Under the system of primogeniture, he did not inherit the estate. Houston's political reputation suffered further due to the publicity related to the trial for his assault of Stanbery. He left for Texas in December 1832 and was immediately swept up in the politics of what was still a part of the Mexican state of Coahuila, attending the Convention of 1833 as representative for Nacogdoches. Houston emerged as a supporter of William Harris Wharton and his brother, who promoted independence from Mexico. This was the more radical position of the American settlers and Tejanos in Texas. He also attended the Consultation of 1835, and the Texas Army commissioned him as Major General in November 1835. He negotiated a peace settlement with the Cherokee of East Texas in February 1836 to allay their fears about independence. Houston was selected as Commander-in-Chief at the convention to declare Texan independence in March 1836, and he signed the Texas Declaration of Independence on March 2, 1836, his 43rd birthday. Mexican soldiers killed almost all of those at the Alamo Mission at the end of a 13-day siege on March 6. On March 11, Houston joined what constituted his army at Gonzales: 374 poorly equipped, poorly trained, and poorly supplied recruits. Word of the defeat at the Alamo reached him and, while he waited for confirmation, he organized the recruits as the 1st Regiment Volunteer Army of Texas. On March 13, Houston retreated before the superior forces of Mexican General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, as he was short on rations. Heavy rain fell nearly every day, causing severe morale problems among the exposed troops struggling through the mud. He received additional troops near present-day La Grange, after four days' march, and continued east two days later with 600 men. At Goliad, Santa Anna ordered the execution of more than 400 volunteer Texas militia led by James Fannin, who had surrendered his forces on March 20. Houston's forces were joined by 130 more men on March 26 near present-day Columbus, and the next day he learned of the Fannin disaster. Houston continued his retreat eastward toward the Gulf coast, drawing criticism for his perceived lack of willingness to fight, and two companies refused to retreat further on March 29 while they were camped along the Brazos River. Houston decided to use the opportunity for rudimentary training and discipline of his force. On April 2, he organized the 2nd Regiment and received a battalion of regulars, and he ordered all troops along the Brazos to join the main army on April 11, approximately 1,500 men in all. He began crossing the Brazos on April 12. Santa Anna finally caught up with the Texans, but he had split his own army into three separate forces in an attempt to encircle Houston's forces. Houston surprised Santa Anna's forces during their afternoon siesta at the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836. The Texans won a decisive victory in less than 18 minutes, suffering few casualties, although Houston's ankle was shattered by a stray bullet. Santa Anna was badly beaten and forced to sign the Treaty of Velasco, granting Texas its independence. Houston stayed on briefly for negotiations, then returned to the United States for treatment of his ankle wound. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What was Sam's role in the texas revolution","completion":"Sam Houston's role in the Texas Revolution, according to the article, was pivotal. He is quoted as being \\"selected as Commander-in-Chief at the convention to declare Texan independence\\" and was the signatory of the Texas Declaration of Independence. Furthermore, \\"the Texas Army commissioned him as Major General in November 1835.\\" He engaged in negotiations, managed troop movements, and even led his forces to a decisive victory against General Santa Anna's forces at the Battle of San Jacinto.

Your task is to generate label \\"yes\\" if title is right for article, otherwise generate \\"no\\". Abstract: Each cell division requires the unwinding of millions of DNA base pairs to allow chromosome duplication and gene transcription. As DNA replication and transcription share the same template, conflicts between both processes are unavoidable and head-on collisions are thought to be particularly problematic. Surprisingly, a recent study reported unperturbed cell cycle progression in Escherichia coli cells with an ectopic replication origin in which highly transcribed rrn operons were forced to be replicated opposite to normal. In this study we have re-generated a similar strain and found the doubling time to be twice that of normal cells. Replication profiles of this background revealed significant deviations in comparison to wild-type profiles, particularly in highly transcribed regions and the termination area. These deviations were alleviated by mutations that either inactivate the termination area or destabilise RNA polymerase complexes and allow their easier displacement by replication forks. Our data demonstrate that head-on replication-transcription conflicts are highly problematic. Indeed, analysis of the replication profile of the previously published E. coli construct revealed a chromosomal rearrangement that alleviates replication-transcription conflicts in an intriguingly simple way. Our data support the idea that avoiding head-on collisions has significantly contributed to shaping the distinct architecture of bacterial chromosomes..

This article: As the musical prelude climaxes, Woglinde and Wellgunde are seen at play in the depths of the Rhine. Flosshilde joins them after a gentle reminder of their responsibilities as guardians of the gold. They are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich who calls out to them: \\"I'd like to draw near if you would be kind to me\\". The wary Flosshilde cries: \\"Guard the gold! Father warned us of such a foe\\". When Alberich begins his rough wooing the maidens relax: \\"Now I laugh at my fears, our enemy is in love\\", says Flosshilde, and a cruel teasing game ensues. First, Woglinde pretends to respond to the dwarf's advances but swims away as he tries to embrace her. Then Wellgunde takes over, and Alberich's hopes rise until her sharp retort: \\"Ugh, you hairy hunchbacked clown!\\" Flosshilde pretends to chastise her sisters for their cruelty and feigns her own courtship, by which Alberich is quite taken in until she suddenly tears away to join the others in a mocking song. Tormented with lust, Alberich furiously chases the maidens over the rocks, slipping and sliding as they elude him, before he sinks down in impotent rage. At this point the mood changes: as a sudden brightness penetrates the depths, a magical golden light reveals, for the first time, the Rhinegold on its rock. The maidens sing their ecstatic greeting to the gold, which rouses Alberich's curiosity. In response to his question Woglinde and Wellgunde reveal the gold's secret: measureless power would belong to the one who could forge a ring from it. Flosshilde scolds them for giving this secret away, but her concerns are dismissed—only someone who has forsworn love can obtain the gold, and Alberich is clearly so besotted as to present no danger. But their confidence is misplaced; in his humiliation Alberich decides that world mastery is more desirable than love. As the maidens continue to jeer his antics he scrambles up the rock and, uttering a curse on love, seizes the gold and disappears, leaving the Rhinemaidens to dive after him bewailing their loss. contains an answer for the question: What are the names of the three people who are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich?, what is it ?

However, to make a more robust conclusion, let's dissect the statement and analyze the key points. 1. \\"An experienced diver\\" - The premise focuses on experienced divers. This subset of divers may have specific preferences and requirements that lead them to enjoy diving in a particular location more than others. This implies that the comparison is being made from the perspective of those who have a considerable amount of diving background. 2. \\"may prefer moving onto the Sinai\\" - The use of the word \\"may\\" suggests that the preference for the Sinai region is not universal among all experienced divers. Nonetheless, it does indicate that there is a sizable portion of experienced divers who find better diving experiences in Sinai. 3. \\"where the diving is even better\\" - This statement provides the basis for the hypothesis. It explicitly compares the diving experience in Sinai to some unspecified location(s) and infers that the qualities of the dives in Sinai are superior. Taking these points into consideration, the hypothesis \\"The diving experience is considered better in Sinai\\" is supported by the given premise. However, few aspects could be further explored to make this hypothesis more comprehensive and accurate: 1. Generalization: It would be useful to evaluate if this preference towards Sinai as a diving location is true not only for experienced divers but also for beginner or intermediate divers. 2. Comparison: Investigating what specific locations or regions are being compared to Sinai would provide more context on the claim that Sinai offers a better diving experience. 3. Factors for preference: Identifying the main factors that contribute to the superiority of diving in Sinai over other locations, such as biodiversity, water clarity, accessibility, or unique underwater attractions, would strengthen the hypothesis. In summary, the hypothesis \\"The diving experience is considered better in Sinai\\" is likely true based on the given premise, although it is essential to take into account its scope and the context in which it has been presented. Exploring the aspects mentioned above will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding and validation of the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:Question: \\"Who got to kick someone off the throne?\\" Context: \\"The Greek kingdom of Bactria began as a breakaway satrapy of the Seleucid empire, which, because of the size of the empire, had significant freedom from central control. Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"In the context of the Greek kingdom of Bacteria and its transition from a satrapy of the Seleucid empire to an independent kingdom, the person who got to kick someone off the throne was Euthydemus. Euthydemus overthrew Diodotus II, the son of the first ruler of the independent Bactrian kingdom, Diodotus, who had declared himself king in 255-246 BCE. Euthydemus possibly held the position of satrap of Sogdiana before initiating his own dynasty by overthrowing Diodotus II around 230 BCE. Amidst the complexities of regional politics and power struggles during that time, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom faced an invasion from a resurgent Seleucid empire led by Antiochus III around 210 BCE. However, Antiochus realized there were benefits to maintaining the status quo and therefore decided to establish a diplomatic relationship with the Greco-Bactrian kingdom. This agreement was solidified by marrying one of his daughters to the son of Euthydemus, which helped legitimize the Greco-Bactria dynasty. Consequently, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom expanded its territories, possibly capitalizing on the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus. In summary, Euthydemus played a crucial role in kicking someone off the throne and establishing his own dynasty in the Greco-Bactrian kingdom, which ultimately led to its legitimization and territorial expansion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:In a statement, the ministry said it was not appropriate to allow in entertainers who have engaged in \\"bad behaviour.\\" \\"Justin Bieber is a gifted singer, but he is also a controversial young foreign singer,\\" it added. The statement was issued in response to a question recently submitted by a user of the bureau's website. \\"We hope that as Justin Bieber matures, he can continue to improve his own words and actions, and truly become a singer beloved by the public,\\" the statement said. By John Sudworth, BBC Beijing correspondent To its list of hostile foreign forces - one assumes ranking somewhere below the Dalai Lama and Taiwanese separatists - China has added the name Justin Bieber. The news came in a statement from the Beijing municipal culture bureau, answering a question from a fan about why, with the singer about to embark on an Asia-wide tour, no venues have been scheduled in mainland China. Justin Bieber is indeed \\"talented at singing\\" came the reply, but nonetheless it would not be appropriate to allow him to perform, because of what it called a number of incidents of \\"bad behaviour.\\" It did not elaborate on exactly which of Mr Bieber's run-ins with the law it was referring to. The pop star, who was allowed to tour China in 2013, joins a long list of musicians who have found themselves similarly blacklisted. Most though, like the British band Oasis and the US group Maroon 5, because of perceived political statements, rather than on the grounds of bad behaviour. This hasn't been the first time the Sorry singer has caused controversy in Asia. In 2014, Bieber caused upset on social media after he posted a photo of himself visiting the controversial Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo. The shrine honours fallen warriors and pays tribute to convicted war criminals but in China and South Korea, the shrine is seen as a symbol of Japan not being sorry for its empire's past. But despite the singer taking the photo down and apologising, the Chinese were outraged. Their foreign minister's spokesperson said he hoped the singer had left Yasukuni with \\"a clear understanding of Japan's history of invasion and militarism, and of the source of Japan's militarism\\". Justin Bieber will be performing in Asia as part of his Purpose World Tour from September, and will be playing in Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Singapore and Indonesia.

A remix album, titled Year Zero Remixed, was released in November 2007. Due to the expiration of his contract with Interscope Records, the album's release, marketing, and promotion were completely in Reznor's control. The album features remixes from artists including The Faint, Ladytron, Bill Laswell, Saul Williams, Olof Dreijer of The Knife, and Sam Fogarino of Interpol. Reznor himself strongly supports fan-made remixes of songs from the album, as evidenced by his decision to upload every song in multi-track form to the then-newly launched Nine Inch Nails remix website. Instrumental versions of the songs on Year Zero are available at the site for download in multiple formats, including MP3, WAV, GarageBand, and Ableton Live formats. A planned film adaption of Year Zero became a television project in 2007. Reznor met with various writers and pitched the idea to television networks. The 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike affected the pre-production stage. Nevertheless, Reznor commented in 2008 that the project is \\"still churning along\\", and that he had begun working with American film producer Lawrence Bender. In 2010, Reznor started developing the Year Zero miniseries with HBO and BBC Worldwide Productions. Reznor and Bender collaborated with Carnivàle writer Daniel Knauf to create the science fiction epic. When asked about the miniseries during an \\"Ask Me Anything\\" session on Reddit on November 13, 2012, Reznor said it was \\"currently in a holding state\\" and explained, \\"We [Reznor and Sheridan] didn't find the right match with a writer, and really have been avoiding doing what we should have done from the beginning: write it ourselves.

Al Ditheridge, from Sustrans, said he was \\"hopeful\\" more money would be granted to extend the scheme. \\"Where affordability is an issue, bikes are cheap, they are cost-effective,\\" he said.

But anyway, the quote took off and decades on, the essence of what he was perhaps trying to say is coming true in Derby. \\"The main person who's going to get a jobseeker a job is the jobseeker.

An opening in the food packaging or a tear in the plastic indicate that the food has been exposed to cold, outside air, and has a higher chance of being freezer burned. Remove the food from the packaging, and check the food for dry areas, areas of discoloration, and ice crystals. Food with any of these qualities, is highly likely to be freezer burned. The exact color of freezer burn discoloration varies depending on the food, but freezer burn tends to look white on poultry (chicken), grayish-brown on meat (steak), white on vegetables, and icy crystals formations on ice cream. Patches of wrinkling on meat or vegetables are also an indication that your food might be freezer burned. Smell the food and see if you can detect an unpleasant plastic-y and stale “freezer” odor. When fat from food comes in contact with air outside of its packaging and oxidizes, it creates the gross freezer flavor and smell we associate with freezer burn. Store bought food is usually labeled with a storage date. Check the label and determine if the food has been stored past this date. If your food is past the labeled date, and has ice crystals, your food is most likely freezer burned. Freezer burned food is not unsafe to eat. However, you can save a majority portion of the food you plan to eat by trimming off the freezer burned areas, and preparing and eating the rest of the food like normal. If the freezer burn is widespread, throwing out the food may be the best option. Even though the food is safe to eat, it will be flavorless, or have a strange flavor. Freezer burned ice cream, will have small ice crystals formations on the surface, which are perfectly fine to eat, though not very appetizing.

However, to provide a more detailed and comprehensive response, consider the following answer: Baldomero Espartero, full name Joaquín Baldomero Fernández Espartero, was Spain's 18th Prime Minister. He served during the regency of Maria Cristina, from 16 September 1840 to 21 May 1841. Espartero was a prominent military figure, known for his victories in the First Carlist War, a political and military conflict from 1833-1839 between Spanish liberals and conservatives. Espartero was born on 27 February 1793 in Granátula de Calatrava, situated in the province of Ciudad Real, Spain. He began his military career at age 15 when he joined the Spanish army during the Peninsular War (1808-1814) against Napoleonic France. After the First Carlist War, Espartero was hailed as a national hero, and in 1840, he was appointed as the 18th Prime Minister of Spain. In addition to holding the title of Prime Minister, Espartero also took on various political roles, such as the Regent of the Kingdom and, later in his career, the Duke of La Victoria. However, his tenure as Prime Minister was marked by internal unrest within the country, political and social changes that occurred during the early years of the liberal regime, and the resistance to his efforts to centralize power. Due to this turbulence, his time in office lasted only two years. In 1841, a series of uprisings led by fellow generals resulted in Espartero's removal from power and his subsequent exile to the United Kingdom. He returned to Spain in 1847 and served in various military and political roles for the remainder of his life. In summary, Spain's 18th Prime Minister was Baldomero Espartero, who served from 16 September 1840 to 21 May 1841 during the regency of Maria Cristina. A highly respected military figure, Espartero's time as Prime Minister was fraught with internal conflict, which ultimately led to his exile and the end of his term."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given the following context: In 1979, the locomotive was renumbered \\"1881\\", painted black with silver stripes, and leased to a Hollywood company for use in the filming of the horror movie Terror Train (1979), starring Jamie Lee Curtis. In 1980, the locomotive was repainted with a color scheme used by Canadian Pacific in the 1930s. The black, gold, and Tuscan red paint job was popular with railroad enthusiasts and photographers. The number 1293 was also restored to the engine. In February 1982, the headlights, handrails, and cab roof of 1293 were damaged when the roof of a Steamtown storage building gave way to heavy snow.Although the Steamtown Special History Study reasoned that, since this type of locomotive had historically operated in New England, perhaps as far south as Boston, it qualified to be part of the federal government's collection, the Canadian native sat unused for 12 years following the move to Scranton. Ohio Central Railroad System purchased it in 1996, and it underwent a 13-month restoration. As of July 2010, Ohio Central Railroad has lost control of most of its holdings, but former owner, Jerry Joe Jacobson, maintained a collection of vintage equipment including CPR 1293 and her sister, CRP 1278, which is also a veteran of Steamtown, U.S.A. operational locomotives. No. 1293 is still operational as of October 2011.Canadian Pacific Railway No. 1278, like her sister, CPR 1293, was also built by Canadian Locomotive Company in 1948, and is a type 4-6-2, class G5d light-weight \\"Pacific\\" locomotive.

Article: In April 2014, the sleepy town of Chibok in Borno State was thrust first into national, and then international limelight when 276 female students from a local high school were abducted by the Islamist terrorist group, Boko Haram. It’s difficult to remember now how slowly news of the abduction trickled out. In part it was because of how remote Chibok is—just under 600 miles of barely motorable roads to the Nigeria’s capital, Abuja. However, it still took, then president, Goodluck Jonathan, two weeks before he spoke about the abduction. It has been four years since the Chibok girls’ abduction and there is a very different administration running Nigeria under president Muhammadu Buhari, but the mistakes that were made then are playing out almost exactly the same way with the recent Dapchi girls’ abduction. Armed fighters, believed to be Boko Haram militants, showed up with trucks in the small town in the northeastern state of Yobe, on Monday (Feb. 19), and specifically asked residents for directions to the local school which they attacked soon after and kidnapped scores of female students. It’s the first known large-scale schoolgirl abduction since Chibok. Since the abduction, there have been conflicting reports on the numbers of girls taken by the terrorist group, ranging from 50 to as high as 105. Again, the lack of clarity is all too reminiscent of the confusion with the Chibok girls’ abduction. Back then, there were a number of avoidable errors: from claiming the location of the girls was known, and yet not carrying out any rescue operation to attempts to shift blame for the abduction to the Borno state governor who was a member of the opposition. It was this poor, uncoordinated response to the abduction that necessitated the creation of the pressure group, Bring Back Our Girls and the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls which went viral on social media world over, used by the former US first lady Michelle Obama and celebrities to put pressure on the Nigerian government to act promptly to rescue the girls. A sign for the Government Girls Science and Technology College is pictured in Dapchi (Reuters/Ola Lanre) This time, there has also been an announcement by the Yobe state government that the Nigerian military had rescued over 50 of the abducted schoolgirls but it offered next to no details on how this rescue operation took place. By the next day, the state governor had been forced to retract the statement, clarifying that there has been no rescue. There has also been the claim by the Nigerian minister of information, Lai Mohammed, that the terrorists carried out the attack to embarrass the Buhari-led administration—casting the president as the victim of the attack rather than the girls who were taken. President Buhari himself has yet to publicly address the Nigerian public save for updates from his official Twitter account, which is not the most effective way of reaching all Nigerians. I have directed the Military and Police to mobilize immediately to ensure that all the missing girls of Government Girls Secondary School, Dapchi, are found. The Minister of Defence will also lead a Federal Government delegation to Yobe tomorrow, to ascertain the situation. — Muhammadu Buhari (@MBuhari) February 21, 2018 Even though the Jonathan and Buhari administrations are very different in many ways, the response to each attacks shows how Nigeria’s politicians can be insulated or out of touch with their public. But while the Jonathan’s government had the excuse of being caught off-guard by a first-of-its-kind crisis, Buhari’s team can’t claim the same. For example, despite the high profile fallout from the Chibok kidnapping and the relentless focus on young girls and women by Boko Haram, the Nigerian government has failed to properly secure secondary schools in the region and strengthen intelligence-gathering to forestall future attacks by Boko Haram. It is entirely possible the terrorist militants targeted the school in Dapchi in order to use them as leverage for extracting concessions from the government in the same way that they have done with the Chibok girls. (paywall) Never again? The Nigerian government needs to take a number of urgent steps to prevent the free-fall into confusion that this incident is becoming: First, it needs to learn to better manage information around the abduction by keeping the Nigerian public abreast of developments surrounding rescue efforts by sharing timely updates, rather than allowing others fill the vacuum. There should be clarity on which government official or agency speaks on the abduction in order to avoid a repeat of the mistake that led to the false news of rescued girls. The government should also quit attempts to stifle the media covering the story or preventing the parents of the missing girls from speaking to the press. The priority here should be the rescue of these girls and not the reputation of the government—the latter can only be redeemed by the achievement of the former. Secondly, the Nigerian government must ensure security agencies from the military, the police and the Department of State Security (DSS) make the rescue of the girls a number one priority and make use of all available resources. In the Chibok girls’ abduction saga, the time spent by government trying to put a response together was taken advantage of by the terrorists in getting out of the reach of the security agencies. This must not be allowed to repeat itself. Every second counts. Thirdly, president Buhari should avoid the mistake of his predecessor in refusing to immediately communicate first with the parents of the missing girls directly, and then with Nigerians. This is not the time for him to be holed up in the Aso Rock Presidential Villa and communicating via proxies. This is the time for him to show empathy and to lead from the front as he promised when he ran for election in 2015. The Nigerian Government must make a stronger commitment to not just containing Boko Haram but totally defeating them. It is evident that despite claims from the government two years ago that the terrorist organization had been ‘technically defeated’, they are still active with a spate of attacks in the North-East region. The Chibok girls’ abduction was a turning point in public perception for the previous administration and sounded the death knell for it at the 2015 elections. If the Buhari administration hopes to avoid this next year, it must ensure that it handles the Dapchi girls’ abduction better. It is not too late for it to take corrective measures. Sign up for the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief — the most important and interesting news from across the continent, in your inbox. ||||| Confusion has surrounded the events in Dapchi, said Lai Mohammed, the minister of information, because dozens of girls ran into hiding and have been slowly trickling back to the school. “This is why the whole situation has been hazy,” he said. Officials have been careful to avoid acknowledging anyone was kidnapped in Dapchi. Instead, they say only that the girls are missing. Witnesses, however, described seeing the girls in militants’ vehicles as part of what appeared to be a deliberate plan to steal them. And they said militants arrived at the town looking specifically for the building, which is a boarding place with about 900 students. One resident who lives a mile outside Dapchi, who asked that his name not be used because he feared for his safety, said his neighbor was outside his home late in the day on Monday when militants pulled up, grabbed him and asked him to point them to the school. He told the fighters he didn’t know where it was and begged to be released. They threw him aside and headed toward the town. Other residents were also abducted by the militants and ordered to direct them to the school before being released, townspeople said. Fighters arrived at the school about 5:30 p.m., guns blazing. Hafsat Lawan, 15, said she and classmates heard gunshots in the distance. ||||| DAPCHI, Nigeria—Garba Sule was preparing for evening prayers when heavily armed Boko Haram jihadists rode into town last week in pickup trucks, firing hundreds of rounds into the air and demanding directions to the local girls’ school. The camouflage-clad militants loaded up dozens of students from the Dapchi Government Girls Science and Technical College and drove them into the surrounding scrubland, according to eyewitnesses, schoolteachers and local officials. Among them: Mr. Sule’s 13-year-old daughter, Zara. ... |||||Summary:","completion":"The Nigerian government must avoid repeating the mistakes made during the Chibok girls' abduction in 2014 when Boko Haram kidnapped 276 female students when dealing with the recent abduction of schoolgirls in Dapchi. Conflicting information has emerged about the number of girls taken, reminiscent of the confusion that arose during the Chibok abduction. The government should create clear communication channels with the Nigerian public regarding rescue efforts and updates, ensure security agencies prioritise rescuing the girls and work to defeat Boko Haram entirely. Prioritising the rescue will save face for the government and prevent voters from drawing comparisons between the current administration and its predecessor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mr. Bonestripper A:","completion":"Title: The Bonestripper Chronicles Genre: Horror/Thriller Plot: The story begins in the small, sleepy town of Ravenwood, known for its mysterious legends, ghost stories, and its once-thriving amusement park, Thrill Manor. Thrill Manor has been closed for almost a decade due to a series of tragic accidents involving its main attraction: the infamous roller coaster, Mr. Bonestripper. For years, it has been rumored that the seemingly inanimate coaster is cursed, and no one dares to step foot in the abandoned park. A group of adventurous and curious friends, Sam, Lily, Jeff, and Sarah, have arrived to the town to create a documentary about the mysteries surrounding Mr. Bonestripper and the accidents that led to the park's closure. Sam is a skeptic, but the rest of the group believe in the supernatural and are determined to prove that there is more to the legend of the roller coaster than mere rumor. The town's mayor, Stephen Delaney, is against their investigation but reluctantly permits them to enter the old theme park, warning them to stay cautious. Inside the park, the group is initially fascinated by the eerie ambiance and begins exploring the various attractions. During their first night, they come across a hidden laboratory behind Mr. Bonestripper. Here, they learn about a reclusive scientist named Dr. Ivan Penrose, who had been working on a project involving merging human souls with machines. The friends study his journals and diaries, discovering that Dr. Penrose had been experimenting with merging pain receptors from human subjects into his creations, hoping to create the most thrilling yet dangerous roller coaster experience. As the plot thickens, Jeff and Sarah spend a night poring through paperwork in the lab while Sam and Lily explore the roller coaster tracks. Whilst traversing the twisted metal, they uncover hidden compartments containing the remains of the coaster's victims, tangled amidst the gears and machinery. The shocking discovery plunges the team into a frantic search for the truth about Dr. Penrose's experiments. As the friends delve deeper into the mystery, they start to experience strange occurrences and vivid nightmares that feel more like warning messages from beyond the grave. They discover that Dr. Penrose was actually in league with the sinister Mayor Delaney, who had been stealing corpses from local burial sites to sell to the mad doctor. Dr. Penrose used the human bones and organs in the machinery of Mr. Bonestripper, seeking to imbue the thrilling ride with the souls and pain receptors of the deceased. The ill-fated coaster now bears depraved memories of its unwilling victims, causing it to be cursed with murderous intent. The spirits of the victims, unwilling to rest in peace until the truth is exposed and justice is served, become the embodiment of the coaster itself and help the group expose the mayor's corrupt dealings. His reign of terror is brought to an end when he is confronted by the group and the police, leading to the arrest of Mayor Delaney and a formal investigation into Penrose's journal and the macabre experiments that occurred at Thrill Manor. In the end, the group succeeds in uncovering the dark truth behind the horrifying roller coaster, Mr. Bonestripper, thus putting a stop to the cycle of death and carnage. The spirits of the victims find peace and guide the friends to dismantle and destroy the cursed coaster, setting fire to its metallic skeleton in a spectacular and cathartic ending. With the curse lifted, the friends leave the town of Ravenwood, forever changed by their harrowing experience and with a newfound respect for the power of the supernatural. The Bonestripper Chronicles then concludes with a scene showing the ashes and remnants of Mr. Bonestripper, with the camera slowly panning out to reveal a smoldering black pearl nestled among the wreckage, symbolizing the darkness and horror that once resided in the deadly roller coaster."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer a question about this article: At the age of 21 he settled in Paris. Thereafter, during the last 18 years of his life, he gave only some 30 public performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon. He supported himself by selling his compositions and teaching piano, for which he was in high demand. Chopin formed a friendship with Franz Liszt and was admired by many of his musical contemporaries, including Robert Schumann. In 1835 he obtained French citizenship. After a failed engagement to Maria Wodzińska, from 1837 to 1847 he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer George Sand. A brief and unhappy visit to Majorca with Sand in 1838–39 was one of his most productive periods of composition. In his last years, he was financially supported by his admirer Jane Stirling, who also arranged for him to visit Scotland in 1848. Through most of his life, Chopin suffered from poor health. He died in Paris in 1849, probably of tuberculosis. What was the likely cause of death for Chopin?","completion":"Chopin likely died because of a sickness called tuberculosis. It's a bad germ that can make people very sick, and it was what probably made Chopin's body too tired and weak to keep going."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Who enlisted the help of four producers?, using the article: Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary.

You’re a journalist.” Tuesday’s big news, of course, was that after assailing Kelly with criticisms of bias and receiving a series of smart-aleck statements from her network, Trump finally declared that he would not attend Thursday night’s GOP debate, which Kelly is scheduled to co-moderate. “What is he afraid of?” Moore asked. “I’m sitting here.

Review: \\"The Princess of Dhagabad\\" is a fine book not only by fantasy standards. It deals with many things beyond the seemingly straightforward plot - knowledge and power, duty and desire, destiny and will. Years of writing scientific papers affected the author's style - the language is precise and clear even when facing Unknown. The pace of the book is somewhat more relaxed than is typical for the genre but those extra words per unit of action are worth reading. The book is rather mild and kind in coping with harsh realities of life. Generally, fans of Conan the Barbarian saga will be disappointed; fans of J.R.R. Tolkien and G.G. Kay are likely to enjoy it. Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","completion":"The review for \\"The Princess of Dhagabad\\" is positive. This conclusion can be derived from the commendatory language the reviewer uses and the explicit appreciation they express for the varied themes tackled by the book. The reviewer appreciates the author's writing style, mentioning that it is \\"precise and clear\\" despite the complexity of the fantasy genre and the multitude of profound themes tackled in the book. They note that the author's experience in writing scientific papers has notably influenced and enhanced this style. This counts as a positive, as being able to communicate complex ideas and narratives clearly and concisely is a sought after quality in writing. They have also positively highlighted the patience and attention to detail in the book's pacing. Although they note that the pace is more \\"relaxed\\" than typical for the genre, they seem to view this as an advantage, stating that the \\"extra words per unit of action are worth reading\\". This indicates that they believe the book is thoughtfully and thoroughly written, once again contributing to a positive review. Additionally, the reviewer remarks that the book is \\"mild and kind in coping with harsh realities of life\\", implicitly commending its sensitive treatment of these subjects. Even in their critique, where they suggest fans of the \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" saga may not enjoy the novel, they balance it out by proposing that fans of J.R.R. Tolkien and G.G. Kay are likely to enjoy it. This critique appears more as a heads-up about the book's style, rather than an outright negative comment. All these aspects - appreciation for the author's writing style, the pace of the narrative, the sympathetic portrayal of harsh realities, and a specific audience recommendation - suggest that the reviewer looks favorably on \\"The Princess of Dhagabad\\".

A-Teens (stylized as A*Teens) were a Swedish pop music group from Stockholm, Sweden, formed by Niklas Berg in 1998 as an ABBA tribute band called ABBA Teens and later renamed A-Teens. The band members were Marie Serneholt, Amit Sebastian Paul, Dhani Lennevald and Sara Lumholdt. The band's debut album became a success around the world and in 2001 it was reported that the band had sold 6 million albums worldwide. After six years together, the band announced they would take a break in 2004 after the release of their Greatest Hits album. The band's second album, entitled \\"Teen Spirit\\", featured a compilation of tracks that were not ABBA covers and when it was finally released on 26 February 2001, it debuted at number two in the Swedish Charts. This pop sensation hit reached the top ten in other countries and entered at number eighty-three on the World Charts, number thirteen on the European Albums Chart, number fourteen on CNN's WorldBeat Album Charts and peaked at number fifty in the United States selling over 60,000 copies in its first two weeks, ensuring Gold Status for sales exceeding the 500,000 copies in the United States alone. Prior to the release of the album, the A-Teens became one of the first bands to broadcast one of their shows on MSN's Websites. The UK releases were delayed due to A-Teens' failure with their previous album in that country. When \\"Upside Down\\" was released there in May 2001, it became their biggest hit in the country. The single peaked at number ten in the United Kingdom becoming their only top ten hit in that country. The album was delayed and released after the second single, \\"Halfway Around The World\\" in late October 2001. The single barely made the top thirty and the album did not chart in the top 75. Before they started their concert tour in the U.S. the band went to promote their album to Asia, with stops in Japan, Singapore, Malaysia where they did show for MTV Asia and Thailand, with great success, especially in the former where Coca-Cola signed the band to become the face of the brand there and promote, \\"We were the first international artists ever to appear on a soda can there. They printed 15 million of them; we went home with ten!\\" Remembers Sara, The cans were distributed around the country that year. Also in 2001, the A-Teens performed as top billing during the Radio Disney Live! 2001 World Tour in Chicago and Philadelphia markets. The group promoted their album with a forty-three-date tour with Aaron Carter around the U.S. Back in Europe, the band toured with No Angels in Germany. By the end of 2001, Teen Spirit went on to sell over 1 million copies worldwide and were invited by Walt Disney/Buena Vista to record the European soundtrack for the movie \\"The Princess Diaries\\". As the movie had already been released in North and South America, the movie was set to be released in Europe in the winter 2001. \\"Heartbreak Lullaby\\" a song written by Cathy Dennis (famous for writing Kylie Minogue's number one hit, \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\") and Kasmanaut, the video was shot in Germany in late October, in the middle of their tour.

In addition to those two very basic and critical activities, there are a number of other things you can to improve your mental health and overall well-being. By incorporating them into your daily life, you will be better able to manage most challenges – including struggles with self-doubt, anxiety, and mild depression. Practices that Focus Your Energy on Well-being Accept Your Feelings Stuffing or ignoring your emotions is more damaging than it is helpful. Everyone has emotions. They are a natural part of being human. Bottling them up may seem like a good solution in the moment, but when you do it all the time, you are potentially creating a time bomb that will eventually explode. Unfortunately, you are hurting yourself as you hold them in and you run the risk of hurting those you love when the eruption finally occurs. Rather than acknowledging what you are feeling and allowing yourself to experience emotions, you may medicate, rationalize, blame, bury, deny, smother, drink, or stuff them (pretend they don’t exist). Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them – especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness. It takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety. Don’t stuff your emotions! Let yourself laugh, cry, scream, yell, or pound something (preferably a pillow, grass, sand – not the wall or someone else). Do whatever you need to do, probably in private is the best choice.

What disease did Cujo have?","completion":"Cujo, the fictional Saint Bernard dog in Stephen King's 1981 novel \\"Cujo\\" and its subsequent 1983 film adaptation, suffered from rabies. Rabies is a viral disease that affects the central nervous system of mammals, including humans and dogs, leading to severe neurological symptoms, aggressive behavior, and ultimately death if left untreated. In the story, Cujo is bitten by a bat infected with the rabies virus while chasing a rabbit. Over time, the virus spreads through Cujo's system, affecting his nerves and brain. As the disease progresses, Cujo's behavior becomes increasingly erratic and aggressive. The once friendly and lovable dog transforms into a vicious, uncontrollable animal that terrorizes the people of fictional Castle Rock, Maine, as it goes on a violent rampage. Rabies is caused by the rabies virus, which is transmitted through the saliva of an infected animal via bites or scratches. The virus enters the body through the wound, invades the nervous system, and travels to the brain, where it multiplies and causes inflammation. This inflammation results in the characteristic symptoms of rabies – aggression, disorientation, seizures, paralysis, excessive salivation, and an inability to swallow. Cujo's portrayal as an aggressive, rabid dog sheds light on the severity of rabies and the importance of vaccination and prevention measures. Although the novel and the film are both works of fiction, the story serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers posed by this deadly disease. In real life, rabies prevention is critical. For domestic animals like dogs and cats, vaccinations are essential to provide immunity against the virus. When it comes to wildlife, avoiding contact with animals, such as bats, raccoons, and skunks, that may carry the virus is key. If bitten or scratched by a potentially rabid animal, it is crucial to seek immediate medical attention, as post-exposure prophylaxis can prevent the onset of symptoms and death if administered promptly. Overall, the tragic fate of Cujo in the novel and the film highlights the devastating effects of rabies on animals and serves as a potent reminder of the importance of preventive measures to protect both pets and humans from this deadly disease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the equation, we have three terms containing the variable m: -59*m, -16*m, and -13*m. Step 2: Combine the -16*m and -13*m. -16*m - 13*m = -29*m Now, the equation becomes: -59*m - 150 = -29*m Step 3: Move the -29*m term to the left side of the equation to isolate the m terms together. To do this, add 29*m to both sides of the equation: -59*m + 29*m - 150 = -29*m + 29*m This simplifies to: -30*m - 150 = 0 Step 4: Move the constant term to the right side of the equation to isolate the m term on the left side. To do this, add 150 to both sides of the equation: -30*m - 150 + 150 = 0 + 150 This simplifies to: -30*m = 150 Step 5: Solve for m by dividing both sides of the equation by -30. m = 150 / -30 This simplifies to: m = -5 So, the answer is m = -5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"So if all 78 hypotheses are true, then roughly 7.8 of them--call it eight-- should be confirmed overwhelmingly.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"8 should be easily confirmed if they are all true.\\"? Select from: [1]. yes; [2]. it is not possible to tell; [3]. no;","completion":"Based on the premise given, it seems that the user is operating under the assumption that if all 78 hypotheses are true, approximately 10% of them, which corresponds to 7.8 or a rounded-up value of 8, would be overwhelmingly confirmed. In other words, it is expected that if all hypotheses are true, strong evidence should be found to confirm 8 of them distinctly. Now, let's analyze the provided options to determine which one best fits the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, \\"8 should be easily confirmed if they are all true.\\" [1]. yes: This option suggests that the premise supports the hypothesis. Indeed, there is a correlation between the premise and the hypothesis. Based on the premise, if all 78 hypotheses are true, then 8 of them should have overwhelming confirmation. The hypothesis that \\"8 should be easily confirmed if they are all true\\" builds upon the premise by suggesting that these 8 hypotheses should be easy to confirm within the context of the scenario presented. Therefore, option [1], \\"yes,\\" seems to establish a connection between the two statements. [2]. it is not possible to tell: Choosing this option would imply that there is not enough information to determine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. However, as discussed above, there is a clear correlation between both statements indicating that 8 of the hypotheses should be confirmed with strong evidence if all 78 are true. Thus, option [2] does not appear to be the best answer. [3]. no: This option would imply that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. However, as previously discussed, there is a connection between the two statements in terms of the expectation for 8 of the hypotheses to be confirmed with substantial evidence in the case that all 78 are true. Consequently, option [3] contradicts the relationship identified between the premise and the hypothesis. Taking into account the analysis of each option, the best answer to what the premise tells us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"8 should be easily confirmed if they are all true\\" is [1], \\"yes.\\" The premise does support the idea that 8 hypotheses should have overwhelming confirmation and, thus, be more straightforward to confirm if all the 78 hypotheses are true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What the TwoPack does is to embed in the EU legal framework the working practices established under these intergovernmental instruments Add punctuation.","completion":"The TwoPack refers to two European Union (EU) regulations that were adopted in 2013 to strengthen the economic governance of the euro area. These regulations aimed to enhance fiscal and economic coordination within the 19 eurozone countries, as well as establish a closer collaboration between national governments and EU institutions. What the TwoPack does is to embed in the EU legal framework the working practices established under these intergovernmental instruments. These working practices involve effective monitoring and surveillance of fiscal policies, early detection of potential economic imbalances, and taking necessary corrective measures, when required. By transferring these practices to the EU legal framework, the TwoPack ensures that member states follow a more coherent approach in addressing macroeconomic challenges. This allows the European Commission and other EU bodies to carry out an improved oversight of national budgets and economic policies, which ultimately results in a more resilient and stable euro area. In summary, the TwoPack embeds intergovernmental practices into the EU legal framework, strengthening the economic governance and collaboration among the eurozone countries, and contributing to the overall financial stability of the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How much braking does a driver do Or idling Please fix the punctuation.","completion":"How much braking a driver does or idling depends on various factors such as driving conditions, traffic levels, location, and driver's behavior. Both braking and idling can have a significant impact on the overall performance and efficiency of a vehicle, but let us take a closer look at each factor in more detail. 1. Driving conditions: Driving conditions can greatly influence the amount of braking and idling a driver does. In difficult or rough road conditions, a driver may need to brake more often to navigate turns, avoid potholes, or maintain a safe speed. Areas with steep inclines or declines may also necessitate more frequent braking, while flat stretches may require minimal braking, leading to more idling. 2. Traffic levels: In urban areas with heavy traffic, drivers often brake more frequently due to stop-and-go conditions. Additionally, idling may increase during traffic jams, at red lights, or when waiting for pedestrians and cyclists to cross the road. In contrast, driving on highways or less congested roads allows for more consistent speeds and less frequent braking and idling. 3. Location: Where a person is driving plays a significant role in the amount of braking and idling performed. Urban areas, with dense populations, intersections, and slower-moving traffic, usually require more braking and idling. Alternatively, rural areas and highways allow for less braking and idling due to fewer traffic signals, less congestion, and higher speed limits. 4. Driver's behavior: Each individual driver's habits can affect the amount of braking and idling they do. For example, aggressive drivers may brake hard and accelerate quickly, leading to more wear and tear on the braking system, while more cautious drivers might maintain a steadier pace without sudden stops or starts. Similarly, some drivers may idle their engines while parked, waiting to pick someone up, or during downtimes, while others may switch off their engines to save fuel. In conclusion, the amount of braking and idling a driver performs depends on various factors, including road conditions, traffic levels, location, and the driver's behavior. By understanding these factors and adjusting driving habits, a driver can potentially reduce the amount of braking and idling, thereby improving fuel efficiency and reducing wear and tear on the vehicle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We have this equation: 19x - 195 + 317 = -9x - 270 First, let's add the numbers on each side of the equation. On the left side, we have -195 + 317, which is the same as 317 – 195. If you take away 195 from 317, we get 122. So now our equation looks like this: 19x + 122 = -9x - 270 Next, let's get all the x's on one side. To do that, we need to add 9x to both sides of the equation. When we do that, we get: 19x + 9x + 122 = -270 Now let's add the x's together: 19x + 9x equals 28x. So, our equation is now: 28x + 122 = -270 Next, we want to get rid of the 122 on the side with the x's. To do that, we subtract 122 from both sides: 28x = -270 - 122 Now, let's add the numbers on the right side: -270 – 122 equals -392: 28x = -392 To find the value of x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 28: x = -392 / 28 When you divide -392 by 28, you get -14: x = -14 So the value of x is -14.

Childhood or past experiences: A person's upbringing, along with traumatic or adverse experiences in their past, can shape their thought patterns and behaviors. They may have grown up around negative role models or in an environment where negativity was prevalent. b. Defense Mechanism: Some people may use negativity as a coping mechanism to protect themselves from disappointments or emotional pain. It could be that they purposely set low expectations for themselves and others to avoid feeling let down. c. Self-esteem and self-worth: A person with low self-esteem or sense of self-worth may struggle with negative thoughts and emotions. They may feel unworthy of success, happiness, or positive outcomes, and thus, unconsciously engage in negative thoughts and behaviors. d. Habit: For some, negativity can become a learned habit over time. They might initially engage in negative thinking as a response to a particular situation, but eventually, it becomes ingrained in their overall personality. e. Attention-seeking: In some cases, individuals may use negativity as a means to gain attention or sympathy from others. They might feel that negative behavior is more rewarding or noticeable than maintaining a positive attitude. 2. Is the performance of service provided by Club Mahindra satisfactory? Club Mahindra is a holiday resort chain in India, and satisfaction with their services would be subjective, depending on individual experiences. However, some factors that might influence the satisfaction levels of customers include: a. Quality of Accommodations: The condition, cleanliness, and comfort of Club Mahindra's resorts can significantly impact guests' overall satisfaction. b. Amenities and Activities: Club Mahindra offers several activities and amenities to guests, including swimming pools, restaurants, spa services, and adventure activities. How well the company executes these offerings can influence customer satisfaction. c.

When he tried to kill a one-year-old boy, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), the killing curse rebounded upon him, destroying his body. Harry is left an orphan with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, Voldemort having killed his parents, Lily (Geraldine Somerville) and James (Adrian Rawlins) Potter. Professors Dumbledore (Richard Harris) and McGonagall (Dame Maggie Smith) and Gamekeeper Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) leave him on the doorstep of his ultra-conventional, insensitive, negligent Muggle (non-magical) relatives, the Dursley family, who take him in. Harry's relatives decide to conceal his magical heritage from him and make him live in a cupboard under the stairs for ten years.Shortly before Harry's eleventh birthday, he receives a letter addressed specifically to him. His outraged uncle, however, reads and burns it before Harry has a chance to look at the contents. The sender does not give up, and the Dursleys receive successively larger numbers of the same correspondence. Soon, his Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) becomes so paranoid that the Dursleys, with Harry in tow, hide in a hut on a small island to escape. That night (which happens to be before Harry's birthday), he is visited by an enormous man named Hagrid who bursts through the locked door of the hut.

Translate \\"The old man would probably be dead within weeks, if not days.\\" to Czech?","completion":"To translate the sentence \\"The old man would probably be dead within weeks, if not days.\\" to Czech, I'll break it down into smaller units and try to retain the meaning in the translated language. I'll also consider grammatical structures and cultural references if any. Here is how I can translate the sentence: \\"Starý muž by pravděpodobně zemřel během týdnů, pokud ne dnů.\\" Why? Czech grammar structure is slightly different than English and word-for-word translation could result in loss of original meaning. Here \\"starý muž\\" means \\"the old man\\", \\"by pravděpodobně zemřel\\" refers to \\"would probably be dead\\", \\"během týdnů\\" is \\"within weeks\\", \\"pokud ne\\" is \\"if not\\" and lastly \\"dnů\\" is \\"days\\".

In New York City, 1934, jazz singer Dot Clark and her shady gangster boyfriend, Louie The Lug (\\"An Earful of Music\\"), are introduced. After having an affair with the deceased Professor Edward Wilson, Dot is now technically his common-law wife and heiress to 77 million. She has to go to Egypt to claim the money, and sets off with Louie in hopes of getting the cash.

Please answer the following question: It was not entirely true that Patch knew there was food in the mountains. He had never been to the mountains. No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\\" Patch shouted up. \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.

Instead the Welsh government will change its Public Health Bill so they will only be banned in schools, eating places and on public transport. In a debate in the Senedd, Mark Drakeford told AMs his personal view had not changed. But he said he recognised his responsibility as minister to find an agreement. He said he would bring forward amendments to define more precisely enclosed spaces where e-cigarettes would be prohibited. He told AMs: \\"I'm not prepared to do nothing in the hope that harm might not occur\\". Previously the Welsh government said it wanted to restrict the use of e-cigarettes in exactly the same way as tobacco. It was concerned their use may \\"normalise\\" smoking for children and young people while ministers feared they may act as a \\"gateway\\" into smoking tobacco. The ban, intended to come into force in 2017, would have been a first in the UK. Ministers pointed to concerns by the World Health Organisation and steps taken in 40 other countries to regulate e-cigarettes, but it divided opinion among health and medical groups. Some anti-smoking groups including Ash Wales, Cancer Research UK and Tenovus opposed restrictions, saying they helped smokers kick the habit. A major review by Public Health England found e-cigarettes were 95% less harmful than tobacco and could be prescribed on the NHS in future to help smokers quit. Before Tuesday's debate, experts from universities and the National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training wrote to AMs claiming there was no evidence to justify the legislation. They claimed it would discourage smokers to switch from smoking to e-cigarettes. Public Health Wales, local health boards and the BMA supported the curbs while opposition politicians called it a \\"huge step backwards\\". The proposals also divided the group of AMs which looked in detail at the proposal. The five Labour members supported curbs on e-cigarettes but they were opposed by four opposition AMs. Less stringent restrictions on e-cigarettes than those on tobacco were suggested and that appears now to have been accepted by the health minister. ANALYSIS by Owain Clarke, BBC Wales health correspondent The decision this afternoon can be interpreted in two ways. Some critics will view it an embarrassing climb down - and ask why did the health minister press ahead with the proposed ban in the face of significant opposition and unclear evidence. Supporters of the Welsh government will say he has acted responsibly, listened to the debate and acted accordingly - an example perhaps of democracy in action. The watering down of the proposed e-cigarette ban in public places does raise some questions about what exactly the Welsh government's flagship Public Health Bill will now ultimately achieve. Previously, a plan to introduce a minimum price for alcohol from the bill was taken out and introduced as separate legislation over fears of legal challenges. Perhaps the decision today reflects the health minister's fears that without a majority a political row about the scope of e-cigs ban could scupper the entire legislation. This whole debate also raises another question about the role of government and the timing of the bill. In seeking to restrict the use of e-cigarettes, were ministers acting responsibly to protect the public, just in case they were found to act as a gateway to tobacco? Or was the Welsh government here being premature, too willing without evidence to interfere in people's lives? This article was about:","completion":"The Welsh government has recently announced a backtrack on plans to ban the use of e-cigarettes in public places, after concerns were raised about the lack of evidence to justify such restrictions. Instead, the Public Health Bill will be amended so that e-cigarettes will only be banned in schools, eating establishments, and on public transportation. The change comes after a major review by Public Health England found that e-cigarettes were 95% less harmful than conventional tobacco and could potentially be prescribed on the NHS to help smokers quit. Health Minister Mark Drakeford said that while his personal views have not changed, he recognized that it is his responsibility to find a reasonable agreement on this issue. He said that he will bring forward amendments to clearly define the enclosed spaces where e-cigarettes would be prohibited. The debate surrounding e-cigarette restrictions in Wales has been divisive, with some anti-smoking groups and local health boards in support, while Cancer Research UK, universities, and opposition politicians argue that the ban would discourage smokers from switching to a less harmful alternative. Despite the changes, the revised restrictions on e-cigarettes will still be more stringent than those on conventional tobacco products, and the ban is planned to come into effect in 2017. It will be the first e-cigarette ban of its kind in the UK, and has garnered attention from the World Health Organisation, and other countries that have implemented or are considering e-cigarette legislation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Hons are distracted when they find the Fungs captured by Never Die and his brothers, who in spite of decapitation and loss of a hand, proceed to chase them (the severed hand grabbing at one of them) chase the Hons to the lair of Nine-Tails Fox, who has recently caused his wife, the apsara known as Flying Cat to walk out on him.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Audioslave's history dates back to October 18, 2000, when Rage Against the Machine's lead vocalist Zack de la Rocha announced he was leaving the band, citing a breakdown in its \\"decision-making process\\". Rage Against the Machine broke up as a result of de la Rocha's departure, but the remaining three members of the band—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk—decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist. Several vocalists jammed with the three, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but they did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Contrary to popular belief, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains neither auditioned nor was asked to join the new project. Tom Morello denied this claim on his Twitter account in 2015. Music producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they play with Chris Cornell, the ex-frontman of Soundgarden. Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed \\"it could turn into a Yardbirds-into-Led Zeppelin scenario.\\" Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together.

Her rival at the club, Clo-Clo, not wanting to be upstaged, startles the animal and it escapes the club into the dark night. The owner of the leopard, a solo sideshow performer named Charlie How-Come—billed as \\"The Leopard Man\\"—begins pestering Manning for money for replacement of the leopard. Soon a girl is found mauled to death, and Manning and Kiki feel remorse for having unleashed the monster. After attending the girl's funeral, Manning joins a posse that seeks to hunt down the giant cat. Presently another young woman is killed, and Manning begins to suspect that the latest killing is the work of a man who has made the death look like a leopard attack. The leopard's owner, who admits to spells of drunkenness, is unnerved by Manning's theory and begins to doubt his own sanity. He asks the police to lock him up, but while he is in jail another killing occurs: the victim this time is Clo-Clo. Afterward, the leopard is found dead in the countryside, and is judged to have died before at least one of the recent killings. When the human murderer in finally found, he confesses that his compulsion to kill was excited by the first leopard attack., what would be the answer ?

These days, unfortunately, my spa trips are few and far between. I blame the damn kids for that one! So, as you can imagine, I was pretty damn excited when the in-laws presented me with an Urban Spa voucher for the Urban Indulgence package: one hour hot stone Lomi Lomi massage followed by a Heavenly Spa Facial - two hours on indulgent bliss, for Christmas. I had never had a hot stone massage before so was very much looking forward to this, if nothing else out of curiosity about what is involved. Whenever you see pictures advertising a hot stone massage, the beautiful model always has a bunch of largish stones on her back so I wasn't sure whether it was more an acupressure experience where they left the stones strategically placed on the back to work their magic or whether it was an actual massage. Turns out that it is an actual massage. I requested a firm massage as my back has really been giving me issues. Carrying 15kgs of Crazy Kid or 9kgs of Kiki (or 26kgs of double babies) really isn't too good for the back so it had been causing me problems for a couple of months. My therapist (the lovely Kristy) gave me an expertly firm massage and used a small, smooth hot stone, along with her hands, to perform the massage. It was quite a unique experience as one minute I could sense that she was using her hands to do the massage then then next I'd get a sweep of hotness as the stone was run over me. It really was a delightful sensory experience. As my back was a problem area, Kristy spent 30 minutes just on that then the other 30 minutes was spent on the rest of my body. I could feel myself drifting in and out of consciousness throughout the massage. One really special thing about this massage was that the massage table was heated. Such a small touch, but one that was greatly appreciated (although it was a great contributor to my lack of consciousness!).

Nobody behind the counter or taking food out looked at me, or acknowledged me. So, I decided I must be doing it wrong.

I waited...and I waited...and I waited, while several people came in, seated themselves, were brought place mats, utensils, ice water, and their orders taken and their drink orders brought out. I finally walked back up to the counter and asked to at least get my drink order...profuse apology from the man behind the counter, gave me a bottle of coke which turned out to be frozen solid.

I suppose the sandwich, which was good, on good bread, well made and tasty, is the reason to give Scratch the benefit of the doubt and give them 2 stars (the service was below 1 star). The little salad they serve with the sandwich was fresh and the vinaigrette was tasty, so that was nice as well. Was it 11.00 + tip for a small sandwich good? Well, that is my quandary.

We have the equation: -15 * p = -9352 + 9457 First, we need to solve for the right side of the equation (-9352 + 9457). Well, if we have -9352, and we add 9457, we are moving back in the positive direction. Let's see how many more we need to add to get to 0. 9352 is 105 less than 9457, so 9457 - 9352 = 105. Now our equation is: -15 * p = 105 Next, we need to solve for p. Since we have -15 multiplied by p, we need to do the opposite, which is dividing, to figure out what p is. So, we will divide 105 by -15: 105 ÷ -15 = -7 (since a positive number divided by a negative number is a negative number). So now we know that p = -7."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: In his lifetime, Ray had done a number of things for which he was not proud, things he'd like to see just as well stuffed down a dark hole. Everybody had things of which they were ashamed. Everybody has committed their share of sins that they wish they could take back. But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand. It was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been. Perhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right? The living simply did not understand that there were rules. They didn't want to understand something so banal. Someone who didn't take the time to understand the rules had no right to pass judgment on him. Not that it ever stopped them. \\"I hear that you are unhappy,\\" he said into the phone, then had to pull the receiver away from his ear so the woman on the other end could scream at him some more.

Movie title: Take Me Home Tonight Movie plot: Set in 1988, the film begins in a music store with recent MIT graduate Matt Franklin (Topher Grace), his twin sister Wendy (Anna Faris), and his best friend Barry Nathan (Dan Fogler) as they try to figure out when to see Matt's dream girl Tori Frederking (Teresa Palmer). Following graduation, Matt has been working at a Suncoast Video store at a local shopping mall while trying to figure out what to do with his life. While working one day, Tori randomly walks into the store. When she asks him where he works, he lies and tells her he's at Goldman Sachs. Tori then invites him to a Labor Day weekend party held by Wendy's boyfriend Kyle Masterson (Chris Pratt). Matt, Barry and Wendy drive to the party later that night, but before they arrive, Barry steals a car from the dealership from where he got fired earlier in the day for his bad sales record.At the party, Kyle challenges people to ride the \\"ball,\\" a hollow steel sphere that is supposed to ride down the street. Matt runs into Carlos (Demetri Martin), a high school classmate who actually works at Goldman Sachs. Barry tries the cocaine Matt found in the stolen car, and is involved in a dance battle, after which Kyle proposes to Wendy.Matt and Barry leave the party with Tori and her friends to go to a business party in Beverly Hills. During the drive to the party, Tori tells Matt that her boss, Peter (Michael Ian Black) hired her just to see her naked. At the party, Tori reveals to Matt that she hates her job. Matt and Tori leave the party, enter the backyard of a neighbor's home, and jump on a trampoline where they play truth or dare. When they get too far, Matt ends up sleeping with her. Then, Matt tells Tori the truth about his job, causing Tori to become upset and leave.During the drive back to Kyle's party, Barry tells Matt that he should have that one night of enjoyment. Barry snorts cocaine that was hidden in the glove compartment in the car they stole. He persuades Matt to do it despite driving the car. Matt gets distracted which ends up crashing the... The answer to this question is:","completion":"In the movie \\"Take Me Home Tonight\\", Matt Franklin, played by Topher Grace, lies to Tori Frederking about where he works because he's embarrassed about his job at Suncoast video. He had recently graduated from MIT and was working in a video store, a situation that didn't seem to align with his educational achievements. He probably felt that working at such a place didn't make him appear successful or remarkable in any way, especially compared to his peers. When Tori, his long-time crush, unexpectedly walks into his store, he seizes the opportunity to lie about his job to impress her, telling her that he works at Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs, known for being a prominent investment bank and financial services company, certainly holds more prestige and would make him appear more successful in Tori's eyes. It's a lie that presumably he hopes will give him a better chance with her. This reflects the societal pressure to 'appear' successful, and it also sheds light on Matt's insecurities about his current job and life situation. Mostly, Matt wanted to win Tori's admiration and show her a side of him that aligns with the societal definitions of success. He may have thought that admitting to working at a video store wouldn't seem nearly as impressive to Tori, undermining his chances with her. Hence, the lie was an attempt to appear successful and promising to Tori, even if it potentially compromised the trust between them later on. However, this lie creates a plot point that brings about dramatic tension and conflict in the storyline. When the truth emerges that he doesn't work at Goldman Sachs, it causes a rift between Matt and Tori. So from a storytelling perspective, the lie serves to intensify and complicate the relationship between Matt and Tori, making the story more engaging and unpredictable to the viewer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Hafez al-Assad, Who Turned Syria Into a Power in the Middle East, Dies at 69 Hafez al-Assad, the air force officer who ruled Syria for three decades, transforming a Middle East backwater into an introverted regional power that endured as the center of unbending Arab hostility toward Israel, died yesterday in Damascus. He was 69. Mr. Assad, a survivor of several assassination attempts and at least one heart attack, died of a heart attack, according to medical officials quoted by Agence France-Presse. Among the Arab autocrats who became stock players in the perpetual drama of negotiating Middle East peace, none was more courted, nor more aloof, than the Syrian leader. No lasting peace could hold without him, but none could be negotiated with him either. A treaty remained elusive largely due to his stubborn role in demanding back every inch of Syrian territory. At home, Mr. Assad's longevity in office rested on a rigid intolerance of dissent, most starkly illustrated by the slaying of thousands of residents of Hama in February 1982 to end a swelling Islamic insurgency. His was a suspicious police state, limiting access to modern instruments like the fax or the Internet that might somehow become tools to help undermine his government. Mr. Assad rarely traveled, even within Syria, and as he aged his public appearances were limited to religious ceremonies on major holidays. But his withdrawn life was also devoid of the lavish trappings common to other Arab rulers. His home and office, where he often worked 18-hour days, consisted of two modest villas that faced each other in a residential neighborhood in Damascus. The stream of American presidents, secretaries of state and other officials who crossed his doorstep over the years, hoping to keep the latest peace effort from foundering there, emerged with a grudging respect for Mr. Assad. He was at once courteous and calculating, professorial and persistent, unleashing flashes of self-deprecating humor during marathon negotiating sessions. The length of the sessions were as legendary as they were nerve-racking. When Henry A. Kissinger arrived in 1973, becoming the first American secretary of state to visit Syria in 20 years, their initial meeting lasted 6 hours and 30 minutes. The waiting press, uninitiated in the ways of the Syrian leader, wondered aloud if the American had been kidnapped. ''His tactic was to open with a statement of the most extreme position to test what the traffic would bear,'' Mr. Kissinger wrote in ''Years of Upheaval,'' the volume of his memoirs published in 1982. ''He might then allow himself to be driven back to the attainable, fighting a dogged rear guard action that made clear that concessions could be exacted only at a heavy price and that discouraged excessive expectations of them. (His negotiating style was in this respect not so different from that of the Israelis, much as both of them would hate the comparison.)'' The lengthy exchanges got to the point that one task of the American ambassador was to brief visiting dignitaries before any meeting with President Assad to pace themselves on the constant offerings of coffee, tea and lemonade lest they bruise protocol by interrupting the Syrian leader to ask for a bathroom break. ''We dubbed it bladder diplomacy,'' said Edward P. Djerejian, the American ambassador from 1988 to 1991. Mr. Assad was most renowned for lecturing foreigners, even American presidents, about the unfair colonial fragmentation of the Middle East. In case anyone missed the point, his reception hall was dominated by a large painting depicting the Arab armies under Saladin defeating the Crusaders during the battle of Hittin in 1187, a not-so-subtle reminder that he considered present circumstances temporary. ''Even in his bitterness toward Israel, he retained a certain wry humor about their conflicting views, and he seemed to derive great patience from his obvious sense of history,'' President Jimmy Carter wrote in ''The Blood of Abraham,'' a 1985 study of the region. Syria was a young nation adrift before Mr. Assad's rule. The government had been a revolving door swung repeatedly by coups after independence from France in 1946, resulting in little development and a population weary of chaos. Summary:","completion":"Hafez al-Assad was a leader in Syria who was in charge for 30 years. He worked hard to make Syria a strong and powerful country. He didn't like Israel and didn't want to make peace with them. Mr. Assad didn't let people disagree with him and controlled everything. He lived a simple life and worked very long hours. Many important people from other countries met with Mr. Assad, but it was difficult to make deals with him. He passed away at the age of 69 because of a heart attack."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. A Long Island Little League coach died after he was struck in the head with a baseball during warm-ups before a game Saturday night, authorities said. Richard Becher, 50, was on the mound during batting practice at a facility called at Baseball Heaven in Yaphank, Suffolk County, when a 12-year-old batter smacked a ball right up the middle that plunked him in the head and knocked him unconscious, according to officials. “He was an amazing person, an amazing father, son, friend,” family friend Denise Volpicello told The Post. “It’s devastating for everyone. He was very active in the community. It’s a tremendous loss.” The young player hit the ball that struck Becher sometime around 5:30 p.m., authorities said. Becher’s brother-in-law said the devoted baseball dad — whose son played on the team he coached — was struck hard by a line drive. “He threw a pitch, the ball got hit. It was a line drive,” John Bree, 51, told Newsday. “He was hit in the head. He dropped to the ground.” Several bystanders attempted to revive the unconscious Becher with CPR while waiting for police and EMS to arrive. Becher, who lived in nearby Holbrook, was rushed to Brookhaven Memorial Hospital Medical Center in East Patchogue, where he was declared dead, police said. “It was obviously a tragic situation,” said Roger Pondel, a spokesman for Baseball Heaven. “Our hearts go out to the family.” Becher, a married father of two, was reportedly pitching from behind an L-screen, which is designed to protect players from this sort of injury, when he was struck. Michael Rubenstein, the president of Sachem Little League, said it was a freak accident. “It’s pretty rare [to get hit] if you’re behind the screen, but you can stick your head out for a second” and expose yourself, Rubenstein told Newsday. The team was preparing for a Tri-State Tournament game Saturday night. The game was canceled after the tragic incident. Becher was a board member of Sachem and the Ronkonkoma Youth Organization. His friends on Long Island were heartbroken by his death and mourned him on social media. “The Sachem community lost a great man last night,” Christopher Pierre wrote on Facebook. “Rich was always the life of the party, had the ability to make you laugh.” Pierre added that Becher was a constant presence on the field and was respected throughout the community. “His tragic passing was where Rich was usually found, on a baseball field with his son and his team,” he said. “His untimely passing is a constant reminder how in a split second, life is altered. It’s hard for me to believe this isn’t a nightmare.” Another friend remembered Becher for his enthusiasm for the game. “Always full of energy when he came into the academy,” Tom Downey wrote on Facebook. “Always reminded the kids that they were suppose to have fun. I’ll always remember that about him.” Becher was the owner of Bech Air Corp., a sheet-metal-installation company on Long Island. ||||| A devoted Holbrook father described as a passionate backer of youth sports died after being hit in the head by a baseball while pitching batting practice to his 12-year-old son's team, his family and Suffolk police said.

When more wind and rain occur, it can increase the rate of erosion and the movement of sediment. This can result in more sediment being loosened from the soil and being carried down towards rivers. The increased water flow from the rain can also help transport the sediment more efficiently, potentially leading to a change in how the lighter and heavier items are distributed within the river. Though the wind and rain do not directly change the steps of the sediment transportation process as described, they can indirectly impact the process by altering the amount of sediment being transported and the rate at which it moves.

On to the Twentieth Century: The British extended their control over the peninsula by putting together the whole panoply of colonial administration — civil service, public works, judiciary force, police force, post office, education, and land regulation — with teams of British administrators, teachers, engineers, and doctors to go with it. At the same time, the tin industry, dominated by Chinese using labor-intensive methods in the 19th century, passed increasingly into Western hands, who employed the modern technology of gravel pumps and mining dredges. Petroleum had been found in northern Borneo, at Miri, and in Brunei, and the Anglo-Dutch Shell company used Singapore as its regional depot for its oil supplies and exports. But the major breakthrough for the Malay economy was the triumph of rubber, when Singapore's new garden director, Henry Ridle (\\"Rubber Ridley\\" to his friends, \\"Mad Ridley\\" to all doubting Thomases) had developed new planting and tapping methods and painstakingly spread his faith in rubber around the peninsula. World demand increased with the growth of the motor-car and electrical industries, and sky-rocketed during World War I. By 1920, Malaya was producing 53 percent of the world's rubber, which had overtaken tin as its main source of income. The Malay ruling class again took a back seat. Together with effective control of the rubber and tin industries, the British now firmly held the reins of government. The sultans were left in charge of local and religious affairs, content with their prestige, prosperity, and security. The census of 1931 served as an alarm signal for the Malay national consciousness. Bolstered by a new influx of immigrants to meet the rubber and tin booms of the 1920s, non-Malays now slightly outnumbered the indigenous population. The Great Depression of 1929 stepped up ethnic competition in the shrinking job market, and nationalism developed to safeguard Malay interests against the Chinese and Indians rather than the British imperial authority. Though hampered by the peninsula's division into the States and the Straits Settlements, relatively conservative Muslim intellectuals and community leaders came together at the Pan-Malayan Malay Congress in Kuala Lumpur in 1939. In Singapore the following year, they were joined by representatives from Sarawak and Brunei. Teachers and journalists urged the revival of the common Malay-Indonesian consciousness, split by the Anglo-Dutch dismemberment of the region in the 19th century. This spirit became a factor in the gathering clouds of war. Question: \\"What caused the Malay ruling class to take a back seat?\\" Answer: \\"Auto and electrical industry demand for rubber, which dramatically increased during World War I\\" Is this answer to the question correct? Options are: (1). no. (2). yes.","completion":"2. yes The answer is correct because the Malay ruling class took a back seat as the British gained control of the rubber and tin industries, which were the main sources of income for Malay. The growth of the motor-car and electrical industries increased the demand for rubber, which then sky-rocketed during World War I. This allowed the British to firmly hold the reins of government, leaving the Malay ruling class to focus on local and religious affairs."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: suppose there is less sunlight gathered by leaves happens, how will it affect LESS sugar and oxygen being produced. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"B: Less To better understand the answer, let's go through each step of the process and analyze the potential consequences of reduced sunlight on the production of sugar and oxygen in plants. 1. Green is a color that gathers sunlight easily: Chlorophyll, the green pigment in the leaves, captures sunlight and starts the process of photosynthesis. 2. Sunlight is gathered by the leaves of the plant: Leaves serve as light-collecting organs, with a large surface area exposed to sunlight to maximize absorption. 3. The sunlight is broken down into glucose through photosynthesis: Photosynthesis is a vital process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria use sunlight energy, water, and carbon dioxide to produce glucose (sugar) and oxygen. The sunlight energy is absorbed by chlorophyll and used to drive a series of chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose. 4. The glucose travels the plant: Once produced, glucose is transported throughout the plant via phloem tissue, providing energy and raw materials for growth and reproduction. 5. The plant uses that glucose as energy to grow: Glucose is broken down through cellular respiration, releasing energy that plants can use for various life processes, including growth, reproduction, and maintenance. Now, let's get back to the question. Suppose there is less sunlight gathered by leaves. This would mean that the plants would have less energy input available for the photosynthesis process. With less sunlight energy, the rate of photosynthesis would decrease, resulting in reduced production of glucose and oxygen. So, in this scenario, the correct answer would be B: less. As the availability of sunlight decreases, less sugar (glucose) and oxygen will be produced by the plant through photosynthesis. This may lead to slower overall growth, reduced reproduction, and potentially weaker plants more susceptible to diseases and pests. Additionally, less oxygen production by plants can have implications for other organisms in the ecosystem, as many living beings rely on oxygen for survival."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The girls at St Paul's helped to copy out the orchestral parts, and the women of Morley and the St Paul's girls learned the choral part in the last movement.The performance was given on 29 September to an invited audience including Sir Henry Wood and most of the professional musicians in London. Five months later, when Holst was in Greece, Boult introduced The Planets to the general public, at a concert in February 1919; Holst sent him a long letter full of suggestions, but failed to convince him that the suite should be played in full. The conductor believed that about half an hour of such radically new music was all the public could absorb at first hearing, and he gave only five of the seven movements on that occasion.Holst enjoyed his time in Salonica, from where he was able to visit Athens, which greatly impressed him. His musical duties were wide-ranging, and even obliged him on occasion to play the violin in the local orchestra: \\"it was great fun, but I fear I was not of much use\\". He returned to England in June 1919. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who failed to be convinced that The Planets should be played in full?, what is it ? Answer:","completion":"The full name of the person who failed to be convinced that The Planets should be played in full is Sir Adrian Cedric Boult. He was a renowned English conductor who believed that the public could only absorb about half an hour of such radically new music at first hearing, and therefore, decided to give only five of the seven movements during the performance in February 1919."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fake bank card PIN numbers. Fictitious email accounts. Wells Fargo admitted to firing 5,300 employees for engaging in these shocking tactics. The bank earlier this month paid 185 million in penalties and has since apologized. Now CNNMoney is hearing from former Wells Fargo (WFC) workers around the country who tried to put a stop to these illegal tactics. Almost half a dozen workers who spoke with us say they paid dearly for trying to do the right thing: they were fired. \\"They ruined my life,\\" Bill Bado, a former Wells Fargo banker in Pennsylvania, told CNNMoney. Bado not only refused orders to open phony bank and credit accounts. The New Jersey man called an ethics hotline and sent an email to human resources in September 2013, flagging unethical sales activities he was being instructed to do. Eight days after that email, a copy of which CNNMoney obtained, Bado was terminated. The stated reason? Tardiness. Related: Elizabeth Warren's epic takedown of Wells Fargo CEO HR official describes 'retaliation' Retaliating against whistleblowers is a major breach of trust. Ethics hotlines are exactly the kind of safeguards put in place to prevent illegal activity from taking place and provide refuge to employees from dangerous work environments. Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf made precisely that point on Tuesday when he testified before angry Senators. \\"Each team member, no matter where you are in the organization, is encouraged to raise their hands,\\" Stumpf told lawmakers. He mentioned the anonymous ethics line, adding, \\"We want to hear from them.\\" But that's not the experience of some former Wells Fargo workers. One former Wells Fargo human resources official even said the bank had a method in place to retaliate against tipsters. He said that Wells Fargo would find ways to fire employees \\"in retaliation for shining light\\" on sales issues. It could be as simple as monitoring the employee to find a fault, like showing up a few minutes late on several occasions. \\"If this person was supposed to be at the branch at 8:30 a.m. and they showed up at 8:32 a.m, they would fire them,\\" the former human resources official told CNNMoney, on the condition he remain anonymous out of fear for his career. CNNMoney spoke to a total of four ex-Wells Fargo workers, including Bado, who believe they were fired because they tipped off the bank about unethical sales practices. Another six former Wells Fargo employees told CNNMoney they witnessed similar behavior at Wells Fargo -- even though the company has a policy in place that is supposed to prevent retaliation against whistleblowers. CNNMoney has taken steps to confirm that the workers who spoke anonymously did work at Wells Fargo and in some cases interviewed colleagues who corroborated their reports. It's possible Wells Fargo could face legal consequences for any retaliation that occurred against employees who called the ethics line. \\"It is clearly against the law for any company (or executives of such companies) to try to suppress whistleblowing,\\" Harvey Pitt, former chairman of the SEC, told CNNMoney in an email. A number of statutes -- including Sarbanes-Oxley and Dodd-Frank -- \\"make this unambiguously clear,\\" Pitt said. \\"I endured harsh bullying ... defamation of character, and eventually being pinned for something I didn't do,\\" said Heather Brock, who was fired earlier this month as a senior business banker at a Wells Fargo branch in Round Rock, Texas. Related: Workers tell Wells Fargo horror stories 'That's retaliation' One such former employee was fired after flagging issues directly to Stumpf, according to Senator Bob Menendez. At the Senate hearing, Menendez read the New Jersey woman's 2011 email to Stumpf, where she described improper sales tactics she felt were \\"wrong.\\" \\"Did you read that email?\\" Menendez asked Stumpf. \\"I don't remember that one,\\" Stumpf replied. \\"Okay, well she was fired. ... So much for the safe haven,\\" Menendez said. Several senators spoke about the plight of the mostly 5,300, low-level employees who were fired related to the scandal. The firing certainly took a huge toll on Bado's life. It put a permanent stain on his securities license, scaring off other prospective bank employers. Today, the New Jersey man's house is on the verge of being foreclosed on and he's working part-time, at Shop-Rite. \\"You wonder where the justice is,\\" Bado said. Ken Springer, a former FBI agent who runs a firm that offers a whistleblower hotline service, was alarmed by the allegations made by former Wells Fargo employees. \\"That's retaliation. It's a big problem -- and a perfect example of what shouldn't happen,\\" Springer said. \\"It looks like there's been a terrible breakdown of checks and balances at Wells Fargo.\\" In response to CNNMoney's report, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman said: \\"We do not tolerate retaliation against team members who report their concerns in good faith.\\" She emphasized that employees are encouraged to immediately report unethical behavior to their manager, HR representative or 24-hour ethics line. Related: Wells Fargo CEO denies orchestrated fraud 'Excessive tardiness' eight days after HR email Wells Fargo confirmed to CNNMoney that Bado had worked there. However, the bank declined to comment on why Bado left and and on the ethics complaint with corresponding report number he cited in emails. \\"Everything submitted to the EthicsLine is investigated,\\" a Wells Fargo spokeswoman said. While ethics complaints are supposed to be confidential, documents show that Bado did speak out before he was fired. On September 19, 2013, Bado wrote an email to a Wells Fargo HR rep and copied his regional manager, where he detailed improper sales tactics. Documents show Bado was fired -- for \\"excessive tardiness\\" -- just eight days later. \\"I have been asked on several occasions to do things that I know are not ethical and would be grounds for discharge,\\" Bado said in the email to HR. He said a branch manager on \\"many occasions\\" asked him to send out a debit card, \\"pin it,\\" and enroll customers in online banking -- \\"all without the customers (sic) request or knowledge.\\" Those are precisely the same practices that regulators fined Wells Fargo for three years later and that senators grilled the bank over this week. Lose, lose situation for Heather Brock Brock, the business banker from Texas, told CNNMoney she experienced a similar situation. The 26-year-old single parent of two young boys was fired soon after she contacted the company's ethics line about illegal sales practices she witnessed. Wells Fargo also confirmed Brock used to work at the company but declined to comment further. Brock was fired earlier this month, with Wells Fargo accusing her of falsifying documents -- a charge Brock emphatically denies. Brock said the company bullied her into admitting she did something wrong. A current Wells Fargo employee who works in Brock's branch vouched for her version of events. \\"That's really scary when you're with a big corporation like this and HR doesn't have your back,\\" said the current employee, who wished to remain anonymous so as not to get fired as well. Brock is hoping her story forces meaningful change at Wells Fargo. \\"You lose if you do complain and you lose if you don't. What does a powerless employee do?\\" Brock said. -- To reach the author of this article email Matt.Egan@cnn.com ||||| Wells Fargo’s former employees don’t agree with CEO John Stumpf’s assessment that they were the rotten apples. While still training at a California Wells Fargo in 2013, Khalid Taha, then a personal banker, was approached by a co-worker and pressed to open a second account under false pretenses. The co-worker told Taha that he couldn’t convert his existing Wells Fargo account into an employee account. She also told him he could buy credit card insurance with no fees. When Taha discovered later, during his ethics training that he had been lied to about both products, he reported the employee. It did not go as expected. “This employee was promoted after a few months,” he said during a press conference hosted by the Committee for Better Banks. See also: Goldman Sachs Bans Employees from Donating to Trump The Committee, which is an organization that says it represents the rights of workers in the financial service industry, brought together a handful of former bank employees on Monday, including two from Wells Fargo, in light of the banking giant’s recent scandal. The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau ordered Wells Fargo to pay 185 million in fines for opening 2 million phony accounts, saying the practice was a result of employees trying to hit aggressive sales targets and receive bonuses. Wells Fargo (wfc) CEO John Stumpf though, seems to have shifted blame for the scandal on to a few bad apples—the 5,300 employees fired (He clarified to CNBC that he did feel accountable, but maintained that nothing in Wells Fargo’s culture had promoted such behavior). See also: Inside Wall Street’s Greatest Feud: Icahn vs. Ackman Yet, both Taha, who left Wells Fargo in July, and former branch manger Julie Miller, who left in 2013, say management was central to allowing to scandal to proliferate. Taha and Miller recalled reporting multiple instances of reporting co-workers for illegally opening deposit and credit card accounts without consumer consent—only to see the same employees promoted or receive a raise later. Meanwhile, the bank continued to set high sales targets for its branches. “I was told by Wells Fargo district and regional management to make my personal bankers and tellers, ‘Sell, Sell, Sell,'” Miller recalled, noting that she had a 35% annual growth target despite being having a finite customer base. “Bankers became so desperate to reach their sales goals to avoid being terminated, that they would ‘churn’ accounts. This is when you close accounts and open up new ones for the same customer in order to manipulate the sales system. See also: Wells Fargo Is No Longer the Most Valuable Bank in the World Taha said that he had to meet sales goals every day, for fear of getting written up or fired. That daily quota often involved 10 to 15 personal accounts, 2 to 3 new accounts, and 2 to 3 credit card accounts. Yet, wages for the average teller was just 12.40 an hour—making the bonuses given for meeting high sales goals necessary in some cases to “make ends meet.” In July, Wells Fargo’s top consumer banking executive Carrie Tolstedt left the bank with 124.6 million in stock and options. The problem with cross-selling, says Shane Larson, the legislative director at Communications Workers of America, is far more pervasive than at just Wells Fargo. The use of aggressive sales targets is an industry can be seen in J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, SunTrust, among others. See also: Wells Fargo Exec Who Headed Phony Accounts Unit Collected 125 Million Former TD Bank employee Cassaundra Plummer noted that her supervisors had encouraged sales practices that weren’t illegal, but certainly dubious. “I was told to drive the conversation, so basically confuse the customer,” she said. She would tell the client that “we’re going to do this and we’re going to do that.” Still, before critics can turn their attention to the consumer banking industry at large, investors are still not mollified by how Wells Fargo has been punished for the scandal. Many are calling for clawbacks the pay of CEO John Stumpf and the executive formerly in charge of community banking, Carrie Tolstedt. Others are calling for resignations. On Tuesday, Stumpf is expected to appear before the Senate in relation to the account scandal. “Corporate executives designed the sales quota systems and created the culture of harassment and fear when we did not meet them,” Miller said. “When John Stumpf blamed the frontline workers for the unauthorized accounts, I was disgusted.” ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Former employees of Wells Fargo have alleged that the bank has a history of \\"retaliating against whistleblowers.\\" CNNMoney has now spoken to several former Wells Fargo staff - including human resources workers - who claim the bank has a history of firing staff who tipped off unethical or illegal sales practises.

In order to purchase the right one, you will need to measure your sofa. Using a tape measure, record the width and length of your couch, as well as the length of the arms. Additionally, you should look for any labels on your sofa. If you can determine the manufacturer and/or specific style of your sofa, you may be able to find a slipcover made especially for it. It can also be helpful to take a photo on your cell phone. You can show this image to a retail employee, and they may be able to help you select the right product. Look for your new slipcover at big box, home supply, fabric, or upholstery stores. Additionally, if you know the manufacturer of your sofa (such as Ikea), you can visit that manufacturer directly (in person or online). Search for a slipcover that fits the size and style of your sofa, as well as the look and feel of your home. If you have an oddly-shaped or vintage sofa, you may need to order a custom-made slipcover from an upholsterer or designer. Slipcovers vary widely in terms of cost. You may find them for as little as 60 (from some big box stores), or as much as 600 (from some furniture retailers). Slipcovers are extremely appealing because they are easy to use. Simply open your new slipcover, remove any pillows or loose items from your sofa, and drape your slipcover over. Often times, there will be ties, Velcro, or other fasteners that will help you to tighten and secure your slipcover. Be sure to read any instructions that come included with your new slipcover. It’s best to wash or steam the slipcover (depending on the instructions on the care tag) before putting it on your sofa to ensure it is soft and wrinkle-free. To easily revamp the look of your sofa cheaply, you can use throw pillows and/or a throw blanket to finish the look. You can find these items at big box or furniture stores, or look at thrift stores or resale shops to stick to your budget.

Title: The Great Buck Howard Movie plot: Troy Gable (Colin Hanks) defies his father (Tom Hanks) and leaves law school to pursue his dream of becoming a writer in Los Angeles. To support himself, he takes a job as a road manager for \\"The Great\\" Buck Howard (John Malkovich), a fading mentalist. Troy comes to enjoy traveling with Buck to performances in smaller venues such as Bakersfield and Akron. In particular, Troy sincerely admires Buck's signature trick: having someone in the audience hide his fee for that night's performance, which he then unfailingly discovers. (Kreskin is said to have actually performed this feat 6,000 times, only failing to find the money nine times.)[4] A reluctant publicist, Valerie Brennan (Emily Blunt), is sent to join them in Cincinnati as a replacement for a more senior colleague to promote Buck's still secret attempt to resurrect his career. Valerie is disgusted by Buck's verbal abuse towards her and Troy, with whom she becomes romantically involved. Buck reveals that his comeback will involve putting \\"hundreds\\" of people (actually only a few dozen) to sleep and then awakening them as if from the dead. The trick works, but despite a large press turnout, no one is there to record the act, since the news media is called away at the last second to cover a car accident involving Jerry Springer. Furious, Buck unfairly blames the mishap on Troy and Valerie, and then faints from exhaustion. In the hospital, Buck and Troy discover that the media absence actually worked in Buck's favor, as rumors reported by the news media exaggerate the scope of Buck's act; as a result, Buck returns to the limelight as a retro-\\"hip\\" phenomenon. He appears on television shows such as those of Jon Stewart, Regis Philbin, Conan O'Brien, and more. Buck is reunited with his estranged friend, George Takei, who sings \\"What the World Needs Now\\". Buck finally gets the call he has been waiting for: To perform once again on The Tonight Show.

Question: What is the political affiliation of the person talking ?","completion":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the speaker likely has a political affiliation that leans towards the Democratic Party or at least opposes the Republican Party. This assumption is made due to the negative tone the speaker uses while discussing Sarah Palin, a prominent Republican politician, and her career trajectory. Furthermore, the speaker criticizes the manner in which Republicans have run Washington over the past seven years, implying dissatisfaction with the Republican Party's governance. The Democratic Party, the primary opposition party to the Republican Party in the United States, generally holds contrasting policy views on various issues. Thus, it is reasonable to deduce that a person expressing discontent with Republican politicians and their approach to governance might be affiliated with or lean towards the Democratic Party. It is important to note that while this analysis is based on the information provided, one should not definitively conclude the speaker's political affiliation without further details, as political identity can be complex and nuanced. Additionally, the speaker could also be affiliated with another political party, like the Libertarian Party, Green Party, or be an independent with specific political views. To sum up, the speaker's negative tone toward Sarah Palin and Republican governance indicates a possible affiliation with the Democratic Party or at least opposition to the Republican Party.

Fascinated by its slithering movements and unique appearance, the children gathered around it in awe. They were mesmerized by the way the snake seemed to effortlessly glide through the grass, as if it was somehow gliding on an invisible wave. Its scales shimmered in the sunlight, reflecting an array of colors that changed depending on the angle from which they were observed. In contrast, the rabbit, though cute and fluffy, simply could not compete with the exotic allure of the snake. As the children slowly approached the snake, they whispered among themselves, discussing their plans for capturing it. Some suggested using sticks to prevent the snake from escaping, while others proposed creating a makeshift trap with rocks and branches. It was evident that their curiosity had transformed into a full-blown quest for this intriguing creature. Understanding the potential danger that a snake might pose, the older children took charge, instructing the younger ones to maintain a safe distance. They had heard stories about venomous snakes from their elders and did not want to expose themselves or their friends to any unnecessary risks. Despite their awareness of the potential threat, their youthful excitement and fascination with the snake still drove them forward. Working together, the kids implemented their capture plan almost like a choreographed dance. Several of them gently pinned the snake using sticks, being careful not to injure the serpent. Another group began constructing a makeshift trap with rocks, branches, and tall grass, creating an enclosure that would prevent the snake from escaping. Once the snake was sufficiently secured, they all stepped back and marveled at their accomplishment. With the snake safely contained, the children began to discuss what they would do next. Some wanted to bring the creature back to their village to show their families and friends, while others argued that it would be best to release the snake back into the wild. In the midst of their heated debate, several children couldn't help but glance over at the rabbit, which was still calmly nibbling on some grass a few feet away. Although they acknowledged the rabbit's appeal, it was evident that the snake had captured their collective imagination like nothing else could. As the sun began to dip below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the landscape, the children ultimately made the wise decision to release the snake back into its natural habitat. They carefully removed the sticks that pinned it down, and watched in amazement as the snake quickly slithered away, disappearing into the tall grass. Satisfied with their thrilling adventure, the kids headed home, their minds brimming with stories to share with their families about the snake and their incredible teamwork. As they walked away, a newfound respect for nature and its fascinating creatures settled within their hearts. While they didn't catch the rabbit that day, their experience with the snake only deepened their curiosity and desire to explore the world around them.

Summarize this article: Image copyright AFP Image caption The kidnapping of the schoolgirls from Chibok has outraged the international community Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan has called off a visit the town where more than 200 schoolgirls were abducted, officials say. Sources had told the BBC he would stop in Chibok, in the north-east, on his way to a conference in France on the threat from Boko Haram militants. But the visit was called off for security reasons, the officials said. The president - under pressure over his government's failure to rescue the girls - will fly direct to Paris. The BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse in Nigeria says the cancellation of this visit underlines just how fragile the security situation is in the north-east. On Thursday, relatives of the girls called for their unconditional release by Boko Haram. Mr Jonathan is said to have ruled out negotiations over a possible release of prisoners. Nothing was seen of the girls for almost a month after they were taken from Chibok. But on Monday the group released a video showing more than 100 of them and offering an exchange for prisoners. UK Africa Minister Mark Simmonds said Mr Jonathan had \\"made it very clear that there will be no negotiation\\" at a meeting on Wednesday.

The president will travel to Paris to take part in a summit convened by French President Francois Hollande to discuss Boko Haram. The leaders of Nigeria's neighbours - Benin, Cameroon, Niger and Chad - are scheduled to attend the summit on Saturday, which will also include representatives from the UK, US and EU. A statement said delegates at the meeting will \\"discuss fresh strategies for dealing with the security threat posed by Boko Haram and other terrorist groups in west and Central Africa\\". 'Troubling atrocities' Meanwhile, US officials on Thursday criticised the speed of Nigeria's response to the threat from Boko Haram. Alice Friend, director for African affairs at the US defence department, said its security forces had been \\"slow to adapt with new strategies and new tactics\\".

State of emergency US drones and surveillance aircraft have been deployed to assist in the search for the schoolgirls, while the UK has sent a military team to the capital, Abuja, to work alongside US, French and Israeli experts. The lower house of Nigeria's parliament, the House of Representatives, approved an extension of the state of emergency in the north-east states of Yobe, Borno and Adamawa on Thursday.

The state of emergency, which still needs to be approved by the Senate, gives the military widespread powers such as detaining suspects, imposing curfews and setting up roadblocks. On Thursday, there were reports of fresh attacks by suspected Boko Haram militants in Borno state. A witness told the BBC's Hausa Service that there had been explosions in Gamboru Ngala, were some 300 people were killed last week in a massacre blamed on Boko Haram. ||||| ABUJA Nigeria's hunt for more than 200 abducted schoolgirls is not all that it seems. In public, an international operation is gathering pace while behind the scenes, officials say it is unlikely to deliver the success that global opinion demands. The United States and Britain are helping Nigerian forces in the effort to liberate the girls taken from their school in Borno state a month ago by Boko Haram Islamist militants. The pressure for results is huge, with the likes of Michelle Obama and film star Angelina Jolie supporting a social media campaign operating under the Twitter tag #BringBackOurGirls. Washington has sent surveillance aircraft as well as assigning medical, intelligence, counter-terrorism and communications advisers to the mission. But officials have little idea where the girls are, and acknowledge that if they are found, any rescue attempt would be fraught with problems. On top of that, morale is shaky among some of the Nigerian troops involved in the hunt who already have experience of Boko Haram as a formidable foe. \\"We commend the effort by the #BringBackOurGirls protesters but it doesn't fit with the reality of the security situation we are facing,\\" said a senior Nigerian military source who spoke on condition of anonymity. Foreign experts are also pessimistic that the girls can be extricated from the rebels' clutches and returned to their homes in Nigeria's remote northeast where Boko Haram operates. \\"I think a rescue is currently unlikely and unfeasible,\\" said Jacob Zenn, a Boko Haram expert at U.S. counter-terrorism institution CTC Sentinel. Until Monday, nothing had been seen of the girls since they were snatched from the village of Chibok near Nigeria's borders with Cameroon, Chad and Niger. Then Boko Haram released a video showing more than 100 girls together in a rural location. In it, rebel leader Abubakar Shekau offered to exchange them for captured militants. The video raised hopes that their location could be found using ground forces, state-of-the-art intelligence and surveillance planes. Then an operation could be staged, perhaps with forces swooping from the sky like a British raid in Sierra Leone in 2000 to free soldiers held by militiamen, or Israeli commandoes' rescue of passengers from a jet hijacked to Entebbe, Uganda, in 1976. However, such a scenario is unlikely this time. One source with knowledge of the search said the footage was probably taken at least 10 days ago, if Boko Harma's past videos are any guide. By now, the girls could be somewhere else as a group, or dispersed to many places. VIRTUALLY UNDETECTABLE The Sambisa forest, Boko Haram's stronghold, is a first target but it is not conducive to aerial search because it covers 60,000 square km (23,000 square miles), more than twice the size of Rwanda. The rebels know this area intimately and could spread the girls among local families, making them virtually undetectable by conventional security forces. Two U.S. national security sources said initially the girls were separated into around three large groups but were subsequently scattered in smaller groups. Other experts said they could be in mountains near Gwoza on the Cameroon border. If this is the case, some girls might be found before others, posing a dilemma for would-be rescuers. \\"In the past, Boko have threatened, and maybe actually gone ahead with, killing hostages upon sensing the merest hint of possible rescue operations,\\" said a security source. Rescuing some girls could add to danger faced by others still captive. Another problem is time. Britain's minister responsible for African affairs, Mark Simmonds, said on Wednesday that it was \\"early days\\" in the rescue operation, yet the abduction happened on April 14 so rebels have had ample time to prepare for an international response. A senior U.S. Defense Department official criticized Nigeria on Thursday for being too slow to adapt to the threat of Boko Haram. TIRED OF FIGHTING An incident this week highlighted the problems of the Nigerian army, whose 1st and 7th divisions have been deployed to Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, to confront the rebels. On Tuesday, gunmen ambushed a unit returning to Maiduguri from Chibok, killing at least four soldiers. Rebels were also killed. The next day soldiers fired into the air at Maiduguri barracks to protest about what they said was poor leadership. Defense headquarters quickly stated that the situation had been resolved, but soldiers told Reuters they remained angry. \\"These Boko Haram have special forces. They know how to shoot and maintain their grounds more than us. What is making it worse is our superior officers who are insensitive to the plight of the troops,\\" said a soldier, who declined to be identified. \\"We are tired of this whole thing because we are being killed every day and we don't get the required support and care from our superiors,\\" another soldier said. President Goodluck Jonathan will visit Chibok on Friday, senior government officials said. Even coordinating an international effort faces difficulties in Nigeria, which recently overtook South Africa as the continent's biggest economy. Nigeria has close ties with Western powers but has historically resisted foreign military involvement on its soil. One possible sign of differing approaches is that Simmonds, rather than the president himself, announced that Jonathan had ruled out any prisoner exchange for the girls' release. Nigerian officials have since declined to comment. Ultimately, the girls' best hope may lie in dialogue but the road to talks remains uncertain because the rebels do not form a unified group. Boko Haram is faceless and even Shekau heads just one of several loosely coordinated groups with differing objectives, said a senior official with knowledge of the northeast. A Nigerian presidential committee set up last year for talks with the rebels dealt last year with Boko Haram proxies. But they were later denounced by other Boko Haram militants as impostors, according to Minister of Special Duties Tanimu Turaki, who leads the committee. One security source in Abuja cautioned against raising false hopes. \\"It is time we removed the thought of a very happy ending to this situation,\\" the source said.

Islamic militants again attacked... (Associated Press) It would have been the first reported visit by the president to the scene of an attack in the northeastern region that has suffered for five years the increasingly deadly assaults by Nigeria's homegrown Boko Haram terrorist network. Jonathan, a Christian from the south, has been accused of insensitivity to the plight of the mainly Muslim northerners. Thousands have been killed over the years and more than 1,500 civilians have died in the insurgency this year alone. Two officials in the presidency confirmed the cancellation saying there were apparent concerns about security after news of the planned trip was leaked to the media and published on front pages of newspapers Friday. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not supposed to give information to reporters. Jonathan had been expected to fly on one of his presidential jets from Abuja, the capital in central Nigeria, to Maiduguri, the Borno state capital in the northeast, and then be transported by military helicopter to the town of Chibok, 130 kilometers (80 miles) to the south. The road from Maiduguri to Chibok passes by the Sambisa Forest to which the girls first were taken that is a known hideout of the insurgents and has been attacked many times. Soldiers say 12 troops were killed in an ambush on that road on Monday night. The Defense Ministry said four soldiers were killed in a firefight on the outskirts of Chibok that night. Soldiers revolted and opened fire on the car of a commanding officer who came to pay respects to the bodies brought to a Maiduguri barracks on Tuesday, said the soldiers, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they want to keep their jobs. The Defense Ministry said the soldiers only fired into the air. The commander was unharmed. There have been other signs that some Nigerian troops are near mutiny, complaining that they are outnumbered and outgunned by the insurgents, are not properly paid and have to scavenge for food in the bush. The weakness of the Nigerian military was described Thursday by Alice Friend, the U.S. Department for Defense director for African affairs at a hearing about the kidnapped girls and the threat posed by Boko Haram. \\"And so we're now looking at a military force that's, quite frankly, becoming afraid to even engage\\" the enemy, she told the U.S. Senate subcommittee on African Affairs in Washington. She also said \\"much of the funding\\" for Nigeria's military is \\"skimmed off the top\\" by corrupt officers in a country where corruption is endemic. Soldiers in Nigeria have told The Associated Press that some in their ranks actually fight alongside Boko Haram, and Jonathan last year said he suspected the Boko Haram members and sympathizers had infiltrated every level of his government and military, including the Cabinet. In Chibok, community leader Pogu Bitrus had said earlier Friday that that though residents had been angry at Jonathan's slow response to the girls' plight, they did not hold it against the president and considered his visit \\"better late than never.\\" The presidency said Jonathan is traveling later Friday to Paris for a French-organized summit including leaders of Nigeria's four neighbors to discuss how to address the regional threat posed by Boko Haram. Boko Haram insurgents on April 15 abducted more than 300 students from the Chibok Government Girls Secondary School. Police say 53 managed to escape and 276 remain in captivity. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan canceled a visit to the town of Chibok, where over 200 schoolgirls were abducted, due to security reasons.

Imagine if you have -1390221 apples on one side (*y means multiplying by y) and on the other side you have -1390293 apples also multiplied by y, and you are given 1512 more apples. We need to find out how many apples one y is equal to. So, let's solve this together! First, let's move -1390293*y to the left side of the equation. To do that, we can add 1390293*y to both sides. Then our equation will look like this: -1390221*y + 1390293*y = 1512 Now, let's combine the number of apples on the left side. (-1390221 + 1390293)*y = 1512 When we add the numbers in the parentheses together, we get 72. So, now our equation is: 72*y = 1512 To find out one y, we need to divide 1512 by 72.

Review: Melvyn Douglas and Joan Blondell co-star in \\"The Amazing Mr. Williams,\\" a 1939 mystery/comedy that's quite good, although forgotten, probably due to the number of incredible films that came out in 1939. Douglas plays a talented police detective married to his job, while his girlfriend waits for a wedding that is constantly postponed. What happens in this film is no exception - he's called to a murder scene just as he's about to walk down the aisle yet again. Both stars were excellent at comedy, worked together well (and often), and help make this battle of the sexes fun. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are on hand for excellent support. As you can read in other reviews, Melvyn Douglas doesn't make much of a woman. Entertaining if a little on the long side. One of the comments here trashed Melvyn Douglas, one of our greatest actors.

Answer this question: when did sikkim became a part of north east??","completion":"Sikkim became a part of the Northeastern region of India on 16 May 1975. The history of Sikkim's integration with India is an intriguing tale of geopolitical factors, diplomatic negotiations, and historical events. Sikkim, a small Himalayan kingdom, was nestled between Nepal, Tibet (China), and Bhutan. It shared a sensitive strategic location as it bordered the critical Siliguri Corridor (also known as the 'chicken's neck'), which connected mainland India to its northeastern states. Historically, Sikkim was a protectorate under British India. Following India's independence in 1947, Sikkim maintained its protectorate status, but under the Indian government instead of British rule. In 1950, India and Sikkim signed the Treaty of Perpetual Peace and Friendship, which deepened their relationship. As per this treaty, India was responsible for Sikkim's defense, foreign affairs, and strategic communication, while the Kingdom of Sikkim maintained its autonomy and control over domestic affairs. This arrangement worked reasonably well initially. However, as uncertainties emerged in the geopolitical landscape, events would soon push Sikkim towards union with India. By the 1970s, several factors contributed to the changing situation in Sikkim. The rising influence of political parties demanding greater democracy and an end to feudal rule, regional tensions after China's annexation of Tibet in the 1950s, and India's defeat in the 1962 border conflict with China generated anxiety in the Indian government. The increasing influence of external forces, particularly from China, further fueled India's concerns. During this period, Sikkim faced political turmoil, which heightened when the ruling party, the Sikkim National Congress, was defeated in the 1974 general elections. Conflicts arose between the pro-democratic political groups and the Chogyal (King) Palden Thondup Namgyal. In response to these events, and in order to maintain stability, the government of India decided to play an active role in Sikkim's affairs. In 1974, the Indian government helped draft a new constitution for Sikkim, which led to the establishment of a more democratic political system and reduced the Chogyal's powers significantly. This progress, however, was deemed insufficient for a stable and secure relationship between the two entities. On April 9, 1975, the Sikkim Assembly passed a resolution to abolish the institution of Chogyal and seek representation in the Indian Parliament. This resolution was supported by a vast majority of the local population. Subsequently, in May 1975, a referendum was held, in which over 97% of the electorate voted in favor of Sikkim's integration with India. Following the referendum, the Indian government passed the 35th Constitutional Amendment Bill and the 36th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1975, which granted Sikkim the status of the 22nd state of India. It was formally admitted into the Indian Union on midnight of May 15, 1975, and officially became a part of the Northeastern region on May 16, 1975. In conclusion, Sikkim's journey from a protectorate to the 22nd state of India was shaped by internal political developments, regional tensions, and pragmatic diplomacy between Sikkim and India. The formal integration on May 16, 1975, brought Sikkim into the fold of the Northeastern region of India, strengthening India's strategic standing and contributing to the socio-economic development of the area."},{"prompt":"Title: POOR protection for DVDs Review: Warning, all 13 DVDs are stuffed in cheap cardboard slots.

How important is it to you to preserve the legacy of American Idol? Simon Fuller: For the last 15 seasons we've been very protective of the TV show. We've never done more than one season a year. The touring and merchandising has always been thoughtful. I think we've had great integrity [in] protecting the brand so it wasn't tarnished. So here we are facing our last season on Fox and now the legacy can be more in our focus. Now we can catch our breath. It allows me to rethink the show for the first time. When you're a No. 1 show, it's hard to be too bold and brazen about changing the format because it's working and succeeding. Also, you're always rushing to get the next season completed. Now we start with a clean sheet of paper.

Rodriguez/Getty Images) Read More: 'American Idol' Cancels Summer Tour The broadcasting landscape has changed so much since Idol debuted. How will streaming services like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu affect the next incarnation of the series? There are loads of ideas being shared and I'm deep in thought about how we can evolve Idol. We debuted at the very beginning of the digital world. So the next generation of Idol will be a lot more interactive, a lot more immersive. For me the most exciting thing is we can really now dive deep with all the new technology that's coming. My head is exploding with opportunities. The next generation of Idol -- and Idol will certainly be coming back for sure -- will have a youthful glow and it will be pioneering again, just as it was when we first began. How do you feel going into the final week of Idol on Fox? The overriding emotion is pride. It's been an amazing 15 years and it's the first time ever that I've been able to look back and think, wow, that was pretty good. We made our mark; we made history. It's exceeded all expectations. In the entertainment industry, you very rarely get to look back. For the first time, I've managed to do that in these past two or three weeks and that will carry me through the finale. Saying goodbye to a lot of people I may not work with again, that's the only sadness for me. [Along with] my partners at Fremantle, I think the group [working on the] show has been pretty much the same since day one. I'm pleased that the final show will still have the warmth and the excitement as the first show 15 seasons ago. In many ways it still feels youthful. Observing the studio audiences over the years, it's clear that Idol has appealed to all ages and that's its been one of the rare series entire families watch together. I think that's certainly one of the legacy points. It was a show that the family could watch. Music unites people. Whether you're five or you're 55 or 85, the musical tastes of the world are more aligned than they ever have been. There was a time when what a teenager liked would be polar opposite to what their parents would like. That's not the case anymore. Looking back on the 15 years, what are your personal highlights? The first season finale with Kelly [Clarkson] and Justin [Guarini], I thought that was a very special moment. Finding Carrie Underwood was significant. When you saw her, even in her innocent, raw state, you knew she had the potential to be a big star. Kelly and Carrie represent the purity of Idol...; the perfect American dream. I think Chris Daughtry's journey was a significant one. People thought he had a good chance of winning and he got knocked out early, but his talent saw him through. It allowed him in some ways to reinvent himself and create Daughtry the band, so he had this rock persona that maybe would have been a little bit harder for him to achieve if he had been a solo winner and won the whole show. And he went on to sell millions of records and so in the most unlikely way, he achieved all his dreams too. Do you have a favorite performance? I have so many. Adam Lambert doing \\"Mad World\\" was one of my favorites. It was unexpected and magnificent. Read More: 'American Idol' Farewell: Pundits and Bloggers Reflect on 15 Years of Covering the Show Have you thought about the impact that the show has had on the economy? I quite often think about that. It's something that hasn't been recognized as much as it should have been. Whether that's all the people employed, the hotels that have been booked, the hundreds of thousands of concert tickets sold, all that music that's been sold, all the merchandise, all those people that are fueling other shows, Broadway and the movies that our stars have been in. The advertisers that have bought into the show. We had that wonderful close relationship with iTunes for many years. The impact of Idol and its value is billions and billions. How did Idol's relationship with the music industry change over the years? I created Idol to find another path to break artists -- I could see them [perform] and engage with the the audience who would, in a way, tell me who they felt was interesting and who they believed could go on and be a star. It was a new paradigm -- a new way to take an artist and music to the consumer, and have them buy the songs and go and see the concerts. I didn't need the music industry. So initially, there was a little bit of resentment. Not overt, more like -- Well, hang on, this is bypassing the development process, the A&R process, the talent scout process, the producing and it can't have value because you can't do that. It's too quick, no one's paid their dues, they haven't learned their trade, it can't be good enough, it can't be appropriate. And so there was a little bit of disdain toward Idol. But the success was massive all over the world -- this was happening in England, in Germany, in Australia, in South Africa, in Sweden, in India -; everywhere young, new artists were selling millions of records and being No. 1 in every country in the world -- you could not ignore it. We worked with Sony for many years and then Universal. We embraced the industry; we didn't alienate it. And then, guess what? Everyone wanted to be on a TV show, everyone wanted to create a TV show and there were hundreds of them around the world. I like to think that Idol helped the music industry grow up a bit and understand that music can be everywhere. It was a point when the music industry was going through so much change; it was the advent of the digital age. The digital world shocked the music industry. They withdrew into their own world rather than step out and be strident and confident. And I was strident and confident. I just went for it. And I think the success I had gave everybody confidence. Do you recall where you were when the first kernel of the idea to create American Idol came into your mind? At my house in the South of France. I would spend my summers there. The first thoughts of what this could were: how do you use the internet and create an interactive experience where people can affect the outcome or choose the songs than an artist would sing, or choose the members? I have had so many great ideas there. It's the time when I can relax and I'm not doing anything and I'm the most comfortable. What else is on your plate right now? I've got a diverse company that [includes] my fashion businesses with Victoria and David Beckham and Roland Mouret. I'm active in many different sports. I just acquired the Miami soccer franchise with David Beckham. We found the land to build our stadium; last week we closed on that. I'm doing a new TV show for the BBC, which is quite different from what I've done previously, which I'll keep secret [for now], but it's a very exciting project, with a global perspective. I'm very excited about the new technologies. I'm working with a company called Pulse, creating a virtual pop star. I've spent a whole lot of time thinking about this, I've been waiting for the technology to be good enough to make it happen. We have the digital rights for Elvis Presley and we're building a virtual reality show around him. We're still launching new artists and we still have Annie Lennox and Aloe Blacc so music is still very prominent in all that I do. Where do you feel most at home these days? I love Los Angeles. I come from England and lived in London for many years. My wife is American and when we were dating she moved to live with me in London. Then we got married and when we had Grace, our first child, Natalie wanted to move to America. I said, \\"Let's go!\\" and that was six years ago and I love living here. I love American people and I feel so at home. I'm happy here. Los Angeles is an extraordinary city. It's always been an important city but now it's an essential city.

Sent 3: He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci, and from 1512 he was patronized by emperor Maximilian I. His vast body of work includes engravings, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, watercolours and books. Sent 4: The woodcuts, such as the Apocalypse series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work. Sent 5: His well-known engravings include the Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514) and Melencolia I (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. Sent 6: His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium. Sent 7: Durer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance. Sent 8: This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, perspective and ideal proportions. Question: In what town and in what year was Durer born?.

Given the question: Question: \\"Who was possibly a satrap?\\" Context: \\"The Greek kingdom of Bactria began as a breakaway satrapy of the Seleucid empire, which, because of the size of the empire, had significant freedom from central control. Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty.

Possible answers: give up and hide, make people understand, start a petition for more support A:","completion":"Kai petitioned the committee for redress when his protest fell on deaf ears because he wanted to make people understand his concerns and gather more support for his cause. By taking this course of action, Kai demonstrated his determination to resolve the issue and his unwillingness to give up on his beliefs. There are several reasons why Kai chose to petition the committee after his initial protest seemingly failed to achieve the desired outcome: 1. Persistence in the face of adversity: It is evident that Kai is passionate about the issue at hand and is willing to pursue various avenues to convey his message and achieve his objectives. Petitioning the committee is another means by which he can ensure that his voice is heard by those in power who have the ability to address his concerns. 2. Rallying support: By starting a petition, Kai can garner more attention to his cause and persuade others to join him in his efforts. In the process, he can build a stronger case and demonstrate to the committee that a significant number of people are concerned about the issue and support his call for redress. 3. Amplifying his message: A successful petition can not only help Kai garner support but also amplify his message. As more people sign the petition, others may become curious about the issue, leading to increased awareness and potentially encouraging further discussion and debate on the subject. This increased visibility and attention can exert pressure on the committee to seriously consider Kai's request and address the issue in question. 4. Demonstrating commitment: By continuing to fight for his cause even after his initial protest failed to yield the desired results, Kai is sending a powerful message to the committee and others about his unwavering commitment to the issue. This determination may make it more difficult for the committee to dismiss his concerns outright. It also establishes Kai as a dedicated advocate, making it more likely that others will take his message seriously and offer their support. In summary, Kai's decision to petition the committee for redress when his protest fell on deaf ears highlights his dedication to and perseverance in pursuing his cause. By rallying support and amplifying his message through the petition, Kai aims to make people understand the importance of the issue and encourage them to join his efforts. Moreover, his persistent actions both demonstrate his commitment to the cause and put pressure on the committee to take notice and address the concerns raised in his petition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Together with his fellow band members, Adam \\"Ad-Rock\\" Horovitz and \\"Mike D\\" Diamond, the Beastie Boys broke barriers and left a lasting impact on the hip-hop genre and music industry as a whole. Initially branded by critics as \\"beer-drinking frat boys\\" because of their debut hit, \\"(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (to Party)!\\", the Beastie Boys would eventually win over critics and fans alike with their clever wordplay, innovative use of samples, and genre-defying beats. Today, the group is remembered in the New York Times obituary for Yauch as being a \\"seminal\\" hip-hop band. Yauch's contribution to the Beastie Boys and the music scene is immeasurable. Hailing from the hard-core punk scene in New York City during the late 1970s, Yauch and his bandmates were the first white group to break barriers and find success in the predominantly black world of rap and hip-hop. With a career spanning over a quarter of a century, the Beastie Boys displayed an ability to not only adapt but also remain relevant, attesting to their immense influence on the music industry. Despite Yauch's absence due to his battle with cancer, the Beastie Boys were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in a ceremony last month. A testament to their endurance as musicians, they have left an indelible mark on the history of hip-hop and music as a whole. Sadly, Yauch's illness had forced the iconic trio to delay the release of their latest album, titled \\"Hot Sauce Committee, Pt. 2.\\" The absence of Adam \\"MCA\\" Yauch will undoubtedly be felt by fans and fellow musicians alike, as he leaves behind an incredible legacy and an unforgettable impact on the world of music. It is essential to recognize and celebrate the achievements of the Beastie Boys and Adam \\"MCA\\" Yauch's life in this time of mourning. Known for their unique sound that merged punk, rap, and hip-hop, the Beastie Boys transcended musical genres and left an indelible mark on modern music. Their approach to creating songs that connected with their fans was innovative and daring, leaving a trail for other artists to follow. In the wake of his passing, the legacy of Adam \\"MCA\\" Yauch and the Beastie Boys will continue to inspire generations of musicians, regardless of their genre or background. As a group that emerged from a predominantly punk scene and went on to dominate the hip-hop charts for decades, Yauch and his fellow Beastie Boys showed that the spirit of experimentation and pushing boundaries is at the heart of great music. In conclusion, Adam \\"MCA\\" Yauch's untimely death is a significant loss for the music industry, as the iconic group he co-founded, the Beastie Boys, defined an era and made their mark on hip-hop history. As a seminal figure in music and an influential force in the world of hip-hop, Yauch's life serves as a reminder for future generations that the power of music transcends barriers and that enduring success lies in the ability to innovate and adapt."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You’ll use the lever to maintain tension on the lock as you pick it and as a way to rotate the doorknob once you've picked the lock. Maintaining tension on the lever will rotate the barrel in the lock which will allow you to lift each individual pin. Push the lever until you feel some tension. You do not need to use a lot of force. Keep tension on the lock as you pick it. This tension is necessary or the pins will just drop back down into the barrel, keeping the knob locked. Stick the slightly bent end of the pick into the lock so that the tip is facing upwards. The pins sit on the top portion inside of the keyhole. Feel for the pins with your pick by pushing down on the handle of the pick while it’s in the hole. Press down on the handle of the pick to push the pins up. Most traditional doorknobs will have 5 or 6 pins. A key pushes the pins up in the exact position they need to line up with the barrel, thus unlocking the door. Some of the pins will slide up with ease as you push down on it with your pick, while others will have some resistance. Pins that have resistance are known as seized pins. Concentrate on the pins with a lot of resistance first. Locate a pin that’s hard to push up, and push down slowly on the handle of your pick until you hear a click. The click is the sound of the pin setting on the barrel. You need to set the seized pins first before setting the other pins in place.

But I can use this background: Air pollution is harmful to human beings and other living things. About 22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can also harm the environment. What is an answer for this question: Which city had more people with an increased chance of dying from other diseases?","completion":"Based on the given background information, the city with more people having an increased chance of dying from other diseases due to air pollution would be Prague. The reason behind this conclusion lies in the differences in air quality between Prague and Belfast, as presented in the situation. Since Prague is facing significant air pollution problems, its residents are exposed to harmful air pollutants. In consequence, these pollutants can lead to the development of lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer and increase the risk of dying from other diseases. On the contrary, Belfast is described as an eco-friendly city with healthier inhabitants. This implies that the air quality in Belfast is much better than in Prague, and the risks associated with air pollution are substantially lower. The residents of Belfast would, therefore, have a reduced chance of dying from other diseases that are linked to air pollution exposure. It is essential to note that the effects of air pollution can be particularly detrimental to vulnerable populations such as children, who are in the process of developing and growing their lungs, and consume more air relative to their size compared to adults. Consequently, they are more susceptible to the harmful impacts of poor air quality. Furthermore, the environmental consequences of air pollution also differ depending on the specific pollutants present; these pollutants can damage both the environment and the health of living organisms, aggravating the overall situation in affected areas like Prague. In conclusion, considering the air quality conditions in the two sister cities, Prague has a higher number of people at an increased chance of dying from other diseases due to air pollution when compared to Belfast, which has a more environmentally-friendly and healthier atmosphere for its inhabitants."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Ezra Weston Loomis Pound (30 October 1885 - 1 November 1972) was an expatriate American poet and critic, as well as a major figure in the early modernist movement. His contribution to poetry began with his development of Imagism, a movement derived from classical Chinese and Japanese poetry, stressing clarity, precision and economy of language. His works include Ripostes (1912), Hugh Selwyn Mauberley (1920) and the unfinished 120-section epic, The Cantos (1917-1969). Pound worked in London during the early 20th century as foreign editor of several American literary magazines, and helped discover and shape the work of contemporaries such as T. S. Eliot, James Joyce, Robert Frost and Ernest Hemingway. Pound was born in a small, two-story house in Hailey, Idaho Territory, the only child of Homer Loomis Pound (1858-1942) and Isabel Weston (1860-1948). His father had worked in Hailey since 1883 as registrar of the General Land Office. Both parents' ancestors had emigrated from England in the 17th century. On his mother's side, Pound was descended from William Wadsworth (1594-1675), a Puritan who emigrated to Boston on the Lion in 1632. The Wadsworths married into the Westons of New York. Harding Weston and Mary Parker were the parents of Isabel Weston, Ezra's mother. Harding apparently spent most of his life without work, with his brother, Ezra Weston, and his brother's wife, Frances, looking after Mary and Isabel's needs. On his father's side, the immigrant ancestor was John Pound, a Quaker, who arrived from England around 1650. Ezra's grandfather, Thaddeus Coleman Pound (1832-1914), was a Republican Congressman from northwest Wisconsin who had made and lost a fortune in the lumber business. Thaddeus's son Homer, Pound's father, worked for Thaddeus in the lumber business until Thaddeus secured him the appointment as registrar of the Hailey land office. Homer and Isabel married the following year and Homer built a house in Hailey. Isabel was unhappy in Hailey and took Ezra with her to New York in 1887, when he was 18 months old. Homer followed them, and in 1889 he found a job as an assayer at the Philadelphia Mint. The family moved to Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, and in 1893 bought a six-bedroom house in Wyncote.

A:","completion":"Title: Feature-Rich and Engaging, but with Minor Room for Improvement Overall Rating: ★★★★✰ (4 out of 5 stars) I recently had the opportunity to explore the app from com.unleashyouradventure.swaccess, and I must say it has become one of my favorite ways to escape into a world of fun-filled literary adventures. With a well-considered selection of in-app features and content, this app presents an engaging platform for those who love to read on the go. In my detailed review, I will highlight some of the features that make this app a standout, while also touching upon a few areas where I believe there is potential for improvement. 1. User Interface and Design: The app's user interface is modern, sleek, and easy on the eyes. Navigating through the interface is intuitive, allowing users to access the content they desire with minimal effort. I appreciate the incorporation of bright colors which enhance the overall user experience. However, there's space for refining the design elements to be somewhat more visually appealing, in turn boosting the app's aesthetics. 2. Content Variety and Accessibility: Com.unleashyouradventure.swaccess does a commendable job when it comes to the diversity of content available in the app. With content-ranging from novels, novellas, short stories, and even audiobooks, there's enough to keep adventure lovers satiated for hours on end. Furthermore, I was impressed to find that most stories cater to an array of interests and preferences, allowing users to fully immerse themselves in their favorite genres. The addition of offline reading mode is a great feature for those who don't always have access to Wi-Fi or mobile data. 3. Personalized Recommendations and Organization: The app's personalized recommendation engine is quite beneficial, tailoring suggestions based on user preferences. The virtual \\"bookshelf\\" allows users to easily organize their favorites and pending reads. However, this feature could be improved further, by allowing users to create custom bookshelves catering to different themes and genres. 4. Community and Social Features: The ability to connect with fellow users through this app adds a sense of community and elevates the social experience. Users, can discuss, rate, and review books as well as share recommendations with others. One area that could benefit from improvement is the integration of social media sharing options, allowing users to share their literary experiences beyond the app's ecosystem. 5. Pricing and Subscription: Although the app offers a decent selection of free content, the subscription pricing does seem to be on the higher end. A more competitive pricing model could potentially attract a broader range of users. Additionally, incentives like occasional promotions and engaging referral programs could be explored to make it more enticing. In conclusion, com.unleashyouradventure.swaccess is an excellent app for adventure enthusiasts who crave an engaging and immersive reading experience. The vast content library, personalized recommendations, and social elements make it easy to see why users are drawn to this app. While there is a bit of room for improvement in terms of design, organizational features, and pricing, its shortcomings are overshadowed by the numerous benefits offered. I confidently rate this app a solid 4 out of 5 stars and would recommend it to readers seeking stimulating and entertaining content on the go."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

And now US scientists want to grow vegetables in mini - greenhouses on the moon. Scientists say they are looking forward to a time when people on the moon or even Mars will be able to eat green and fresh vegetables. Paragon Space Development Corporation has shown people what it called the first step toward growing flowers - and finally food - on the moon. Paragon, which is a partner of NASA in experiments at the International Space Station, calls it a \\"Lunar Oasis \\" This is a closed greenhouse placed in a metal box. It is designed to safely land a laboratory plant on the moon surface, and protect it while it grows. The small greenhouse is to be sent up into space by Odyssey Moon Ltd, which takes part in the Google Lunar X Prize. This competition offers 20 million to any company which can send up, land and operate a lunar rover on the moon surface. Leaders of Paragon say future testing of the \\"Lunar Oasis\\" will be driven by Odyssey's flight schedule, which will not happen until 2012 at the earliest.

Seward was born on May 16, 1801, in the village of Florida, Orange County, New York. Seward was a key figure in American politics during the 19th century, particularly in the lead-up to and during the American Civil War. He was a member of the Whig Party and later a founding member of the Republican Party. Before serving as Secretary of State under Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson, Seward held positions as a New York State Senator, Governor of New York, and United States Senator. As Secretary of State, Seward negotiated the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867, a transaction sometimes referred to as \\"Seward's Folly\\" due to widespread skepticism about the value of the territory at the time. However, this acquisition proved to be of great strategic and economic importance for the United States in the years that followed. The town of Seward, New York, was established on February 28, 1840, and named in his honor to acknowledge his achievements and contributions to the nation. This small town, with a population of around 1,700 people, is located in Schoharie County, approximately 50 miles west of Albany, the state capital.

Both sentences discuss the same historical events: the Constitution's ratification in 1789 and the Bill of Rights' adoption in 1791. Step 3: Analyze the differences in wording and sentence structure. In Sentence 1, the phrasing is \\"the US was ratified by Bill of Rights,\\" whereas in Sentence 2, the phrasing is \\"the United States Bill of Rights was adopted.\\" Step 4: Determine whether the differences in wording and sentence structure change the meaning between the two sentences. Upon analyzing the differences in wording, it is evident that \\"the US was ratified by Bill of Rights\\" and \\"the United States Bill of Rights was adopted\\" convey different ideas. In Sentence 1, the wording implies that the US as a whole was ratified by the Bill of Rights. In contrast, Sentence 2 states that the Bill of Rights was adopted, specifying the actual event that took place. Considering the steps above, my final answer is: [a]. no; The two sentences are not paraphrases of each other due to differing wording and implications surrounding the US and the Bill of Rights."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Choices: (1). biomes. (2). spontaneous mutation. (3). food chains. (4). ecological pyramids. Q: What can demonstrate the decrease in energy, biomass or numbers within an ecosystem? A: Answer:","completion":"The concept of demonstrating the decrease in energy, biomass, or numbers within an ecosystem is best illustrated by Ecological Pyramids, which are graphical representations that show the reduction in factors such as energy, biomass, and population size from one trophic level to another within a food web or ecosystem. There are three main types of ecological pyramids: 1. Pyramid of Numbers: This pyramid shows the decreasing number of organisms at each trophic level, from producers to top predators. For an example, there could be thousands of grass plants (producers), hundreds of grasshopper (primary consumers), tens of frogs (secondary consumers) and only one bird (tertiary consumer) in a particular ecosystem. 2. Pyramid of Biomass: This pyramid depicts the corresponding decreasing biomass (total amount of living or organic matter) from the producers to the tertiary consumers. Biomass decreases at each trophic level because every organism uses substantial energy for life processes like respiration, growth, reproduction, waste elimination etc. and that energy cannot be passed to the next level. 3. Pyramid of Energy: This pyramid shows the decrease in energy from one trophic level to the next. The energy flow in the ecosystems is unidirectional and non-cyclic i.e., it flows from the sun to producers (plants), and then from producers to consumers. Each time energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next, about 90% is lost as heat and only 10% is incorporated into the biomass of the next trophic level. Thus, the energy available decreases with each successive trophic level. Ecological Pyramids are a fundamental tool in understanding the structure of an ecosystem and highlighting inefficiencies in energy transfer which can affect populations. They demonstrate the principle of energy conservation and the inefficiency of energy transfer, which is a limiting factor in the length of food chains and hence the numbers and sizes of organisms within the community. In effect, they also exhibit the concept of 'carrying capacity'- a population-level concept referring to the maximum number of organisms that an environment can support. The decrease in biomass, energy, or numbers from the base to the apex of the pyramid represents the fact that due to energy loss in successive trophic levels, the environment can support fewer organisms as we move up the pyramid. In summary, ecological pyramids visualize the decrease in energy, biomass or numbers within an ecosystem, providing a succinct way to understand and quantify the different ecological parameters as they escalate from primary producers to apex predators. They effectively demonstrate the inherent checks and balances of natural ecosystems, and the fact that every component within an ecosystem is interconnected and mutualistic."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the last name of the subject of the painting that Hans Hieronymus Imhoff gave a lukewarm description for? Answer the above question based on the context below: After the painter's death in 1528, the portraits were held by his brother, and then his brother's widow before they passed into the collection of Willibald Imhoff, a grandson of Dürer's friend Willibald Pirckheimer. Inventories from the Imhoff collection from 1573–74, 1580 and 1588 list both panels. The next surviving Imhoff inventory, of 1628, again lists the mother's portrait, but it disappears after mention in the 1633–58 account books of Hans Hieronymus Imhoff, after which its whereabouts became unknown. Dürer expert Matthias Mende described the missing portrait of Barbara Holper as \\"among the most severe losses in the Dürer oeuvre\\". In 1977, art historian Lotte Brand Philip proposed that Unknown Woman in a Coif, held by the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg, was the original portrait of Barbara Holper. The Nuremberg panel was previously thought to have originated from a member of Wolgemut's workshop, a Franconian artist in his circle, or the anonymous Mainz painter Master W. B. Brand Philip's attribution was based on striking similarities in composition and its shared tone, theme and size with the father panel at the Uffizi. In both works the sitters are holding rosary beads, and Dürer attentively describes their hands. Both portraits show the sitter in the same pose, against a similarly coloured background. Both are lit from the upper left. The boards are identically cut in width and depth, although 3 cm was removed from the left edge of Barbara's panel. Brand Philip noted the similarities between the panel and Dürer's 1514 charcoal drawing Portrait of the Artist's Mother at the Age of 63. Fedja Anzelewsky agreed with the attribution, noting that both portraits bear, on their reverse, the catalogue number recorded in the Imhoff inventories, as well as \\"precisely the same design of masses of dark clouds\\".Anzelewsky speculated that the father's portrait, which was not listed in the 1628 Imhoff inventory, had been broken off and sold to Rudolph II of Austria.

It is not at all clear how we should proceed in our dialogue with the Muslim world, but deluding ourselves with euphemisms is not the answer. It now appears to be a truism in foreign policy circles that real reform in the Muslim world cannot be imposed from the outside. But it is important to recognize why this is so--it is so because the Muslim world is utterly deranged by its religious tribalism.

Harris wrote a response to controversy over his criticism of Islam, which also aired on a debate hosted by The Huffington Post on whether critics of Islam are unfairly labeled as bigots: Is it really true that the sins for which I hold Islam accountable are \\"committed at least to an equal extent by many other groups, especially [my] own\\"? ...

In this context, the gain would refer to the profit percentage on the cost price of an article. For example, if the cost price is 100 and the profit required is 40%, then the gain = 1 + (40/100) = 1.4, which means the selling price should be 1.4 times the cost price. Part #2: Deducting a percentage from the list price. Usage: In the problem, a 5% discount is given on the list price. For example, if the list price is 100, the discount given would be 5% (5/100) * 100 = 5, making the actual selling price 100 - 5 = 95.

In mid-1943, Shoup was transferred to the staff of Major General Julian C. Smith, commander of the 2nd Marine Division, and tasked to help plan the invasion of Betio on Tarawa Atoll. Shoup's aggressive leadership style would complement the offensive strategy his superiors were seeking in taking the atoll. He was tasked with drawing up initial plans, designating the landing beaches on Betio for the 2nd Marines, and overseeing some rehearsals at Efate. However, after Colonel William W. Marshall, commander of the 2nd Marines, suffered a nervous breakdown before invasion, Smith promoted Shoup to Colonel and gave him command of the regiment, in spite of Shoup's lack of combat experience. The invasion commenced on 20 November 1943, with Shoup disembarking from Maryland, the flagship for the invasion. His force met heavy resistance on the beaches. His LVT was destroyed by shore fire, and he had to proceed without transportation. As he was wading ashore at around 11:00, he was struck by shrapnel in the legs and received a grazing wound from a bullet in the neck. In spite of these wounds, he rallied the Marines and led them ashore. He was able to coordinate the troops on the beaches and organize them as they began to push inland against an anticipated Japanese counterattack. He continuously organized aggressive attacks on the defenders, and was noted for his bravery and vigour during the conflict. On the second day of the attack, he organized an advance inland, despite heavy casualties among the American troops. By the afternoon, they were winning the battle, and reinforcements began to arrive in force. That night, Shoup was relieved by Colonel Merritt A. Edson, the division's Chief of Staff, who commanded the 2nd Marines for the remainder of the campaign. Six years later, Shoup made a cameo appearance in the movie \\"Sands of Iwo Jima\\" reprising his actions that first night on Tarawa, although he had originally been brought onto the movie as a technical advisor. For his leadership during the assault and the push inland Shoup was awarded the Medal of Honor and the British Distinguished Service Order. For his role in planning the invasion he was awarded the Legion of Merit with \\"V\\" device. He also was awarded the Purple Heart for the combat wounds he suffered during the course of the campaign. Ten years after the assault, Shoup remarked of the operation, \\"there was never a doubt in the minds of those ashore what the final outcome of the battle for Tarawa would be. There was for some seventy-six hours, however, considerable haggling with the enemy over the exact price we would have to pay.\\" In 1968, he returned to Tarawa to dedicate a memorial to the battle and to the American and Japanese troops who had died there.

I can’t think of anything “funny” I have seen at the zoo exactly although there has to be something…. we used to go to Catskill Game Farm and Bronx Zoo in NY so I am sure there has to have been something notable, if not funny…. At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see. Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you? My daughter wanted to feed who she wanted to feed but the deer and the pigs had their own ideas. The deer liked these crackers kind of like rye crisps and the baby pigs went for the bottles of milk or formula. When my daughter tried to pick and choose and just feed one suddenly she would be surrounded by many. I think my husband must have videos of what transpired. One of these days it might be entertaining to view them again. At the Bronx Zoo I remember going one or more years during the winter to see the animal light sculptures and huge block ice carving and the penguins and polar bears maybe? I can’t remember anything funny happening. When we went out to San Diego around years ago during a business trip my husband got to go on then my daughter and I went with him. I took my daughter to the Zoo and Sea World but she was so young then and it was so long ago I can’t recall much except standing on line to see the pandas and just collapsing on a open type tour after trying to carry her and a collapsible stroller and diaper bag all around. She was so young but seemed to enjoy jumping on some bouncy trampoline type thing at the Sea World. My husband might remember the funny things better than I do. After the end of the story the woman is probably: Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. not enough information B. Going to ask her husband what funny things he might remember. C. Suddenly remember a bunch of funny things. D. Go to the zoo just to look for funny things. Answer:","completion":"B.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Facebook and Twitter have become a significant threat to marriage - with social media now a factor in an increasing number of divorce cases, say lawyers. One in seven married individuals have considered divorce because of their spouse's postings of Facebook or other online sites, according to research. A similar percentage admit that they search online for evidence of their spouse's _ , while nearly one in five say they have daily quarrels because of the way their husband or wife uses social media. The research was assigned by law firm Gordon in response to an increase in the number of its clients who said that Facebook, Skype, Snapchat, Twitter or other social media sites had played a part in their divorce. Andrew Newbury, of law firm Gordon, said: 'Social media is the new marriage. Five years ago Facebook was rarely mentioned in the context of a marriage ending, but now it has become common.\\" Social media, specific pictures and posts on Facebook, are now being routinely raised in divorces.' The survey by Censuswide among 2011 husbands and wives, found the most common reasons for checking their spouse's social media accounts were to discover who they were talking to, who they were meeting and where they were going. A quarter of the married people said the resulting suspicions led to quarrels at least once a week, and 17 percent said such quarrels were daily events. Arguments were caused by contact with former partners, by the sending of secret messages, and by the posting of 'inappropriate' pictures. Some 14 percent said they looked at their spouse's social media with the specific intention of detecting evidence of adultery . Question: What can be the best title for the passage?

Process: - The flu virus has receptors, which are like viral Velcro, on the surface of the virus particle - The receptors will lock onto a target cell using these chemical receptors on the surface, which docks onto the cell surface - The receptors then go into the cell - The receptors use it like a factory - The receptors take it over and make it produce thousands or in some cases millions of copies of new viruses - The copies come streaming out of the cell - The copies infect other cells to make more viruses, or they escape from the body and infect a new victim - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less receptors enter the cell happens, how will it affect MORE cells being damaged. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"If fewer receptors enter the cell in the perturbation hypothesis, the direct effect on the process might be reduced efficiency in viral replication and infection. With less viral Velcro available to dock onto the target cell and initiate the infection process, there may be a slower rate at which the virus takes over the host cell. In this case, fewer target cells may be affected initially due to the decreased ability of the virus to latch on and enter the cells. However, it is also possible that infected cells might produce fewer copies of new viruses as a result of this perturbation, thus indirectly affecting the rate at which neighboring cells are infected. However, this could lead to a less severe overall infection in the host organism due to reduced viral proliferation, giving the immune system more time to mount a defense against the invading virus. The perturbation, in this case, could lessen the magnitude of the infection and its impact on the host. Nonetheless, even with fewer viral receptors entering cells, there is still the possibility of the virus spreading to other cells and infecting new victims. The perturbation may alter the overall rate and severity of the infection, but it does not necessarily preclude the possibility of further damage to the host or the spread of the virus to other individuals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\" is a song by the British rock band Queen, featured on their 1978 album \\"Jazz\\" that was released as a single in 1979. Written by lead singer Freddie Mercury, it was recorded in August 1978 at Super Bear Studios in Berre-les-Alpes (Alpes-Maritimes), France, and is the twelfth track on the album. - Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara; 5 September 1946 24 November 1991) was a British singer, songwriter and record producer, known as the lead vocalist and co-principal songwriter of the rock band Queen. He also became known for his flamboyant stage persona and four-octave vocal range. Mercury wrote and composed numerous hits for Queen (including \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", \\"Killer Queen\\", \\"Somebody to Love\\", \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\", \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\", and \\"We Are the Champions\\"); occasionally served as a producer and guest musician (piano or vocals) for other artists; and concurrently led a solo career while performing with Queen. - The UK Singles Chart (currently entitled Official Singles Chart) is compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC), on behalf of the British record industry, listing the top-selling singles in the United Kingdom, based upon physical sales, paid-for downloads and streaming. To be eligible for the chart, a single is currently defined by the Official Charts Company (OCC) as either a 'single bundle' having no more than four tracks and not lasting longer than 25 minutes or one digital audio track not longer than 15 minutes with a minimum sale price of 40 pence. The rules have changed many times as technology has developed, the most notable being the inclusion of digital downloads in 2005 and streaming in 2014. - The lead vocalist, lead vocals or lead singer in popular music is typically the member of a group or band whose voice is the most prominent in a performance where multiple voices may be heard. The lead singer either leads the vocal ensemble, or sets against the ensemble as the dominant sound. In vocal group performances, notably in soul and gospel music, and early rock and roll, the lead vocalist takes the main vocal part, with a chorus provided by other group members as backing vocalists. - \\"We Are the Champions\\" is a song by the British rock band Queen, first released on their 1977 album \\"News of the World\\". Written by lead singer Freddie Mercury, it is one of Queen's most popular songs, and one of rock's most recognisable anthems. - \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" is a song by the British rock band Queen. Written by guitarist Brian May, the track featured on their 1978 album \\"Jazz\\", and later on their compilation album, \\"Greatest Hits\\". When released as a single with \\"Bicycle Race\\", the song reached number 11 in the UK Singles Chart, and number 24 in the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100 in the US. - \`\` Bicycle Race '' is a single by the British rock band Queen . It was released on their 1978 album Jazz and written by Queen 's frontman Freddie Mercury . It was released as a double A-side single together with the song \`\` Fat Bottomed Girls '' . The song is notable for its video featuring a bicycle race with nude women at Wimbledon Stadium , which was edited or even banned in several countries . - Greyhound racing is an organized, competitive sport in which greyhound dogs are raced around a track. There are two forms of greyhound racing, track racing (normally around an oval track) and coursing. Track racing uses an artificial lure (now based on a windsock) that travels ahead of the dogs on a rail until the greyhounds cross the finish line. As with horse racing, greyhound races often allow the public to bet on the outcome. In coursing the dogs chase a \\"lure\\" (originally a live hare or rabbit that could be killed by the dog). - In music, an octave (: eighth) or perfect octave is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. It is defined by ANSI as the unit of frequency level when the base of the logarithm is two. The octave relationship is a natural phenomenon that has been referred to as the \\"basic miracle of music\\", the use of which is \\"common in most musical systems\\". - \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" is a song by the British rock band Queen. It was written by Freddie Mercury for the band's 1975 album \\"A Night at the Opera\\". It is a six-minute suite, consisting of several sections without a chorus: an intro, a ballad segment, an operatic passage, a hard rock part and a reflective coda. The song is a more accessible take on the 1970s progressive rock genre. It was reportedly the most expensive single ever made at the time of its release, though the exact cost of production cannot be determined. - \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" is a song by the British rock band Queen. Written by Freddie Mercury in 1979, the track is featured on their 1980 album \\"The Game\\", and also appears on the band's compilation album, \\"Greatest Hits\\" in 1981.

Question: Where does Salvatore like to spend his time? Movie title: Nuovo Cinema Paradiso Movie plot: In Rome, in the 1980s, famous Italian film director Salvatore Di Vita returns home late one evening, where his girlfriend sleepily tells him that his mother called to say someone named Alfredo has died. Salvatore obviously shies from committed relationships and has not been to his home village of Giancaldo, Sicily in 30 years. As his girlfriend asks him who Alfredo is, Salvatore flashes back to his childhood. It is a few years after World War II. Six-year-old Salvatore is the mischievous, intelligent son of a war widow. Nicknamed Toto, he discovers a love for films and spends every free moment at the movie house Cinema Paradiso. Although they initially start off on tense terms, he develops a friendship with the fatherly projectionist, Alfredo, who takes a shine to the young boy and often lets him watch movies from the projection booth. During the shows, the audience can be heard booing when there are missing sections, causing the films to suddenly jump, bypassing a critical romantic kiss or embrace. The local priest had ordered these sections censored, and the deleted scenes are piled on the projection room floor. At first, Alfredo considers Toto a bit of a pest, but eventually he teaches Salvatore to operate the film projector. The montage ends as the movie house catches fire (highly flammable nitrate film was in routine use at the time) as Alfredo was projecting The Firemen of ViggiÃ¹ after hours, on the wall of a nearby house. Salvatore saves Alfredo's life, but not before some film reels explode in Alfredo's face, leaving him permanently blind. The Cinema Paradiso is rebuilt by a town citizen, Ciccio, who invests his football lottery winnings. Salvatore, still a child, is hired as the new projectionist, as he is the only person who knows how to run the machines. About a decade later, Salvatore, now in high school, is still operating the projector at the Cinema Paradiso.

Along with need-it-now services like virtual check-in and grab-and-go meals, hotels are offering 12-minute exfoliation treatments and 10-minute massages for travelers who want their spa treatments in the time it takes to microwave garlic potatoes. No longer the purview of airports, lickety-split beauty and wellness treatments are augmenting the traditional spa menus at hotels and resorts. In the wake of the 2008 recession, many spas began offering shorter treatments for consumers who could no longer afford to indulge: Some 75 percent of spas added abbreviated treatments to their menus, according to the International Spa Association. The trend stuck, and appears to be taking on renewed significance at a time when beauty and wellness-on-demand apps like Glamsquad and Zeel allow people to book and receive massages, manicures, makeup applications and blowouts wherever they are — an Airbnb rental, an office building — with a few taps on a smartphone. Among the nascent players is JW Marriott Hotels and Resorts. The upscale chain is rolling out its Spa by JW concept with treatments that last 12 to 25 minutes and can be booked without an appointment. Treatments include scalp massages, shoulder massages and hand exfoliation and moisturizing, and are offered in chairs tricked out with scent infusers, noise canceling technology and smartphone charging stations. “It gives our travelers who honestly don’t have the time to do the full spa treatment the ability to refresh or calm down after a flight,” said Mitzi Gaskins, Marriott International’s vice president of luxury brand management. So far, Spa by JW is in a couple of hotels, including the new JW Marriott Houston Downtown and the JW Marriott Mumbai Sahar in India; some 25 spas are in the pipeline. Ms. Gaskins said the concept grew out of Marriott’s research, which included talking to avid spagoers around the world as well as guests who don’t usually frequent hotel spas. Some felt intimidated by the typical spa setup, which often includes a secluded location within a hotel, a seemingly aloof reception desk staff and undressing and putting on a robe. Spa by JW is designed to be in a busy area of a hotel; a kind of additional lounge for guests that also offers quick pick-me-up treatments that can be booked on a whim rather than reserved a week before. The 12-minute tension-release massage at the JW Marriott Houston Downtown, for example, is 25; the 90-minute deep-tissue intensive muscle release massage is 200. In December, Viceroy Snowmass in Colorado began offering its “ski-in/ski-out spa treatments” for skiers and snowboarders who want to spend a full day on the slopes but don’t mind pausing for a bit of pampering. Guests can ski right up to the spa, hand their skis and poles to a “ski valet,” and then take an elevator down to the spa for treatments that last 30 minutes. A Mediterranean lunch with healthful bites including hummus, olives and roasted vegetables is part of the package and may be eaten during the treatment — to save time, of course. The most popular treatment, according to Debbie Alcorta, the spa operations manager for Viceroy Snowmass, is “Kick Off Your Boots” (30 minutes; 95 for the treatment, lunch and gratuity), which includes a foot bath in warm water, a lemongrass mimosa scrub, cuticle grooming and a hot stone massage. And good news for those who want to rush back out to the slopes: You don’t even have to don a robe. “We can just roll up your ski pants and your little second-skins, do the treatment and get you on your way,” said Ms. Alcorta. Another treatment, “Warm Up Your Hands and Toes” (30 minutes; 95 for the treatment, lunch and gratuity) is a hydrating hand and foot therapy to combat dry winter skin that, like “Kick Off Your Boots,” is performed in a communal spa suite. Skiers can walk-in, ahem, ski-in, for appointments between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., or make a reservation for a specific time, Ms. Alcorta said. When they’re done they can use the rest of the spa facilities, including a relaxation lounge. “And then they can get back on the slopes,” she said. While not every hotel spa is quite so convenient, a number have “express” menus, like the 21c Museum Hotel in Cincinnati, which offers 30-minute Swedish massages (75), pedicures (45) and facials (85). There’s also a 10-minute massage called the “See You in Ten” (25). At the same time, on-demand beauty and wellness services that send stylists and therapists to people’s homes or vacation rentals are becoming more popular. Zeel offers appointments every day of the year (holidays, too) in more than a dozen cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago and Washington. A recent search showed that a therapist who could come to Midtown Manhattan to give an hourlong Swedish massage, for example, would cost 130 before 18 percent gratuity (automatically added to the bill) and tax, for a total of 159.25. The company recently introduced Zeel Concierge, a service that allows hotels and spas to book appointments that they normally couldn’t because of, say, a guest’s last-minute request or a lack of staffing. Now hotel concierges and spa staff can book appointments using Zeel massage therapists (who the company says are licensed and undergo background checks), according to Spafinder Wellness, an industry marketing and media group. It’s little wonder Zeel and similar services with apps such as Soothe, StyleBee and Glamsquad are finding success in the age of Uber, when immediacy and personalization are prized. “Sometimes a busy schedule only leaves an hour between work and a night on the town to get rested and beautiful,” says a new report by Spafinder Wellness 365. “Customers are increasingly willing to forgo the experience of a spa — or at least periodically complement it — in exchange for the convenience and flexibility of wellness on-demand.” Is the 90-minute massage doomed? Hardly. Luxury hotels and resorts continue to introduce hour-plus treatments for those who want to spend the afternoon slathered in olive oil body butter, or have a deep-pore cleansing. But it’s now easier than ever to get a quick fix, whether you just stepped off a plane or a ski slope.

He found that the Siberian tiger is an apex predator. It had a pretty stable population during the sixteenth century. He noted that information as case A. Then with the introduction of guns the number of Siberian tigers decreased in the seventeenth century. He noted that information as case B. and a hint : Apex predators can have profound effects on ecosystems, as the consequences of both controlling prey density and restricting smaller predators, and may be capable of self-regulation. They are central to the functioning of ecosystems, the regulation of disease, and the maintenance of biodiversity. When introduced to subarctic islands, for example, Arctic foxes' predation of seabirds has been shown to turn grassland into tundra. Such wide-ranging effects on lower levels of an ecosystem are termed trophic cascades. The removal of top-level predators, often through human agency, can cause or disrupt trophic cascades. For example, reduction in the population of sperm whales, apex predators with a fractional trophic level of 4.7, by hunting has caused an increase in the population of large squid, trophic level over 4 (carnivores that eat other carnivores). This effect, called mesopredator release, occurs in terrestrial and marine ecosystems; for instance, in North America, the ranges of all apex carnivores have contracted whereas those of 60% of mesopredators have grown in the past two centuries. Please answer this question : In case B, would the number of mesopredators be less or more than in case A? A:","completion":"In case B, the number of mesopredators would likely be more than in case A. This is because case B represents a decrease in Siberian tiger population due to the introduction of guns in the seventeenth century. The Siberian tigers are apex predators, and their population decrease would lead to a release of mesopredators (carnivores that eat other carnivores) in the ecosystem due to the removal of the top-level predator. This phenomenon is known as mesopredator release and can be observed in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. With fewer apex predators to control them, mesopredators can often increase in number and expand their range."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It's a quest that may not require you to speak aloud until a recruiter reaches out — if they ever do. That solitary, slow experience is one reason why ZipRecruiter, an online job site, has created an app for Amazon Echo that encourages users to say: \\"Alexa, find me a job.\\" Launched Thursday, ZipRecruiter's app allows job seekers to ask Amazon's voice assistant Alexa what jobs are available, gather more information about the positions, and apply to them (if they have a resume on file). The app is the first for job applications on Echo, a system that already allows users to pay bills and book flights via a black cylinder with voice recognition. \\"Conversational [design] is not perfect for a number of industries, but there's something that makes it extra magical for us,\\" Jen Ringel, ZipRecruiter's director of product, told Mashable. \\"Voice in a way is humanizing the job search.\\" To search for jobs, Echo owners do not need to create an account or log-in on ZipRecruiter. They can simply download the app and start talking to Alexa. The app knows a handful of commands, including, \\"Alexa, tell ZipRecruiter, I hate my boss,\\" which will then prompt a response about a job search. The Echo integration is the latest project Ringel and Sara Siegal, a software engineer at ZipRecruiter, have been working on to make the job search more conversational. Even though it’s not a real human, it still becomes more of a human experience \\"Part of the reason why job search is so stressful cause you’re really putting yourself out there. You go for a job you hope you’re qualified for, you think you’re qualified for and then you send it off and guess what: silence,\\" Ringel said. The team recently released a chatbot for Facebook Messenger and have seen job seekers apply to twice as many jobs through the system compared to other methods. With Amazon's Alexa, Ringel and Siegal said they hope people will feel even more comfortable finding and applying to jobs. \\"Even though it’s not a real human, it still becomes more of a human experience,\\" Siegal said. Ringel and Siegal both own Echo devices and casually converse with them, including testing jeopardy skills and learning cat facts. For now, Echo owners can only hear about and apply to jobs with the ZipRecruiter app, but they plan to build more features in the coming months.

It is one of the most recognisable and popular of all instruments, and yet its design has remained almost unchanged for 100 years. But now Hungarian musician Gergely Boganyi claims to have reinvented the grand piano after spending 8,000 hours and almost £1million building his own in a workshop in Budapest. With its edgy design, finished entirely in glossy black paint, music fans have dubbed the creation the Batpiano - for its resemblance to the Batmobile. Scroll down for video. Gergely Boganyi, 41, has spent ten years, 8,000 hours and almost £1million redesigning the grand piano in a workshop above a disused communist-era factory in Hungary. Bogyani has replaced most of the traditional wood with carbon fibre, designed two legs which act as sound deflectors to project music, and redesigned the key mechanism. Viewers of the new creation at a premiere event in Budapest earlier this month described the instrument as a Batpiano - because its angular body and black pain resemble the Batmobile. It is certainly futuristic, doing away with most of the wood traditionally used in grand pianos such as the Steinway, and replacing it with cutting-edge carbon fibre. Almost every single one of the instrument's 18,000 components has been redesigned. Rather than the traditional three legs, the Boganyi has only two, and both of them have been carefully shaped to help project the sound into the auditorium. He had also reinvented the key mechanism, meaning it applies only the slightest pressure to the soundboard - the anchor of the piano to which everything else is fixed. The board itself, instead of being made from the traditional wood, is made from more than 20 carbon composite layers woven one on top of the other. Boganyi, 41, a feted concert pianist who has spent more than a decade building the instrument in a workshop above a disused communist-era factory, is optimistic about the results. He said: 'What we created will enrich piano history. It is said that old pianos sound friendly, velvety, while new ones are stronger and more powerful. I was hoping for both.' The piano traces its history back to the dulcimer, an instrument made of strings stretched across a board played with hand-held hammers, which was invented in Iran shortly after the birth of Christ. However, the first modern piano was created by Bartolomeo di Francesco Cristofori in Florence, Italy, in 1709 and was called gravicembalo col piano e forte - which roughly translates as 'harpsichord with soft and loud'. Boganyi won his first music prize at the age of six, and has gone on to play as a soloist in some of the most critically acclaimed orchestras in the world, including the London Philharmonic in 2004. Boganyi says that, unlike other modern redesigns such as though sponsored by Peugeot and Audi, his was focused entirely on the sound, rather than the appearance. Following a premiere concert in Budapest on Wednesday this week, the piano will go on sale later this year. Boganyi does not know how much it will cost yet, but says 'it will be expensive' It was designed to improve upon the harpsichord, the favoured instrument of Bach and Handel, which produced notes by plucking at strings, rather than striking them. The plucking action meant that the harpsichord was only capable of producing one flat tone, while the piano's hammer action meant the tone varied depending on how hard the key was struck. During the late 18th century, around the time Beethoven was playing, craftsmen added more keys to the instrument, as well as the first pedals to dampen or sustain notes. The suit the new styles of playing, the hammers were made heavier, and the strings stronger, producing a powerful new sound. Makers also experimented with upright versions, with the strings stretched vertically in front of the player, and square grand pianos. The last great period of invention came in the mid to late 1800s, when Steinway & Sons developed their grand piano, and added a third pedal underneath. But now Boganyi, who won his first music prize aged six and performs as a soloist in acclaimed orchestras such as the London Philharmonic, is hoping to add to that history with his latest version. He says the new instrument is based on innovations dreamed up, but not widely used, by 19th-century Hungarian piano makers. The instrument's soundboard, the central fitting to which all other parts are fixed, has been refashioned out of 20 layers of carbon composite woven together giving the piano a lighter, airier sound. Jazz pianist Gerald Clayton described playing the new piano as like being 'in a spaceship, like you are hovering above gravity (pictured, Boganyi plays the piano in his workshop) Boganyi and his design team are pictured with the new piano in their workshop in Szigethalom. And it seems that it could have been worth the wait as expert piano players agreed that the sound it produces is entirely new. Karoly Reisinger, CEO of New York piano repair shop Klavierhaus, was 'mesmerized at the sound he said brought lyrical qualities back to the piano after a century of power-focused development. He said: 'In this design you will be able to hear the 1850-1860 era qualities, lyrical, bell-like, precise – and also the modern instrument that our time is used to, which is clarity.' Four-time Grammy-nominated jazz pianist Gerald Clayton said he felt he had played a slick new type of instrument. He added: 'The sound almost feels as if you're in a bubble, it's so clear. It feels like you are in a spaceship, like you are hovering above gravity. 'When you play a lot of notes, or you play a chord, the sensation is different. It's super-clear.' Following a premiere in the Grand Concert Hall in Budapest earlier this month, the piano will go on sale later this year. Boganyi does not know how much each one will cost yet, but he says 'with these materials it will not be cheap.' What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the person that wrote the Recondita armonia in a high B flat? is inside the article: The opera begins without any prelude; the opening chords of the Scarpia motif lead immediately to the agitated appearance of Angelotti and the enunciation of the \\"fugitive\\" motif. The sacristan's entry, accompanied by his sprightly buffo theme, lifts the mood, as does the generally light-hearted colloquy with Cavaradossi which follows after the latter's entrance. This leads to the first of the \\"Grand Tunes\\", Cavaradossi's \\"Recondita armonia\\" with its sustained high B flat, accompanied by the sacristan's grumbling counter-melody. The domination, in that aria, of themes which will be repeated in the love duet make it clear that though the painting may incorporate the Marchesa's features, Tosca is the ultimate inspiration of his work. Cavaradossi's dialogue with Angelotti is interrupted by Tosca's arrival, signalled by her motif which incorporates, in Newman's words, \\"the feline, caressing cadence so characteristic of her.\\" Though Tosca enters violently and suspiciously, the music paints her devotion and serenity. According to Budden, there is no contradiction: Tosca's jealousy is largely a matter of habit, which her lover does not take too seriously.After Tosca's \\"Non la sospiri\\" and the subsequent argument inspired by her jealousy, the sensuous character of the love duet \\"Qual'occhio\\" provides what opera writer Burton Fisher describes as \\"an almost erotic lyricism that has been called pornophony\\". The brief scene in which the sacristan returns with the choristers to celebrate Napoleon's supposed defeat provides almost the last carefree moments in the opera; after the entrance of Scarpia to his menacing theme, the mood becomes sombre, then steadily darker. As the police chief interrogates the sacristan, the \\"fugitive\\" motif recurs three more times, each time more emphatically, signalling Scarpia's success in his investigation.

Given the below context: On the night of 6 November 1995, a fire broke out in the Rova compound, destroying or severely damaging all of its buildings. Once the flames had been extinguished, all that remained of the original structures were the stone shells of the royal chapel and Manjakamiadana. Fire-fighters arrived late at the scene. Their capacity to douse the fire was hampered by the discovery that their fire hoses did not properly fit onto the nearby hydrants. In addition, the water pressure at the hydrants was significantly reduced due to Analamanga hilltop's high elevation. As the fire-fighters battled the flames, numerous bystanders ran into Rova compound buildings to retrieve artefacts of historic and cultural significance. Approximately 1,675 objects were saved out of an estimated total of 6,700. Some pillaging is believed to have occurred. On the night of the fire, the body of one of the queens was found in the public square in the centre of the city. A funeral vigil was held the following day for these royal remains. The remains were later identified as belonging to Ranavalona III, and have since been re-interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga.The destruction of the Rova of Antananarivo occurred at a time when the complex was in the final stages of the process to become classified as Madagascar's first cultural UNESCO World Heritage Site. Six people were initially charged in connection with the Rova's destruction in an Antananarivo court of law, but the official investigation concluded that the fire was an accident. Public accusations of a cover-up placed the blame for the fire on government officials, various ethnic groups, foreign powers and other parties. Widespread belief persists within and outside Madagascar that a deliberate arson was the cause. Rumoured motivations for arson at the Rova were numerous and remain unproven.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Meet the aspiring writers behind your fortune cookie messages Have ever wondered how companies produce the seemingly endless fortunes found in the free cookies you get at Chinese restaurants? The answer is high school students and struggling writers. There are around 40,000 Chinese restaurants in the US, and every year a mind-boggling 3bn fortune cookies are manufactured and consumed. Each cookie needs a fortune line buried in its shell. Kay Marshall Strom, 65, was a high school senior when she saw a little blurb in the local San Francisco newspaper asking for a fortune writer. Intrigued, she sent an inquiry – she had been contemplating becoming a writer when she grew up and figured, why not start small? She got the job. Inspiration for the fortunes was everywhere – movies, walks outside, time spent with friends – and Strom would jot down ideas as they occurred to her throughout the day. The job lasted an entire year, and every few weeks, she would send batches of new fortunes to the company for approval. The company skewed conservative, and some of her more creative and offbeat ideas got shot down. One idea that did make it through though became infamous: “You will be hungry again in an hour.” Despite the years that have passed since Strom spent her after-school hours playing fortune teller, many of her compositions remain in print, and she still finds her own witticisms from time to time in cookies. Others don’t have such fond memories of their fortune-writing experiences. Russell Rowland, who was a struggling writer when he got his freelance fortune gig, is one of them. “One of the funniest things about this whole thing is … I can’t stand fortune cookies. I think they are horrible,” he said with a laugh. But the cookies gave him a sort of start in publishing. Since sitting down to compose fortunes at 75 cents each back in 2000, he has published four books. When he took his turn as the sage of Chinese food fans, Rowland was given no guidelines, just a firm number: 700 fortunes. So he turned to literature – specifically, a book of famous quotations called Great Thoughts. Other times, he would come up with a good phrase, like “Love is the secret to happiness”, and then plug in other words to get extra mileage out of a single idea. While it may seem easy to write one-line predictions, there is a lot more art to fortune-writing than meets the eye. They have to be general enough to make sense for any kind of customer, but at the same time, they can’t offend anyone – which means a lot of the more fun fortunes have to fall by the wayside in favor of the bland. The fortunes that survive must make sense for the grandmother who goes to church seven times a week, for her six-year-old grandson, and for his wild-at-heart teenage babysitter all at the same time. So forget telling people they will meet a tall, dark and handsome stranger. The sheer number of fortunes needed is another obstacle. Companies keep databases of thousands of fortunes accumulated over years that they rotate on a regular basis to keep people from getting the same ones over and over. Coming up with original ideas when there are already 10,000 in the database – as there are, for example, at cookie manufacturer Wonton Foods – is a real challenge. The job also has more responsibility than just providing a few chuckles or a smile after dinner. Some people take fortune cookies very seriously. Forums exist to discuss how to make the fortune inside come true. People collect the fortunes, tape them to their work desks and home fridges, and tuck them into their wallets as a reminder to have hope. A childhood friend used to always eat the little slip of paper, assuring me that if she literally internalized it, her fortune would come to fruition. That level of wishful thinking isn’t limited to weird kids with a taste for paper. In 2005, there were 110 second-prize winners in the Powerball lottery, prompting an investigation which uncovered that all 110 people had played the “lucky” numbers on the back of their fortune (it is worth noting that unlike the fortunes, those numbers are computer-generated). Erin Jump Fry, CEO of Fancy Fortune Cookies, said the incredible lasting power of the fortune cookie boils down to its ability to surprise us when so few things can any more. She would know: in addition to printing messages in her cookies for birth announcements, wedding favors and teens asking each other to prom, she once had a client ask her to slip an actual engagement ring into a fortune cookie. No word on if the bride tried to eat it, tape it to her fridge or put it in her wallet, as tradition dictates. Summary:","completion":"High school students and struggling writers are often behind the creation of fortunes found in fortune cookies distributed in Chinese restaurants across the US. Approximately three billion fortune cookies are manufactured and consumed every year, each requiring a fortune statement. These creators often find inspiration from a variety of sources, ranging from popular movies to famous quotations. The fortunes must be generalized to suit all types of customers and avoid offensive content. As a result, more creative ideas are usually rejected in favor of safer alternatives. Companies maintain databases of thousands of fortunes to prevent repetition, providing a challenge for writers to come up with original ideas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sherman Joseph Alexie, Jr. (born October 7, 1966) is a Spokane-Coeur d'Alene-American novelist, short story writer, poet, and filmmaker. His writings draw on his experiences as an Indigenous American with ancestry from several tribes. He grew up on the Spokane Indian Reservation and now lives in Seattle, Washington. His best-known book is The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven (1993), a collection of short stories. Alexie was born on October 7, 1966, at Sacred Heart Hospital in Spokane, Washington. As a little child he lived on the Spokane Indian Reservation, located west of Spokane. His father, Sherman Joseph Alexie, was a member of the Coeur d'Alene tribe, and his mother, Lillian Agnes Cox, was of Colville, Choctaw, Spokane and European American ancestry. One of his paternal great-grandfathers was of Russian descent. Alexie was born with hydrocephalus, a condition that occurs when there is an abnormally large amount of cerebral fluid in the cranial cavity. He had to have brain surgery when he was six months old, and was at high risk of death or mental disabilities if he survived. Alexie's surgery was successful; he suffered no mental damage but had other side effects. His parents were alcoholics though his mother was a sober alcoholic. His father often left the house on drinking binges for days at a time. To support her six children, Alexie's mother, Lillian, sewed quilts, worked as a clerk at the Wellpinit Trading Post and had some other jobs. Alexie has described his life at the reservation school as challenging because he was constantly teased by other kids as well as endured abuse he described as \\"torture\\" from teachers who were white nuns. They called him \\"The Globe\\" because his head was larger than usual, due to the hydrocephalus as an infant. Until the age of seven, Alexie suffered from seizures and bedwetting; he had to take strong drugs to control them. Because of his health problems, he was excluded from many of the activities that are rites of passage for young Indian males. Alexie excelled academically, reading everything available, including auto repair manuals.

She was the eldest of a family of orphaned children who had once lived a happy and contented life. However, their lives had taken a turn when their parents tragically passed away in a terrible accident that left them under the care of their uncle and his wife. Polly was a responsible and caring sister to her younger siblings, always trying her best to ensure their safety and well-being in the absence of their parents. Sadly, their new guardians did not treat them with the love and kindness they needed. In particular, the uncle's wife displayed incredibly cruel and abusive behavior towards the children. She would regularly punish them for the smallest mistakes and even took pleasure in their pain and suffering. Polly endured this cruelty in silence, in the hope that she could shield her younger siblings from her step-aunt's wicked actions. In the midst of this dire situation, a mayoral election was taking place in Oxmore. There was fierce competition, as the two main candidates had completely different visions for the town. The current mayor, George Stockton, was a kind-hearted man who believed in unity and compassion. His opponent, Roger Truman, was a power-hungry businessman known for his ruthless attitude and cunning strategies. As the election campaign gained momentum, Polly learned of a young man supporting Roger Truman's campaign. His name was Edward, and he was the son of Roger Truman, the opposing mayoral candidate. Edward was well-aware of the miseries of the orphaned children, as well as the cruelty shown by the uncle's wife towards them. He felt inclined to help them in any way possible, as he believed that his father surely would once he assumed office. He approached Polly to speak privately about their situation. Polly, who had reached her breaking point due to their mistreatment, saw an opportunity to take revenge on the cruel relatives who had made her family's life a living hell. She confided in Edward about their suffering, and he vowed to help her on the condition that Polly would support his father's candidacy for mayor. Reluctantly and without much choice, Polly agreed, envisaging this partnership as a chance to secure freedom and a better future for her family. Their involvement led to a dramatic political showdown in Oxmore. Polly, the young and morally upright eldest sister, challenging her morally corrupt relations, captivated local media and public opinion. With the support of Edward, she revealed her relatives' true nature to the town's residents and gained popular sympathy. The resulting political confrontation resulted in the defeat of both her cruel uncle and Roger Truman, as Oxmore citizens demanded justice for the orphaned children. Consequently, George Stockton, the incumbent mayor, won the election. After the mayoral elections, Mayor Stockton, recognizing Polly's courage and the difficulties her family had endured, granted her permission to keep the children with her, while providing them with a safe and comfortable home to recover and flourish. Thus, Polly's younger siblings finally began to lead a happier, more stable life, where they could begin to heal from their painful experiences. Additionally, Edward and Polly began to grow closer as a result of their partnership, finding solace in each other, and forging a strong bond. In the end, Polly's heroic actions brought her family a renewed sense of hope, empowerment, and unity. Her bravery, combined with the support of a loyal friend and a just leader, served as an inspiration to the entire town of Oxmore. It showcased the inherent strength of human determination in the face of adversity, validating the old adage that good will always triumph over evil."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Anyway, I'm not too thrilled. Speedy delivery though! Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the review, I would say that the customer is dissatisfied with the product. There are several key points mentioned in the review that indicate the customer's dissatisfaction. Firstly, the title of the review itself states, \\"I don't think I like it.\\" This is a clear indication that the customer is not pleased with the product. In the body of the review, the customer also mentions that the product is \\"hot to the touch,\\" which may be considered as a negative feature or a safety concern for some users. Furthermore, the main purpose of the product, which is to help the customer's cat with her tension, has not been fulfilled as per the customer's expectations. The customer states that the product \\"hasn't really seemed to help\\" their cat with the issue. This is a significant point of dissatisfaction, as the product has failed to deliver the intended results. While the customer acknowledges that it might be possible the cat doesn't have a problem that Feliway can help, this still implies dissatisfaction with the product, as it has not met the needs or expectations of the user. Lastly, though the customer does mention that the delivery was speedy, this is not related to the performance or quality of the product itself. The positive aspect of speedy delivery is not enough to overcome the negative aspects of the product mentioned by the customer. Taking all of these points into consideration, it is evident that the customer who left this review is dissatisfied with the product."},{"prompt":"Question: \\"Mami Horikoshi\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

In the study, which will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology's annual meeting in March, men on beta-blockers were less likely to have brain changes suggestive of dementia. Experts say it is too early to recommend beta-blockers for dementia. The findings are preliminary and larger studies in men and women from different ethnicities are needed to see what benefit beta-blockers might offer. People with high blood pressure are advised to see their doctor and get their condition under control to prevent associated complications like heart disease, stroke and vascular dementia. Having high blood pressure may damage the small vessels that supply the brain with blood. Blood carries essential oxygen and nourishment to the brain and without it, brain cells can die. Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease and can occur if blood flow to the brain is reduced. Other research in a much larger sample of men - 800,000 in all - suggests another type of blood pressure drug known as an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) may cut dementia risk, including Alzheimer's disease, by as much as 50%. The latest work in 774 Japanese-American men found that all types of blood pressure medication were better than no treatment in terms of signs of dementia in the brain - brain shrinkage and tiny areas of brain tissue damage caused by poor blood supply - noted at autopsy after death. However, men who had received beta-blockers as their only blood pressure medication had fewer abnormalities in their brains than those who had not been treated for their hypertension, or who had received other blood pressure medications, the University of Hawaii team found. Men on beta-blockers and other medications also had fewer brain abnormalities, but not as big a reduction as that seen in the men on beta-blockers alone. In the study, 610 of the men had high blood pressure or were being treated for high blood pressure. Study author Dr Lon White said: \\"With the number of people with Alzheimer's disease expected to grow significantly as our population ages, it is increasingly important to identify factors that could delay or prevent the disease. \\"These results are exciting, especially since beta-blockers are a common treatment for high blood pressure.\\" Dr Simon Ridley, head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \\"Hypertension is a known risk factor for Alzheimer's and other causes of dementia, and keeping high blood pressure in check could be important for preventing these diseases. \\"This study suggests a link between the use of beta-blockers and fewer signs of dementia, but as the results of this study have yet to be published in full, it's not clear what caused this link. It's important to note that this study only looked at Japanese-American men, and these results may not be applicable to the wider population. He said a better understanding of the links between high blood pressure and dementia could be crucial for developing new treatments or approaches to prevention. \\"With 820,000 people affected by dementia in the UK, and that number increasing, we urgently need to find ways to prevent the diseases that cause it - that requires a massive investment in research,\\" Dr Ridley added.","completion":"This article talks about a study on some medicine called beta-blockers, which are used to treat high blood pressure. High blood pressure is not good because it can lead to memory problems, called dementia. In the study, the brains of men who took beta-blockers looked healthier compared to those who didn't. But, the experts say we need to do more research to understand if beta-blockers can actually help prevent dementia.

Part of a massive ancient mountain range, it was found buried under several km of ice using specially developed penetrating radars. The massive subglacial valley is up to 3 kilometres deep, more than 300 kilometres long and up to 25 kilometres across, and in places, the valley floor is more than 2000 metres below sea level. All calm - the area above the giant mountain range, which is covered in upto 7km of ice. The massive subglacial valley is up to 3 kilometres deep, more than 300 kilometres long and up to 25 kilometres across, and in places, the valley floor is more than 2000 metres below sea level. The mountain range and deep valley were carved millions of years ago by a small icefield similar to those of the present-day Antarctic Peninsula, or those of Arctic Canada and Alaska. Researcher were able to chart it for the first time by combining data from satellites and ice-penetrating radars towed behind skidoos and on-board small aircraft. In fact, it is so large researchers say it can be seen from space - despite being several kilometres underground. The research involved scientists from Newcastle University, the University of Bristol’s Glaciology Centre, the British Antarctic Survey and the universities of Edinburgh, Exeter, and York. They charted the Ellsworth Subglacial Highlands – an ancient mountain range buried beneath several kilometres of Antarctic ice - by combining data from satellites and ice-penetrating radars towed behind skidoos and on-board small aircraft. The researchers spent three seasons investigating and mapping the region in West Antarctica. The mountain range and deep valley were carved millions of years ago by a small icefield similar to those of the present-day Antarctic Peninsula, or those of Arctic Canada and Alaska. Professor Martin Siegert, Professor of Geosciences at the University of Bristol, said: 'While the idea of West Antarctic Ice Sheet growth and decay over the past few million years has been discussed for decades, the precise location where the ice sheet may originate from in growth phases, and decay back to in periods of decay, has not been known. Of of the sub-ice radar images which helped researchers pinpoint the vast valley, showing the giant mountains ans passes between them. 'By looking at the topography beneath the ice sheet using a combination of ice-penetrating radio-echo sounding and satellite imagery, we have revealed a region which possesses classic glacial geomorphic landforms, such as u-shaped valleys and cirques, that could only have been formed by a small ice cap, similar to those seen at present in the Canadian and Russian High Arctic. 'The region uncovered is, therefore, the site of ice sheet genesis in West Antarctica.' The team’s analysis has provided an unprecedented insight into the extent, thickness and behaviour of this ancient icefield, and the configuration and behaviour of the early West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The subglacial landscape shows where and how the West Antarctic Ice Sheet originated and grew. It also provides important clues about the size and shape of the ice sheet in West Antarctica in a warmer global climate. The findings are published in the latest edition of the Geological Society of America Bulletin. Another image showing the vast valley, outlined in black here. The paper’s lead author Dr Neil Ross, from Newcastle University, said: 'The discovery of this huge trough, and the characterisation of the surrounding mountainous landscape, was incredibly serendipitous. 'We had acquired ice penetrating radar data from both ends of this huge hidden valley, but we had no information to tell us what was in between. 'Satellite data was used to fill the gap, because despite being covered beneath several kilometres of ice, the valley is so vast that it can be seen from space. 'To me, this just goes to demonstrate how little we still know about the surface of our own planet. The discovery and exploration of hidden, previously-unknown landscapes is still possible and incredibly exciting, even now.'The research was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).

We have this equation: -24 = -304*h + 316*h First, we should combine the terms with \\"h\\" in them. So, let's think about this: if we have -304 \\"h\\"s and we add 316 \\"h\\"s, how many \\"h\\"s will we have? -304 * h + 316 * h = (316 - 304) * h = 12 * h So now, our equation looks like this: -24 = 12 * h Next, we want to find out what \\"h\\" is. To do that, we should get \\"h\\" all by itself on one side of the equation. Right now, \\"h\\" is being multiplied by 12, so we should do the opposite to undo that. The opposite of multiplying is dividing. Let's divide both sides of the equation by 12 to find out what \\"h\\" is: -24 divided by 12 = -2 (because when we divide a negative number by a positive number, the result is negative) So, -2 equals to 'h'.

Emerson was staunchly opposed to slavery, but he did not appreciate being in the public limelight and was hesitant about lecturing on the subject. He did, however, give a number of lectures during the pre-Civil War years, beginning as early as November, 1837. A number of his friends and family members were more active abolitionists than he, at first, but from 1844 on, he took a more active role in opposing slavery. He gave a number of speeches and lectures, and notably welcomed John Brown to his home during Brown's visits to Concord. He voted for Abraham Lincoln in 1860, but Emerson was disappointed that Lincoln was more concerned about preserving the Union than eliminating slavery outright. Once the American Civil War broke out, Emerson made it clear that he believed in immediate emancipation of the slaves. Around this time, in 1860, Emerson published The Conduct of Life, his seventh collection of essays. In this book, Emerson \\"grappled with some of the thorniest issues of the moment,\\" and \\"his experience in the abolition ranks is a telling influence in his conclusions.\\" In these essays Emerson strongly embraced the idea of war as a means of national rebirth: \\"Civil war, national bankruptcy, or revolution, [are] more rich in the central tones than languid years of prosperity.\\" Emerson visited Washington, D.C, at the end of January 1862. He gave a public lecture at the Smithsonian on January 31, 1862, and declared:, \\"The South calls slavery an institution... I call it destitution... Emancipation is the demand of civilization\\". The next day, February 1, his friend Charles Sumner took him to meet Lincoln at the White House. Lincoln was familiar with Emerson's work, having previously seen him lecture. Emerson's misgivings about Lincoln began to soften after this meeting. In 1865, he spoke at a memorial service held for Lincoln in Concord: \\"Old as history is, and manifold as are its tragedies, I doubt if any death has caused so much pain as this has caused, or will have caused, on its announcement.\\" Emerson also met a number of high-ranking government officials, including Salmon P. Chase, the secretary of the treasury; Edward Bates, the attorney general; Edwin M. Stanton, the secretary of war; Gideon Welles, the secretary of the navy; and William Seward, the secretary of state. On May 6, 1862, Emerson's protege Henry David Thoreau died of tuberculosis at the age of 44. Emerson delivered his eulogy. He often referred to Thoreau as his best friend, despite a falling-out that began in 1849 after Thoreau published A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers. Another friend, Nathaniel Hawthorne, died two years after Thoreau, in 1864. Emerson served as a pallbearer when Hawthorne was buried in Concord, as Emerson wrote, \\"in a pomp of sunshine and verdure\\". He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1864.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose temperatures are higher happens, how will it affect More mass is burned by the red giant. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of higher temperatures would have an effect on the process. If the temperatures in the red giant are higher, this could lead to more mass being burned at a faster rate. This increased rate of mass burning would cause the core temperature to rise even more and could potentially shorten the duration of the red giant phase. This, in turn, could affect the subsequent stages of the star's life cycle. With more mass being burned by the red giant due to the higher temperatures, the star may go through the process of fusing carbon and oxygen in its center more rapidly. As a result, the red giant would reach the stage where it can no longer fuse the carbon and oxygen sooner. The higher core temperatures would also affect the star's gravity and its ability to hold the outer layers. This could cause the layers to break away earlier, which would ultimately result in the formation of a white dwarf sooner than expected. Therefore, the supposed perturbation has both direct and indirect effects on the process of the red giant burning its mass and evolving into a white dwarf."},{"prompt":"What is the final step of the following process: - An airline reservation is made - The passenger arrives early at the airport - The luggage is checked - The passenger waits in line - The passenger shows their identification and gets a boarding pass - The passenger goes to their gate - The passenger gets in line when it's time to board - The person boards the plane - The plane arrives at the destination","completion":"The final step of the process is: - The passenger deplanes (exits the aircraft) at the destination airport."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Niagara River corridor from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario is renowned as a spectacular winter haven for hundreds of thousands of water birds. But this year's bitterly cold season has made it notable for something else: dead ducks.Biologists say carcasses began piling up by the hundreds in early January after the plunging temperatures started icing over nearly the entire Great Lakes, preventing the ducks from getting to the minnows that are their main source of food. Necropsies on dozens of birds have confirmed the cause: starvation.'All have empty stomachs. They're half the weight they should be,' said Connie Adams, a biologist in the state Department of Environmental Conservation's Buffalo office who has personally seen 950 dead birds. A dead red-breasted merganser duck sits on an examine table at the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation's wildlife health unit on Thursday. Biologist Joe Okoniewski examines a dead red-breasted merganser duck at the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation's wildlife health unit on Thursday. 'This is unprecedented. Biologists who've worked here for 35 years have never seen anything like this,' she said. 'We've seen a decline in tens of thousands in our weekly waterfowl counts.' It's a phenomenon that has been seen elsewhere along the Great Lakes, with news reports of diving ducks and other waterfowl turning up dead by the hundreds along the southern part of Lake Michigan. They've also been found in Lake St. Clair between Lakes Erie and Huron. 'It's a hard winter for ducks, like everything else,' said Russ Mason, wildlife director with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. Necropsies and toxicity analyses showed many of the Michigan ducks were subsisting on invasive zebra mussels, which caused the birds to have potentially toxic levels of selenium in their bodies, Mason said. Zebra mussels filter toxins from the water and pass them up the food chain. Most of the dead ducks seen in the upstate New York are red-breasted mergansers, which breed in northern Canada and Alaska and come south for the winter to the Great Lakes region. In most years, there are periods of freezing and thawing, providing enough breaks in the ice for them to dive for minnows. But this winter, it's been so bitterly cold for so long that the ice had pushed across 92.2 percent of the Great Lakes' surface area earlier this month, according to federal monitors, just short of the record 94.7 percent set in 1979. Biologists say the Niagara River also. has ice extending up to 100 yards off shore, creating a shelf where. minnows and shiners can hide. The Niagara River corridor from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario is renowned as a winter haven for water birds. There is evidence some waterfowl gave up and tried to fly farther south but were too weak to do so. Dead birds have been seen along shorelines, on docks and on the ice, their carcasses feasted upon by gulls and bald eagles. Two weeks ago, Adams said, there were 240,000 water birds in her area's weekly count. Last week, there were 43,000. It's unknown how many birds - which also included such species as scaup, canvasbacks and grebes - migrated elsewhere and how many died.At the DEC's Wildlife Health Unit near Albany, biologist Joe Okoniewski has refrigerators stuffed with bags of red-breasted mergansers sent by wildlife biologists on Lakes Erie and Ontario. The diving ducks are black and white with a rusty speckled breast, orange bill and an iridescent green head with a shaggy crest on the back. 'The skin is stuck tight to the body wall because there's no layer of fat underneath,' Okoniewski said, running a scalpel along the breastbone of a dead merganser. The gizzard and intestine were empty, except for a few normal parasites.'I've seen a couple with stomachs full of feathers and feathers all the way down through their intestines,' Okoniewski said. 'They're desperate for anything to eat. It's really sad.' Biologist Joe Okoniewski examines the ducks who he says died of starvation. Unlike mallard or black ducks, mergansers won't eat bread or other food people may offer. They only eat live fish. While the bird deaths are a natural event that can be documented but not changed, wildlife rehabilitators are trying to save birds that people find near death in snowbanks and parking lots. 'We've had over 160 since the beginning of January,' said Dawn Mazierski, a wildlife technician at the Erie County SPCA in Tonawanda. 'We have to tube-feed them a liquid diet three to four times a day until they're strong enough to eat on their own.' The birds, which spend all their time on water, can hardly walk, and often their natural waterproofing is damaged by dirt or road salt so they can't swim either. 'They soak up water like a sponge and sink,' Mazierski said. So the birds rest in a quiet room on net hammocks called loon beds, preening their feathers back to condition. When they're ready, they go into tubs of water stocked with minnows donated by bait shops. 'A merganser can eat 200 to 250 fish per day,' Mazierski said. 'We go through thousands of fish a day.' After anywhere from three days to a couple of weeks, the birds are ready for release. 'Once their weight has increased and they're real spunky, and we have a decent weather day, we take them back out,' Mazierski said. 'And we hope they'll find enough food to bulk up for their flight north in spring.' Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

News article: PepsiCo Inc. will start selling Diet Pepsi without aspartame later this year, the biggest change to the beverage in three decades, after a consumer backlash against the artificial sweetener crushed sales. The company will replace aspartame with a blend of sucralose and acesulfame potassium in Diet Pepsi, Caffeine Free Diet Pepsi and Wild Cherry Diet Pepsi sold in the U.S. beginning in August. The move follows a 5.2 percent decline in Diet Pepsi’s sales volume last year, according to Beverage-Digest. Sales of Coca-Cola’s Diet Coke, which also uses aspartame, dropped 6.6 percent. PepsiCo is getting the jump on Diet Coke, the country’s No. 1 sugar-free soda, in removing the controversial sweetener. Consumers have been backing away from both brands in recent years, fearful that the lab-created sweetener may cause cancer. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said there’s no proof of a health risk from aspartame. “Decades of studies have shown that aspartame is safe, but the reality is that consumer demand in the U.S. has been evolving,” Seth Kaufman, senior vice president of Pepsi and the company’s flavors drinks in North America, said in an interview. “The U.S. diet cola consumer has been asking and asking and asking for an aspartame-free great diet cola.” Coke’s Response Even so, Coca-Cola isn’t budging. “There are currently no plans to change the sweetener for Diet Coke, America’s favorite no-calorie soft drink,” Scott Williamson, a spokesman, said in an e-mail. “All of the beverages we offer and ingredients we use are safe.” PepsiCo’s decision came after consumer complaints accelerated during the past two years -- with feedback flowing in through call lines, social media and letters, Kaufman said. In surveys, aspartame was the top reason given by consumers for drinking less of the diet cola, he said. “It’s been going on for some time, and the volume of it over the past two years has really been high,” Kaufman said. The rising worry over aspartame coincides with a surge in demand for natural ingredients, with more consumers rejecting artificial additives and highly processed foods. The trend has been stoked by social media, where nutrition advocates -- with or without formal training or scientific proof -- spread warnings faster and wider than ever. Food Babe Controversial blogger Vani Hari, who calls herself the Food Babe, says aspartame is “one the most dangerous substances allowed in our food supply. Aspartame is linked to diabetes, autoimmune disorders, depression (which can cause you to eat more -- once again), birth defects, and several forms of cancer.” PepsiCo, based in Purchase, New York, doesn’t have plans to replace aspartame in Diet Mountain Dew, despite a 3 percent sales decline. That product is the company’s best-selling diet beverage after Diet Pepsi. There are no plans to remove aspartame from other PepsiCo soft drinks either, Kaufman said. The focus for the change is on colas with declining sales. With aspartame-sweetened Pepsi Max, for example, consumers didn’t cite the ingredient as one of the top 10 reasons they were drinking less of it, Kaufman said. The FDA approved aspartame for use in some beverages and foods in 1981. Two years later, the ingredient was allowed in carbonated beverages. It was then ruled a “general-purpose sweetener” in 1996, giving it freer rein. Highly Studied “Aspartame is one of the most exhaustively studied substances in the human food supply, with more than 100 studies supporting its safety,” the agency said. “FDA scientists have reviewed scientific data regarding the safety of aspartame in food and concluded that it is safe for the general population under certain conditions.” People with a rare hereditary disease that makes it hard for them to metabolize aspartame’s phenylalanine are advised to limit its ingestion, the FDA warns. The agency requires labeling to inform people who are at risk. Acesulfame potassium, meanwhile, was first approved for food in 1988 and is used in drinks such as Coke Zero, which also contains some aspartame. Sucralose, marketed as Splenda and used in a version of Diet Coke, was first approved in 1998. The FDA has deemed both sweeteners safe. Cancer Rats While Sucralose and acesulfame potassium haven’t generated the same level of fear among consumers, the sweeteners aren’t free from concern. The Center for Science in the Public Interest recommends “caution” over sucralose because of an unpublished 2012 Italian study that said the sweetener caused leukemia in mice. The Washington-based group says to “avoid” acesulfame potassium because of rat studies suggesting that the ingredient caused cancer. Sucralose, a synthetic product of molecular engineering, may get a pass from some because it is at least derived from table sugar. Acesulfame potassium, also a synthetic chemical, hasn’t been used as widely and is lesser known to consumers. Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, took a shot at the aspartame revolt in mid-2013 with print ads in national publications that defended its safety. Sales of Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi both declined almost 7 percent that year. The crisis, which came on top of a consumer reaction against high-calorie sugar-sweetened drinks, has forced Coca-Cola and PepsiCo into the lab for solutions. Both have aggressively pursued a natural, noncaloric ingredient called stevia, which is extracted from a leaf and is 200 to 300 times sweeter than sugar. Stevia doesn’t work so well in colas, however. It gives off a metallic aftertaste when used in higher doses. So the soda makers are researching ways to ferment and bioengineer copies of a better-tasting stevia molecule found in the leaf. As for aspartame, Kaufman declined to say how PepsiCo’s decision would affect Coca-Cola, saying only that “we’re excited that we’re the first scaled business to do it.” ||||| PepsiCo Inc. said Friday it would remove the sweetener aspartame from Diet Pepsi, seeking to address consumer concerns about the artificial additive and reverse slumping diet soda sales. PepsiCo said it would switch to sucralose, a less controversial but still artificial sweetener.

Write a to-do list before bed. 2. Go to sleep. 3. Sleep better than all the non-list-writing people you meet tomorrow. It sounds simple, but there's evidence that it just might work. According to a small study published in the January issue of Journal of Experimental Psychology, participants who took 5 minutes to write out a to-do list before bed fell asleep more quickly than participants who wrote about tasks they had already completed. The key, according to researchers, is in mentally \\"offloading\\" responsibilities before bedtime, theoretically freeing the mind for sound sleeping. [How to Sleep Better] \\"We live in a 24/7 culture in which our to-do lists seem to be constantly growing and causing us to worry about unfinished tasks at bedtime,\\" lead author Michael Scullin, director of Baylor's Sleep Neuroscience and Cognition Laboratory, said in a statement. \\"Most people just cycle through their to-do lists in their heads, and so we wanted to explore whether the act of writing them down could counteract nighttime difficulties with falling asleep.\\" To test this hypothesis, researchers invited 57 men and women between ages 18 and 30 to spend one weeknight in a controlled sleep lab. The rules were simple: lights out at 10:30 p.m., and no technology, homework or other distractions allowed. Five minutes before bedtime, each participant was instructed to complete a short writing exercise. Half of the participants wrote about anything they needed to remember to do in the upcoming days, while the other half wrote about tasks they had completed during the previous days. When the exercise was done, participants tucked in for bed. Researchers measured each participant's brain activity overnight using a technique called polysomnography, which records eye movement, muscle activity and other biological changes. The researchers found that the participants who wrote to-do lists fell asleep an average of 9 minutes faster than those who wrote about already-accomplished tasks. In fact, \\"the more specifically participants wrote their to-do list, the faster they subsequently fell asleep,\\" the study authors wrote. \\"The opposite trend was observed when participants wrote about completed activities.\\" While 9 minutes may not seem like a lot of extra shut-eye, it's comparable to the improvement seen in clinical trials for some sleep medications, Scullin told Time magazine. A 2006 study similarly found that napping for just 10 minutes sufficiently improved participants' cognitive function and energy. The authors acknowledged that the new study could be improved by a larger sample size and more data taking each participant's personality and propensity for anxiety into account. Still, the paper's findings are consistent with other published research on the therapeutic power of keeping a journal. Previous studies have observed that expressive writing — writing about emotions and stress for 20 minutes a day — was linked to boosted immune function in patients with illnesses such as asthma, arthritis and HIV/AIDS. Other studies have drawn a line between journaling in times of stress or emotional hardship and stress relief. So, give writing before bed a try — and hope it's boring enough to put you to sleep. Originally published on Live Science. ||||| Are you a fan of to-do lists? You may be at an advantage, because they could improve your sleep, according to a new report.

Scullin said in a statement. “Most people just cycle through their to-do lists in their heads, and so we wanted to explore whether the act of writing them down could counteract nighttime difficulties with falling asleep.” To do so, they examined 57 university students, who were split into two groups. While one group was asked to write down everything they needed to remember to do the next day or over the next few days, the other was required to write about completed tasks from previous days. Then all participants were instructed to go to bed right after those five-minute writing sessions. After analyzing the results, they found that those who wrote to-do lists fell asleep an average of 9 minutes faster than those who jotted down things they already finished. \\"The more specifically participants wrote their to-do list, the faster they subsequently fell asleep,\\" the study authors wrote. \\"The opposite trend was observed when participants wrote about completed activities.\\" The scientists noted their study was small and could be improved with more subjects.

But Buddhism survived and when the Mongols conquered the region, Buddhism was adopted as the official religion of their empire. In 1271, Kublai Khan established the Yuan Dynasty and Tibet remained a semi-autonomous entity within it. From the second half of the 14th century until the early 17th, Tibet was ruled by competing Buddhist schools. However, it was during this period that the Gelug order was founded in 1409 and the institution of the Dalai Lama was established in 1569 with the priest-patron relationship between the Altan Khan and the 3rd Dalai Lama . The Dalai Lamas are said to be the reincarnates of the Bodhisattva of Compassion, Avalokiteśvara. It was when the 5th Dalai Lama Ngawang Lobsang Gyatso succeeded in establishing the Ganden Phodrang government and Gelug supremacy in Tibet, with the help of the Güshi Khan of the Khoshut Khanate, that the post took on the dual role of political and religious leadership . After Lobsang Gyatso's mortal passing in 1682, which was kept a secret for 15 years, there was a period of anarchy and invasions that eventually led to the establishment of Qing protectorate over Tibet in 1720 that would reach its peak in the 1790s in response to attacks by Nepal, be renewed in 1903 when the British invaded, and would last until 1912. Tibet became independent with the demise of the Manchu Qing dynasty and would remain so until 1950. Based on the above article, answer a question. When did the break-up of the Tibetan Empire occur?","completion":"The break-up of the Tibetan Empire occurred in the mid-9th century."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: After 18 months of treating this camera like gold and being reasonably satisfied with the quality of the images (as long as they weren't enlarged), one day it just stopped working with the lens partially extended, frozen in place. All the repair shops want 100 to fix it. For 100 I could buy a new one. It was cute while it lasted, but I've bought a Yashica T4 (the original - not the awful zoom remake with the same name) instead. It's not nearly as small, but this elph is just too fragile. Is this product review negative? A:","completion":"Yes, this product review is negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the camera's durability, stating it stopped working after 18 months, and they highlight issues with repair costs and image quality when enlarged. They also mention that they replaced it with a different camera, referring to the original camera as \\"too fragile.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"Police and goverment figures are examples of what kind of individuals?\\" Context: \\"These were fighting words to be coming from a country that once insisted Europe needed Turkey and was willing to spill blood over it. For his authority Miller invokes the people, citing the \\"collective wisdom\\" of Europe, and introducing a concept to arise many times in the decades to follow under chilling circumstances:\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the context of the question. The context seems to be a discussion about authority and power, mentioning Europe and Turkey in a conflict of some sort, and a person named Miller who speaks on behalf of the people. Step 2: Understand the question. The question is asking about the type of individuals that police and government figures represent. Essentially, it requires a term that defines or categorizes these types of individuals. Step 3: Reflect on relevant concepts. Given the context of authority and power, the roles of police and government figures are likely related to their responsibility in maintaining order, enforcing laws, and representing the interests of the people or the state. Step 4: Formulate the answer. Police and government figures are examples of authority figures or public officials. These individuals hold positions of power and responsibility within the governance and enforcement systems of a country.

Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - Energy builds up in the crust of the earth - The energy causes the fault lines give way - The earth&#x27;s plates move - The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions Answer:","completion":"The final step of the process is the generation of seismic waves and the occurrence of an earthquake. When the energy from the Earth's crust is released, it travels through the Earth's layers as seismic waves. These waves cause the ground to shake, resulting in an earthquake. The shaking can cause damage to structures, trigger landslides, tsunamis, and other secondary effects, depending on the intensity, depth, and location of the earthquake. Overall, the process consists of: 1. Energy build-up in the Earth's crust: Stress accumulates in the Earth's crust due to the slow movement of tectonic plates. 2. Fault lines give way: As the stress surpasses the strength of the rock, a fault rupture occurs, releasing the accumulated energy. 3. Earth's plates move: The release of energy causes the tectonic plates to shift and slide past each other. 4. Energy radiates outward: The released energy spreads out from the fault in all directions as seismic waves. 5. Seismic waves and earthquake: These seismic waves cause the ground to shake, resulting in an earthquake and potential damage to structures and the environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
