Taylor Hicks was born in Birmingham, Alabama on October 7, 1976, to Bradley Hicks and Pamela Dickinson. He and his family moved to the suburb of Hoover when he was eight years old. His hair started turning gray by the time he was 14. His parents divorced, and stepmother Linda shared custody of their son until he became of age. While in college, Hicks was part of a band called Passing Through, which he later quit to start his own band. In 1997, he independently recorded In Your Time, an album which included both studio and live tracks. In 2000, he moved to pursue a music career in Nashville, Tennessee, where he worked with Nashville veterans Billy Earl McClelland and Percy Sledge to record a three-track demo but was unable to find a label that would sign him. He left Nashville after a year due to what he called the \\"oversaturation of the market\\". Hicks returned to Alabama and launched a professional music career, performing at various venues and parties mostly around the Southeastern United States, including The War Eagle Supper Club (a popular college bar) in Auburn, Alabama. Hicks has performed with the likes of Widespread Panic, James Brown, Tom Petty, Jackson Browne, Drive-By Truckers, Robert Randolph, Snoop Dogg and Keb Mo. He also performed in the huge infield of Talladega Superspeedway in 2004 during a NASCAR race weekend. He recorded, produced, and released a second album, Under the Radar, in 2005. Despite releasing two albums prior to appearing on American Idol, he did not violate their requirements for contestants, as he had never held a recording contract. Hicks has allowed audience members to record his concerts for personal, non-commercial use, and has authorized the Internet Archive to create a section for fans to upload and share their recordings.

Article: Have you ever imagined what human beings will look like in the future? Well, now you don't have to. According to AsapScience, a Canada-based video channel that touches on many different science topics, humans will be very different creatures 1,000 years from now. Artificial intelligence, genetic engineering and climate change will work together to change our bodies greatly, according to a video recently published by the channel. We could, for instance, develop red eyes as our DNA changes, and have darker skin because of global warming. The video painted a picture of a future world in which our bodies are part human, part machine. Nanobots, or tiny robots, will be put into our bodies, improving our abilities. \\"No longer will we be limited by our own physiology. We will truly become a mixture of biology and machine on the inside,\\" says the video. Meanwhile, designer babies will cause future generations to grow into intelligent, attractive people. As global warming takes hold, humans will also be skinnier and taller, as this body shape deals with heat better. In fact, Cadell Last, a researcher at the Global Brain Institute located in Belgium, believes change may happen even faster than this. As he said in a paper recently published in Current Aging Science, mankind is already going through a major evolutionary change. In less than four decades, Last claims, we will live longer, have children in old age and need artificial intelligence to finish daily tasks. \\"Your 80 or 100 is going to be so radically different than your grandparents,\\" Last said. Instead of living fast and dying young, he believes humans will live slow and die old. \\"The biological clock isn't going to be around forever,\\" he added, and said that people could pause it for some time using future technology.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Pharmaceutical companies whose products are used in the three-drug cocktails for lethal injections are predominantly European, and they have strenuously objected to the use of their drugs for executions and taken steps to prevent their use. For example, Hospira, the sole American manufacturer of sodium thiopental, the critical anesthetic in the three-drug cocktail, announced in 2011 that it would no longer manufacture the drug for the American market, in part for ethical reasons and in part because its transfer of sodium thiopental manufacturing to Italy would subject it to the European Union's Torture Regulation, which forbids the use of any product manufactured within the Union for torture (as execution by lethal injection is considered by the Regulation). Since the drug manufacturers began taking these steps and the EU regulation ended the importation of drugs produced in Europe, the resulting shortage of execution drugs has led to or influenced decisions to impose moratoria in Arkansas, California, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, North Carolina, and Tennessee.

It's an Indie; low-budget, no big-name actors, freshman director. I had heard it was good, but not this good. Placed in a contemporary, ethnic, working-class Brooklyn, Karyn Kusama has done an extraordinary job of capturing the day-do-day struggles of urban Latinos. Diana, the protagonist, is seething with anger and lashes out at her high school peers, getting in trouble with the school and her friends. She is being raised by her single father, who appears to love her and her brother, but applies a strict, sex-based double standard on his children. The father's double standard is illustrated by the fact that Tiny, the brother, is taking boxing lessons at the local gym, but Diana is denied similar pursuits. On an errand to the gym to meet Tiny, Diana is captivated by boxing. Tiny doesn't like boxing, so he and Diana trade places; he gets the money from Dad then gives it to Diana to take the lessons in his place. This is actually a feel-good movie, as Diana grows and learns about herself through boxing, meets a guy, and addresses some very serious issues head-on. There's no giggly, 'everything that can go right does go right' resolution a la \\"Bend It Like Beckham\\". The reality and attendant personal issues are too big for pat resolutions, but in my opinion, \\"Girlfight\\" is a better and more satisfying film for it. Now, what is this review like?

Instead, they serve to emphasize how impressive the film is despite its limited resources.

They commend the film's handling of serious issues and find it more satisfying than the \\"giggly\\" resolution of a film like \\"Bend It Like Beckham.\\" Overall, the reviewer is clearly impressed by \\"Girlfight\\" and finds it to be a worthwhile, emotionally impactful film.

Understand your personal and family medical history. Talk to your doctor.\\"","completion":"Title: Understanding Your Health Profile: The Significance of Age, Gender, Ethnicity, and Lifestyle in Shaping a Personalized Healthcare Approach Introduction Personalized healthcare, as the term suggests, refers to the formulation of medical techniques and interventions curated to cater to the specific needs of an individual. This approach acknowledges that each person has a unique health profile, influenced by factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, lifestyle, and medical history. To optimize healthcare outcomes and efficiently manage resources, it is crucial to consider these factors in medical decision-making processes. This article discusses the importance of understanding and evaluating an individual's health profile by considering their age, gender, ethnicity, lifestyle, personal and family medical history, and engaging in conversations with healthcare professionals. 1. Age Age is one of the most impactful factors in determining an individual's health needs and medical care requirements. The developmental stage of a person, be it infancy, adolescence, adulthood, or old age, brings about significant changes in their physiological, mental, and social aspects. These changes affect their susceptibility to various diseases as well as their response to medications and treatments. For instance, aging individuals may experience reduced organ function, weakened immune systems, and cognitive decline, increasing the risk of chronic illnesses and infections. Therefore, understanding the role of age in one's health profile is pivotal in identifying appropriate preventive measures, early detection of health risks, and tailored management strategies. 2. Gender Gender, as a biological and social determinant of health, plays a crucial role in an individual's health profile. Physiological differences between males and females affect the prevalence and presentation of various diseases, sensitivity to medications, and health risks. For example, women are at a higher risk of developing osteoporosis, while men are more prone to heart diseases. Additionally, social and cultural gender norms impact access to and utilization of healthcare services, decision-making in treatment plans, and mental health outcomes. Recognizing the influence of these gender-related factors is essential in integrating gender-sensitive approaches into personalized healthcare plans. 3. Ethnicity Ethnicity, as an intersectional factor of genetics, culture, and socioeconomic background, holds significant implications for health profiles. Population groups sharing common genetic heritage may exhibit varied susceptibilities to certain genetic disorders and chronic conditions. For instance, Ashkenazi Jews have a higher prevalence of Tay-Sachs disease, while African Americans are more prone to sickle cell anemia. Moreover, cultural practices, lifestyle habits, and dietary preferences can predispose certain ethnicities to health risks, both modifiable and non-modifiable. Understanding these multicultural nuances and incorporating them into healthcare strategies can immensely benefit the provisioning of culturally-sensitive and patient-centered care. 4. Lifestyle Modern-age living has seen significant changes in our lifestyle practices, with varying repercussions on our health. Sedentary living, unhealthy diets, tobacco use, and excessive alcohol consumption are some of the key drivers of non-communicable diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and certain cancers. By evaluating an individual's lifestyle practices, healthcare professionals can identify potential health risks and provide targeted interventions to modify such behaviors. Empowering individuals to adopt healthier lifestyles is a critical aspect of personalized healthcare, aiming to prevent diseases and promote well-being. 5. Personal and Family Medical History A comprehensive understanding of one's health profile necessitates the consideration of their personal and family medical history. Past experiences with illnesses can inform medical professionals of inherent susceptibilities, risk factors, and appropriate treatment options. Similarly, family medical history can shed light on hereditary or genetic predispositions, early indicators for potential health concerns, and the need for preventive measures such as lifestyle adjustments or regular screenings. Integrating such information into healthcare planning is fundamental to upholding the spirit of patient-centered care. 6. Communication with Healthcare Professionals Lastly, establishing open, transparent, and continuous communication with healthcare professionals is indispensable for personalized care. Dialogue on personal concerns, changes in physical or mental health, and understanding prescribed treatments fosters trust and mutual understanding. Collaborative decision-making, education, and counseling are integral to enhancing patient satisfaction, adherence to treatment, and overall health outcomes. Conclusion In conclusion, adopting a personalized healthcare approach necessitates understanding and evaluating the multiple determinants of one's health profile. By considering factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, lifestyle, personal and family medical history, and engaging in conversations with healthcare professionals, individuals can actively participate in shaping their health journeys and contribute to achieving optimal outcomes for themselves and their communities."},{"prompt":"Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Some British and American people like to invite friends for a meal at home.

She had me go through Mia's pockets, but all I could find was a piece of paper with an address written on it. Five Crossings. I couldn't find her ID anywhere.

Read this article and answer this question The Cambodian-Spanish War was an attempt by the Spanish Empire to conquer Cambodia, establish their own king, and Christianize the population. Along with the Spanish, the Japanese, Filipinos, Thai, Portuguese, and Dominicans participated in the invasion of Cambodia. Each country possessed different motives for their invasion of Cambodia. Specifically, the Thai interference and the Spanish expedition was a result of a power struggle between rival factions in Cambodia's government. In addition, both Spanish and Portuguese took part in the invasion of Cambodia because King Philip II ruled both Spain and Portugal. In February 1593, Thai ruler Naresuen attacked Cambodia in order to fight the Burmese. Later on, in May 1593, 100,000 Thai soldiers invaded Cambodia. As a result of the Thai's invasion, Lovek was conquered in July 1594. In 1593, the Spanish expedition led by Gregorio Vargas Machuca and Blas Ruiz de Hernan Gonzales entered Cambodia through the city of Manila.Although the Spanish invasion of Cambodia failed, Ruiz and Veloso succeeded in establishing king Barom Reachea II in May 1597. Private individuals of Muslim Malays, Chams, Cambodians retaliated to Spain and Portugal's invasion by slaughtering the Spanish and Portuguese, including Diogo Veloso.

The capital of the province is the city of Ayacucho. - The Spanish American wars of independence were the numerous wars against Spanish rule in Spanish America that took place during the early 19th century, after the French invasion of Spain during Europe's Napoleonic Wars. Although various regions of Spanish America objected to crown policies the restricted trade and privileged Spanish-born officials over American-born, \\"there was little interest in outright independence; indeed there was widespread support for the Spanish Central Junta formed to lead the resistance against the French.\\" These conflicts started in 1809 with short-lived governing juntas established in Chuquisaca and Quito opposing the composition of the Supreme Central Junta of Seville. When the Central Junta fell to the French invasion, in 1810, numerous new juntas appeared across the Spanish domains in the Americas. The conflicts among these colonies and with Spain eventually resulted in a chain of newly independent countries stretching from Argentina and Chile in the south to Mexico in the north in the first third of the 19th century. Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule until the SpanishAmerican War in 1898. - The Peruvian War of Independence was composed of a series of military conflicts beginning in 1811 that culminated in 1824 with the defeat of the Spanish Empire in the battles of Junin and Ayacucho. During the previous decade Peru had been a stronghold for royalists, who fought those in favor of independence in Upper Peru, Quito and Chile. The wars of independence took place with the background of the 1780-1781 uprising by indigenous leader Túpac Amaru II and the earlier removal of Upper Peru and the Río de la Plata regions from the Viceroyalty of Peru. Because of this the viceroy often had the support of the \\"Lima oligarchy,\\" who saw their elite interests threatened by popular rebellion and were opposed to the new commercial class in Buenos Aires. Among the most important events during the war was the proclamation of independence of Peru by José de San Martín on July 28, 1821. - The Historical Sanctum of the Pampa of Ayacucho settled on August 14 , 1980 , by means of Supreme Decree N ° 119 - 80 - AA .

But beyond the handshakes, casual strolls and shared asides, many analysts and experts are already wondering what exactly the enduring substance of the summit will be and whether it could boost Trump's political rating at home. For Trump, the great political disrupter, it was the most significant foreign policy move of his presidency. It comes at a time when he looks to turn around his often weak polls and bolster his political standing at home in advance of midterm congressional elections in November, where Democrats are poised to make gains. From the images of their historic first handshake to signing an agreement on denuclearization, Trump and Kim took the first steps toward writing a new chapter in relations between their two countries. \\"People are going to be very impressed, people are going to be very happy, and we are going to take care of a very big and very dangerous problem for the world,\\" Trump said sitting alongside Kim after both men signed the joint agreement. It was Trump's biggest moment on the world stage, and an opportunity he was eager to seize. \\"We got along really well.We had a great chemistry.You understand how I feel about chemistry.It is very important,\\" Trump told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren immediately after the summit. \\"I mean, I know people where there is no chemistry. We had it right from the beginning. We talked about that and I think great things are going to happen for North Korea.\\" It was the first ever meeting between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader. The two men signed an agreement that committed both countries to work toward the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but the details remain vague. The United States offered unspecified security guarantees and a halt to military exercises with South Korea. Trump also said he raised the issue of human rights with Kim, but added that most of the meeting focused on the nuclear issue.

Something as simple as a smile can show friendliness in one culture, embarrassment in another, impatience in a third. Even silence means different things in different places. If you want to avoid making some mistakes when traveling abroad, you should pay attention to the following. Touch Britain, along with much of Northern Europe and the Far East, has a \\"non-contact\\" culture. In those countries, there is very little physical contact in people's daily talks. Even brushing someone's arm by accident is the reason for an apology. However, in the high-contact cultures of the Middle East, Latin America, and southern Europe, physical touch is a big part of daily life. What's more, there are different standards for who touches whom and where. In much of the Arab world, men hold hands and kiss each other in greeting, but would never do the same with a woman. In Thailand and Laos, it is taboo to touch anyone's head, even children's. In South Korea, elders can touch younger people with force when trying to get through a crowd, but younger people can't do the same. Eye contact In most Western countries, frequent eye contact is a sign of confidence and attentiveness . We may think that a conversation partner who looks away is either not listening to us or lying. Of course, this is not the standard around the world. In many Asian, African, and Latin American countries, the unbroken eye contact would be considered impolite and rude. These cultures consider avoiding eye contact a sign of respect for bosses and elders. In these parts of the world, children won't look at an adult who is speaking to them, and nor will employees look at their bosses. In Britain, when people are talking, they usually_. A) avoid eye contact B) brush the others' arms C) avoid physical contact D) apologize for their mistakes Answer:","completion":"C) avoid physical contact In the context of the question, Anne Merritt emphasizes the importance of understanding body language while studying foreign speech. A simple gesture like a smile can have different meanings in different cultures. Similarly, silence can be interpreted differently based on the cultural context. When traveling abroad, it is essential to be aware of the cultural norms and expectations regarding touch, eye contact, and other non-verbal cues in order to avoid making mistakes. For example, Britain, along with much of Northern Europe and the Far East, falls under the category of \\"non-contact\\" cultures. In these countries, there is minimal physical contact during daily interactions, and even accidentally brushing someone's arm might warrant an apology. In contrast, high-contact cultures like the Middle East, Latin America, and southern Europe involve physical touch as a significant part of everyday life, with different standards of who can touch whom and where. For instance, in much of the Arab world, men may hold hands and kiss in greeting, but wouldn't do the same with a woman. Touch is also culturally specific in Thailand, Laos, and South Korea, where certain taboos, age-related expectations, and etiquettes must be observed not to offend the local population. Eye contact is another non-verbal cue that varies across cultures. In Western countries, maintaining frequent eye contact shows confidence and attentiveness. However, this standard is not universal. In many Asian, African, and Latin American countries, constant eye contact is considered impolite and rude. Instead, avoiding eye contact in these regions is a sign of respect for authority figures, such as bosses and elders. Consequently, children and employees in these cultures typically do not look directly at adults or superiors while being spoken to. To sum up, when people in Britain talk, they generally avoid physical contact (option C) as it belongs to the \\"non-contact\\" category of cultures. This highlights the importance of paying attention to cultural differences in body language, touch, and eye contact while traveling and interacting with people from other countries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation.

In this layer, energy created from nuclear fusion in the core travels outward in the form of photons, but it does not involve the process of nuclear fusion. [C]. convection zone: The convection zone is situated between the radiative zone and the photosphere. Here, energy is transported by means of convection currents, but this zone is not responsible for nuclear fusion.

Sometimes these evergreen shrubs become elephantine and block light from the front windows of a house or dwarf everything else in the garden. There is a solution. Sharp pruning shears, or a saw in some cases, can be used to cut the plants back hard, and encourage dormant buds to break. Complete restoration to youthful splendor may take several years, but this new lease on life is well worth the wait. The time for such action is now, while the plants are dormant. At Planting Fields Arboretum in Oyster Bay, L.I., this form of pruning has been practiced with great success. Some rhododendrons on this magnificent 400-acre showplace date back to the time of the original owner, William Rhobertson Coe, who started collecting from nurseries in England as early as 1916. On a recent visit, Gordon E. Jones, the director, emphasized that this type of rejuvenation pruning must be done early in the season to take advantage of the shrub's spring growth dynamics, \\"certainly not later than the first week of April,\\" he said. \\"If done later in the season, after growth begins, pruning does not have the same effect,\\" he said. This form of pruning works best on the large hybrids, often referred to as Iron Clads or Catawbas. \\"It's one of the neatest tricks, a way of bringing a plant back to scale so you can live with it,\\" Mr. Jones said. \\"But there is no guarantee that this type of pruning will work 100 percent. It works best on plants that are lush, in good condition and in an ideal growing location with good light and well-drained soil. If there is too much competition from tree roots or a shade canopy or if the plant is very aged, pruning does not always work and plants may die.\\" Those who are hesitant about such drastic procedures can prune their plants gradually by taking out one or two old branches each spring. As new buds break and begin to fill in, the plant will be gradually renewed over a period of several years. Of course, bloom will be sacrificed by pruning and probably for the next years until new growth matures and sets buds. On a recent walk through the arboretum, Mr. Jones and the assistant director, Robert Titus, pointed out numerous examples of success with this type of rhododendron renewal. The stubs of many old plants could be seen - several inches thick - with crowns of splendid new growth above them. Some of the plants were victims of a severe ice storm that hit Long Island several years ago. Many shrubs and treeswere smashed to the ground. One broken-off rhododendron was estimated to be 60 years old. After the storm, its branches were cut to within a foot or 18 inches from the ground. Dormant buds along this wood were roused and the shrub came back. It is now full of flower beds. Younger rhododendrons and smaller growing hybrids should also be kept in shape by dormant pruning of leaf buds, not flower buds, at this time of year. Pinch out the small leaf bud, as shown in the drawing, while plants are dormant. This bud removal causes lateral buds below to break and increases bushiness or density of the shrubs. Several other old overgrown evergreens will respond to drastic dormant pruning, particularly laurel, andromeda and azalea. Or these shrubs can be lightly reshaped later in the season right after blooming. This latter type of pruning is akin to a haircut. Long straggly wood is cut out to keep the plants in form. Restore a large, overgrown rhododendron by pruning woody stems as low as a foot to 18 inches from the ground, as shown by the black slashes. Young rhododendron and small-leaved hybrids can be kept shapely by pinching out center leaf bud (not flower bud) to force lateral buds to break out in a whorl of leaves.","completion":"Title: \\"Rhododendron Revival: Rejuvenating Overgrown Shrubs for a Thriving Garden Landscape\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Spanish clubs owe government fortune in unpaid taxes Updated Apr 18, 2013 12:14 PM ET You'll be amazed by how much money the world's biggest clubs make. Check out the Spanish football clubs owe the government 670 million euros (874 million) in taxes, Spain's Sports Council said Thursday. Council president Miguel Cardenal said the amount of back taxes clubs owed was down from 750 million euros (979 million) in 2012. Cardenal told Spanish radio station Cope that the reduction was \\"a positive piece of data,\\" while insisting that the league must find a more equitable way to distribute its television revenues to ensure the survival of many clubs in financial difficulties. UEFA has barred Malaga from European competition for one season for not paying player wages and taxes on time as part of its effort to force clubs to clean up their finances. Cardenal said that he is pushing for a new law that would force clubs to sell the TV rights for games collectively, instead of individually as they do now. In 2011, Real Madrid and Barcelona both took in a reported 140 million euros, with the next biggest earner, Atletico Madrid, getting less than 50 million euros. \\"It's very important because (TV money) is a principal source of financing for clubs,\\" Cardenal said. \\"'It is natural to think that the difference between what the biggest clubs receive and those that receive the least become smaller.\\" High debts have forced several Spanish clubs to seek bankruptcy protection in recent years.

Please answer the following question: Background: In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22] Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] Paragraph: Two brothers had bike repair shops in neighboring towns. Bob's was located in a hilly area, with more precipitation and full of bike trails, while Rob's was in the valley, near the parks. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which bike shop completed more brake repairs? A:","completion":"Based on the given information, it can be concluded that Bob's bike shop, located in a hilly area with more precipitation and full of bike trails, is likely to complete more brake repairs as compared to Rob's bike shop in the valley near the parks. There are several reasons to support this conclusion. Firstly, the hilly terrain results in descents, causing bikers to rely more on their brakes to control their speed and maintain safety, subsequently making the brakes wear out more quickly. In slippery conditions, as mentioned in the background, bikers might experience an increased risk of loss of control due to insufficient back tire grip. This would further emphasize the importance of having brakes that function properly and consequently lead to frequent brake maintenance and repairs. Secondly, the area where Bob's shop is located experiences more precipitation, which contributes to the growth of slippery conditions, as well as wear and tear on brake systems. Rain, snow, and ice deteriorate brake pads and components faster than in a dry environment, increasing the need for brake repairs. Thirdly, the presence of bike trails around Bob's shop means there could be a higher number of riders who actively engage in off-road cycling, mountain biking, or other similar activities that require more frequent use of brakes due to the varying terrain and surfaces encountered. These riders would typically need regular brake maintenance and repairs to ensure their safety and optimum braking performance. In contrast, Rob's bike shop is located in the valley near parks, where the terrain is likely to be flatter and with fewer elevation changes. Bikers in this area would encounter fewer situations where brakes are relied upon heavily, resulting in less wear and tear on the brake system. Additionally, the lack of mention of precipitation suggests the climate could be drier, which would also contribute to fewer brake problems. Therefore, based on the information provided, it can be concluded that Bob's bike shop likely completes more brake repairs than Rob's bike shop."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I read this background article the other day: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. I am facing a new situation today: A team of hikers split into two groups. Group Jones hiked north and camped there overnight. Group George went east. Both groups made campfires and heated cans of soups. Group Jones didn't make holes in the cans, so the cans exploded. The others heated their soup cans the right way, by venting them first. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which group's cans had the air molecules inside impact the container walls with less force?","completion":"Based on the information provided, Group George's cans had the air molecules inside impact the container walls with less force. This is because they vented their cans before heating them, thereby allowing the increase in pressure and kinetic energy within the cans to escape. In contrast, Group Jones did not vent their cans, leading to an increase in pressure and ultimately causing the cans to explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains this difference in outcomes between the two groups. When soup cans are heated, the increased temperature adds more kinetic energy to the air molecules inside the can. This added kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move more rapidly and impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. If the can is not vented, the pressure inside continues to increase until it reaches a point where the can can no longer withstand the pressure and it explodes. However, by venting the can, as Group George did, the trapped air inside has a means to escape, preventing the buildup of pressure that could lead to an explosion. Therefore, the air molecules inside the vented cans would still gain kinetic energy and move faster due to the heat, but they would not create a significantly increased pressure as the molecules can escape the can through the vent. As a result, the air molecules in Group George's cans would impact the container walls with less force compared to Group Jones' non-vented cans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When you play for a team chasing their. first title since 2004 — and have served a ban for five bookings so. receive a longer suspension for a dismissal — it is also rank stupidity. Sadly, it also means Southampton's outstanding performance is of secondary importance. Instead it felt as though Arsenal’s season could be shaped by Flamini’s dismissal. The advantage has swung the way of their title rivals and Manuel Pellegrini’s Manchester City will go top if they beat Tottenham on Wednesday evening. Chelsea are also waiting in the wings. Southampton played this game at full throttle, taking the lead when Jose Fonte converted Luke Shaw's teasing left wing cross. To Arsenal's credit they recovered from a dreadful first half to level through Olivier Giroud and then went ahead with a delicious strike from Santi Cazorla. To see Arsenal panic as they did in the first half and for much of the second, when they were unable to put their foot on the ball, was extraordinary. Mauricio Pochettino’s team were full of exuberance, feeding off the raw, rampant enthusiasm of Sam Gallagher in his first Premier League start. At the age of just 18 he has the makings of a proper player, making life hell for Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny. The kid didn’t give them any rest. Equaliser: Lallana score Southampton's second goal against Arsenal. Vital strike: Cazorla scored Arsenal's second against Southampton. I will take that: Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny wins the ball off Southampton's Jay Rodriguez. Showing no fear: Southampton's Sam Gallagher was excellent against Arsenal in his first Premier League start. Watching on: Southampton manage Mauricio Pochettino runs to the aid of his injured left-back Luke Shaw during the Arsenal match. February 2: Crystal Palace - League (h) February 8: Liverpool - League (a) February 12: Manchester United - League (h) February 15: Liverpool - FA Cup (h) To play as he did, against a team with the best defensive record in the Premier League, was something special. Gallagher, pinched from Plymouth’s youth team two years ago, played because Rickie Lambert’s hamstring injury ruled him out. He inspired Southampton’s opening charge, linking brilliantly with Lallana, Jay Rodriguez and the lung-busting runs of Calum Chambers down the right. Wenger’s team were untidy, sluggish and sloppy; careless in possession as Southampton built up a head of steam. Gallagher’s early strike drew a save from Wojciech Szczesny, flying to his right to tip the ball away for a corner. Game on. Southampton took the lead in the 21st minute. Shaw put in the hard yards, buying some time and space down the left and his cross was met by the head of Fonte at the far post. They could have been two up when Gallagher’s effort inside the six-yard box hit a post. Opening strike: Southampton's Jose Fonte, left, scores the first goal of the match against Arsenal at St Mary's. As half-time approached Wenger was desperate to get his team back down that tunnel and at the break he tweaked his system, encouraging his side to be more adventurous whenever they were in possession. It worked. Within minutes of the restart they were level when Bacary Sagna, in an advanced position for the first time in the game, poked the ball into Giroud’s path. The Arsenal forward improvised, turning Sagna’s ball beyond Artur Boruc for the equaliser. It was a special strike. Southampton were stunned, conceding again. when Cazorla’s sweetly struck effort on the edge of the area beat the. Polish goalkeeper. It was a remarkable turnaround for Arsenal, but. Southampton responded with an equaliser of their own after 54 minutes. Making his mark: Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil keeps a close eye on Southampton's Calum Chambers. Tough night: Wenger says the red card was harsh on Flamini as Arsenal drew 2-2. Lallana read Jay Rodriguez’s cut-back and steered Southampton’s equaliser beyond Szczesny. It was a stunning response. Arsenal. poured forward for the winner and Boruc looked beaten when Cazorla’s. chip was somehow deflected on to the top of the crossbar. Szczesny. rescued Arsenal again when he tipped Fonte’s effort around the post. three minutes from time. It was another escape. Flamini, who will start. his ban on Sunday against Palace, was nowhere near as lucky. Start of Saints' march: Fonte enjoys opening the scoring against Arsenal.

The first question, \\"Why can't India also adopt the 2-child policy throughout the nation since India is going to be the most populous country by 2022?\\" is asking if it would be possible or beneficial for India to implement a 2-child policy, given the impending status of being the most populous country. The assumption in this question seems to be that such a policy might be helpful in managing population growth for India and improving socio-economic challenges related to overpopulation. Theories behind implementing a 2-child policy in India might include potential benefits such as reducing the overall population growth, managing resource distribution, and increasing the quality of life for citizens. However, there are also concerns and challenges in implementing such a policy. Some of these concerns might include: 1. Cultural and religious beliefs: India is a culturally and religiously diverse country. Imposing a 2-child policy might seem restrictive and insensitive to different family structures and beliefs, which value larger families. 2. Socio-economic inequalities: A 2-child policy might also disproportionately impact lower-income and rural communities, leading to further socio-economic disparities. 3. Gender-biased sex selection: India has a history of skewed sex ratios, driven in part by cultural preferences for male children. Imposing a 2-child policy might exacerbate this issue if families opt for gender-biased sex selection, resulting in a further imbalanced sex ratio and potential social problems. 4. Ethical and human rights concerns: Enforcing a 2-child policy might lead to concerns about invasive enforcement measures, such as forced sterilizations, unwanted abortions, or penalties for non-compliance, which could infringe on personal freedoms and human rights. The second question, \\"China recently claimed that its one-child policy was a success. Should India also adopt a one-child policy? And does such a policy violate human rights in any manner?\\" is asking whether India should consider following China's example of a one-child policy and if there are potential human rights concerns with implementing such a policy. China's one-child policy, which was enforced from 1979 to 2015, aimed to curb its population growth. While it did lead to a substantial population reduction, it has been criticized for its adverse effects on society. Some of these effects included a gender imbalance, violations of human rights, an aging population, and a dwindling workforce. Introducing a one-child policy in India might have similar negative consequences and unintended side effects. Alongside, it may also be seen as a violation of human rights. Forced population control policies can result in forced abortions, forced sterilizations, and human rights violations, as well as mismanagement by local government officials. Human rights groups have accused China's former one-child policy of causing various abuses and violations, which could occur in India if a similar policy was implemented. Considering these factors and potential consequences, it is clear that the two questions have distinct implications and focus on different aspects of population control policies for India. Therefore, the answer is (a). no, they do not have the same meaning."},{"prompt":"Question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: Where do commuters usually move quickly?

Choose from: a). go inside because of the rain; b). enjoy the sunshine; c). get the winning goal;","completion":"Based on the given context, Cameron and his friends are likely to do the following: b). enjoy the sunshine. As mentioned, Cameron and his friends decided to play soccer outside because of the nice weather. This indicates that they are taking advantage of the pleasant conditions and making the most out of their time outdoors. Enjoying the sunshine is the most plausible option here, as it aligns with their reasons for being outside in the first place. While options a) and c) could be potential outcomes, they do not appear to be consistent with the context provided. Going inside because of the rain (a) would contradict the information about the nice weather, which was the main motive for the group to be outdoors. Furthermore, getting the winning goal (c) focuses on a specific event during the soccer game and is not necessarily related to the group's activities apart from playing soccer itself. So, apart from playing soccer, the group will likely continue to engage in other outdoor activities to make the most of the sunny day. They might decide to have a picnic, engage in other sports or recreational activities, take a walk around a park, or simply spend time together socializing. Such activities would not only help them enjoy the beautiful weather but also provide a good opportunity to bond with their friends and create lasting memories."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But as a lifelong resident, I’ve started to feel that many once-accessible pleasures—a museum visit, dinner at a nice (not even four-star!) restaurant, a set at a jazz club—have gotten out of reach. So I don’t take advantage of the city’s charms as much as I’d like. And when I do splurge, I often end up feeling that the expense just wasn’t worth it. With one exception. Over the past decade, I’ve managed to see dozens and dozens of plays. Most cost less than 50—and many have been inexpensive as 10 or even free—thanks to the magic of theater subscriptions. While the particulars vary, typically these programs require an upfront membership fee, usually between 50 and 150, which entitles the subscriber to a season’s worth of tickets (3+ productions) at a substantial discount. (Some places let you advance-purchase the entire slate.) This hasn’t necessarily saved me money in the long run—after all, I probably wouldn’t have purchased individual tickets for every production I ultimately attended. But it has benefited me in other ways. For one thing, I get to feel good about supporting a local cultural institution. Theater companies, like most arts organizations these days, are struggling. Subscribers assure a steady stream of income. But more than that, it has allowed me the thrill of discovery. Because subscribers commit to shows as much as a year in advance, we never know exactly what we’re going to get. Often we’re seeing new plays and works-in-progress, being performed in front of an audience for the first time. Sometimes they are surprising and exciting; one in every batch is usually a clunker. But that’s the beauty of it: You put yourself in the artists’ collective hands and hope for the best. That was my attitude a few years ago when I sat down for a little show called “Hamilton.” Back in 2014, it had not yet grown into the juggernaut that it is today. Last week the producers announced they were raising the top ticket price to 849. Brokers are selling seats for the final performances before creator and star Lin-Manuel Miranda leaves the show in July for as much as 10,000. The ticket price when I saw the show as part of my subscription to the Public Theater: 50. And that’s a big part of why I keep plunking down my subscription fee year after year. Because you never know when the next “Hamilton” will come along. Write a title for it.","completion":"\\"Discovering the Magic of Theater Subscriptions: Affordable and Exciting Experiences in New York City\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Frederick himself lost half his army in the Battle of Kunersdorf (now Kunowice Poland), the worst defeat in his military career and one that drove him to the brink of abdication and thoughts of suicide.

The idea that Earth is a magnet is far from new. It was first proposed in 1600 by a British physician named William Gilbert. Knowing it acts like a magnet is one thing. Knowing why it acts like a magnet is more difficult. In fact, finding out why is a fairly recent discovery. To find out why required new technology. It was the seismograph that made it possible to learn why the Earth acted like a magnet. Seismograph are used to study earthquakes. By studying earthquake waves they were able to learn about Earths interior. They discovered that Earth has an inner and outer core. The outer core consists of liquid metals, mainly iron and nickel. Scientists think that Earths magnetic field is generated here. It is caused by the motion of this liquid metal. The liquid metal moves as Earth spins on its axis.

Write an article that answers the following question: WHAT DETERMINE THE ATOP FOR THE AFC EAST","completion":"Title: Deciphering the AFC East: Factors that Determine the Teams at the Top Introduction When looking at the AFC East Division in the National Football League, it becomes crucial to understand what factors contribute to a team's position at the top. Recent years have seen shifts in the power dynamics, with familiar faces and emerging challengers. But what truly determines success in this division? In this article, we will analyze key factors that have put teams at the top of the AFC East, considering the New England Patriots' past dominance, the Buffalo Bills' resurgence, and other contributing elements. Step 1: Team Talent The most crucial factor in determining any team's success is the talent they possess on their roster. The Patriots, for instance, had two decades of unparalleled success due in large part to the combination of quarterback Tom Brady and head coach Bill Belichick. As a result, the team managed to dominate the division, winning 17 of a possible 20 division titles. Similarly, Buffalo's rise to the top in the 2020 season can be attributed in part to the blossoming of quarterback Josh Allen and the performance of the team's talented wide receivers and defenders. Therefore, the skillset of individual players and coaching staff plays a significant role in determining the team's overall success in the division. Step 2: Coaching and Strategy The impact of coaching and strategic planning cannot be overstated. Effective coaching, game management, and innovative play-calling can often be the difference-maker in close games and challenging situations. As evidenced by the Patriots, a high caliber coaching staff can elevate a team from \\"good\\" to \\"great.\\" In the AFC East, a team that can maintain consistency in coaching and strategy development has a higher chance of staying atop the division. Step 3: Player Development and the Draft Drafting and developing talent through the years can contribute significantly to a team's ability to achieve or maintain divisional success. The ability of a team's front office and scouting department to identify talent in the draft and support player development can make a world of difference. Smart drafting, free agency signings, and trades can all contribute to sustaining or achieving a team's dominance in the AFC East. Step 4: Rival Team Dynamics Having a window of opportunity is essential in the NFL, and the dynamics of rival teams within the division play a role in determining the positions of each team in the AFC East. When key players from successful teams like Tom Brady leave or retire, the door opens for contenders like the Buffalo Bills to rise and seize that power vacuum. Thus, a team's position at the top of the AFC East can be influenced by the shifting tides of competing teams. Step 5: Adaptation and Resilience Lastly, resilience and adaptation are key components of a successful team. Injuries, changes in coaching staff, and other adversities are inevitable during an NFL season. A team's capacity to overcome difficulties and adjust accordingly will significantly impact its ability to remain at the top of the AFC East. Conclusion Ultimately, various factors determine the teams that rise or stay atop the AFC East. Talent, coaching, strategic planning, player development, rival team dynamics, and adaptation all contribute significantly to a team's overall success in the division. As the division's landscape continues to change, analyzing these factors provides us with a deeper understanding of what it takes to conquer the AFC East."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

A 2012 report from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics found that people with a bachelor's degree or higher live about nine years longer than people who don't graduate high school. James Smith, a health economist at the RAND Corporation, is also a supporter of the argument for staying in school for better life expectancy. His findings show education should be an even bigger factor than race and income. Educated people are more likely to land better jobs, plan for their future, and make healthier lifestyle choices. Being a hard worker doesn't necessarily mean job-stress will harm you. The Longevity Study found that plenty of hard workers lived long lives. \\"Skeptics may wonder if hard workers really are enjoying life.\\" the authors write, \\"We found that productive, hardworking people (even in old age) are not stressed or miserable, but tend to be happier, healthier, and more socially connected than their less productive peers.\\" Having a strong social group is associated with a longer life. We often turn to friends and family for support, and taking care of the people that matter to us may help us take better care of ourselves, some evidence shows. Some research even suggests that immune function is improved when we are around our friends, and that they help with stress management. Research shows that sitting for long period of time put people at risk for shorter lifespans and other health risks. A 2011 study found that each hour people spent sitting down and watching TV after...

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which entity is this text about? Alice Cooper (born Vincent Damon Furnier; February 4, 1948) is an American singer, songwriter, and actor whose career spans over fifty years. With his distinctive raspy voice and a stage show that features guillotines, electric chairs, fake blood, deadly snakes, baby dolls, and dueling swords, Cooper is considered by music journalists and peers alike to be \\"The Godfather of Shock Rock\\". He has drawn equally from horror films, vaudeville, and garage rock to pioneer a macabre and theatrical brand of rock designed to shock people. Originating in Phoenix, Arizona, in the late 1960s after he moved from Detroit, Michigan, \\"Alice Cooper\\" was originally a band consisting of Furnier on vocals and harmonica, lead guitarist Glen Buxton, Michael Bruce on rhythm guitar, Dennis Dunaway on bass guitar, and drummer Neal Smith. In 1964, 16-year-old Furnier was eager to participate in the local annual Cortez High School Letterman's talent show, so he gathered four fellow cross-country teammates to form a group for the show: Glen Buxton, Dennis Dunaway, John Tatum and John Speer. They named themselves the Earwigs. They dressed up in costumes and wigs to resemble the Beatles, and performed several parodies of Beatles songs, with the lyrics modified to refer to the track team: in their rendition of \\"Please Please Me\\", for example, the line \\"Last night I said these words to my girl\\" was replaced with \\"Last night I ran four laps for my coach\\". Of the group, only Buxton knew how to play an instrument--the guitar--so Buxton played guitar while the rest mimed on their instruments. The group got an overwhelming response from the audience and won the talent show. As a result of their positive experience, the group decided to try to turn into a real band. They acquired musical instruments from a local pawn shop, and proceeded to learn how to play them, with Buxton doing most of the teaching, as well as much of the early songwriting. They soon renamed themselves the Spiders, featuring Furnier on vocals, Buxton on lead guitar, Tatum on rhythm guitar, Dunaway on bass guitar, and Speer on drums. Musically, the group was inspired by artists such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Who, the Kinks, the Doors, and the Yardbirds. For the next year the band performed regularly around the Phoenix area with a huge black spider's web as their backdrop, the group's first stage prop. In 1965, the Spiders recorded their first single, \\"Why Don't You Love Me\\" (originally performed by the Blackwells), with Furnier learning the harmonica for the song. The single's B-side track was the Marvin Gaye Tamla Records hit \\"Hitch Hike\\". The single was released by local record label Mascot Records, owned by Jack Curtis, a concert promoter who also owned the Stage 7 teen club, which later became the VIP Club where the Spiders were the house band. In 1966, the Spiders graduated from Cortez High School, and after North High School football player Michael Bruce replaced John Tatum on rhythm guitar, the band released their second single, \\"Don't Blow Your Mind\\", an original composition which became a local #1 hit, backed by \\"No Price Tag\\". The single was recorded at Copper State Recording Studio and issued by local micro-imprint Santa Cruz Records. By 1967, the band had begun to make regular road trips to Los Angeles to play shows. They soon renamed themselves Nazz and released the single \\"Wonder Who's Lovin' Her Now\\", backed with future Alice Cooper track \\"Lay Down and Die, Goodbye\\". Around this time, drummer John Speer was replaced by Neal Smith. By the end of the year, the band had relocated to Los Angeles.","completion":"This text is about Alice Cooper, an American singer, songwriter, and actor whose career spans over fifty years.

Lindsay Lohan was taken into custody at the end of Friday's hearing in her necklace theft case after the judge sentenced her to 120 days in jail for violating her drunk driving probation. The actress was expected to post a 75,000 bond at the jail and be freed. The judge granted the bond after her lawyer filed a notice of appeal. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner also ordered Lohan to serve 480 hours of community service, including 360 hours at a downtown Los Angeles women's center. Sautner suggested Lohan might behave better after seeing \\"how truly needy women and women who have fallen on real hard times have to live.\\" She must complete another 120 hours of community service at the Los Angeles County morgue. The judge also ruled Friday that the necklace theft case against Lohan will go forward to trial, but the felony charge was reduced to a misdemeanor. \\"I'm going to give her an opportunity,\\" Sautner said. Sautner did not buy the defense argument that Lohan accidentally walked out of a Venice, California, jewelry store wearing a necklace that later appeared around her neck in photographs taken five days later. \\"If in fact it was an accident, she could have called the store back,\\" Sautner said. Defense attorney Shawn Holley argued that Lohan was busy and scattered when she was at the store and absent-mindedly walked out with the necklace. \\"It's undisputed that Ms. Lohan walked out of the store with the necklace on,\\" Holley said. The prosecution must show she had \\"specific intent to permanently deprive the store of that necklace.\\" \\"I see the intent here and the level of brazenness to say 'Let me see what I can get away with here,' \\" Sautner said. A police detective testified that Lohan's assistant handed the necklace to a police officer after learning through a website posting that police had obtained a search warrant hours earlier to search for it in her home. Prosecutor Danette Meyers argued that \\"it doesn't take a rocket scientist\\" to realize Lohan returned the necklace to police because she knew her home was about to be searched. Lohan's trial date was set for June 3, but she must return to court for a hearing May 11, the judge said. A misdemeanor could still result in up to a year in prison for Lohan. Before delivering the good news to Lohan about the reduction of the charge, the judge addressed her much-publicized misbehavior. \\"She thumbs her nose at the court,\\" Sautner said, referring to an incident with another judge last year. \\"She walks into court with 'F U' on her fingernails. I don't know what that means unless it has 'I am' before it.\\" The jeweler who accused Lohan of stealing the gold and diamond necklace testified Friday that she had not gotten any money from selling the security camera video of the actress in her store. Kamofie and Company owner Sofia Kamen was the second witness called by the prosecution in the preliminary hearing. Holley used the the store's licensing of the video, for a reported 40,000, to question Kamen's motives in accusing Lohan of theft. All of the money from the video licensing went to publicist Christopher Spencer, who Kamen said she fired last month because he was negotiating deals for the store that she was not interested in, she testified. Spencer subsequently disputed Kamen's account. Kamen said that she realized the necklace was missing 10 minutes after the actress left the store last January. She wasn't closely watching Lohan, even though there was another incident four days earlier in which the actress almost walked out wearing a diamond earring. \\"We thought it was an accident,\\" Kamen said. \\"We weren't thinking that she would take it.\\" The first prosecution witness was Tinelli Comsooksri, a store employee who was working the day of the earring incident. \\"She was covering the earring that she still left on with her hair,\\" Comsooksri said. She stopped Lohan as she was walking out, Comsooksri said. As prosecutor Meyers held the infamous necklace, now known as \\"People's Exhibit 2,\\" Kamen testified that it was priced at 2,500 although it cost the store only 850. She explained that retail jewelers routinely triple the wholesale price. The value of the necklace was a crucial issue for Lohan for the felony grand theft charge to be reduced to a misdemeanor. Shoplifting offenses are charged as petty theft if the property taken is valued at less than 950. Lohan has been in court nine times in the past year, mostly for hearings related to probation violations for her 2007 drunk driving case. She did a short stint in jail last year, but she also checked into substance abuse rehab twice under court order. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"Lindsay Lohan, a famous actress, got in trouble for taking a necklace from a store without paying. The judge said she broke the rules from an earlier problem when she drove after drinking alcohol. So, the judge told Lindsay she has to spend 120 days in jail, but she could also pay 75,000 to not stay in jail for now. The judge also wants Lindsay to help others by doing 480 hours of community service at a women's center and a place called the morgue. Lindsay has been to court many times before for breaking rules, and she might have to go to jail for up to a year if she's found guilty of this issue with the necklace."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He found it easy to understand their differences by categorizing them. For that, he classified reptiles as class A and amphibians as class B. But I can use this background: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...

Article: Story highlights Investigators have recovered a data recorder from El Faro, the doomed cargo ship that sunk last year, killing 33 U.S. Coast Guard Marine Board of Investigation has been conducting a high-level inquiry into the wreck for months (CNN) The National Transportation Safety Board has recovered the data recorder of El Faro, a ship that sank with all hands on board last year near the Bahamas. Investigators hope to find GPS navigational data and crew communications on the recorder that will give them a window into the final hours of the doomed ship that sunk during Hurricane Joaquin in October. The entire crew, 33 members, went down with the ship. Floating debris from El Faro wreckage \\"The recovery of the recorder has the potential to give our investigators greater insight into the incredible challenges that the El Faro crew faced,\\" said NTSB Chairman Christopher A. Hart. Read More ||||| NEWS BRIEF Late Monday evening, more than 10 months after El Faro sank east of the Bahamas, a crew recovered the vessel’s data recorder, which investigators and family members hope will offer some clues into how and why the cargo ship went down. “The recovery of the recorder has the potential to give our investigators greater insight into the incredible challenges that the El Faro crew faced, but it’s just one component of a very complex investigation,” NTSB Chairman Christopher Hart said in a statement. El Faro’s early October disappearance was unusual, as I reported at the time: Although big ships run aground and even sink, few simply go down, even when sailing through hurricanes, as El Faro was. A U.S. Navy crew found the ship’s wreckage on October 31, and in January, the National Transportation Safety Board released ghostly images of the ship on the ocean floor, under 15,000 feet of water. But the ship’s data recorder, similar to the black box on airplanes, was not found with the vessel. Senator Bill Nelson, the Democrat from Florida, the ship’s home, who sits on the Senate committee that oversees the NTSB, urged the agency to do more to recover the recorder. In April, a new expedition found the recorder near the wreckage. “Finding an object about the size of a basketball almost three miles under the surface of the sea is a remarkable achievement,” Hart said at the time. But it took several more months to mount the expedition to actually retrieve it. The recorder should provide investigators with information about the ship’s course, and it also records communications on the ship’s bridge. NTSB said recorders are required to maintain at least 12 hours of recording, though they sometimes include more. Investigators have also been working to suss out other information about the ship, including touring its sister ship. El Faro was found upright, but the bridge had been ripped off, which experts suggested was a sign of a fast and violent sinking. Beyond the hurricane, there’s been little indication why the ship went down, though lawyers for the families of crew members have sued its owner alleging El Faro was not seaworthy. El Faro’s 33 crew members were killed in the wreck, but only one body was recovered. NTSB said Tuesday it had no further missions planned to the site. “There were no human remains found whatsoever, and no personal effects whatsoever,\\" lead investigator Tom Roth-Roffy told the AP in January. “I think we found one boot.” |||||Summary:","completion":"The National Transportation Safety Board has found a data recorder from a ship called El Faro that sank last year. They are hoping to learn more about what happened by looking at the GPS and listening to any final messages from the crew. The ship sank during a big storm called Hurricane Joaquin and all 33 people on board sadly didn't survive. Finding the recorder will help the investigators understand what challenges the crew faced during the tough storm, and hopefully help to prevent such accidents in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this equation, those terms are 16z and 4z. Add these terms together to find the combined coefficient (that is, the number in front of z) of z. 16z + 4z = (16 + 4)z = 20z Now, the equation becomes: -120 = 20z Step 2: Isolate the variable z We will now isolate the variable z by getting it alone on one side of the equation. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of z, which is 20. -120 ÷ 20 = 20z ÷ 20 Step 3: Solve for z Perform the division operations: -6 = z So, the solution is: z = -6 Now, the value of z in the equation -120 = 16z + 4z is -6."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

First, let's look at the problem: -321*p + 252*p + 759 = 0. We can start by combining the terms with \\"p\\" in them. So -321*p and 252*p are like having -321 apples and then adding 252 apples. That leaves us with -69*p + 759 = 0. It's like you lost 69 of your oranges, but then you found 759 of them. I'm going to make this a bit easier, just like if you want to find your toy car in your room, you wouldn’t want other toys blocking your view. So let's get rid of the +759 from both sides. This won't change the overall value, just like cleaning up your room doesn't make your toy car disappear, it makes it easier to find. So now the equation is -69*p = -759. Almost there! Now we're going to find \\"p\\". P is like the mystery toy we're looking for. We know it's something to do with -69 and -759, but we need to find out exactly what p is. To do this, we do the opposite of multiplication for our -69, which is division. So we divide -759 by -69. If we do that, we find that p = 11.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: Who dissolved the East India Company? is inside the article: The East India Company drove the expansion of the British Empire in Asia. The Company's army had first joined forces with the Royal Navy during the Seven Years' War, and the two continued to co-operate in arenas outside India: the eviction of the French from Egypt (1799), the capture of Java from the Netherlands (1811), the acquisition of Penang Island (1786), Singapore (1819) and Malacca (1824), and the defeat of Burma (1826).From its base in India, the Company had also been engaged in an increasingly profitable opium export trade to China since the 1730s. This trade, illegal since it was outlawed by the Qing dynasty in 1729, helped reverse the trade imbalances resulting from the British imports of tea, which saw large outflows of silver from Britain to China. In 1839, the confiscation by the Chinese authorities at Canton of 20,000 chests of opium led Britain to attack China in the First Opium War, and resulted in the seizure by Britain of Hong Kong Island, at that time a minor settlement.During the late 18th and early 19th centuries the British Crown began to assume an increasingly large role in the affairs of the Company. A series of Acts of Parliament were passed, including the Regulating Act of 1773, Pitt's India Act of 1784 and the Charter Act of 1813 which regulated the Company's affairs and established the sovereignty of the Crown over the territories that it had acquired. The Company's eventual end was precipitated by the Indian Rebellion in 1857, a conflict that had begun with the mutiny of sepoys, Indian troops under British officers and discipline. The rebellion took six months to suppress, with heavy loss of life on both sides. The following year the British government dissolved the Company and assumed direct control over India through the Government of India Act 1858, establishing the British Raj, where an appointed governor-general administered India and Queen Victoria was crowned the Empress of India. India became the empire's most valuable possession, \\"the Jewel in the Crown\\", and was the..., can you guess it ?

At 42, she had never been married, or even seriously dated. All she could think about, night and day, was her ultimate goal. And her dream finally came true, thanks to the death of 74-year-old Porter Strickley. She could not deny that she had learned the job well, working for that old pain-in-the-butt. He was 57 when she interviewed for the position of Assistant District Attorney. At the time, she thought he was 70. Two months ago, she had become the District Attorney. She loved seeing her name on the door. And she felt a rush of adrenaline every time a judge referred to her as 'The District Attorney' in open court. The D.A.'s office would be better than ever--now that she was running the show. There was a soft knock, and Andrea Newly opened the door just enough to peek in. \\"Come in, Andrea.\\" Angela sometimes wondered if she had made a mistake two weeks ago when she hired this timid young lady as her assistant. Angela had been impressed with her resume. But in person, Andrea was quiet, and seemed to be rather intimidated by Angela. But Andrea was enthralled with every word Angela spoke. And the new D.A. couldn't resist the prospect of being god to her assistant. She had hired her on the spot, even though she knew Andrea would stress her patience. But Angela was confident the 25-year-old could be molded into her mentor's image. And thereby, become a powerful force for justice in the D.A.'s office. Andrea took a chair across from the D.A. The furniture in the District Attorney's office was similar to that found in most old government offices-largely unchanged since the 1950s. Yet the hardwood chairs and desks were of such good quality that an exact replacement would be cost prohibitive in today's market. Angela planned to upsize her diminutive desk as soon as possible, even if the money came out of her own pocket. According to the above context, answer the following question.

If She wore nothing but a wrap of skin around her hips., can we conclude that \\"She was naked\\"? Choose from: [a]. yes; [b]. it is not possible to tell; [c]. no;","completion":"[b]. It is not possible to tell; Based on the information provided, we know that \\"she wore nothing but a wrap of skin around her hips.\\" This statement does not give a complete picture of her attire to confidently conclude that she was entirely naked. While this wrap of skin around her hips suggests that her lower body may be partially covered, we cannot determine the exact amount of coverage it provides nor do we have any information about the coverage of her upper body. Nudity typically implies that an individual's body is completely uncovered and unclothed. However, in this context, the woman is wearing a wrap of skin that, although minimal, does provide a certain degree of coverage to a portion of her body. Conversely, if she were genuinely considered naked, no part of her body would be clothed at all. It is important to note that the concept of nudity is culturally specific and can vary significantly from one society to another. Some cultures may perceive wearing a wrap of skin around the hips as near-nakedness, while others may regard it as entirely acceptable and not particularly revealing. In conclusion, without further information about the extent of the coverage provided by the wrap of skin or the context in which this observation is being made, it is not possible to tell for sure if she was genuinely naked or not."},{"prompt":"Question: Generate a question that has the following answer: massie for the following movie plot: Massie (Elizabeth McLaughlin), Dylan (Sophie Anna Everhard), Kristen (Bridgit Mendler) and Alicia (Samantha Boscarino) are the most popular girls at Octavian Country Day, calling themselves the Pretty Committee.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: There are two basic ways to see growth: one as a product, the other as a process. People have generally viewed personal growth as a result or product that can easily be identified and measured. The worker who gets a rise, the student whose grades improve, the foreigner who learns a new language--all these are examples of people who have measurable results to show for their efforts. By contrast, the process of personal growth is much more difficult to determine, since it is a journey and not the specific signposts or landmarks along the way. The process is not the road itself, but rather the attitudes and feelings people have, their caution or courage, as they meet with new experiences and unexpected obstacles . In this process, the journey never really ends; there are always new ways to experience the world, new ideas to try, new challenges to accept. In order to grow, to travel new roads, people need to have a willingness to take risks, to face the unknown, and to accept the possibility that they may \\"fail\\" at first. How we see ourselves as we try a new way of being is extremely important to our ability to grow. Do we notice ourselves as quick and curious? If so, then we tend to take more chances and to be more open to unfamiliar experiences. Do we think we're shy and indecisive? Then our sense of fear can cause us to hesitate, to move slowly, and we think we're slow to adapt to change or that we're not smart enough to deal with a new challenge. Then we are likely to take a more passive role or not try at all. These feelings of insecurity and self-doubt are both unavoidable and necessary if we are to change and grow. If we protect ourselves too much, then we stop growing. We become trapped inside a shell of our own making. Question: How do you understand the last sentence of this passage? Options: A: We are trapped and injured. B: Our body is trapped and stops growing. C: We get stuck in what we are doing and can not achieve real growth. D: We can't protect ourselves and are trapped by others. A:","completion":"C: We get stuck in what we are doing and can not achieve real growth."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Question: He was climbing higher and higher, what was he scared of as he got higher?

As the height increases, so does the risk and potential consequences of falling, making this a natural fear to experience during the climb. Other choices like exhaustion, accomplishment, and exhilaration may be emotions or concerns during the climb, but they do not represent a direct fear associated with the height. Eagles, while potentially a concern for a climber, would not necessarily be directly related to the increasing height."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Process: - Air is taken through the mouth - Enters the lungs - The oxygen fills the sacs in your lungs - Carbon dioxide is removed from the lungs and exhaled - The oxygen is pass throughout your body. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose natural disaster caused the chambers to be interrupted happens, how will it affect LESS oxygen reaching the body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"If a natural disaster were to cause an interruption in the chambers (alveoli) of the lungs, it would result in less oxygen reaching the body. This potential perturbation would have both direct and indirect effects on the process. Direct effect: A disruption in the alveoli would mean that the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs would be impaired. Consequently, the amount of oxygen absorbed into the bloodstream would be significantly reduced, leading to lower oxygen levels being transported throughout the body. Indirect effect: As a result of the lower oxygen levels in the bloodstream, the body would struggle to produce the necessary energy required for various physiological processes and cellular functions. This could potentially lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, confusion, and even loss of consciousness. In severe cases, the lack of oxygen could be life-threatening, causing damage to vital organs such as the brain and heart. In conclusion, a perturbation resulting in the disruption of the lung's chambers would adversely affect the process of oxygenation in the body, leading to direct and indirect consequences that could be harmful to one's overall health and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Large advance sales guaranteed a considerable run; by the start of November, it had paid back its advance, and closed after 358 performances, paying a small profit to RCA. Thomas Hischak, in his The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia, suggests that business fell off after the advance sales were exhausted \\"because audiences had come to expect more from a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical\\". According to Frederick W. Nolan in his book about the duo's works, \\"despite a 500,000 advance sale, despite a ten-month run (which, for anyone except Rodgers and Hammerstein, would have represented a major success), and despite an eventual profit in excess of 100,000, Me and Juliet has to be classed as a failure\\".The backstage drama portrayed in the musical was matched by actual difficulties among the cast. McCracken, who played Betty, was the wife of choreographer Bob Fosse and became pregnant during the run. Bill Hayes later wrote that she lost her baby through miscarriage about the same time she lost her husband to Gwen Verdon. The baby was in fact aborted, because the pregnancy would have endangered McCracken's health as a result of her diabetes. Hayes noted that in the fifteen months he played Larry, he did not recall ever having a conversation with Isabel Bigley, who was supposedly his love interest and wife: \\"I doubt that the audience ever believed we were deeply in love.\\" The show received no Tony Award nominations. During the run, Hammerstein followed his usual practice of visiting the theatre now and again to ensure that the performers were not taking liberties with his book. Upon his return, Hammerstein's secretary asked him how the show was going.

Multi-choice problem: Based on the sentence \\"woman sitting on couch with chocolate\\", is the sentence \\"Woman sitting with chocolate.\\" a true sentence? Select from the following. + yes; + it is not possible to tell; + no;","completion":"The correct answer is \\"yes\\". The statement \\"Woman sitting with chocolate.\\" is indeed a true sentence based on the initial sentence, \\"Woman sitting on couch with chocolate.\\" Although the second sentence lacks the detail about the woman sitting on a couch, it still maintains the essential elements of the situation involving a woman sitting and there being chocolate present. The phrase \\"Woman sitting with chocolate\\" can be interpreted as a woman seated, having chocolate with her; regardless of her exact location, which could be a couch, chair, bench, or floor. The initial statement does specify the location as a couch, but the locale isn’t the primary focus of the situation or condition described. Although the second sentence has less detail, it isn't necessarily denying or contradicting any elements of the original sentence; it is more like an abridged version of the same scenario. Therefore, it is accurate to claim the sentence \\"Woman sitting with chocolate\\" as true in terms of the assertion brought up by \\"Woman sitting on couch with chocolate\\". So, when comparing these two sentences and checking to see if the second sentence can be asserted as true based on the initial sentence, the correct choice is \\"yes\\". That's because the second sentence isn't introducing any contradictory details or conditions that would make it false in contrast to the first sentence.

По сути, существует большой риск, что этот законопроект в конечном итоге увеличит дефицит бюджета. Translate this to English?","completion":"In essence, there is a significant risk that this bill will ultimately lead to an increase in the budget deficit. The statement underlines the concern that this particular legislative proposal might have negative consequences for the country's budget by increasing the deficit. A budget deficit occurs when a government's expenditures exceed its revenues, leading to the need for additional borrowing or cutting expenses. This situation can arise due to various reasons, such as implementing new projects, financing social programs, or providing economic stimulus. A budget deficit can have both short and long-term implications for an economy. In the short term, it may be necessary to stimulate growth or address a crisis. However, continually running a budget deficit could result in various economic challenges in the long term, such as higher inflation, increased debt, and lower economic growth. One of the main reasons behind the concern in the statement may be the fear of unsustainable borrowing. Governments often resort to borrowing money to finance their budget deficits, either by issuing government bonds or taking loans from domestic or international institutions. This increase in national debt can put pressure on the economy, as a government needs to allocate more resources to service its debt, which can lead to higher taxes, reduced public spending, or a combination of both. Moreover, an increased budget deficit can potentially lead to higher inflation. When a government resorts to borrowing to fund its expenses, it could increase the money supply in the economy. An increase in the money supply without a corresponding increase in real productive capacity could result in inflation. Persistent inflation can cause several economic challenges, such as eroding the purchasing power of consumers, leading to social unrest, and reducing investment attractiveness. Furthermore, an increased budget deficit might also have an adverse impact on a country's economic growth. When the government continually resorts to borrowing, it can lead to a higher interest rate environment, as the demand for funds in the economy increases. Higher interest rates can discourage private investments, as borrowing becomes more expensive for businesses, ultimately hindering economic growth. In conclusion, the statement points out that the proposed bill carries a considerable risk of ultimately leading to an increased budget deficit, with its attendant issues of unsustainable borrowing, potential inflation, lower economic growth, and social unrest. It is, therefore, crucial for policymakers to carefully consider and weigh the benefits of a proposed bill against its potential long-term ramifications for the country's fiscal and economic health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. We drove about a great deal--the country at the back of Deauville, going away from the sea, is lovely--very like England--charming narrow roads with high banks and hedges on each side--big trees with spreading branches meeting overhead--stretches of green fields with cows grazing placidly and horses and colts gambolling about. It is a great grazing and breeding country. There are many haras (breeding stables) in the neighbourhood, and the big Norman posters are much in demand. I have friends who never take their horses to the country. They hire for the season a pair of strong Norman horses that go all day up and down hill at the same regular pace and who get over a vast amount of country. We stopped once or twice when we were a large party, two or three carriages, and had tea at one of the numerous farmhouses that were scattered about. Boiling water was a difficulty--milk, cider, good bread and butter, cheese we could always find--sometimes a galette, but a kettle and boiling water were entirely out of their habits. They used to boil the water in a large black pot, and take it out with a big spoon. However, it amused us, and the water really did boil. After reading the above, is \\"There is a lot of hay\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Describe what about the area makes this a good place to raise horses?\\"?","completion":"No, the statement \\"There is a lot of hay\\" is not the correct description in response to the question \\"Describe what about the area makes this a good place to raise horses?\\" based on the passage provided. The passage instead highlights several factors that make the area around Deauville a great place for raising horses. First, it is described as a \\"great grazing and breeding country\\", implying plenty of open spaces and potentially good, green pastures for horses to graze on. This would be an important consideration when raising horses, as such an environment would provide them with plenty of space to move around and a natural source of nutrition. Second, the presence of many 'haras' or breeding stables underscore the area's reputation as a suitable environment for horse raising. Horses would be well taken care of in such facilities and likely bred to maintain healthy lineages. Lastly, the text mentions big Norman horses who are strong and can get over a vast amount of country, pointing towards the area's tradition of horse breeding and lending credibility to its suitability for raising horses. One can infer from these points that the area has the ideal natural resources, facility infrastructure, and local expertise for horse-raising activities. It appears that this region has a long-standing culture of horse breeding, further validating its appropriateness as a location for maintaining horses. The absence of any explicit mention of hay - an essential part of a horse's diet - in the descriptive passage indicates that \\"There is a lot of hay\\" would not be a correct or sufficiently grounded response to the question. A more accurate answer, based on the text, would highlight the open grazing fields, established horse breeding facilities, and the local breed of strong Norman horses that populate the country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: The origins of blues are not unlike the origins of life. For many years it was recorded only by memory, and relayed only live, and in person. The blues were born in the North Mississippi Delta following the Civil War. Influenced by African roots, field hollers , ballads, church music and rhythmic dance tunes called jump-ups evolved into a music for a singer who would engage in call-and-response with his guitar. He would sing a line, and the guitar would answer. From the crossroads of Highways 61 and 49, and the platform of the Clarksdale Railway Station, the blues headed north to Beale Street in Memphis. The blues have strongly influenced almost all popular music including jazz, country, and rock and roll and continue to help shape music worldwide. Bad luck and trouble are always present in the Blues. Relentless rhythms repeat the chants of sorrow, and the pity of a lost soul many times over. The blues form was first popularized about 1911-14 by the black composer W.C. Handy. However, the poetic and musical form of the blues first crystallized around 1910 and gained popularity through the publication of Handy's Memphis Blues(1912) and St.Louis Blues(1914). Instrumental blues had been recorded as early as 1913. During the twenties, the blues became a national craze. Mamie Smith recorded the first vocal blues song, Crazy Blues in 1920. In the early 1960s, the urban bluesmen were \\"discovered\\" by young white American and European musicians. Many blues-based bands brought the blues to young white audiences. Since the sixties, rock has undergone several blues revivals. Some rock guitarists have used the blues as a foundation for offshoot styles. The latest generation of blues players like Robert Cray and the late Stevie Ray Vaughan, gracing the blues tradition with their incredible technicality , have drawn a new generation listeners to the blues. Answer:","completion":"Question: What can be inferred about the development and influence of blues music from its origins in North Mississippi Delta to its impact on popular music? A) Blues was initially an isolated genre, not impacting other music styles. B) The blues found its roots in a mixture of African influences, field hollers, ballads, church music, and dance tunes. C) Blues emerged in the 1960s and had little impact on rock and roll. D) W.C. Handy composed the first blues song in the early 20th century, but blues music only started gaining popularity in the 1960s. Correct answer: B) The blues found its roots in a mixture of African influences, field hollers, ballads, church music, and dance tunes. Explanation: The article states that the blues were born in the North Mississippi Delta following the Civil War, and was influenced by African roots, field hollers, ballads, church music, and dance tunes. The blues then went on to strongly influence popular music, including jazz, country, and rock and roll, which contradicts options A and C. While W.C.

Plot title: The Iron Giant Movie plot: In 1957, a large alien robot crashes from orbit near the coast of Rockwell, Maine with no memory. Shortly after, the Iron Giant wanders off into the mainland. Nine-year-old Hogarth Hughes follows a trail of the forest's destruction and frees the robot, who is stuck in the power cables of an electrical substation. After being rescued by and befriended by Hogarth, the Giant follows him back to his house, where he lives with his widowed mother Annie. Upon their return, the Giant attempts to eat the rails off the ties of the nearby railroad tracks. Alarmed by the sound of an oncoming train, Hogarth tells the giant to repair the tracks. The Giant attempts this, but takes too long, causing the train to collide with his head. Hogarth hides the damaged robot in their barn where he discovers the robot is self repairing.Later that night, Hogarth returns to the barn with a stack of comic books to read to the Giant. The Giant is impressed with Superman, but distressed when he discovers a comic about an evil robot; Hogarth tells the Giant that he can be \\"who you choose to be\\". Investigating the destroyed substation, U.S. government agent Kent Mansley discovers evidence of the Giant and decides to continue his inquiries in nearby Rockwell. Finding a BB gun Hogarth left near the substation the night he found the Giant, Mansley takes up a room for rent at Hogarth's home and trails the boy to learn more. He is paranoid about an alien invasion and alerts the U.S. Army to the possible presence of the Giant.

Some of the earliest recorded observations ever made through a telescope, Galileo's drawings on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613, contain plotted points that match up with what is now known to be the position of Neptune. On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky; hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope. In July 2009, University of Melbourne physicist David Jamieson announced new evidence suggesting that Galileo was at least aware that the 'star' he had observed had moved relative to the fixed stars.

However, as mentioned in the information above, Galileo himself seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when observing its position close to Jupiter. It was later with the advancements in astronomy and the eventual discovery of Neptune in 1846 by the collective efforts of Johann Gottfried Galle, Urbain Le Verrier, and John Couch Adams that astronomers began to understand that the celestial object Galileo once observed was not a fixed star, but actually a planet, Neptune.

Title: Blind Faith Movie plot: In Toms River, New Jersey, the Marshalls â Rob (Urich) and Maria (Kerns), and their three sons, 18-year-old Roby (Barry Gray), 17-year-old Chris (Jay Underwood) and 12-year-old John (Johnny Galecki) â are an apparently happy family living the American Dream. But in September 1984, Maria is shot and killed, and Rob claims she was murdered by a robber while he was changing a flat tire. When the police commence their investigations, however, they discover unsettling truths about the Marshalls: Rob has secretly accumulated an enormous debt and has secured a second mortgage of 100,000 in Maria's name, and is having an affair with a married neighbor, Felice Richmond (Robin Strasser). Maria had known of the affair, and had considered divorce but decided to work on their marriage shortly before she was killed. Felice gives the police a statement that Rob wanted to get rid of his wife to collect on her life insurance, and he immediately becomes the prime suspect. At first, Rob's friends and sons support him. But they begin to notice that he does not seem to be in mourning over Maria's death, and Rob's best friend Sal (Joe Spano) is angry that he is more interested in building a future with Felice. Rob is advised by his lawyer not to contact Felice because it could influence his image; this troubles Rob, who is deeply in love with her. Meanwhile, the police have expanded their list of suspects to include Andrew Meyers (Jake Dengel), a Louisiana shop clerk who had contact with Rob concerning his financial problems, and Arnie Eggers, a rumored hitman. As all evidence seems to point to Rob, Felice breaks off their relationship, which leads him to unsuccessfully attempt suicide in a motel. By this point, Chris admits for the first time that he suspects his father might in fact be guilty. Roby and John are both shocked to hear this, strongly believing in their father's innocence.

This high-profile legal battle has shed new light on the numerous legal issues surrounding online gambling and its impact on both the finance and gaming industries. Read on to understand the intricacies of this case and the possible consequences of the founder's guilty plea. Background: Neteller is a prominent online money transfer service that has grown tremendously since its launch in 1999. By offering users secure, convenient, and speedy transactions across various online platforms, it carved a niche for itself in the e-commerce world. However, its role in facilitating online gambling turned out to be a double-edged sword and ultimately embroiled its founder in a significant legal battle. The Case: In 2007, US prosecutors charged the founders of Neteller, Stephen Eric Lawrence and John David Lefebvre, with handling illegal gambling transactions. The duo faced multiple charges, including conspiracy to commit money laundering, operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, and the facilitation of unauthorized gambling. Given the opacity of international online gambling platforms, the US authorities struggled for years to gather enough evidence for a successful prosecution. However, once prosecutors did attain sufficient evidence, the case turned into a landmark legal battle and a rare conviction for such offenses. Guilty Plea: After years of legal proceedings, Stephen Eric Lawrence, one of Neteller's founders, finally pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiring to promote illegal gambling. By admitting guilt, Lawrence sought a reduced sentence from the court. However, his admission also signifies that he might face considerable fines and further legal ramifications. Impact on Neteller and Regulatory Measures: This high-stakes legal battle has had broad implications for Neteller and the online gambling landscape as a whole. Due to the prosecution, the company was forced to cease its services to the US online gambling market. The case was also pivotal in pushing various governments and financial institutions to implement stricter regulatory measures for online gambling and money transfer services. Neteller's case served as a wake-up call for businesses in the online gambling industry, particularly payment service providers. Many companies have revamped their operations in light of this case, with several withdrawing from the US market to comply with American anti-gambling laws. Furthermore, the regulatory environment for online gambling has tightened, leading to more scrutiny over transactions and the identification of customers. Financial authorities worldwide are now cracking down on payment services that ignore their legal responsibilities. Consequently, financial institutions and e-wallet providers have become more cautious about their partnerships in the gambling industry, focusing on transparent, legitimate, and law-abiding practices to avoid severe penalties. Conclusion: The guilty plea of Neteller's founder in this major online gambling case sends a crucial message to the bustling online gambling world. It accentuates the importance of adhering to laws and regulations, even when operating in an international context. By taking note of this case and the growing scrutiny over online gambling, stakeholders in the industry can adapt their business models, minimize legal risks, and maintain long-term sustainability in a rapidly changing regulatory landscape. The tightening of regulations might ultimately lead to a more responsible, safe, and transparent online gambling industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions. Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric.

Using sheer brute force and shovels at times, teams worked in cramped and often challenging conditions four metres below the streets of east London to clear the congealed waste, which was made up of oil, wet wipes and other sanitary products. The clearing process took longer than first expected due to the damage to the one metre high egg-shaped sewer caused by the fatberg. Thames Water waste network manager, Alex Saunders, said: \\"Our work is finished, and the beast finally defeated after a mammoth effort from the team. \\"It was some of the most gut-wrenching work many would have seen on national television, and one of the reasons why the man-made Whitechapel fatberg captured the world’s imagination.\\" \\"The good news is it has helped Thames Water and other water companies around the world get the message across that cooking fat, oils and grease should never go down the plughole. \\"As you have seen, when combined with wet wipes, sanitary products, underwear, nappies, and anything else that shouldn’t be flushed, we’re faced with having to clear out these giant, rock-hard fatbergs.\\" (Image: Thames Water) Andy Brierley, director of Lanes Utilities, Thames Water’s wastewater network services maintenance partner, even likened it to a Harry Potter experience. He said: \\"Nailing this fatberg was like battling a giant Harry Potter movie creature beneath the streets of London. \\"Around each sewer corner we discovered a new fatberg challenge. \\"We’re immensely proud of the team effort made to get the job done.\\" (Image: Thames Water) Every month Thames Water spends around £1 million clearing blockages from its 68,000 mile sewer network. Their \\"Bin it – don’t block it\\" message encourages people to avoid putting things like cooking fat, oil, food waste, wet wipes and make-up pads down the toilet or drain. According to Thames Water, eight times an hour a customer suffers a blockage caused by items being put down the drain or flushed away which shouldn't be.

It took nine weeks for Thames Water to blast and hack away at the ghastly blockage, which was longer than two football pitches. The last stretch needed brute force and shovels to dismantle the \\"rock hard\\" fatberg and it was \\"gut-wrenching work\\", said Thames Water's Alex Saunders. It formed under the streets of Whitechapel, east London, damaging the one-metre-wide sewer as it grew. Eight people used high-powered jet hoses to break up the 250m fatberg before sucking it out of the sewer and into tankers. Image: Fatberg fighters: Two workers celebrate their victory.

The message is 'Bin it - don't block it', and Thames Water is reminding people that \\"poo, pee and toilet paper are the only things that should ever be flushed down the toilet\\". Cooking fat, oil and grease should also not be poured down the plughole. Instead, water companies recommend using something like an old jam jar or butter tub to collect it when cooled, before emptying it into the rubbish.

Please answer the following question: Sinkholes are formed by precipitation, and rain is also known as precipitation. Given these facts, what can rain cause among the following options: - volcanoes - flooding - desert - Condensation - Sinkholes - Dehydration - erosion - cloud formation Answer:","completion":"Rain, as a form of precipitation, can directly or indirectly contribute to several phenomena among the options provided: 1. Flooding: This is the most direct result of excessive rain. When too much rain falls in a short period of time (such as in a heavy storm or hurricane), it can overwhelm local bodies of water and drainage systems, causing them to overflow and flood the surrounding areas. 2. Sinkholes: These are often caused by the erosion of soluble rocks, such as limestone or dolomite, beneath the ground. Rainwater, especially when it's more acidic, can seep into the ground and dissolve these types of rocks over time, creating cavities that may eventually collapse and form sinkholes. 3. Erosion: Rain, particularly when it's heavy or prolonged, can cause the erosion of soil, rocks, and other materials on the Earth's surface. This can result in landslides, loss of fertile topsoil, and other types of land degradation. 4. Cloud formation: Rain doesn't directly cause cloud formation, but it's a part of the same cycle. Water on the Earth's surface (including rain that has fallen) evaporates due to the Sun's heat, rises, cools, and condenses to form clouds in the atmosphere. When the cloud droplets become too large, they'll fall as rain, completing the cycle. Among the phenomena listed, rain does not cause volcanoes, desert conditions, condensation (although it's part of the bigger cycle where condensation occurs), or dehydration (rain adds moisture to ecosystems, not remove it)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

King Tutankhamen Artifacts A traveling exhibition of artifacts from the tomb of King Tutankhamen, popularly known as \\"King Tut\\", toured the United States from November 1976 to April 1979. The 55 objects were shown in six cities and were seen by around eight million museum-goers. The second touring exhibit was started in 2007, this time with 130 artifacts and stops in London and three different American cities. However some objects, like the king's golden face mask, are too valuable or too delicate to be transported long distances, so \\"replicas\\" (exact copies of something) are on show. Japanese Color Woodblock Prints The Art Museum at University of Virginia, in Charlottesville, Virginia, has an extraordinary collection of Japanese color woodblock prints . These prints document the period from about 1850 to 1900, a time when Japan was opening itself to Western influences. Before this point, Japan was a closed society that had little communication with the world outside of its borders. These works of art beautifully show the feeling of change and the trend toward modernization. The museum has put together a traveling exhibition of 60 of these prints, which can be borrowed and exhibited worldwide for periods of eight weeks or more. Face-to-face with \\"Lucy\\" One of the world's most famous archaeological finds in history are the 3.2 million-year-old bones of a 106-centimeter-tall female found in the Ethiopian desert in 1974. Lucy, a name given to her by the discovery team, is a \\"hominid\\", or a creature that scientists believe is the earliest ancestor of modern human beings.

He has seven overbearing sisters who ridicule and emotionally abuse him regularly and leads a lonely life punctuated by fits of rage and anguish. In the span of one morning, he witnesses an inexplicable car accident, picks up an abandoned harmonium from the street, and encounters Lena Leonard, a coworker of his sister's, Lena having orchestrated this meeting after seeing him in a family picture belonging to his sister Elizabeth. Coping with his loneliness, Barry calls a phone-sex line, but the operator attempts to extort money and sends her four henchmen, who are brothers, to collect. This complicates his budding relationship with Lena, as well as his plan to exploit a loophole in a Healthy Choice promotion and amass a million frequent flyer miles by buying large quantities of pudding. After Lena leaves for Hawaii on a business trip, Barry decides to follow her. He arrives and calls one of his manipulative sisters to learn where Lena is staying. When his sister starts abusing him again, Barry snaps and demands she give him the information, which she does. Lena is overjoyed to see Barry, and they later have sex. At first, Barry explains that he is in Hawaii on a business trip by coincidence, but he soon admits that he came only for her. The romance develops further, and Barry finally feels some relief from the emotional isolation he has endured. After they return home, the four brothers ram their car into Barry's, leaving Lena mildly injured. With his new-found freedom from loneliness in jeopardy, a surprisingly aggressive and poised Barry adeptly fights off all four of the goons in a matter of seconds, using a tire iron as a weapon.

I'm looking for paper on which to note down the name of a book I am recommending to my mother. Over forty years since my earliest memories of the kitchen pad and pencil, five houses later, the current paper and pencil look the same as they always did. Surely it can't be the same pencil? The pad is more modern, but the wooden stand is definitely the original one. \\"I'm just amazed you still have the same stand for holding the pad and pencil after all these years.\\" I say to her, walking back into the living-room with a sheet of paper and the pencil. \\"You still use a pencil. Can't you afford a pen?\\" My mother replies a little sharply. \\"It works perfectly well. I've always kept the stand in the kitchen. I never knew when I might want to note down an idea, and I was always in the kitchen in those days.\\" Immediately I can picture her, hair wild, blue housecoat covered in flour, a wooden spoon in one hand, the pencil in the other, her mouth moving silently. My mother smiles and says, \\"One day I was cooking and watching baby Pauline, and I had a brilliant thought, but the stand was empty. One of the children must have taken the paper. So I just picked up the breadboard and wrote it all down on the back. It turned out to be a real breakthrough for solving the mathematical problem I was working on.\\" This story--which happened before I was born--reminds me how extraordinary my mother was, and is, as a gifted mathematician. I feel embarrassed that I complain about not having enough child-free time to work. Later, when my mother is in the bathroom, I go into her kitchen and turn over the breadboards.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: The film begins with self-help author Wes Wilson who has recently come out with his first best selling book. At the after-party, he meets up with an attractive woman named Samantha. They flirt, and he proposes publicly. He introduces her to his agent, who tries to talk Wes into writing a sequel. Wes dismisses the agent and takes Samantha to his car to leave the party early. They are attacked in the parking lot, and Samantha is knocked out and kidnapped. Time passes slowly for Wes, who is haunted by his inability to save her. At a book signing, however, Wes also encounters Nicole, a young woman who says she is a reporter. He goes to her house for an interview, and they bond, and he enters into a relationship with her. A few more months pass and Wes and Nicole become a happy couple. Suddenly a mysterious man named Isaac who Wes had met before at the book signing, shows up and demands to know where some diamonds are. Wes runs away, and Isaac's main henchman Boone and another give chase. Wes is kidnapped as a result along with Nicole and Isaac orders him to go to some bank and empty the contents of a safety deposit box which could be the diamonds themselves. Wes finds a briefcase and then he and Nicole are released. To Isaac's surprise, there is only a stuffed toy in the briefcase and he resumes his hunt for the diamonds. Eventually, Wes gets back to his apartment, only to find Samantha there to his shock and surprise. She apologizes and tells Wes she stole the diamonds from Isaac and that Isaac won't stop until they are dead and he has the diamonds but Wes is still heartbroken that she would betray him like that as he felt guilty for not being able to help her and believed that she was dead for so long. Samantha also tells him that Nicole wants the diamonds as well and tells him to meet her under a bridge. Just then, one of Isaac's henchmen shows up, and Samantha kills him after much effort.

Is the superfluid dark matter proposed by Justin Khoury what ripples when Galaxy clusters collide and what waves in a double slit experiment? Does dark matter ripple when galaxy clusters collide and wave in a double slit experiment? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"To answer these questions, I’ll take a step by step approach: 1. Understand the concepts involved in the questions: - Superfluid dark matter: A model proposed by Justin Khoury that explains dark matter as a superfluid. - Ripples: Refers to the disturbances or fluctuations caused in a medium when something is observed or passed through it. - Galaxy clusters collide: When two or more galaxy clusters come into contact, resulting in a massive interaction of their dark matter. - Double slit experiment: A famous physics experiment that demonstrates the wave-particle duality of particles like electrons and photons, which shows an interference pattern when they pass through two slits. 2. Break down the first question: - The question asks if superfluid dark matter proposed by Justin Khoury is what ripples when galaxy clusters collide and waves in a double slit experiment. 3. Analyze the first question: - The question is pointing towards the nature of dark matter in two different scenarios – galaxy cluster collisions and the double slit experiment, asking if the superfluid dark matter is responsible for observed fluctuations in these scenarios. 4. Break down the second question: - The question asks if dark matter ripples when galaxy clusters collide and wave in a double slit experiment. 5. Analyze the second question: - Similar to the first question, this one also points towards the nature of dark matter in the same two scenarios – galaxy cluster collisions and the double slit experiment, asking if dark matter has characteristics such as rippling and waving in these scenarios. 6. Compare the two questions: - Both questions aim to understand the nature of dark matter in galaxy cluster collisions and the double slit experiment. - The major difference between the two questions is the specification of \\"superfluid\\" dark matter in the first question – which is a specific model of dark matter proposed by Justin Khoury. 7. Evaluate if the two questions are paraphrases: - Both questions are similar, but they are not strict paraphrases of each other. The first question specifically mentions the superfluid dark matter model by Justin Khoury, whereas the second question discusses dark matter in a more general sense. In conclusion, the two questions are related and deal with the characteristics of dark matter in the context of galaxy cluster collisions and the double slit experiment. However, they are not exact paraphrases since one of them specifically refers to the superfluid dark matter model by Justin Khoury, while the other refers to dark matter in a more general sense."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Working alone as a graphic artist, Hartman frequently amused himself with \\"flights of voice fantasies\\". Citing the need for a more social outlet for his talents, Hartman, aged 27, began in 1975 to attend evening comedy classes run by the California-based improvisational comedy group The Groundlings. While watching one of the troupe's performances, Hartman impulsively decided to climb on stage and join the cast. After several years of training, paying his way by re-designing the group's logo and merchandise, Hartman formally joined the cast of The Groundlings; by 1979 he had become one of the show's stars. Hartman met comedian Paul Reubens and the two became friends, often collaborating on writing and comedic material. Together they created the character Pee-wee Herman and developed The Pee-wee Herman Show, a stage performance which also aired on HBO in 1981. Hartman played Captain Carl on The Pee-wee Herman Show and returned in the role for the children's show Pee-wee's Playhouse. Reubens and Hartman made cameos in the 1980 film Cheech & Chong's Next Movie. Hartman co-wrote the script of the 1985 feature film Pee-wee's Big Adventure and had a cameo role as a reporter in the film. Although he had considered quitting acting at the age of 36 due to limited opportunities, the success of Pee-wee's Big Adventure brought new possibilities and changed his mind. After a creative falling-out with Reubens, Hartman left the Pee-Wee Herman project to pursue other roles. In addition to his work with Reubens, Hartman recorded a number of voice-over roles. These included appearances on The Smurfs, Challenge of the GoBots, The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo, and voicing characters Henry Mitchell and George Wilson on Dennis the Menace. Additionally Hartman developed a strong persona providing voice-overs for advertisements. Answer this question \\"What were the possibilities?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"The possibilities mentioned in the text refer to new acting opportunities that emerged for Hartman after the success of Pee-wee's Big Adventure, which convinced him not to quit acting at the age of 36."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: If you choose a title that sounds like it belongs in one genre while the actual content of the story belongs in another, you’ll not only confuse potential readers, you may alienate them. For example, if your title sounds distinctly fantasy-esque, like “The Dragon of the Old Tower,” but the story is in fact about modern-day brokers on Wall Street, you’ll alienate those who pick up your story looking for fantasy and you’ll miss entirely those looking for a story about something modern or about the world of elite finance, etc. In the majority of cases, titles that are brief but impactful are more successful than those that are long and difficult to remember. For example, “A Man Discovers the Perils of a Solo Trek Through the Yukon” is likely less compelling to potential readers than “To Build a Fire,” which is shorter and more imaginative. Titles that use poetic language, vivid imagery, or a bit of mystery tend to be alluring to potential readers. Poetic language in a title, like “A Rose for Emily” or Gone with the Wind, draws readers with an elegant turn of phrase that promises an equally poetic story or writing style. Titles that evoke vivid imagery appeal to readers because they conjure something tangible and meaningful. A title like Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, though long, creates an immediate and vivid image that conjures an idea of a battle between good and evil. Imbuing your title with a bit of mystery can also draw readers in. A title like Something Wicked This Way Comes (also an allusion from Macbeth) or “The Black Cat” give just enough information to raise questions that will pull the reader into the story. Though alliteration--the repetition of successive sounds at the beginning of words--can make a title catchier or more memorable, it can also make it sound trite or hokey if not done well. Subtle alliteration, like I Capture the Castle or The Count of Monte Cristo, can add appeal to a title. Obvious or forced alliteration, on the other hand--like \\"The Guileless Guide of Gullible Gus\\" or \\"The Especially Exciting Endeavors of Elanor Ellis\\"--can easily dissuade a potential reader from picking up your story. Summary:","completion":"Pick a title that matches your story, so you don't confuse or upset readers. Short and interesting titles are usually better than long, hard-to-remember ones. Using pretty words, creating strong pictures, or adding a little mystery can make your title more exciting. Be careful with using the same starting sounds in words because sometimes it can sound too silly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In the given dialogue, both the man (M) and the woman (W) are engaged in a conversation while waiting at the bus stop. The man inquires about the No. 7 bus, and the woman responds that she has not noticed it passing by since she started waiting. She then clarifies that she is also waiting for the No. 7 bus herself. This exchange suggests that the woman's primary objective is to catch the bus, rather than waiting specifically for the man or her mother. The answer choices provided seem to revolve around the woman's motivations for waiting at the bus stop. However, her conversation with the man indicates that the bus, not another individual, is the main reason for her presence there. Neither of the other two alternatives are supported by the dialogue since there is no mention of her waiting for the man or her mother. Instead, the woman shares that she and her mother have recently moved from Indiana, which is a piece of personal information unrelated to her purpose for waiting. In summary, based on the conversation presented in the dialogue, the most accurate response to the question, \\"What is the woman waiting for?\\" would be \\"She is waiting for a bus.\\" This answer is directly supported by the information given in the conversation between the man and the woman, which emphasizes their shared objective of catching the No. 7 bus."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Here are two sentences: In addition , the committee noted , \\" while spending is firming , the labour market has been weakening \\" . \\" The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period confirms that spending is firming , although the labor market has been weakening . Do they have the same meaning?","completion":"Yes, the two sentences convey the same overall meaning but are structured differently and have some variations in the choice of words. Both sentences discuss two primary observations: spending is firming, and the labor market is weakening. Let's analyze each sentence: 1. \\"In addition, the committee noted, 'while spending is firming, the labor market has been weakening'.\\" Here, we have a report on the committee's observation, which is being offered as additional information. The sentence directly quotes the committee, putting their observation in a single statement. They first mention that spending is firming and then discuss the weakening labor market. 2. \\"The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period confirms that spending is firming, although the labor market has been weakening.\\" In this sentence, the focus is on the evidence collected between meetings. The evidence confirms the same observation found in the first sentence: spending is firming, and the labor market is weakening. The word \\"although\\" is used to provide a contrasting point between firming spending and the weakening labor market, showcasing the contradictory nature of these two economic indicators. To summarize, both sentences communicate the same key points: that spending is firming while the labor market weakens. However, the first sentence emphasizes the committee's observation as additional information, while the second sentence highlights the supporting evidence collected over a specific time frame. Additionally, the first sentence uses \\"while\\" to present both points simultaneously, whereas the second sentence employs \\"although\\" to highlight the contrast between the two points.

Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question Why is the family so excited ?","completion":"It is not explicitly mentioned in the passage that the family is excited, but one can infer that the family may be excited or particularly fond of their cat named Blue for several reasons. 1. Unique name: The cat's name is Blue, which is an unconventional name and reflects the distinctiveness of the cat. The family chose the name because of his blue eyes, which later changed to green. This could be a reason why the family is excited, as the transformation of Blue's eye color adds a unique element to his appearance. 2. Physical features: Blue is described as a normal-sized cat with grey fur and black stripes. His appearance may be aesthetically pleasing and attractive, which could be another reason for the family's excitement. His coloration and markings could make him stand out as an endearing pet. 3. Affectionate behavior: When Blue gets petted, he does \\"a really weird flipping thing,\\" which implies that he enjoys being petted and displays his affection in a unique way. The fact that he interacts differently when being shown love and attention may be a source of excitement for the family members, as his behavior adds an element of interaction and fun to their experience with the cat. 4. Cuddly nature: The passage mentions that Blue sleeps a lot and has already \\"mussed up\\" the person's jeans, implying that the cat is cuddly and enjoys snuggling. People generally find this quality endearing in pets, and it may contribute to the family's excitement as it shows the closeness and trust Blue has developed with them. 5. Emotional attachment: The family may be excited simply because they have developed a strong emotional bond with Blue. Pets have a unique ability to provide companionship, comfort, and emotional support to their owners. These factors, combined with Blue's distinctive features and behavior, might contribute to making the family excited and delighted to have him as a part of their lives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It's the most striking image of Columbo I've seen: the view is from inside the darkness of the cupboard where the victim was murdered, and into the room beyond, which is lit up by daylight. Columbo is sitting in a high-backed armchair facing the doorway (and us), contemplating the cupboard, and almost in silhouette due to the contrast in light. There's no sound. The camera slowly moves out of the room and up towards him. He's deep in meditation, puffing gently on a cigar, swirls of smoke from the cigar circling slowly upwards as he thinks.

This involves recognizing the inherent therapeutic elements present in the process of consuming tea and the symbolic significance it carries in various cultures and households. This process will involve a combination of common personal experiences mixed with scientific and cultural references. 1. Providing Comfort: Tea, due to its warmth and variety of flavors, often provides comfort. It can create a sense of calmness, relax the mind and reduce distress. In tough or problem-filled times, this perception of relaxation and comfort might help one feel that the problem is less overwhelming. 2. Facilitating Reflection: The ritual of drinking tea can allow for quiet moments of reflection. This reflective practice might help one to find solutions to problems. Relaxing with a cup of tea can promote mindfulness which potentially allows focus on the present problem and may aid in setting a path to solving it. 3. Enhancing Social Interactions: Often, tea is consumed in a communal setting. Sharing a cup of tea with family or friends can lead to discussions. In such scenarios, one can discuss problems, share concerns and receive advice, which could lead to problem-solving. 4.

Premise: \\"He is able to see the world as it is.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"He can see the real world.\\" true? OPT: * yes. * it is not possible to tell. * no.","completion":"Based on the premise \\"He is able to see the world as it is,\\" the hypothesis \\"He can see the real world\\" is most likely true. Let us break down and discuss both the premise and the hypothesis to better understand the relationship between them. Premise: \\"He is able to see the world as it is.\\" This premise implies that the individual in question possesses the capability to perceive the world without distortion or fabrication. It suggests that this person can discern the truth about the environment and situations they encounter. This ability could stem from various factors, including their personal experiences, observational skills, logical reasoning, or heightened intuition. The premise gives us a strong indication that this individual holds a realistic understanding of the world and is not swayed easily by misrepresentation or deception. Hypothesis: \\"He can see the real world.\\" The hypothesis postulates that the individual can perceive the world in its genuine state or form. In other words, the person is not fooled or misled by false or distorted representations of reality. The hypothesis aligns with the premise in asserting that the individual has the capacity to discern the truth about their surroundings. Therefore, they can distinguish the real world from illusions, misunderstandings, or misperceptions. Now, when comparing the premise to the hypothesis, both statements appear to be suggesting the same idea: this individual is able to perceive the world accurately, without being deceived by false or distorted versions of reality. The key to understanding the congruence between the premise and the hypothesis lies in the assumption that \\"seeing the world as it is\\" equates to \\"seeing the real world.\\" However, it is essential to mention that the provided premise and hypothesis do not offer information regarding the extent or limitations of the individual's perception. For example, we cannot deduce from the given statements whether the individual can perceive all truths about the world or only specific aspects. Nevertheless, since the premise indicates that the individual can see the world as it is, and the hypothesis states that they can see the real world, we can infer that there is a strong likelihood that the hypothesis is true. In conclusion, given the available information from the premise, the best option would be to assert that the hypothesis \\"He can see the real world\\" is likely true. This is because both the premise and the hypothesis emphasize the individual's ability to perceive reality in an accurate, undistorted manner. While it is essential to consider potential limitations and nuances in the individual's perception, the overall relationship between the premise and the hypothesis supports a strong likelihood of their congruence and truth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him.

Charles Taze Russell was born to Scottish-Irish parents, immigrant Joseph Lytel Russell (d. December 17, 1897) and Ann Eliza Birney (d. January 25, 1861), on February 16, 1852 in Allegheny, Pennsylvania. Russell was the second of five children, of whom two survived into adulthood. His mother died when he was 9 years old. The Russells lived for a time in Philadelphia before moving to Pittsburgh, where they became members of the Presbyterian Church. With the formation of the Watch Tower Society, Russell intensified his ministry. His Bible study group had grown to hundreds of local members, with followers throughout New England, the Virginias, Ohio, and elsewhere. They annually re-elected him \\"Pastor\\", and commonly referred to him as \\"Pastor Russell\\". Congregations that eventually formed in other nations also followed this tradition. In 1881, Russell published his first work to gain wide distribution: Food for Thinking Christians. The 162-page \\"pamphlet\\" was published using donated funds amounting to approximately 40,000 (current value 1,014,345). It had a circulation of nearly 1.5 million copies over a period of four months distributed throughout the United States, Canada and Great Britain by various channels. During the same year he published Tabernacle and its Teachings which was quickly expanded and reissued as Tabernacle Shadows of the \\"Better Sacrifices\\", outlining his interpretation of the various animal sacrifices and tabernacle ceremonies instituted by Moses. Russell claimed that the distribution of these works and other tracts by the Watch Tower Society during 1881 exceeded by eight times that of the American Tract Society for the year 1880. In 1903, newspapers began publishing his written sermons. These newspaper sermons were syndicated worldwide in as many as 4,000 newspapers, eventually reaching an estimated readership of some 15 million in the United States and Canada. In 1910 the secular journal Overland Monthly calculated that by 1909, Russell's writings had become the most widely distributed, privately produced English-language works in the United States. It said that the entire corpus of his works were the third most circulated on earth, after the Bible and the Chinese Almanac. In 1912 The Continent, a Presbyterian journal, stated that in North America Russell's writings had achieved a greater circulation \\"than the combined circulation of the writings of all the priests and preachers in North America.\\" Russell also had many critics, and he was frequently described as a heretic in this period.

She soon discovers that the victim, Cisco, was an ex-U.S. Army officer who had been stationed at a nearby military base. As Sarah digs deeper into Cisco's past, she learns about his secret connection to the local Sioux tribe. Known for his genuine respect for the tribe's customs and heritage, Cisco had been working to preserve their sacred lands from being exploited by a wealthy and unscrupulous land developer, Vincent Harker. Unfortunately, his efforts made him an enemy of not only Harker but also a few rogue military personnel who were assisting Harker in his pursuit. Sarah finds an unlikely ally in the Sioux tribe's chief, John White Feather, who reveals that his people have long been aware of a lost ancient artifact hidden within their lands. This artifact, when discovered, would grant immense power and wealth to whoever possesses it. Harker and his military accomplices have been ruthlessly searching for this lucrative prize, leading them to conspire against Cisco. Driven by her thirst for the truth, Sarah convinces White Feather to help expose Harker and the corrupt military operatives. Together, they assemble a team of skilled individuals, including former military personnel and local Sioux members, to retrace the final days of Cisco's life. Through a series of flashbacks, they piece together the events leading up to his murder. In the movie's climax, Sarah's investigative prowess and White Feather's leadership bring them face-to-face with Harker and the treacherous U.S. Army officers.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Senate Blocks Bill to Eliminate Tax Breaks for Oil Companies WASHINGTON — The Senate on Tuesday blocked a Democratic proposal to strip the five leading oil companies of tax breaks that backers of the measure said were unfairly padding industry profits while consumers were struggling with high gas prices. Senate pages delivered charts about tax breaks for oil companies to the chamber on Tuesday. Democrats sought to eliminate five tax breaks, producing an estimated 21 billion over 10 years. Despite falling eight votes short of the 60 needed to move ahead with the bill, top Democrats said they would insist that eliminating the tax breaks to generate billions of dollars in revenue must be part of any future agreement to raise the federal debt limit. “We have to stand up and say, ‘Enough is enough,’ ” said Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota. “While oil prices are gouging the pocketbooks of American families, these companies are on a pace for a record profit this year.” The defeat on Tuesday was expected since most Republicans were dug in against what they saw as a politically motivated plan in advance of the 2012 elections. Democrats had hoped that directing the savings toward the deficit would make it harder for Republicans to reject it. In the 52-to-48 vote, 3 Democrats joined 45 Republicans in opposing the bill, which was supported by the Obama administration and fiscal watchdog groups that saw the tax help for the oil industry as wasteful. Forty-eight Democrats, two independents and two Republicans backed it. Energy-state Democrats criticized the initiative, saying it was misdirected and would do nothing to ease gasoline prices and could cost American jobs. “Why are we harming an industry — five large oil and gas companies that work internationally, that employ 9.2 million people in the United States directly?” asked Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana. “Why are we doing it?” Republicans, who on Wednesday will push their own plan to open more areas to oil drilling and speed government permits, said the Democratic proposal would contribute to higher prices and increase dependence on foreign oil even though a recent Congressional Research Service report predicted any impact on prices would be negligible. “Clearly, this is not a serious effort to address the price of gas at the pump,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader. Under the proposal, Democrats would have eliminated five different tax breaks enjoyed by the multinational oil companies, producing an estimated 21 billion over 10 years. More than 12 billion would have come from eliminating a domestic manufacturing tax deduction for the big oil companies, and 6 billion would have been generated by ending their deductions for taxes paid to foreign governments. Critics suggest that the companies have been able to disguise what should be foreign royalty payments as taxes to reduce their tax liability. The bill would also deny the companies the ability to deduct some intangible drilling and development costs. The bill would have applied to BP, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips. The White House lent strong support to the effort though the president in the past has recommended applying revenue generated by ending the tax breaks to the development of alternative energy sources. “The administration believes that, at a time when it is working with the Congress on proposals to reduce federal deficits, the nation cannot afford to maintain these wasteful subsidies,” the White House said. Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat and majority leader, portrayed the vote as one that revealed the values of Republicans. “Instead of defending oil companies, Republicans should be defending the American taxpayer,” Mr. Reid said. “We believe this is the kind of wasteful spending that will lead to an agreement on reducing the debt.” While most Republicans have opposed eliminating the tax breaks as a back-door tax increase, some, including Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the Budget Committee chairman, have indicated a willingness to consider the idea. Also on Tuesday, Senate Democrats wrote to the Federal Trade Commission seeking an inquiry into whether domestic oil refiners had reduced production to drive down the gasoline supply and drive up prices. “This is just another piece of the puzzle that we need to get at as we try to take away taxpayer subsidies to Big Oil and hold Big Oil accountable for whatever may be going on in the supply chain that is hurting the families that I work for,” said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri. Summary:","completion":"The Senate has blocked a Democratic proposal to remove tax breaks for the top five oil companies, arguing that the tax advantages are unfairly increasing industry profits while Americans face high gas prices. The bill aimed to eliminate five tax breaks, estimated to produce 21 billion over a decade. Despite the setback, top Democrats plan to push for the removal of these tax breaks in future federal debt limit negotiations. Critics of the Democratic proposal argued that it would have no impact on easing gasoline prices and could lead to job losses."},{"prompt":"Question: The answer to the question: What are the names of the two military high schools? is inside the article: In 2007, there were about 4,350 schools, about half of which were primary schools; on average, each school had 688 students. In recent years, Istanbul's educational system has expanded substantially; from 2000 to 2007, the number of classrooms and teachers nearly doubled and the number of students increased by more than 60 percent. Galatasaray High School, established in 1481 as the Galata Palace Imperial School, is the oldest high school in Istanbul and the second-oldest educational institution in the city. It was built at the behest of Sultan Bayezid II, who sought to bring students with diverse backgrounds together as a means of strengthening his growing empire. It is one of Turkey's Anatolian High Schools, elite public high schools that place a stronger emphasis on instruction in foreign languages. Galatasaray, for example, offers instruction in French; other Anatolian High Schools primarily teach in English or German alongside Turkish. The city also has foreign high schools, such as Liceo Italiano, that were established in the 19th century to educate foreigners.Kuleli Military High School, along the shores of the Bosphorus in Çengelköy, and Turkish Naval High School, on one of the Princes' Islands, were military high schools, complemented by three military academies—the Turkish Air Force, Turkish Military, and Turkish Naval Academies. Both schools were shut Darüşşafaka High School provides free education to children across the country missing at least one parent. Darüşşafaka begins instruction with the fourth grade, providing instruction in English and, starting in sixth grade, a second foreign language—German or French.

The Finnish government and major creditors of bankrupt shipyard Waertsilae Marine Industries Oy agreed in principle to form a new company to complete most of the troubled shipyard's backlog of 15 ships. The new company will attempt to limit the shipyard's losses, participants said. \\"The situation is that the bankruptcy court will get out of the shipbuilding business. Everything will be taken over by the new company,\\" said Christian Andersson, executive vice president of Oy Waertsilae, former parent of Waertsilae Marine. Once its ownership is finalized, the new company will open talks with state-appointed receivers to buy or lease Waertsilae Marine's shipyard facilities. Subcontractors will be offered a settlement and a swift transition to new management is expected to avert an exodus of skilled workers from Waertsilae Marine's two big shipyards, government officials said. Under an accord signed yesterday, the government and Union Bank of Finland would become major shareholders in the new company, each injecting 100 million Finnish markkaa (23.5 million). Oy Waertsilae is to contribute 200 million markkaa, most of it as subordinated debt, and take a minority stake in the new company. Customers holding contracts for Waertsilae Marine's undelivered ships are expected to subscribe most of the remaining 170 million markkaa in share capital, government officials said. Waertsilae Marine's biggest creditor is Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. Carnival, which has three ships on order from Waertsilae Marine, presented claims for 1.5 billion damages in the bankruptcy court this week.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the present-day name of the place John Fordun referred to as 'the isle of Irte (insula de Irte), which is agreed to be under the Circius and on the margins of the world'?, using the article: The first written record of St Kilda may date from 1202 when an Icelandic cleric wrote of taking shelter on \\"the islands that are called Hirtir\\". Early reports mentioned finds of brooches, an iron sword and Danish coins, and the enduring Norse place names indicate a sustained Viking presence on Hirta, but the visible evidence has been lost. In the late 14th century John of Fordun referred to it as 'the isle of Irte (insula de Irte), which is agreed to be under the Circius and on the margins of the world'. The islands were historically part of the domain of the MacLeods of Harris, whose steward was responsible for the collection of rents in kind and other duties. The first detailed report of a visit to the islands dates from 1549, when Donald Munro suggested that: \\"The inhabitants thereof ar simple poor people, scarce learnit in aney religion, but M’Cloyd of Herray, his stewart, or he quhom he deputs in sic office, sailes anes in the zear ther at midsummer, with some chaplaine to baptize bairnes ther.\\"Despite the chaplain's best efforts, the islanders' isolation and dependence on the bounty of the natural world meant their philosophy bore as much relationship to Druidism as it did to Christianity until the arrival of Rev. John MacDonald in 1822. Macauley (1764) reported the existence of five druidic altars, including a large circle of stones fixed perpendicularly in the ground near the Stallir House on Boreray.Coll MacDonald of Colonsay raided Hirta in 1615, removing 30 sheep and a quantity of barley. Thereafter, the islands developed a reputation for abundance. At the time of Martin's visit in 1697 the population was 180 and the steward travelled with a \\"company\\" of up to 60 persons to which he \\"elected the most 'meagre' among his friends in the neighbouring islands, to that number and took them periodically to St. Kilda to enjoy the nourishing and plentiful, if primitive, fare of the island, and so be restored to their wonted health and strength.\\", what would be the answer ?

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Why did the Epicureans go against these offices and civil service?\\" Context: \\"The Epicureans and the Cynics rejected public offices and civic service, which amounted to a rejection of the polis itself, the defining institution of the Greek world. Epicurus promoted atomism and an asceticism based on freedom from pain as its ultimate goal. Cynics such as Diogenes of Sinope rejected all material possessions and social conventions (nomos) as unnatural and useless. The Cyrenaics meanwhile, embraced hedonism, arguing that pleasure was the only true good. Stoicism, founded by Zeno of Citium, taught that virtue was sufficient for eudaimonia as it would allow one to live in accordance with Nature or Logos. Zeno became extremely popular, the Athenians set up a gold statue of him and Antigonus II Gonatas invited him to the Macedonian court. The philosophical schools of Aristotle (the Peripatetics of the Lyceum) and Plato (Platonism at the Academy) also remained influential. The academy would eventually turn to Academic Skepticism under Arcesilaus until it was rejected by Antiochus of Ascalon (c. 90 BCE) in favor of Neoplatonism. Hellenistic philosophy, had a significant influence on the Greek ruling elite. Examples include Athenian statesman Demetrius of Phaleron, who had studied in the lyceum; the Spartan king Cleomenes III who was a student of the Stoic Sphairos of Borysthenes and Antigonus II who was also a well known Stoic. This can also be said of the Roman upper classes, were Stoicism was dominant, as seen in the Meditations of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and the works of Cicero.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The Epicureans went against public offices and civil service primarily because they believed in prioritizing individual well-being over involvement in communal life. They focused on atomism and asceticism, with an ultimate goal of achieving freedom from pain. This perspective led them to reject institutions like the polis, as they felt these institutions served as distractions from their pursuit of a life free from suffering. Additionally, their focus on personal happiness and fulfillment was in stark contrast to the duties and responsibilities associated with public offices and civic service, leading them to withdraw from these aspects of society."},{"prompt":"Teacher:In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>.

Jill Reilly and Allan Hall. PUBLISHED:. 04:34 EST, 3 May 2013. |. UPDATED:. 01:58 EST, 6 May 2013. On trial: Beate Zschaepe, 38, has been charged killing nine immigrant businessmen and a policewoman over a 13 year period. A woman dubbed the 'Nazi moll' is standing trial accused of killing ten people after a 13 year reign of terror. Beate Zschaepe, 38, has been charged killing nine immigrant businessmen and a policewoman in Germany. She gave herself to police last year and is said to have told them 'I'm the one you have been looking for,' but has remained tightlipped ever since. Prosecutors say she helped found the National Socialist Underground (NSU) and faces life imprisonment if convicted. She is believed to have been locked in a macabre love triangle with two of her alleged accomplices who were found dead last November. 'Everyone in Germany knows her name but no one knows who she is,' wrote the German daily Die Welt. German police and intelligence. agencies are braced for public fury when their collective failings are. exposed at the country's most scandalous neo-Nazi trial which starts on. Wednesday in Munich. Revelations that a string of unsolved. killings may have been a cold-blooded neo-Nazi campaign against ethnic. Turks have shaken the nation, forcing Germans to confront painful truths. about racism and the broader treatment of immigrants in society. The NSU had allegedly been undetected until Zschaepe blew up her rented flat in eastern Germany a year ago and gave herself up to police. The bodies of her alleged accomplices, Uwe Mundlos, 38, and Uwe Boenhardt, 34, were discovered in a caravan in an apparent double suicide. The case is shaping up as an indictment against the entire German law enforcement establishment, its attitudes to dangerous neo-Nazism and the failings which led authorities to believe that a single racist maniac - dubbed 'The Doner Kebab Killer' because so many victims ran fast-food outlets - was responsible for the assassinations. Her trial will be held in the most heavily guarded courtroom since the cases against the Baader-Meinhof terrorists of the 1970's were heard. Gang: The bodies of her alleged accomplices, Uwe Mundlos, 38, and Uwe Boenhardt, 34, were discovered in a caravan in an apparent double suicide last year. Love triangle: From left Uwe Mundlos, Beate Zschaepe and Uwe Boehnhardt who were all believed to be a macabre love triangle. Charged with participation in all 10 executions, 15 robberies, setting up a terrorist organisation and numerous arsons, Zschaepe could expect, under normal German law, to be out after 15 years if convicted. But prosecutors are seeking to implement the special clause in the national law called 'particularly grievous guilt' which allows the state to incarcerate particularly heinous criminals forever. She is in the dock along with four supporters. It is the biggest terrorism trials ever held in Germany of extreme right-wingers since the post-WW2 republic was formed and security in Munich will be unparalleled. Blown up: The NSU had been undetected until Zschaepe blew up her rented flat in eastern Germany a year ago and gave herself up to police. Sewers have been sealed to prevent bombs being placed near the court, snipers will be on rooftops and police leave throughout Bavaria has been cancelled. Zschaepe, idolised by Norwegian mass-killer Anders Breivik who wrote to her advising her to use her trial to spread 'right-wing propagnada,' is branded by Germany's federal prosecutor Harald Range as being at the heart of planning and carrying out the murders. But the trial is about so much more than her - it is about the deep national sense of shame in police failings to stop the NSU, which was composed of Zschaepe and two male sidekicks who were also her lovers. No link was ever made between the group and the killings, despite a vast covert intelligence network. Victims: Enver Simsek, Abdurrahim Ozudogru, Suleyman Taskopru, Habil Kilic and police woman Michele Kiesewetter and bottom from left : Mehmet Turgut, Ismail Yasar, Theodorus Boulgarides, Mehmet Kubasik und Halit Yozgat. It has led to charges that certain police and intelligence chiefs wanted to protect the NSU because they admired them, although claims of a conspiracy have been fiercely rejected. The group was supported by a loose network of crazed neo-Nazis who dreamed of a Fourth Reich. During the killings no claim of responsibility was ever made; the group hoped that the randomness of the murders would strike fear into Germany's immigrant population who would begin leaving en-masse. They went underground in 1998 and lived from the proceeds of bank robberies across the country. The cell imploded on November 4 2011 when her male accomplices Uwe Mundlos and Uwe Boehnhardt botched a bank raid. Grief: Ismail Yozgat , right, and Ayse Yozgat left, pray at a memorial event on the seventh anniversary of the murder of their son Halit, who was killed by the NSU terror group, in Kassel, Germany (file photo) Remembrance: A monument to commemorate the victims of the NSU terror group is pictured in Nuremberg. In a pre-arranged plan to avoid capture, Mundlos shot his accomplice before turning the gun on himself. Zschaepe, as instructed, blew up their hideout in the east German city of Zwickau. But the blast and subsequent fire failed to destroy a mountain of evidence, including videotapes in which the trio allegedly boasted of their crimes. Days later, as a massive manhunt stretched across the country, she turned herself in. Prosecutor Range, 64, said collating the evidence against her was a 'Herculean task. We collected 6,800 pieces of evidence, mostly from the wreckage of the burned-out house in Zwickau, and questioned about 1,200 witnesses. On our side, 10 public prosecutors ran the investigations, and the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation. 'Their central motive was to unsettle our fellow citizens of foreign origin -- the goal being that they would leave Germany, out of fear for their own safety.' Idolised: Zschaepe, pictured right after her arrest, is idolised by Norwegian mass-killer Anders Breivik who wrote to her advising her to use her trial to spread 'right-wing propagnada' He said it was likely that the murderers were looking to create a 'monument' for themselves with the killings. He said that Zschaepe was involved deeply in the murders. He went on; 'To visualize it, one could say that two people did the killing while the third person stood guard. Not directly at the scene of the crime, but by handling the cover and the logistics. 'By securing the apartment as an indispensable headquarters for the NSU, by cultivating the stories and by handling the group's financial affairs. This is why we see Beate Zschäpe as a full co-perpetrator. She collaborated in all the murders and attacks. 'There are a few clues that are already known. They include her fingerprints on newspaper articles about NSU attacks that were found in the wreckage at the site of the fire in Zwickau. Besides, the police also found many surveillance notes there. To me, this means that she knew what was going on. And there is also witness testimony that places Zschaepe very close to the scene of a crime in Nuremberg. 'She was an active participant in the discussions related to the group's armed conflict, and she was involved in illegal activities with her accomplices for almost 14 years. For that reason, I am convinced that she wasn't just an accessory or merely a companion, but was in fact acting on the same level as the others.' Other controversies than the police bungling are swirling around the trial before the first opening statements. Munich authorities have failed to reserve a single seat for a member of the Turkish media, despite the nationality of most of the victims. This has led to renewed charges of German racism at worst, and indifference at best, to foreigners in the country. The trial will open just days after police discovered a neo-Nazi information service operating in the country's jails seeking to contact NSU members. The network sent coded messages between prisons hidden in letters and the classified ads sections of magazines. Again, the news seems to have failed to reach any outrage gene among Germans, who still break out in a cold sweat about left-wing violence.","completion":"1.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the kidneys are not functioning efficiently happens, how will it affect more carbon dioxide occurs. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation of inefficient kidney function does not have a direct effect on the process of air pollution or the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. However, there is an indirect connection between kidney health and environmental factors like air pollution. Kidneys are responsible for filtering waste products and excess fluids from the blood, maintaining the electrolyte balance, and regulating blood pressure. When the kidneys are not functioning efficiently, these waste products can accumulate in the body, causing various health issues. Air pollution and increased carbon dioxide levels can contribute to worsening air quality and, as a result, negatively impact overall human health. While air pollution does not directly cause kidney dysfunction, long-term exposure to poor air quality can increase the risk of developing chronic kidney diseases (CKD). In this context, the perturbation of inefficient kidney function is more of a potential consequence of air pollution rather than a contributor to the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. To summarize, the perturbation of inefficient kidney function does not directly or indirectly contribute to the process of air pollution or the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. However, it is important to consider the potential negative health effects of air pollution on the kidneys and other organs in the human body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Imperial Tobacco was one of the biggest employers in Nottingham, with its factories producing more than one million cigarettes a day and employing up to 7,000 people at its peak in the 1930s. The Horizon factory closure resulted in the loss of about 500 jobs. The auctioneer, John Pye & Son, mentioned that some of the iconic lots would remain local as bidders from Nottinghamshire won them. Another auction is planned in the coming months to sell the plant machinery and tooling from the site."},{"prompt":"Question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In a fairy tale, Princess Moanna, whose father is the king of the underworld, visits the human world, where the sunlight blinds her and erases her memory. She becomes mortal and dies. The king believes that eventually, her spirit will return to the underworld and so, builds labyrinths around the world in preparation for her return. In post-Civil War Spain in 1944 (after Francisco Franco has come into power), protagonist Ofelia travels with her pregnant but sickly mother Carmen, to meet Captain Vidal, her new stepfather. Vidal, is the son of a famed commander who died in Morocco, believes strongly in Falangism, and has been assigned to hunt down republican rebels. A large stick insect, which Ofelia believes to be a fairy, leads Ofelia into an ancient stone labyrinth, but she is stopped by Mercedes, Vidal's housekeeper, who is secretly supporting the rebels. That night, the insect appears in Ofelia's bedroom, where it becomes a fairy and leads her through the labyrinth. There, she meets the faun, who believes she is the reincarnation of Princess Moanna. He gives her three tasks to complete in order for her to acquire immortality. Meanwhile, Vidal murders two local farmers detained (erroneously) on suspicion of helping the rebels. Ofelia completes the first task -- retrieving a key from the belly of a giant toad -- but becomes worried about her mother, whose condition is worsening. The faun gives Ofelia a mandrake root, which eases Carmen's illness. Accompanied by three fairy guides, Ofelia then completes the second task -- retrieving a dagger from the lair of the Pale Man: a child-eating monster. Although she was warned not to consume anything there, she eats two grapes, awakening the Pale Man. He eats two of the fairies and chases Ofelia, but she manages to escape. Infuriated at her disobedience, the faun refuses to give Ofelia the third task. Vidal tortures a captive rebel, and then kills Doctor Ferreiroâwho is also a rebel collaboratorâafter he euthanized the tortured prisoner. Vidal catches Ofelia...

It is the smallest and highest-pitched instrument in the family in regular use. Smaller violin-type instruments are known, including the violino piccolo and the kit violin, but these are virtually unused in the 2010s. The violin typically has four strings tuned in perfect fifths, and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings, though it can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers (pizzicato). Violins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres. They are most prominent in the Western classical tradition and in many varieties of folk music. They are also frequently used in genres of folk including country music and bluegrass music and in jazz. Electric violins are used in some forms of rock music; further, the violin has come to be played in many non-Western music cultures, including Indian music and Iranian music. The violin is sometimes informally called a fiddle, particularly in Irish traditional music and bluegrass, but this nickname is also used regardless of the type of music played on it. - The Grateful Dead was an American rock band formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California.

Article: What a Scientist Is Like If you were asked to imagine a scientist, what image would come to your mind? The common idea that most kids from kindergarten through college have of a scientist is a man wearing a white lab coat with messy hair, big glasses, and several glass cups of mysterious color1ful liquids giving off clouds of smoke. As for adults, the majority view scientists as strange people who spend 100 hours a week slaving away in a lonely laboratory. However, the reality is quite different. Recently I've had a chance to take part in a scientific experience far from my laboratory and into Costa Rica. It supports a huge amount of wildlife due to its geographical placement between North and South America. It is home to more than 500,000 species ,which represents nearly 4% of the total species worldwide! First we worked alongside conservationists to preserve wildlife at a leatherback turtle ( )rescue center. We helped the volunteers preserve turtle populations by removing rubbish from the shoreline to create a safe environment for turtle eggs to come out. After that we stayed at Mount Arenal where we studied seismic activity relating to earthquakes. During our stay at Arenal, we rode over the mountainous areas and took a long walk through the rainforest. After reaching the top, we went down and through waterfalls to the beautiful valley below! On the last day we got a hands-on introduction to rocket science where we learned about new rocket technology that will be used on the international space station. During my Costa Rica experience, I know that being a scientist doesn't mean working in a lab all day and night. A scientist is one who loves learning and getting a better understanding of the world from helping preserve wild-life, learning about earthquakes or inventing rockets. I think that schools should really stress that science is so much more than wearing a lab coat and mixing chemicals. Kids need to be aware of the excitement and adventures science can bring!

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I read this background article the other day: Sugaring is a food preservation method similar to pickling. Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses. The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites. A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant. I am facing a new situation today: Dan and Joey bot got into sugaring fruit and veggies, as they are vegan. Dan candied apples, pears, plums and quince. Joey candied ginger, peaches, pineapple and oranges but had some humidity in the room the fruit didn't turn out right. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which fruit had a longer shelf life because of better preservation, apples or peaches? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the specific situation with Dan and Joey, it can be concluded that the apples, which were candied by Dan, had a longer shelf life because of better preservation as compared to the peaches candied by Joey. There are a few factors that contribute to this conclusion. First, sugaring is a food preservation method that involves dehydrating the food and packing it with pure sugar. The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment that is hostile to microbial life, which in turn helps prevent food spoilage. Since both apples and peaches were preserved using the sugaring method, we would need to consider other factors affecting the preservation process to determine which fruit had a longer shelf life. One important factor to consider is the humidity level in the room where the fruits were being preserved. As mentioned in the background article, a risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture, and once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. In the case of Joey, who candied the peaches, there was humidity in the room, which could have led to an increase in moisture levels and the potential for fermentation to occur. Fermentation itself can be used as a food preservation method, but it needs to be intentionally controlled to yield pleasant results. Since Joey had humidity in the room where he was preserving the peaches, it is likely that the environment was not optimal for the sugaring process, and it could have led to an unintentional fermentation or other undesirable outcomes, negatively affecting the shelf life of the peaches. On the other hand, Dan, who candied the apples, didn't face any issues with humidity, so it is safe to assume that the apples were preserved in a more controlled environment, which minimizes the risk of unintentional fermentation and maximizes the effectiveness of the sugaring process. Consequently, the apples likely had a longer shelf life due to better preservation. In conclusion, the apples that were preserved by Dan had a longer shelf life because of better preservation as compared to the peaches preserved by Joey. The main factor influencing this difference was the presence of humidity in the room where Joey was preserving the peaches, which could have led to an increase in moisture levels and the potential for fermentation to occur, thus reducing the shelf life of the peaches."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Advertisement Continue reading the main story WASHINGTON — The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday put in place a major new policy to phase out the indiscriminate use of antibiotics in cows, pigs and chickens raised for meat, a practice that experts say has endangered human health by fueling the growing epidemic of antibiotic resistance. This is the agency’s first serious attempt in decades to curb what experts have long regarded as the systematic overuse of antibiotics in healthy farm animals, with the drugs typically added directly into their feed and water. The waning effectiveness of antibiotics — wonder drugs of the 20th century — has become a looming threat to public health. At least two million Americans fall sick every year and about 23,000 die from antibiotic-resistant infections. “This is the first significant step in dealing with this important public health concern in 20 years,” said David Kessler, a former F.D.A. commissioner who has been critical of the agency’s track record on antibiotics. “No one should underestimate how big a lift this has been in changing widespread and long entrenched industry practices.” Photo The change, which is to take effect over the next three years, will effectively make it illegal for farmers and ranchers to use antibiotics to make animals grow bigger. The producers had found that feeding low doses of antibiotics to animals throughout their lives led them to grow plumper and larger. Scientists still debate why. Food producers will also have to get a prescription from a veterinarian to use the drugs to prevent disease in their animals. Federal officials said the new policy would improve health in the United States by tightening the use of classes of antibiotics that save human lives, including penicillin, azithromycin and tetracycline. Food producers said they would abide by the new rules, but some public health advocates voiced concerns that loopholes could render the new policy toothless. Health officials have warned since the 1970s that overuse of antibiotics in animals was leading to the development of infections resistant to treatment in humans. For years, modest efforts by federal officials to reduce the use of antibiotics in animals were thwarted by the powerful food industry and its substantial lobbying power in Congress. Pressure for federal action has mounted as the effectiveness of drugs important for human health has declined, and deaths from bugs resistant to antibiotics have soared. Under the new policy, the agency is asking drug makers to change the labels that detail how a drug can be used so they would bar farmers from using the medicines to promote growth. The changes, originally proposed in 2012, are voluntary for drug companies. But F.D.A. officials said they believed that the companies would comply, based on discussions during the public comment period. The two drug makers that represent a majority of such antibiotic products — Zoetis and Elanco — have already stated their intent to participate, F.D.A. officials said. Companies will have three months to tell the agency whether they will change the labels, and three years to carry out the new rules. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story Additionally, the agency is requiring that licensed veterinarians supervise the use of antibiotics, effectively requiring farmers and ranchers to obtain prescriptions to use the drugs for their animals. “It’s a big shift from the current situation, in which animal producers can go to a local feed store and buy these medicines over the counter and there is no oversight at all,” said Michael Taylor, the F.D.A.’s deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine. Some consumer health advocates were skeptical that the new rules would reduce the amount of antibiotics consumed by animals. They say that a loophole will allow animal producers to keep using the same low doses of antibiotics by contending they are needed to keep animals from getting sick, and evading the new ban on use for growth promotion. More meaningful, said Dr. Keeve Nachman, a scientist at the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future, would be to ban the use of antibiotics for the prevention of disease, a step the F.D.A. so far has not taken. That would limit antibiotic uses to treatment of a specific sickness diagnosed by a veterinarian, a much narrower category, he said. Another skeptic, Representative Louise M. Slaughter, a Democrat from New York, said that when the European Union tried to stop companies from using antibiotics to make farm animals bigger, companies continued to use antibiotics for disease prevention. She said antibiotic use only declined in countries like the Netherlands that instituted limits on total use and fines for noncompliance. But another longtime critic of the F.D.A. on antibiotics, Dr. Stuart B. Levy, a professor of microbiology at Tufts University and the president of the Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics, praised the new rules. He was among the first to identify the problem in the 1970s. “I’m kind of happy,” he said. “For all of us who’ve been struggling with this issue, this is the biggest step that’s been taken in the last 30 years.” Mr. Taylor, the agency official, said the F.D.A. had detailed what veterinarians needed to consider when they prescribed such drugs. For example, use has to be for animals at risk for developing a specific disease, with no reasonable alternatives to prevent it. “It’s far from being a just-trust-them system,” he said. “Given the history of the issue, it’s not surprising that there are people who are skeptical.” He added that some food producers had already curbed antibiotic use. A spokeswoman for Zoetis, a major drug producer that said it would abide by the new rules, said the new policy was not expected to have a big effect on the revenues of the company because many of its drug products were also approved for therapeutic uses. (Dr. Nachman said that was an indication that overall use might not decline under the new rules.) The Animal Health Institute, an association of pharmaceutical companies that make drugs for animals, said that it supported the policy and “will continue to work with the F.D.A. on its implementation.” The National Pork Producers Council was less enthusiastic, saying, “We expect that hog farmers, and the federally inspected feed mills they purchase feed from, will follow the law.” “It is part of our ethical responsibility to utilize antibiotics responsibly and part of our commitment to public health and animal health,” the council said in a statement. The National Chicken Council said in a statement that its producers already worked closely with veterinarians, and that much of the antibiotics used in raising chickens were not used in human medicine. ||||| Black Angus cattle stand in a pen before being auctioned off at the Muskingum County Livestock Auction in Zanesville, Ohio. (Ty Wright/Bloomberg News) The Food and Drug Administration took steps Wednesday to try to phase out the use of certain antibiotics in livestock and ensure that drugs given to animals on factory farms are prescribed by veterinarians to prevent and treat diseases, rather than merely to boost growth. The agency finalized recommendations asking animal drug manufacturers to voluntarily alter their labels so that farmers would no longer be allowed to use antibiotics merely to make animals grow faster. In addition, the agency wants to curb over-the-counter sales of antibiotics and require farmers to get approval from a veterinarian before administering the drugs to livestock. The announcement, welcomed by representatives of the agricultural industry but panned by some consumer advocates who had hoped for more aggressive action, comes amid growing concern that the widespread use of antibiotics in animals is helping to create resistant “superbugs” that sicken and kill thousands of Americans each year. The vast majority of antibiotics sold each year in the United States — by some estimates as much as 80 percent — are used in agriculture rather than in human medicine. For years, consumer and environmental groups have hounded Congress and the FDA to regulate more stringently the amount of antibiotics given to animals, but the government has done little to forcibly limit the practice. Michael Taylor, the FDA’s top food safety official, said the agency’s action will create significant and meaningful changes to the agriculture industry’s status quo. “There will be fewer approved uses, and the remaining uses will be under tighter control,” Taylor told reporters Wednesday, adding that agency officials decided to make the new recommendations voluntary because they believed it would offer the quickest and most efficient route to altering current practices. “It avoids legalistic, product-by-product regulatory proceedings that would take years to complete.” Companies will have 90 days to say whether they plan to sign on, followed by three years to implement the changes. FDA officials on Wednesday said some of the biggest animal-drug producers have already backed the agency’s plan, and Taylor said he remained confident that more companies soon would follow suit. Public health activists and consumer advocates, who have raised alarms in recent years about the potential consequences of the overuse of antibiotics in animals, praised the FDA for trying to address the decades-old problem of antimicrobial resistance. But they also argued that the agency’s efforts lack teeth, and that companies too easily will be able to ignore or circumvent the new standards. They also said they worried that the policy would allow companies to continue to use the drugs to compensate for cramped and unsanitary living conditions that can foster disease in animals. Rep. Louise M. Slaughter (D-N.Y.), a microbiologist who has unsuccessfully tried to pass legislation limiting the use of certain antibiotics to humans and sick animals, called the agency’s efforts “an inadequate response” that “falls woefully short of what is needed to address a public health crisis.” Avinash Kar, a health attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the policy “an early holiday gift to industry.” “It is a hollow gesture that does little to tackle a widely recognized threat to human health,” Kar said in a statement. “FDA has essentially followed a voluntary approach for more than 35 years, but use of these drugs to raise animals has increased.” Taylor said he understands the strong opinions surrounding the issue and the lingering skepticism about voluntary regulations. “There are a lot of reasons why companies have an incentive to take this action,” Taylor said. He added, “We reserve our ability to take regulatory action.” In a call Wednesday afternoon, representatives from industry lobbying groups such as the Animal Health Institute and the National Pork Producers Council reiterated their support of the FDA’s new policies, which the agency first proposed last year. “It’s going to mean a real change for how antibiotics are used on the farm,” said Liz Wagstrom, chief veterinarian for the NPPC. Richard Carnevale, AHI’s vice president for regulatory, scientific and international affairs, said that even though the new recommendations are voluntary, it makes little sense for companies to try to ignore or avoid them. “They risk the goodwill of their customers, and they risk the potential wrath of the FDA,” he said. Although the problem of antimicrobial resistance has been acknowledged for decades, the overuse of antibiotics in animals has taken on a higher public profile in recent years, as health officials and consumer groups have issued more and more dire warnings about the potential consequences. In September, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an alarming report about the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant infections, which kill an estimated 23,000 Americans each year. While most of those infections arise in hospitals and nursing home settings, officials underscored the massive use of antibiotics in animals as a serious concern. “Resistant bacteria can contaminate the foods that come from those animals, and people who consume these foods can develop antibiotic-resistant infections,” the CDC’s report stated. “The use of antibiotics for promoting growth is not necessary, and the practice should be phased out.” In October, a separate report from the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future found that pharmaceutical and farm lobbies had successfully blocked legislative reforms to the widespread use of antibiotics in U.S. livestock, and the organization said regulation had grown only weaker under the Obama administration. Those findings came five years after a detailed report from a Pew Charitable Trust commission, which found that the constant feeding of antibiotics to animals in order to plump them up and ward off potential disease was making those drugs less and less effective and the bacteria they were meant to treat ever-more resistant to medicines. ||||| The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday started a process of voluntarily phasing out the use of some antibiotics in animals processed for meat.

Darr Beiser, USA TODAY) Story Highlights Experts have long worried about how public health is endangered with overuse of antibiotics Guidelines ask antibiotic makers to voluntarily change labels Some critics of overuse of antibiotics say the FDA's action is long overdue The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday it would begin phasing out the use of antibiotics in animal feed that make animals grow faster on less food, while phasing in requirements for veterinary oversight of the remaining uses of such drugs. The agency said that it was giving drug companies that sell antibiotics for animal feed 90 days to voluntarily rewrite the labels on those drugs. The new labels will say that the antibiotics and antimicrobials can only be used to treat actual illnesses in animals under the supervision of a veterinarian. By volume, three times more antibiotics are sold for use in animals than to treat humans, according to the World Health Organization. Antibiotics and antimicrobials are routinely mixed into the feed of animals such as cows, pigs, chickens and turkeys to make them grow faster and put on more weight with less feed. No one actually knows why antibiotics and antimicrobials made animals grow faster, said William Flynn, deputy director for science policy with the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine. Public health officials have long decried the practice. \\"It is inappropriate to routinely feed antibiotics to healthy animals just because they live in overcrowded conditions that are conducive to the spread of disease,\\" said Gail Hansen, with The Pew Charitable Trusts' human health and industrial farming campaign. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a report in September that said \\"antibiotics should be used in food-producing animals only under veterinary oversight and only to manage and treat infectious diseases, not to promote growth.\\" Decades of scientific research has linked the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in food animals to rising antibiotic resistance in human pathogens. It is a real and growing concern for doctors, said Robert Lawrence, a professor with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. \\"An infection that is now considered relatively easy to treat could once again prove fatal should antibiotics continue to be misused in food animal production and exacerbate this growing public health crisis,\\" Lawrence said. The new FDA guidelines are meant to end the use of drugs that are important to treating humans in animal feed. Once that label change is made voluntarily on a given drug \\"it is a violation of federal law\\" to use that drug in any other way, said Mike Taylor, deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine at the FDA. \\"We believe that this is major step forward in helping to ensure that important antibiotics maintain their effectiveness for the future,\\" Taylor said. This marks a major shift from the current situation, when animal producers \\"can go to the local feed store and buy these products over the counter and there's no veterinary oversight at all,\\" said Taylor. Under the guidelines, the oversight of a veterinarian will be required to prescribe antibiotics that are used on humans to treat sick animals. The two largest producers of these drugs, Zoetis in Florham Park, N.J., and Elanco in Indianapolis, have agreed to change their labels, Taylor said. \\"We expect to see other companies come on board,\\" over the next 90 says, he said. Drugs that will be affected include tetracyclines, penicillin and macrolides such as azithromycin, Flynn said. Classes of drugs that are not used to treat human illness will continue to be available to animal producers to add to feed to increase growth, said Flynn. After three years, the FDA will evaluate how the voluntary label changes have gone and whether further action is warranted, Taylor said. The agency chose to do this as a voluntary request because \\"it avoids the legalistic, product-by-product regulatory proceedings that would take years to complete,\\" Taylor said. The voluntary aspect of the plan troubles Caroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director with the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington, D.C. \\"It requires the drug companies who profit from sales of their drugs to initiate the process,\\" she said. \\"The good news is that the agency has pledged to evaluate levels of compliance and inform the public after 90 days if the drug industry is cooperating with the relabeling effort.\\" Many groups that have long worked to slow antibiotic resistance were cautiously hopeful. \\"We commend FDA for taking the first steps since 1977 to broadly reduce antibiotic overuse in livestock,\\" said Laura Rogers, director of The Pew Charitable Trusts' human health and industrial farming campaign. \\"There is more work to do, but this is a promising start — especially after decades of inaction.\\" \\"It's a good first step down the path toward ending antibiotic overuse in animal agriculture,\\" said Jean Halloran, Director of Food Policy Initiatives for Consumers Union. Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-New York, the only microbiologist in Congress, called the regulation inadequate. \\"Sadly, this guidance is the biggest step the FDA has taken in a generation to combat the overuse of antibiotics in corporate agriculture, and it falls woefully short of what is needed to address a public health crisis.\\" The Keep Antibiotics Working Coalition was happy to see that FDA has released the long-awaited guidelines but \\"our fear, however, is that there will be no reduction in antibiotic use as companies will either ignore the plan altogether or simply switch from using antibiotics for routine growth promotion to using the same antibiotics for routine disease prevention,\\" said the group's Steven Roach. The American Meat Institute, an industry trade group, supported the change. It is \\"consistent with protecting both animal and public health, ensuring the ability to medically treat animals, and maintaining the highest standard of animal welfare practices,\\" said AMI's chief scientist Betsy Booren. The market is already moving in this direction, said Taylor. \\"There are significant animal producers in the animal product who have on their own initiative stopped using these products for production uses.\\" In addition, major food retail chains including McDonalds and Kentucky Fried Chicken now have publicly said that they won't buy meat raised using these medically important growth-promoting antibiotics, he said. It's unclear if the shift will result in higher prices for meat, said Thomas Myers, chief policy officer with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's animal and plant health inspection service. Economists with the agency's Economic Research Service are looking at possible price changes as the new rules are phased in over the next three years, he said.

This is because using too many antibiotics can cause health problems for people. When farmers use these antibiotics, it can make infections harder to treat and even cause some people to get very sick. This new change means that farmers can't use antibiotics just to make animals grow bigger, and they will need a veterinarian's permission to use them to keep the animals from getting sick. This is an important step to help keep people healthy and make sure antibiotics can still work when we need them."},{"prompt":"Q:Question: \\"Which of the following did not use XAML: Jupiter, Silverlight, or Intel?\\" Context: \\"Windows 8 development started before Windows 7 had shipped in 2009.

(CNN) -- A Christian evangelical group said Thursday that a Bible school -- backed by American evangelist Franklin Graham -- was destroyed in the latest bombing raid to hit South Kordofan, an oil-rich Sudanese province that borders the newly created independent country of South Sudan. At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement No injuries were reported. \\"It was a miracle that no one was injured,\\" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. \\"We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,\\" added Graham, son of the famed Rev. Billy Graham. More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported. The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties.

Answer: National park and nature reserve is the area selected by governments or private organizations for special protection against damage or degradation with the objective of biodiversity and landscape conservation. A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? pick from the following. + yes; + no;","completion":"Yes; however, let's explore the topic further for a more detailed and long answer. The process of selecting and designating National Parks varies depending on the country and its specific regulations. Generally, National Parks are chosen by federal, state, or local government agencies or their respective environmental and wildlife departments that are responsible for the management and preservation of natural resources. Here, we will discuss the selection process in three countries - the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. 1. United States In the United States, National Parks are managed by the National Park Service (NPS), which falls under the Department of the Interior. The process of selecting and establishing a National Park typically starts with public interest and advocacy from local citizens, environmental groups, and other stakeholders. They may identify an area with unique natural, historical, or cultural significance that requires protection and preservation. Once there is sufficient public interest and support, the area's potential for National Park designation is assessed through research, ecological surveys, and feasibility studies. If the area meets the criteria, the proposal for a new park is submitted to Congress as a legislative bill, including any land acquisition, boundary adjustments, and resource management plans. In certain cases, the President of the United States can designate a national monument under the Antiquities Act without going through Congress. Some national monuments have later been converted into National Parks through congressional action. 2. Canada In Canada, Parks Canada is the government agency responsible for the establishment, management, and conservation of National Parks. The process begins with identifying an area with ecological, cultural, or historical significance that represents one of Canada's 39 distinct natural regions. A detailed site selection study and consultation process takes place with the involvement of Indigenous communities, governments, stakeholders, and the public to assess the area's suitability, ecological significance, potential visitor experiences, and other factors. If the area fulfills the criteria, Parks Canada submits a proposal for the establishment of a new National Park to the Minister of Environment and Climate Change. The Minister then reviews the proposal, and if approved, it moves forth as a bill in the Parliament of Canada. After the bill is passed, the land is legally designated as a National Park, and a management plan is developed in collaboration with Parks Canada, Indigenous communities, stakeholders, and the public. 3. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, National Parks are managed by different authorities depending on the country (England, Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland). The process of selecting and designating National Parks involves evaluating areas based on the landscape's natural beauty, wildlife, cultural heritage, recreational opportunities, and in some cases, their potential for contributing to sustainable economic development. The relevant national park authority conducts assessments, consultations, research, and prepares a proposal for the designation of a new National Park. The proposal is then submitted to the appropriate government department, such as the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) in England. After thorough review and public consultations, the Secretary of State decides to approve or reject the proposal. If approved, a statutory instrument is signed, and the area becomes a designated National Park. Subsequently, a management plan is developed in collaboration with the National Park Authority, local communities, and stakeholders. In conclusion, the selection of National Parks most often involves government agencies responsible for natural resources, environmental conservation, or wildlife management. The process starts with identifying an area with exceptional significance and involves various steps, including research, assessment, consultations, and legislative approval to establish a designated National Park."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:","completion":"Title: A Day of Sport: Tunisia's Etoile du Sahel and DR Congo's TP Mazembe Play to A Draw Article: Hey, my little friend! Let me tell you a story about a really exciting football (or as some people call it, soccer) game that happened recently between two really good teams. One team is called Etoile du Sahel from a country named Tunisia and the other team is called TP Mazembe from a different country called DR Congo. On a beautiful Saturday, Etoile du Sahel, which is like one of the big stars of their country, were playing at home, means in their own field. Imagine how much fun it might be to play in your own backyard, where you're so familiar with every little corner! Just like that, Etoile du Sahel was excited to have this big game in their homeland, Tunisia. You know how in some games, one person or team visits the other, right? This time, TP Mazembe, a really strong team from DR Congo was the guest team. They traveled all the way to Tunisia (like a long car ride) to play this important game. You can imagine they were excited but also a bit nervous because they were far away from their home. The game was a part of a big competition called the Confederation Cup semi-final. This game was just like the books you read where the characters have to go through many adventures to make it to the final chapter. If the teams win this game, they get to go one step closer to the very end, when one team can be called the winner of the cup. But guess what happened? Both teams played really well, and when the game ended, both had scored 1 goal each. In football, this is called a draw. It's like in a race, if you and your friend are running and reach at the end line at the same time, no one wins or loses, it's a tie. So, our two teams, Etoile du Sahel and TP Mazembe, had a 1-1 draw on that exciting day. This means they'll both have to try their best again in their next game. Because whoever wins the next game, might get a chance to go to the final part of the competition! So, my young friend, that was the exciting story of the football match between Tunisia's Etoile du Sahel and DR Congo's TP Mazembe.

This fact supports the idea that the environment is suitable for holding concerts, specifically during the summer. In the context provided, the acoustics are a critical factor that contributes to the overall experience and success of the concerts held in the caves. On the other hand, the hypothesis posits the complete opposite scenario. It proposes that the acoustics in the caves are terrible to the point that it prevents summer concerts from taking place. In this case, the dismal acoustics would lead to a diminished experience for concertgoers, making the caves an unsuitable venue for concerts. Comparing the scenario in the given premise and the hypothesis, we can immediately observe that they are in direct contradiction. The premise asserts exceptional acoustics and concerts being held in the caves, while the hypothesis suggests that the acoustics are too poor to facilitate such events. Based on the information we have, the exceptional acoustics enable the summer concerts to be held in the caves.

That makes it 200 cheaper than Facebook's rival Oculus Rift and 400 less than HTC's Vive. The PlayStation VR is seen as less advanced than its two rivals, but many experts think it will outsell them. However, the disclosure that it will not be released until October means Sony will fail to meet its earlier target of the first half of 2016. The Japanese company also revealed that it expects more than 50 games tailored to its headset will be available at its launch. It made its announcement in San Francisco to coincide with the city's Games Developers Conference. Retailers have confirmed that the UK price - which includes the VAT sales tax - will be £350. Virtual reality involves a user's vision being filled with computer-generated images or 360-degree views of stitched-together videos, which move as they tilt and angle their head. When done well, this results in the wearer feeling as if they are present within the environments they are looking at, delivering a more engaging experience than a TV or monitor. The research firm IHS has forecast that about 53 million people will own a PlayStation 4 console - which is required to use the new PlayStation VR - by the end of this year. It predicts 1.6 million people will buy Sony's headset before 2017 and that the biggest limit on sales will be the speed at which it can manufacture the device. \\"When Oculus and HTC announced their relative headset pricing, Sony was offered an open goal opportunity to take an early lead in the consumer VR market, which it has taken with aplomb,\\" said IHS analyst Piers Harding-Rolls. \\"Sony's walled garden approach to the PS4 platform means it is well placed to provide a better controlled and consistent VR experience to consumers. This will be important in driving adoption and positive word of mouth.\\" By contrast, HTC and Oculus rely on gamers owning a relatively high-end Windows PC, which adds to their costs. One consequence is that both the Vive and the Rift should be able to run games with more advanced graphics. They both also offer higher resolution displays and wider fields of view, which could make their games seem more immersive. But the PlayStation VR provides a faster refresh rate - allowing it to display 120 frames per second, rather than the 90fps limit of its rivals - which should make its games seem smoother and less likely to cause motion sickness. It is not known what Sony's profit margin will be on the device. But there has been speculation that it is willing to make a loss at launch in order to capture a bigger slice of the market. \\"Next-generation consoles have historically been sold close to - if not below - cost and PlayStation VR is likely to be no different,\\" commented Geoff Blaber from the consultancy CCS Insight. \\"Sony has a big opportunity to build an early leadership position and extend its PS network to a new platform.\\" Reviewers suggest that the best VR games are designed with the format in mind, rather than just ports of existing titles. Games designers are also still experimenting with how best to use virtual reality. Bearing in mind most players will not invest in VR hardware for some time to come, if at all, that makes it a relatively high-risk venture. \\"Games-makers need as big an install base as possible to get a viable return on their investment when they are developing for VR,\\" commented Rob Crossley, UK editor at the news site Gamespot. \\"Sony, HTC and Oculus will all want each others' devices to sell well to inspire those developers. \\"They all need each other to succeed because this is uncharted territory - a concept that has yet to be proven on the market.\\" PlayStation VR Price: 399 (£282) excluding tax/£350 including VAT Release date: October 2016 Computer required: PlayStation 4 Built-in sensors: Accelerometer, gyroscope Controls: DualShock 4 gamepad, PlayStation Move hand batons, PlayStation 4 motion-sensing camera - none of which are included in the price Resolution: 1,920 by 1,080 pixels Field of view: 100 degrees Refresh rate: 120Hz HTC Vive: Price: 799 excl tax/£689 incl VAT (includes three games and two hand controllers) Release date: April 2016 Computer required: PC running Windows 7 or higher with Nvidia/AMD video card Built-in sensors: Accelerometer, gyroscope, front-facing camera, laser sensor Controls: Two motion-tracking hand controllers and two infrared laser-emitting base stations used to determine where the player is standing Resolution: 2,160 x 1,200 pixels Field of view: 110 degrees Refresh rate: 90Hz Oculus Rift: Price: 599 (£423) excl tax Release date: March 2016 Computer required: PC running Windows 10 fitted with Nvidia/AMD video card Built-in sensors: Accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer Controls: Xbox gamepad, remote control, infra-red sensor peripheral to track movements.

Released on October 10, 1966, the single was an immediate critical and commercial hit, topping record charts in several countries including the US and UK. Characterized by its complex soundscapes, episodic structure, and subversions of pop music formula, it was the costliest single ever recorded at the time of its release. \\"Good Vibrations\\" later became widely acclaimed as one of the greatest masterpieces of rock music. The song has been covered by artists such as Groove Holmes, the Troggs, Charlie McCoy, and Psychic TV. John Bush commented: \\"'Good Vibrations' was rarely reprised by other acts, even during the cover-happy '60s. Its fragmented style made it essentially cover-proof.\\" In 1976, a nearly identical cover version was released as a single by Todd Rundgren for his album Faithful. When asked for his opinion, Brian said: \\"Oh, he did a marvelous job, he did a great job. I was very proud of his version.\\" Rundgren's single peaked at number 34 on the Billboard Hot 100. Rundgren explained: \\"I used to like the sound of the Beach Boys, but it wasn't until they began to compete with the Beatles that I felt that what they were doing was really interesting--like around Pet Sounds and 'Good Vibrations' ... when they started to shed that whole surf music kind of burden and start to branch out into something that was a little more universal. ... I tried to do [the song] as literally as I could because in the intervening 10 years, radio had changed so much.

It was sequenced as the album's closing track, following \\"In Blue Hawaii\\". In this version, \\"Good Vibrations\\" was the project's only track that eschewed the modular recording method. The song's verses and chorus were recorded as part of one whole take, and were not spliced together. In 2012, Wilson Phillips, a trio consisting of Wilson's daughters Carnie and Wendy, and John Phillips' daughter Chynna, released an album containing covers of songs by the Beach Boys and the Mamas & the Papas titled Dedicated.

The Gangster Next Door Thursday March 24, 2011 at 9 pm on CBC-TV Repeating: Friday March 25, 2011 at 10 pm ET/PT on CBC News Network Vancouver Sun Reporter Kim Bolan on how boys become gangsters. Anti-gang crusader Eileen Mohan talks about her murdered son Chris. Former gang member James gets off drugs with the help of UN leader Clay Roueche The Gangster Next Door is the harrowing story behind the headlines of the countryâs bloodiest gang war - shockingly led by young men raised in the most middle-class of families. And yet theyâve stooped to new lows to win increasingly brazen gang battles, targeting previously off-limits gangster girlfriends and wives and shattering the lives of true innocents, like the four-year-old left alive in the backseat of a Cadillac, his mother shot dead at the wheel. At stake: billions in illicit drug money. Part police action film, part in-depth analysis, all deeply-human storytelling, The Gangster Next Door introduces characters rarely willing to step out of the shadows â a founding member of a notorious and violent gang, the mother of a gangster girl-friend, and the shattered mother of an innocent victim, a woman whose all-consuming grief fuels an anti-gang crusade. The Gangster Next Door is a must-watch documentary for anyone who wonders how Lotus Land became Gang-couver â and if it can happen in your community. The world awoke to Vancouver's gang problem in the winter of 2008-09 during a period of time on the streets of the lower mainland when there was a targeted hit every six days. The gunfights became increasingly audacious and public â robbing the community of its sense of safety. The collateral damage from the gang problem spreads out in waves out from every horrific incident âstaining the lives of parents and grandparents, children and old friends, bystanders and the community itself. Nobodyâs immune. Perhaps most disturbing - the baffling new profile of these greedy young gangsters who are willing to kill over drug profits:Â among recent gang murders or arrest warrants are the sons of a teacher, a banker, a therapist, even a policeman. The new breed of gangster is quite likely middle-class â a young man with a world of options open to him who is still somehow drawn to the dark side.Â Â Â The Gangster Next Door explores this emerging social phenomenon â the deadliest gangster could be anybody's next door neighbour. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"This article is about a documentary called \\"The Gangster Next Door.\\" It tells the story of young men from middle-class families who become involved in gangs and the violent gang war in Vancouver.

The OPTIONS: 1). packing for moving is hard for her.. 2). packing for vacation is hard for her..","completion":"Olivia couldn't help but smile as she laid out her suitcase, the faint scent of sunscreen and chlorine drifting up from the fabric, remnants of her last trip. The bright colors of swimsuits and sundresses piled on top of her neatly folded clothes represented the epitome of freedom. After weeks of planning, she was more than ready to embark on a much-needed vacation. As she continued to pack, she couldn't help but reflect on the stark contrast between the experiences of packing for a vacation and packing for a move. While packing for a vacation symbolized adventure and relaxation, packing for a move only served as a reminder of the upcoming hardship and stress. 1) The packing process was particularly hard for Olivia when she had to move. Unlike the joy she felt preparing for a trip, she felt a sense of emotional and physical burden each time she had to uproot her life. Moving required far more extensive planning and organisation — a task that Olivia seldom enjoyed. The laborious effort in gathering all of her belongings, creating an inventory, and meticulously wrapping and labeling delicate items like glassware, electronics, and other valuable possessions would often leave her exhausted and anxious. Just the thought of the immense time and energy it would require to unpack and rearrange these items at her new place made her feel even more overwhelmed. As if the physical aspect of packing for moving wasn't enough, it also brought on emotional challenges. Having to sort through sentimental items, deciding which ones were worthy of a place in her new home, and bidding farewell to the memories embedded in her old space stirred various emotions for Olivia. At times she felt excited about the prospects of her new home, yet at other moments, sadness and guilt would consume her, making the process extraordinarily taxing. 2) Although packing for a vacation could be daunting as well, Olivia would much rather face this challenge any day. The excitement and anticipation that accompanied such an endeavor only fueled her enthusiasm to find the perfect combination of outfits, accessories, and essentials. Sure, she may have struggled with narrowing down her choices, trying to ensure she had enough variety without overpacking (and most importantly, not exceeding the checked luggage weight limit). But these struggles were of a different nature; gentle reminders of the pleasure soon to come, rather than a taxing burden on her physical and emotional well-being. She reveled in researching the destination, its local attractions, and regional weather patterns to ensure she was thoroughly prepared. For Olivia, the thrill of hunting down travel-sized toiletries, carefully organizing documents, and meticulously arranging everything in a space-efficient manner was invigorating. The satisfaction of conquering the challenge of fitting all her belongings into a single suitcase was incomparable to the dread she felt when faced with the task of packing and unpacking her entire life while moving. The truth was evident: Olivia wholeheartedly preferred packing for vacation over packing for moving. It was during these moments, when she was nestled in the joy of preparing for a trip, that she felt an abundance of gratitude for every chance she had to explore the world and gather unforgettable memories while escaping the complexities of her everyday life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Background: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led...

Given this information, it's highly probable that Village B experienced an Allee effect due to its declining population size.

In addition, area businesses have stepped forward to help 9-year-old Jaiden Newcomer, the pumpkin's owner The original pumpkin had been taken from the family's front porch in the 1200 block of Edison Street last week and was returned over the weekend. \\"I didn't think my actions through,\\" the apology note stated. It all started the evening of Oct. 14, when Jaiden's dad, Corey Newcomer, went to work. The pumpkin was gone by the time he got home the next morning, and Jaiden was upset. Nine-year-old Jaiden Newcomer pulls his 100-pound pumpkin into the backyard of his Spring Garden Township home. The pumpkin was a replacement for his original pumpkin, which he had won at a fall festival, that was stolen. A couple of businesses offered a replacement after hearing about the theft.

Monday afternoon, VanZant was set to deliver another pumpkin, guessed to be about the same weight as the one Jaiden first won at a fall festival hosted by the business. \\"I'm not certain of its weight, but I'm 69 years old, and I need help carrying it,\\" VanZant said. \\"Jaiden has been pretty nervous talking to people about it, but he's all beside himself with excitement,\\" Corey Newcomer said of the attention since the theft. \\"It has been a pretty nice response from everyone.\\" Now that he has so much pumpkin, Jaiden wants to pay it forward and find a place that can make pies from all the pumpkins so he can donate them to a food bank, according to Jaiden's mother, Amy Newcomer. In the meantime, the father said Jaiden will likely keep his new pumpkins somewhere else so it isn't as easy for someone to take them. \\"We're just happy everyone has been so kind,\\" he added. \\"It's been heartwarming.\\" Note of apology Jaiden's original pumpkin was returned with a note of apology: \\"I'm really sorry about taking your pumpkin, it was wrong of me, you earned the pumpkin, I didn't think my actions through nor realize who they were affecting Sincerest Apologies\\" Read original report.

Amy Newcomer, mother of 9-year-old Jaiden Newcomer, said the family returned to their home in the 1200 block of Edison Street on Sunday evening after being away for the weekend to find the pumpkin back on the front porch of the home. \\"He's very excited,\\" Newcomer said. \\"He's beside himself.\\" Jaiden won the 100-pound pumpkin by correctly guessing its weight at an Oktoberfest celebration at Cape Horn Beverage in Windsor Township, said his grandmother, Josie Tomchick of Dallastown. Four adult family members worked together to lift it onto the porch when they first brought it home, according to Tomchick. \\"They put it on a wheelbarrow to move it,\\" she said. Note of apology: Accompanying the returned giant pumpkin was a note apologizing for the theft, Newcomer said. The note said: \\"I'm really sorry about taking your pumpkin. It was wrong of me. You earned the pumpkin. I didn't think my actions through nor realize who they were affecting. Sincerest apologies.\\" Newcomer said she was surprised the pumpkin didn't end up smashed and destroyed. \\"I never thought it would actually be returned,\\" she said. Even Jaiden initially wasn't so sure the returned pumpkin was the same one that was stolen. The stolen one had the shape of a crescent moon on it and Jaiden examined the returned one to make sure it bore the same mark, Newcomer said. \\"He ran there to make sure it was on there,\\" she said. \\"Our great pumpkin was on the front porch.\\" More pumpkins: As word began to spread that the pumpkin had been stolen, offers to replace it started to roll in to the Newcomer family. A Cumberland County plant nursery gave Jaiden a replacement pumpkin, and Cape Horn Beverage planned to give him a new but smaller one Monday. Tomchick, Jaiden and his brother, 5-year-old Peyton, went to Ashcombe Farm and Greenhouses on Friday to pick up the new pumpkin. Now Jaiden has 255 pounds of pumpkin, Newcomer said. Pay it forward: All the generosity bestowed on Jaiden was not lost on him. He told his mother that he wanted to use the pumpkins to \\"make pumpkin pies for people who can't afford it,\\" Newcomer said.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Fill a heavy-bottomed pot, such as a dutch oven, kadhai, or wok, with enough ghee or oil for deep-frying, between one and two inches. Heat the oil to between 360°-375° F (182°-190°C). To test the oil temperature without a thermometer, place the end of a wooden spoon into the oil. If bubbles start to form around the spoon and float to the top, your oil is ready to go. Give the batter a quick stir with a spatula, but do not over-mix. Then pour the batter into a clean squeeze bottle or condiment dispenser. Plastic squeeze bottles can be purchased at many grocery stores, as can specialized batter dispensers. You can also recycle an empty ketchup bottle, just be sure to wash it thoroughly before use. If you do not have a squeeze bottle available, you can pour the batter into a food-grade plastic bag, and cut a small hole in one corner of it when you are ready to dispense the batter. Using your dispenser, squeeze or pour the batter into the hot oil in coils or spirals that are about 2\\" wide. Only make 3-4 jalebi at a time to avoid crowding the pan. Forming the jalebi is the tricky part, and does take a bit of practice, but once you get the motion down it will be as easy as, well, jalebi! The batter will first sink to the bottom, but will quickly pop back up and float to the top. After a minute or two, flip the jalebi over so they cook on both sides. Then remove them from the oil and drain for a moment on paper towels. Place the jalebi into the syrup while they are still hot, and let them soak for at least a minute, some people prefer up to 4-5 minutes. Turn the jalebi over once so both sides have a chance to soak. The jalebi should become thoroughly saturated with sugar syrup. Start your next batch of jalebi cooking while the first is soaking the syrup. If you wish to serve the jalebi warm, place the jalebi on a platter, or in bowls with a bit of syrup. Otherwise, remove them from the syrup and let then dry on a rack for several hours until the syrup forms a crust.

The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill Thursday that would protect from arbitrary dismissal the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The measure, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, would codify Justice Department regulations that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \\"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\\" The proposal would give the special counsel 10 days to challenge a dismissal in court. If a court determines the firing was not for \\"good cause,\\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation. While marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea. The legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller. Mueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign. Trump has said there was no collusion and repeatedly denounced the probe as a \\"witch hunt.\\" Despite his harsh criticism of the Special Counsel and the Justice Department, Trump has dismissed reports that he's privately talked about firing Mueller.

In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. James' father unfortunately had Huntington's disease. This is a disease that can be passed down from generation to generation.

Article: In the second half of each year, many powerful storms are born in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean seas. Of these, only about half a dozen becomes the strong, circling winds of 75 miles per hour or more that are called hurricanes, and several usually make their way to the coast. There they cause millions of dollars of damage, and bring death to large numbers of people. The great storms that hit the coast start as soft circling wind hundreds -- even thousands -- of miles out to sea. As they travel aimlessly over water warmed by the summer sun, they are carried westward by the southeast winds. When conditions are just right, warm, moist air flows in at the bottom of such a wind, moves upward through it and comes out at the top. In the process , the moisture in this warm air produces rain, and with it the heat is changed to energy in the form of strong winds. As the heat increases, the young hurricane begins to move in a counter-clockwise motion . The life of a hurricane is only about nine days, but it contains almost more power than we can imagine. The energy in the heat released by a hurricane's rainfall in a single day would satisfy the entire electrical needs of the United States for more than six months. Water, not wind, is the main source of death and destruction in a hurricane. A typical hurricane brings 6 to 12 inch downpours, causing sudden floods. Worst of all is the powerful movement of the sea -- the mountains of water moving toward the hurricane center. The water level rises as much as 15 feet above normal as it moves toward shore. Question: When is an ordinary tropical storm called a hurricane? Options: A: When it begins in the Atlantic and Caribbean seas. B: When it hits the coastline. C: When it is more than 75 miles wide.

A potato skin can help whiten dark spots on the skin because it contains a natural bleaching agent, which can gently lighten the dark area. On the other hand, scrubbing the spot with plum skin (option A) will not be effective because plums do not have the natural lightening properties that potatoes have. So, using potato skin is the better solution for this goal."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

From September 1823 to 1826 Chopin attended the Warsaw Lyceum, where he received organ lessons from the Czech musician Wilhelm Würfel during his first year. In the autumn of 1826 he began a three-year course under the Silesian composer Józef Elsner at the Warsaw Conservatory, studying music theory, figured bass and composition.[n 3] Throughout this period he continued to compose and to give recitals in concerts and salons in Warsaw. He was engaged by the inventors of a mechanical organ, the \\"eolomelodicon\\", and on this instrument in May 1825 he performed his own improvisation and part of a concerto by Moscheles. The success of this concert led to an invitation to give a similar recital on the instrument before Tsar Alexander I, who was visiting Warsaw; the Tsar presented him with a diamond ring. At a subsequent eolomelodicon concert on 10 June 1825, Chopin performed his Rondo Op. 1. This was the first of his works to be commercially published and earned him his first mention in the foreign press, when the Leipzig Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung praised his \\"wealth of musical ideas\\".

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this summary: Start your reference entry with the title of the regulation. List the CFR title number and year of publication. Identify the page numbers where the regulation appears. Provide a direct URL for the regulation. Use commas instead of periods in footnotes.","completion":"Title: The Perfect Guide to Citing Regulations in References Introduction Citing a regulation in a scholarly paper, essay, or article can be daunting due to its complex nature. However, it is essential to provide accurate information to the readers, mainly when dealing with legal documents. The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) is a primary source for federal regulations in the United States. Learning how to cite this legal resource correctly can make your task of referencing much more manageable. In this guide, we will focus on the correct way to start a reference entry, list the CFR title number and year of publication, identify the page numbers where the regulation appears, and provide a direct URL for the regulation. Moreover, we will discuss the appropriate usage of commas in footnotes. Starting the Reference Entry with the Title of the Regulation When citing a specific regulation, start your reference entry with the title of the regulation. This helps readers identify the subject matter of the regulation at first glance. Make sure that the title is written in italics and follows appropriate capitalization rules. Listing the CFR Title Number and Year of Publication After mentioning the title, include the CFR title number to specify which regulation you are referencing. The CFR is divided into 50 different titles, making it easy for readers to navigate through the various regulations. By providing the title number, you give your readers a better understanding of the regulation's context. Next, mention the year of publication. This information is vital as the regulations get updated or repealed over time. Including the publication year keeps readers informed about the version of the regulation you are referring to in your work. Identifying the Page Numbers Where the Regulation Appears Finding and referencing the exact pages where the regulation appears is a crucial part of proper citation. Generally, the page numbers are indicated by the section numbers within each CFR title. By providing the specific range of sections or pages, the readers can locate the regulation without any confusion. Ensure that you use the abbreviation \\"§\\" for section to help the reader understand that the numbers you are providing are for locating the cited regulation. Providing a Direct URL for the Regulation Nowadays, it is essential to include an online link to the specific source in your references to make it easier for the readers to access the cited material. To do this, find a government or official website that hosts the cited regulation and copy the direct URL. Including a valid URL not only ensures that the source is reliable but also eases the reader's task of locating the reference material. Using Commas Instead of Periods in Footnotes When creating footnotes for regulations, use commas instead of periods to separate different elements within the citation. Using commas allows the reader to distinguish between the individual components of the citation, making the information presented more comprehensible. Make sure to follow the appropriate citation style guide on using commas or other punctuation marks in footnotes. Conclusion Citing regulations can be challenging, but understanding the process can make the task more accessible. By following these guidelines, you will be able to correctly cite regulations in your references – starting with the title, providing the CFR title number and publication year, specifying the page numbers, including a direct URL, and using commas in the footnotes. By delivering accurate and well-structured citations, you ensure that your readers can efficiently locate and examine the regulations you referenced, improving the quality of your work and adding credibility to your research."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A: The answer is:","completion":"When your body digests food, it breaks down the molecules of nutrients and releases energy, essential components, and waste products. The digestive process aims to extract the necessary nutrients and energy required for an individual's growth, maintenance, and overall bodily functions. During digestion, the body breaks down food molecules in the following manners: 1. Mechanical digesting: This process involves the chewing of food in the mouth, where the teeth break down the food into smaller pieces. Additionally, the muscles in the gastrointestinal tract help churn and mix the food as it moves through the digestive system. 2. Chemical digesting: The food is broken down further through the action of digestive enzymes and acids. These enzymes and secretions are released by the salivary glands, stomach, pancreas, liver, and small intestine. As nutrients are broken down and absorbed during the digestion process, they release the following components: 1. Carbohydrates: The digestive system breaks down complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides) into simple sugars or monosaccharides, such as glucose and fructose. The body absorbs these simple sugars through the lining of the small intestine and into the bloodstream. They serve as a primary source of energy and help maintain healthy brain function. 2. Proteins: Proteins are broken down into amino acids by digestive enzymes called proteases. These amino acids are used by the body to build and maintain muscles, bones, skin, and other tissues, as well as to synthesize enzymes, hormones, and neurotransmitters. 3. Fats: Fats are broken down by enzymes called lipases into individual fatty acids and glycerol. Fatty acids are absorbed and used by the body for energy storage, insulation, and as components of cell membranes. Glycerol is converted into glucose to provide energy. 4. Vitamins and minerals: During digestion, vitamins and minerals are released from the food and absorbed through the small intestine. These micronutrients play vital roles in various bodily functions, such as immune support, maintaining healthy skin and bones, and metabolic processes. 5. Water: Water is absorbed by the body through the large intestine, helping maintain proper hydration, regulate body temperature, and support various physiological processes. 6. Energy: The breakdown of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats releases energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which fuels the body's cells and supports essential functions. 7. Waste products: Indigestible materials, such as dietary fiber and particles of undigested or unabsorbed food, pass through the colon and are eventually eliminated from the body as feces. In summary, the body digests food to break down the molecules of nutrients and release energy, essential components, and waste products. These components play a crucial role in maintaining the proper functioning of the body, ensuring optimal health and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What are the type of mollusk that is left in mounds many feet high? is inside the article: Using an unofficial nickname of \\"The River City\\", Jacksonville has a culture centered on the St. Johns. An annual footrace named the Gate River Run accepts 18,000 participants who travel a course along and over the river twice. The largest kingfishing tournament in the U.S. is held on a St. Johns tributary, where sport fishers concentrate on king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla), cobia (Rachycentron canadum), dolphin (Coryphaena hippurus) and Wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri). The home stadium for the Jacksonville Jaguars faces the river, as does most of the commercial center of downtown. Seven bridges span the St. Johns at Jacksonville; all of them allow tall ships to pass, although some restrict passing times when train or automobile traffic is heavy.Tides cause seawater to enter the mouth of the St. Johns River and can affect the river's level into the middle basin. As a result, much of the river in Jacksonville is part seawater, making it an estuarine ecosystem. The animals and plants in these systems can tolerate both fresh and salt water, and the fluctuations in saline content and temperatures associated with tidal surges and heavy rainfall discharge. Marine animals such as dolphins and sharks can be spotted at times in the St. Johns at Jacksonville as can manatees. Fish such as mullet (Mullidae), flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma), shad (Alosa sapidissima), and blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) migrate from the ocean to freshwater springs upriver to spawn.Although freshwater invertebrates inhabiting and comprising algae and periphyton make the foundation of food webs in the middle and lower basin, zooplankton and phytoplankton take that role in the estuarine habitat. Mollusks gather at the St. Johns estuary in large numbers, feeding on the bottom of the river and ocean floors.

All these details work together to create a specific image of a woman standing on the street, close to some shops, wearing a hat and positioned near a Snow White cut-out. The position of the woman, combined with the mentioned elements, allows us to infer some possible reasons for her presence, such as sightseeing, taking a break from shopping, or maybe waiting for someone. 2. \\"A woman taking a nap on her couch.\\" In this statement, the pieces of information provided are: a) The woman is taking a nap. b) She is located on her couch.

Based on the differences between these two descriptions, it is evident that these situations are distinct and unrelated. Consequently, the assertion that \\"A woman with a Chinese hat on leaning on the wall standing behind a cut out of Snow White in front of some store windows\\" logically leads to \\"A woman taking a nap on her couch\\" is incorrect.

Use a glass measuring cup that is large enough to hold the vinegar and not spill over if you were to dip a rag into it. Use a glass container rather than plastic, since you will need to heat up the vinegar. One of the great things about removing paint from glass is that you probably already have everything you need at home. You don’t need to use any chemical-based products—just white vinegar and dish soap should do the trick! There’s no need to cover the bowl, but do keep an eye on it as it heats up so you can stop the microwave once the vinegar starts to bubble. Depending on how strong your microwave is, this might take a little more or less time than indicated. The rubber gloves will keep your hands from getting burnt in the hot vinegar. A smaller rag, about the size of a washcloth, works well for this project. A hand towel could be too bulky and get in the way while you’re working. You could also use a clean sponge for this step, too. Use some elbow grease to really rub the paint and saturate it with the white vinegar. This should soften the paint, and it may actually completely remove it! If it doesn’t come off yet, that’s totally okay. Just move on to the next step. If the paint does come away completely from using the white vinegar, simply spray the window with glass cleaner and wipe it down to clean it off. Put the dish soap into the bucket first so it can get sudsy while the bucket is filling with water. Try your best to do this right after the vinegar step so that the paint doesn’t have a chance to dry again. Really saturate the paint with the soapy water. If you’re concerned about the water running down the wall or hitting the floor, lay down a towel underneath of where you’re working. Use firm pressure, and only scrape in one direction. Remoisten the paint from time to time with the soapy rag to keep it lubricated. Try to get the edge of the razor underneath the entire section of paint so that it comes away in one piece. Take your time with this part of the process. You want to avoid scratching the glass, which can happen if you rub back and forth or scrape too quickly. This should get rid off all the vinegar, soap, and remaining paint flakes. Wipe the cleaner away with a clean rag or with paper towels. If you notice you missed a section of paint after you clean the window, go back and repeat the soapy water and scraping steps until it comes clean.

Question: \\"What was the other subject in the letter to the National Assembly?\\" Context: \\"In November 1790, François-Louis-Thibault de Menonville, a member of the National Assembly of France, wrote to Burke, praising Reflections and requesting more \\"very refreshing mental food\\" that he could publish. This Burke did in April 1791 when he published A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed \\"a considerable insight into human nature\\" he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–7 Burke was a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau \\"entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but vanity\\"—which he \\"was possessed to a degree little short of madness\\". He also cited Rousseau's Confessions as evidence that Rousseau had a life of \\"obscure and vulgar vices\\" that was not \\"chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action\\". Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital: \\"a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred\\".\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"In his letter to a Member of the National Assembly, which was published in April 1791 as a response to François-Louis-Thibault de Menonville's request for more intellectual discourse, Edmund Burke delved into two main subjects. The first subject was a call to external forces to fight against the revolution in France. Burke, a renowned statesman and political theorist, felt this revolution endangered the established hierarchy and tradition, destabilizing order in society. The second subject, which formed a significant portion of the letter, was a critique of the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Rousseau had become a central figure in the revolution, and Burke essentially criticized this personality cult that had developed around him in revolutionary France. Even though he acknowledged that Rousseau sometimes showed a considerable insight into human nature, Burke’s general evaluation of Rousseau was mostly critical. Burke, who was a friend of David Hume and thus indirectly connected to Rousseau, accused Rousseau of being highly self-absorbed—\\"possessed [by vanity] to a degree little short of madness\\". He even referred to Rousseau's autobiography, Confessions, as proof of Rousseau's \\"obscure and vulgar vices\\", asserting that his life lacked virtues or good actions entirely. Further, he berated Rousseau for his contradictory behavior. While Rousseau endorsed the theory of universal benevolence—kindness to all—he sent his own offspring away to a foundling hospital, implying that he held kindred relationships in low regard. Burke found this to be immensely hypocritical. Hence, the two main subjects of the letter to the National Assembly were a call for outside intervention to counteract the French revolution and an assault on the character and practice of the popularly followed philosopher, Jean-Jacques Rousseau."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Q:What is the final step of the following process: - Blood enters the kidney - The blood travels into the neophrons - Waste is expelled via the neophrons - The waste goes to the bladder in the form of urine A:","completion":"The final step of the process in which blood enters the kidney, travels into the nephrons, waste is expelled via the nephrons, and the waste goes to the bladder in the form of urine is: - Urine excretion through the urethra and out of the body. To provide a more in-depth understanding of the process, let's look at the individual steps more closely: 1. Blood enters the kidney through the renal artery, which branches off from the aorta and transports oxygen-rich blood to the kidney. 2. The blood travels through a complex network of blood vessels and eventually reaches the nephrons, the functional units of the kidney responsible for filtering and removing waste from the blood. Each kidney contains millions of nephrons. 3. Within the nephrons, the blood undergoes a series of filtration processes, starting with the glomerulus, a cluster of capillaries that filter the blood based on size, allowing smaller molecules like water and waste to pass through while retaining larger molecules like proteins and blood cells. 4. The filtered blood then moves through the tubule system of the nephron, where various substances are selectively reabsorbed back into the bloodstream (like glucose, electrolytes, and water) based on the body's needs, or secreted from the bloodstream into the tubules as waste. 5. The waste products, now in a liquid form known as urine, pass through the collecting ducts in the kidney. These ducts merge, emptying the urine into the renal pelvis. 6. From the renal pelvis, urine flows into the ureters, which are muscular tubes that transport the urine towards the bladder. 7. The bladder is a muscular, hollow organ that stores urine temporarily until it is expelled from the body. When the bladder is full, stretch receptors in its walls send a signal to the brain prompting the urge to urinate. 8. The final step of the process is the excretion of urine from the bladder through the urethra and out of the body. This occurs when the muscles of the bladder contract, while the sphincter muscles surrounding the opening of the urethra relax to allow the urine to flow out. In summary, after blood is filtered through the nephrons and waste products are expelled in the form of urine, the final step is the excretion of the urine from the bladder, through the urethra, and out of the body. This entire process is essential for maintaining the proper balance of electrolytes, waste removal, and fluid balance within the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

For example, the Russian and Austria-Habsburg annexation of the Crimean and Balkan regions respectively saw large influxes of Muslim refugees – 200,000 Crimean Tartars fleeing to Dobruja. Between 1783 and 1913, approximately 5–7 million refugees flooded into the Ottoman Empire, at least 3.8 million of whom were from Russia. Some migrations left indelible marks such as political tension between parts of the empire (e.g. Turkey and Bulgaria) whereas centrifugal effects were noticed in other territories, simpler demographics emerging from diverse populations. Economies were also impacted with the loss of artisans, merchants, manufacturers and agriculturists. Since the 19th century, a large proportion of Muslim peoples from the Balkans emigrated to present-day Turkey. These people are called Muhacir. By the time the Ottoman Empire came to an end in 1922, half of the urban population of Turkey was descended from Muslim refugees from Russia.

This is the feature length directorial debut of veteran Dutch actress Monique van de Ven and based on my observation it should be her last. I hate movies that are so implausible that you are picking apart practically every scene. This film immediately leaves you scratching your head. as it begins a young photographer and his girlfriend who works for an international aid organization are having a leisurely drive through the Taliban-controlled mountains Afghanistan having a conversation about their love when a rocket stops a truck in front of them. They get out of their vehicle to watch as Talliban fighters equipped with rocket launchers, machine guns, rifles, handguns and grenades execute all five people in the truck. Bob (Waldemar Torenstra) starts taking pictures of all this when he is spotted by one of the insurgents who lobs a hand grenade at them that kills his girlfriend. since they are with hand throwing distance they can't be more than 50 yards away yet he somehow gets away. His girlfriend is blown up and he takes a picture of the moment of the grenade impact that kills her and wins a prize as photographer of the year for the photo. Every scene and situation in this film as as ridiculous as it's opening. The following year Bob finds himself on assignment for National Geographic on a Dutch resort island where he meets Kathleen (Sophie Hilbrand) and inserts himself into her seedy underworld of international drug smugglers.

The band was formed in 2003 and recorded its first EP, Translating the Name, that same year original vocalist Anthony Green left Saosin due to personal reasons. In 2004, Cove Reber replaced Green as vocalist after auditioning for the role. The group recorded its self titled debut album which was released on Capitol Records on September 26, 2006. The original lineup for Saosin, consisting of Burchell, Shekoski, Kennedy and Green, was formed in the summer of 2003. On June 17, the band released their first commercial production, the EP Translating the Name. It was an immediate success and was immensely popular on online forums and music sites. Saosin first became popular through promotion and exposure through the Internet. They became known for their distinct musical styles long before their first studio-length album was released, and were popularized on social networking and music sites such as MySpace. The E.P. has sold an estimated 62,000 copies. Bassist Zach Kennedy left the band early on, as he wanted to pursue a career in art. He was later replaced by Chris Sorenson. A local Southern Califonian drummer by the name of Pat Magrath, was hired only for the recording for the EP, according to Burchell. The band was impressed with his drumming skills however, and he later appeared as a guest performing Lost Symphonies live with the band. Alex Rodriguez was unable to record Translating the Name as he had promised his band at the time Open Hand he would finish recording with them. Danny King filled in for live drums with the band before Rodriguez completed his responsibilities with Open Hand and joined Saosin full-time after the EP release. Saosin went on a U.S. tour with bands Boys Night Out and Anatomy of a Ghost shortly after the release of Translating the Name. In February 2004, the band's vocalist Anthony Green left Saosin and later formed the band Circa Survive. Green was homesick, depressed and said he was missing his family. Green was also disenchanted with the direction of Saosin and disliked that the band excluded him from the writing process. The band finished their Warped Tour obligations with Story of the Year's Philip Sneed taking the mic. A public, nationwide audition then took place.

Green was the color of plants but it was also the color of money. Plants were good but money was bad. I didn't know what green meant. Blue and red were clear though. Blue was the color of ocean and sky, both good things. Red was the color of Mars and it was manly but mars meant aliens and aliens were bad so red was bad. This is how I navigated.

She passed away at a St. Louis hospital in her hometown after suffering complications from a recent heart attack. Bass will forever be remembered as one of the most powerful voices of her era, a fierce talent who captured the imaginations and hearts of soul music lovers around the world. Born on July 3, 1940, in St. Louis, Missouri, Fontella Bass grew up in a family whose musical talents were passed down through generations. Her mother, Martha Bass, was a gospel singer and a member of the legendary Clara Ward Singers, and her younger brother, David Peaston, enjoyed a successful R&B career. With gospel music filling her home, it was only fitting that the young Fontella would follow in her family's footsteps and realize the power of her own awe-inspiring voice. It was at the age of 16 when Bass's undeniable singing talents were first discovered. While performing in her brother's band, she caught the eye of legendary blues pianist and singer Little Milton Campbell, who invited her to join his band. By 1961, Bass had honed her talents on stage and caught the attention of a local St. Louis recording studio. She recorded several songs with the Chicago-based Chess Records label, but it was her collaboration with songwriter-producer Billy Davis and former Roosters' guitarist Oliver Sain that led to her biggest break. In 1965, Fontella Bass co-wrote and recorded what would become her signature song, \\"Rescue Me,\\" a pulsating, emotive soul classic that remains an anthem of empowerment, vulnerability, and resilience. The song soared to the top of the Billboard Rhythm and Blues charts and became a pop hit, reaching number four on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The immense popularity of \\"Rescue Me\\" catapulted her into the limelight and served as the pinnacle of her musical career. Following the success of \\"Rescue Me,\\" Bass continued to perform and record music, collaborating with other artists such as Bobby McClure and Art Ensemble of Chicago. However, she faced numerous challenges throughout her career, including disputes with record labels over royalties and contractual issues. Despite setbacks, her determination and love for music never wavered. Throughout her career, Bass released a series of acclaimed albums, including \\"The New Look\\" in 1966 and \\"Free\\" in 1972, showcasing her stylistic versatility and powerful voice. Her exceptional contributions to the world of soul music earned her a Pioneer Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation in 1997. As we pay tribute to Fontella Bass and her extraordinary life, we remember her not just for her astonishing voice, but also for her inspiring story. From humble beginnings, she forged her way into the annals of popular music history, leaving a legacy that continues to echo through the soulful, passionate melodies that originated from deep within her heart. In the years that followed her initial burst of fame, Bass remained an active performer, often singing with her family members. Her voice and spirit live on in the powerful music she left behind, a testament to her enduring impact on generations of listeners and fellow artists alike. As we say goodbye to this extraordinary singer, we celebrate the life of Fontella Bass—an inextinguishable beacon of soul music—and the joy that her passionate performances brought to millions of fans around the world. Her voice will forever be immortalized in the annals of popular music, and her memory will continue to serve as an inspiration for generations to come. Rest in peace, Fontella Bass.

Q: What is the term for a particle from outside the cell engulfing the cells membrane? A: Choose from: (1). metastasis. (2). endometriosis. (3). mitosis. (4). endocytosis. Answer:","completion":"The correct term for a particle from outside the cell engulfing the cell's membrane is (4) Endocytosis. Endocytosis is a cellular process in which substances, such as particles or molecules, from outside the cell are brought into the cell by engulfing them with its cell membrane. This process helps cells take in specific substances, nutrients, and other necessary materials from their environment. Endocytosis can be broken down into different types, including phagocytosis, pinocytosis, and receptor-mediated endocytosis. 1. Phagocytosis: Also known as \\"cell eating,\\" this process is utilized by specialized cells called phagocytes, which are found in the immune system. Phagocytes use phagocytosis to engulf and eliminate harmful substances, such as bacteria, dead cells, and debris from the surrounding environment. The substances are enclosed within the cell membrane, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This phagosome is then fused with a lysosome, in which digestive enzymes break down and destroy the engulfed material. 2. Pinocytosis: Also referred to as \\"cell drinking,\\" pinocytosis is a form of endocytosis in which smaller particles and fluids are taken up by the cell. The cell membrane envelops these particles, forming small vesicles called endosomes, which then carry the substances into the cell's interior where they can be broken down. Pinocytosis can be either constitutive or selective, depending on whether it is always active or only activated when specific substances are present. 3. Receptor-mediated endocytosis: The most specific form of endocytosis, receptor-mediated endocytosis occurs when substances bind to specific receptors located on the cell membrane. These receptors are usually transmembrane proteins that recognize and bind to extracellular substances, such as nutrients, hormones, or growth factors. Once bound, the receptor and its bound substance are internalized, typically by forming a small vesicle called a coated pit that is lined with a protein called clathrin. This vesicle then detaches from the membrane and moves into the cell's interior for further processing. To summarize, endocytosis is the process of engulfing particles or molecules from outside the cell by the cell's membrane. It is an essential process for cells to take in nutrients, remove harmful substances, and maintain their function. The correct term from the given choices is (4) Endocytosis."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and answer the question. Article: In a New York street, a small truck hit a big tree.

Title: Keeping Mum Movie plot: In the opening scene, as pregnant young Rosie Jones (Emilia Fox) rides on a train, her very large trunk starts leaking blood. When questioned by the police, she calmly reveals that the two dismembered bodies inside are of her unfaithful husband and his mistress. She is then sentenced by the judge (Roger Hammond) to a secure unit for the criminally insane for manslaughter.Forty-three years later, in the village of Little Wallop, Walter Goodfellow, the vicar (Rowan Atkinson) is very busy writing the perfect sermon for a conference, having no idea about the problems in his house, which include the unfulfilled sexual needs of his wife Gloria (Kristin Scott Thomas) who subsequently starts an affair with her golf instructor, Lance (Patrick Swayze); the rebellious nature of his daughter Holly (Tamsin Egerton) who constantly picks up new boyfriends; and son Petey (Toby Parkes) who is bullied by schoolmates. Then everything changes with the arrival of the new housekeeper Grace (Maggie Smith).Walter and Gloria first meet her when they fail to fetch Petey from school and see him strolling with her. Gloria becomes very angry, thinking that Grace is trying to kidnap him and is appeased only when the latter identifies herself by showing an envelope with her name on it. Grace is installed into their lives and learns about some of the problems in the house Clarence, the neighbour's (Mr. Brown's) nuisance-barking Jack Russell terrier, who disturbs Gloria's sleep; the boys who bully Petey; and the golf instructor with whom Gloria is having an affair. Walter does not know anything about any of this - the only problem he has is the toxic blue-green algae in the garden pond. Grace resolves to solve these problems in her own way. She first kills the dog, Clarence, and when his owner finds out that his dog has been killed, she kills him, too. She sabotages the bullies' bicycles, injuring one of them and thereby making Petey very happy. She catches the golf instructor outside the house one night, videotaping Holly undressing, and...

Question: I have a new situation: John and Keith are neighbors. They have been pondering about how to communicate with each other in a doomsday scenario when all the electronic devices would be useless. They connected their houses with three ducts. One of the ducts is filled with air; they called it channel A. Another duct is filled with water; they called it channel B. And the last duct is filled with iron; they called it channel C. They can now transmit sound with these channels of communication; in case, disaster strikes. But I can use this background: In common everyday speech, speed of sound refers to the speed of sound waves in air. However, the speed of sound varies from substance to substance: sound travels most slowly in gases; it travels faster in liquids; and faster still in solids. For example, (as noted above), sound travels at 343 m/s in air; it travels at 1,480 m/s in water (4.3 times as fast as in air); and at 5,120 m/s in iron (about 15 times as fast as in air). In an exceptionally stiff material such as diamond, sound travels at 12,000 metres per second (27,000 mph);[1] (about 35 times as fast as in air) which is around the maximum speed that sound will travel under normal conditions. What is an answer for this question: How much faster would be channel C than channel B in m/s, 3640 m/s or 3600 m/s? Answer:","completion":"To find out how much faster channel C (iron) is than channel B (water), we need to subtract the speed of sound in water from the speed of sound in iron. Speed of sound in iron: 5,120 m/s Speed of sound in water: 1,480 m/s Difference in speed: 5,120 m/s - 1,480 m/s = 3,640 m/s Therefore, channel C is 3,640 m/s faster than channel B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was unclear how many of the dead had been identified prior to burial and how many of those burials occurred in mass graves. \\"We know that bodies have been buried, we feel inappropriately,\\" said Dr. Jon Andrus, deputy director of the Pan American Health Organization.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"Group B, the group that made a fire with small twigs, had a fire with wood that provoked a more intense reaction. Smaller twigs have a larger surface area to volume ratio compared to a large log. This means that the twigs catch fire and burn more easily due to the increased exposure to oxygen.

That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Given the background: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led... and the situation: Bobby and Will were two friends attending a genetics course. Bobby studied a small, isolated group of mammals.

First, let's simplify the right side of the equation. We have -217 + 235. Now, if you add them together, you get 235 - 217 = 18. Now the equation is -9 * a = 18. To find the value of 'a', we want to get rid of the multiplication on the left side of the equation. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by -9. So, a = 18 / -9.

Can the Supreme Court of India interfere on the banned of 500 and 1000 notes by the government? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? OPT: --no --yes","completion":"--yes If the Supreme Court of India were to remove the ban on the ₹500 and ₹1000 currency notes, various consequences could arise. However, it is crucial to first understand the significance of this ban. In November 2016, the Indian Government introduced the demonetization policy, which entailed a ban on ₹500 and ₹1000 currency notes. This move aimed to curb the widespread problem of black money, counterfeiting, and corruption within the Indian economy. The primary objectives were to increase transparency in the financial system, formalize the economy, and promote digital transactions. Now, let's discuss what could happen if the ban on ₹500 and ₹1000 notes were lifted by the Supreme Court of India: 1. Economic Disruptions: One of the most immediate effects would be economic disruptions. A reversal of the ban might lead to a surge in cash-based transactions, acts of forgery, and an increased circulation of black money – the very elements the demonetization policy sought to combat. 2. Loss of Confidence: The demonetization policy necessitated swapping of old currency notes with new ones for millions of people. Lifting the ban risks eroding public confidence in the government and its policies, as individuals who have experienced the inconvenience of this exchange process may feel disillusioned. 3. Impact on Digital Payments: One of the goals of demonetization was to encourage more digital transactions and promote a cashless economy. Removing the ban might undo some progress made in this area, as the cash-based economy would regain prominence once the ₹500 and ₹1000 notes are reintroduced. 4. Currency Circulation: The Reserve Bank of India has already introduced new ₹500 notes and a ₹2000 note, which are currently in circulation. Lifting the ban would require simultaneous circulation of old and new notes, which could lead to confusion and complications in the financial system. 5. Legal Precedent: The Supreme Court's intervention in removing the ban may set a precedent for future cases involving the government's economic policies and financial regulations. It could also raise questions about the balance of power between the judiciary and the executive. Regarding the second question, the Supreme Court of India has the authority to review and assess the constitutionality of any law or policy. However, the apex court generally exhibits judicial restraint, and its interference in economic and policy matters is relatively uncommon. While the court might scrutinize the policy – as it did when the demonetization move was challenged – it is unlikely to rule against the government's decision without substantial evidence of unconstitutionality or violation of fundamental rights. In conclusion, reversing the ban on ₹500 and ₹1000 notes by the Supreme Court could have significant ramifications on the economy, public confidence, and future legal decisions. While the court has the authority to review such a policy, it is essential to consider the possible aftershocks of reversing this decision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Funeral for a Friend were a Welsh post-hardcore band from Bridgend, formed in 2001. The band consisted of lead vocalist Matthew Davies-Kreye and guitarist Kris Coombs-Roberts for its entire history, with Darran Smith (guitar), Gareth Davies (bass) and Ryan Richards (drums and screaming vocals) completing the line-up for the band's first four studio albums. Between 2008 and 2012 the band transitioned towards its final line-up, which saw Davies-Kreye and Coombs-Roberts alongside guitarist and occasional vocalist Gavin Burrough, bassist Richard Boucher and drummer Pat Lundy (who left the band in 2014). Funeral for a Friend's popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their debut album, Casually Dressed & Deep in Conversation (2003). When Michael Davies, one of January Thirst's original vocalists, quit in December 2001, Matthew Evans (vocals) and Johnny Phillips (drums) invited Matt Davies (later Davies-Kreye) to try out for the vacated singer position. Soon afterward, the band reformed as Funeral for a Friend; the name is derived from a song by Planes Mistaken for Stars, one of Davies' favourite bands at the time. During the start of the New Year they parted ways with second guitarist Kerry Roberts (Kris Coombs-Roberts's brother) and found a suitable replacement in Darran Smith (ex-Tripcage). The band recorded four tracks at Mighty Atom Studios for a proposed self-financed EP with another Welsh band From This Moment On. Upon hearing the tracks, Mighty Atom Records approached the band and offered a two-album deal, resulting in their debut EP, Between Order and Model (2002). Before the EP's release, Andi Morris (bass) quit, with Phillips and Evans also leaving. The band then recruited Gareth Davies (later Ellis-Davies) on bass and Ryan Richards on drums. Matt Davies became the band's only primary vocalist, with Gareth Davies performing backing melodies and Richards taking over Evans' screaming role. In 2003, Funeral for a Friend recorded their second EP, Four Ways to Scream Your Name, produced and mixed by Colin Richardson. In mid-2003, the band secured their first Kerrang! award, winning the award for \\"Best UK Newcomer\\", beating The Darkness, who won in all other nominated categories. Funeral for a Friend's win was largely attributed to their fervent fan base, as the awards winner was decided by public vote online at the official Kerrang! Web site.

Choose the correct sentiment from candidates: Select from the following. - negative - positive TEXT:Emilio Miraglia's first Giallo feature, The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave, was a great combination of Giallo and Gothic horror - and this second film is even better! We've got more of the Giallo side of the equation this time around, although Miraglia doesn't lose the Gothic horror stylings that made the earlier film such a delight. Miraglia puts more emphasis on the finer details of the plot this time around, and as a result it's the typical Giallo labyrinth, with characters all over the place and red herrings being thrown in every few minutes. This is a definite bonus for the film, however, as while it can get a little too confusing at times; there's always enough to hold the audience's interest and Miraglia's storytelling has improved since his earlier movie. The plot opens with a scene that sees two young girls fighting, before their grandfather explains to them the legend behind a rather lurid painting in their castle. The legend revolves around a woman called 'The Red Queen' who, legend has it, returns from the grave every hundred years and kills seven people. A few years later, murders begin to occur... Even though he only made two Giallo's, Miraglia does have his own set of tributes. It's obvious that the colour red is important to him, as it features heavily in both films; and he appears to have something against women called 'Evelyn'. He likes castles, Gothic atmospheres and stylish murders too - which is fine by me! Miraglia may be no Argento when it comes to spilling blood, but he certainly knows how to drop an over the top murder into his film; and here we have delights involving a Volkswagen Beetle, and a death on an iron fence that is one of my all time favourite Giallo death scenes. The female side of the cast is excellent with the stunning Barbara Bouchet and Marina Malfatti heading up an eye-pleasing cast of ladies that aren't afraid to take their clothes off! The score courtesy of Bruno Nicolai is catchy, and even though it doesn't feature much of the psychedelic rock heard in The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave; it fits the film well. The ending is something of a turn-off, as although Miraglia revs up the Gothic atmosphere, it comes across as being more than a little bit rushed and the identity of the murderer is too obvious. But even so, this is a delightfully entertaining Giallo and one that I highly recommend to fans of the genre!","completion":"The correct sentiment for the given text is: positive The reviewer is praising the film, noting that it is a great combination of Giallo and Gothic horror, and stating that it is an improvement over the director's earlier film.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the ballet that the composer performed which led to him being carried on the shoulders of his admirers? from the following article ? On 18 February 1914 The Rite received its first concert performance (the music without the ballet), in St Petersburg under Serge Koussevitzky. On 5 April that year, Stravinsky experienced for himself the popular success of The Rite as a concert work, at the Casino de Paris. After the performance, again under Monteux, the composer was carried in triumph from the hall on the shoulders of his admirers. The Rite had its first British concert performance on 7 June 1921, at the Queen's Hall in London under Eugene Goossens. Its American premiere occurred on 3 March 1922, when Stokowski included it in a Philadelphia Orchestra programme. Goossens was also responsible for introducing The Rite to Australia on 23 August 1946 at the Sydney Town Hall, as guest conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.Stravinsky first conducted the work in 1926, in a concert given by the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam; two years later he brought it to the Salle Pleyel in Paris for two performances under his baton. Of these occasions he later wrote that \\"thanks to the experience I had gained with all kinds of orchestras ... I had reached a point where I could obtain exactly what I wanted, as I wanted it\\". Commentators have broadly agreed that the work has had a greater impact in the concert hall than it has on the stage; many of Stravinsky's revisions to the music were made with the concert hall rather than the theatre in mind. The work has become a staple in the repertoires of all the leading orchestras, and has been cited by Leonard Bernstein as \\"the most important piece of music of the 20th century\\".In 1963, 50 years after the premiere, Monteux (then aged 88) agreed to conduct a commemorative performance at London's Royal Albert Hall. According to Isaiah Berlin, a close friend of the composer, Stravinsky informed him that he had no intention of hearing his music being \\"murdered by that frightful butcher\\". Instead he arranged tickets for that particular evening's performance of Mozart's opera The Marriage of Figaro, at Covent...

Dr Alec High \\"repeatedly\\" engaged in sexual activity between 2013 and 2015 at the University of Leeds despite being warned not to, a General Dental Council (GDC) committee heard. He was \\"erased from the register with immediate effect\\", meaning he can no longer practice dentistry. Dr High had ignored a warning by a senior colleague, the committee heard.

On one occasion, a colleague trying to comfort a grieving student overheard him having sex with a woman who was often seen coming and going from his office. Dr High qualified in 1966 and worked for the NHS in the North East before moving to the University of Leeds in 1981. He was a senior lecturer and consultant specialising in the head and neck, but left the university in 2014.

While attending my MOS AIT in the US Army (good lord, was that 25 years ago???), a few of us had a hotel party. It didn’t get too crazy as it was mainly to get off post. If I remember right, after some folks left, there was one couple, a couple girls (maybe 3?), and myself who stayed over. I had known them all for a month or so and had spent a ton of time hanging out at the barracks or around the school area. The couple took one bed, the girls took the other, and I took the floor at the foot of the girls’ bed. About the time everyone started to nod off, one of the girls woke me, asking if I would share the blanket, as the bed was too crowded. She and I had both recently gotten engaged to people two plane flights away and had been nothing more than friends previously - with no hint of anything else… I thought nothing of it and said sure. After a few minutes, she said she couldn’t sleep and asked if she could snuggle up a little. I thought nothing of it and said sure. I started to think… hunh… this is peculiar… After a few more minutes, she asked if I minded if we kissed a little. At that point, I started to get the idea… but that was as far as I thought anything was going to happen as I thought, hunh, OK, maybe she misses her fiance. I know I do. Then we progressed to (very quiet) sex at her request. As far as we knew, everyone else in the room was asleep - at least they never hinted at knowing. We dated another month or two while we were both there. I was so clueless as to how she felt and it took FAR too long to figure out what was happening.

Read this and answer the question Natural uranium consists of three major isotopes: uranium-238 (99.28% natural abundance), uranium-235 (0.71%), and uranium-234 (0.0054%). All three are radioactive, emitting alpha particles, with the exception that all three of these isotopes have small probabilities of undergoing spontaneous fission, rather than alpha emission. There are also five other trace isotopes: uranium-239, which is formed when 238U undergoes spontaneous fission, releasing neutrons that are captured by another 238U atom; uranium-237, which is formed when 238U captures a neutron but emits two more, which then decays to neptunium-237; uranium-233, which is formed in the decay chain of that neptunium-237; and finally, uranium-236 and -240, which appear in the decay chain of primordial plutonium-244.

Brazenly taunting him with her sexuality, she bluntly dissects their prior relationshipâa nightmarish web of masochism, money, manipulation and dependency, pimping her out to dangerous clients in order to gain both a business advantage and perverse personal thrills. She outlines her newest ambition, since their estrangement, of raising the necessary capital to run a nightclub in Beijing. Miles makes no pretense of the fact that he is less interested in the proposal than the woman, and encourages her to visit him at his apartment. Without making any promises, Sandra leaves for her job at an import business, run by a young married couple: Lester and Sue Wong. Sandra's own import sideline, drug running, is facilitated by her close bond of loyalty with low-ranking employee Lisa.

LAGUNE'S POINT OF VIEW. For three days the Laboratory at South Kensington saw nothing of Lagune, and then he came back more invincibly voluble than ever. Everyone had expected him to return apostate, but he brought back an invigorated faith, a propaganda unashamed. From some source he had derived strength and conviction afresh. Even the rhetorical Smithers availed nothing. There was a joined battle over the insufficient tea-cups, and the elderly young assistant demonstrator hovered on the verge of the discussion, rejoicing, it is supposed, over the entanglements of Smithers.

Lewisham, it was remarked by Miss Heydinger, made but a poor figure in this discussion. Once or twice he seemed about to address Lagune, and thought better of it with the words upon his lips.

She sits on the damp pavement, her knees pulled up to her chest, cradling her frail body as if trying to shield herself from the turbulent world. \\"Hey, are you okay?\\" James ventures, trying to mask his concern with nonchalance. The girl lifts her head, revealing the anguish in her deep, blue eyes. It's a gaze James recognizes – one that mirrors the loneliness and hurt he has felt many times himself. Somehow, knowing she shares that same pain comforts him, as if they bear an unspoken connection. \\"I... I don't know,\\" her voice breaks as she sniffles, wiping her face with the back of her trembling hand. \\"Here, let me help you up,\\" James offers, extending a hand towards her. After a momentary pause, the girl accepts his help and slowly rises from the ground, leaning on James' sturdy arm for support. Despite her delicate appearance, James can feel the weight of her internal struggles manifesting physically in each brief exchange. \\"Thank you,\\" she mumbles, managing a small, grateful smile. \\"I'm James, by the way,\\" he introduces himself, hoping the small talk will make her more comfortable around him. \\"I'm Lily,\\" she responds, her voice stronger now, but with a hint of vulnerability that James can't ignore. \\"Do you want to talk about what's bothering you, Lily?\\" James begins tentatively, unsure how to approach the subject but fearing the consequences of ignoring it. Lily hesitates before answering, weighing the pros and cons of revealing her heart to a stranger. But the kindness in his eyes and the sincere concern she hears in his voice allow her to take the plunge. \\"It's just... everything's falling apart. My life, my dreams, my relationships. I feel like I'm losing control and there's nothing I can do to stop it,\\" she confesses, fresh tears forming in her eyes. James nods, understandingly. He's no stranger to feeling lost and unable to regain control. As they walk along the dimly lit alleyway, he listens intently as Lily pours out her soul, explaining her complicated family situation, her dead-end job, and the loneliness consuming her. As their steps echo in the otherwise quiet night, James realizes that the focus has shifted from simply offering comfort to a stranger in need, and onto a journey of healing and acceptance for them both. His own fears, doubts, and struggles surface as he shares his stories with Lily. There's a powerful resonance between the two as they continue talking, a feeling that they are not alone in their pain anymore. As they reach the end of the alley and step out onto a bustling city street, something within them has fundamentally changed. Although the world is still as daunting and unyielding as ever, they now have a glimmer of hope. The brief companionship in the alleyway has illuminated a path towards healing and understanding. They realize their problems may not be solved overnight, but they have found solace in the comforting presence of one another – two lost souls searching for their way in a complex and often cruel world. James and Lily exchange numbers on that street corner, under a hazy yellow streetlight that bathes them in its warm, reassuring glow. As they part, heading off into their separate lives, they know they've forged an indelible bond that will help them weather the proverbial storms. The sky may be dark and starless, the paths before them uncertain, but James and Lily are no longer alone; they walk onward, knowing that with each step, they are healing not only their own wounds but another's as well. And in that moment – that brief, poignant connection – they found a glimmer of hope and the strength to keep moving forward in the dark, uncertain world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Expansion quickly peaked however, and the European powers who had carved up the New World set about testing each other in dynastic conflicts and colonial rivalry. The English were the main rivals of the Dutch on the high seas, and there were several wars between the two in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1665–1667 the Dutch sailed up the River Medway and sank the British fleet moored there. The 18th century saw Amsterdam grow into the foremost financial center in the world, but the seeds of decline had already been planted. When the English colonies in New England rose up in revolt against the British, they found ready Ailies in the Dutch. From their colonies in the Caribbean they sent caches of arms and ammunition. The British were furious and went to war in 1780, destroying the Dutch navy and signaling a sudden decline in power and influence from which the Netherlands never recovered. Trade suffered to such an extent that in 1791 the VOC went into liquidation. In the latter part of the century there were anti-Orange demonstrations by pro-French factions in the country, and in 1795 Napoleon Bonaparte took the Netherlands in his epic march across Europe. Under the yoke of another foreign power, and with trade at an all time low, the Golden Age was truly dead. The Return of the House of Orange Napoleon installed his brother Louis as King of Holland and he chose to take the fine Town Hall on Dam Square as his palace — now the Koninklijk Palace. But only four years later he fled the city after civil disturbances broke out when he raised taxes. When Napoleon's bubble burst and French power began to wane, William of Orange emerged from exile and was proclaimed king in 1813. Amsterdam had to work its way out of economic decline, but throughout the 19th century the city grew steadily. Industrialization changed the city. With the building of the Central Station at the end of the century, Amsterdam turned its back on its seafaring past and looked towards the mechanical age for its future. The station was built over the old harbor wall and some of the oldest canals in the city center were filled in to allow better access to motorized vehicles. Dam Square was landlocked for the first time in its history.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. This movie makes me want to throw up every time I see it. If you take the first movie, and reverse the plot (ariel wants to leave the sea, her daughter wants to go to the sea), take the same characters and give them new animals and new names, and then throw in crappy animation and the biggest suck factor, possible, you get the little mermaid 2. Its basically a copy of the first movie with a reversed plot. I'll take you through the horror of it step by step. These are the people from the 1st movie: First of all, Prince Eric is still prince eric, with about 3 lines in the whole movie. Ariel is uptight, annoying, and is not the carefree, headstrong spirit we saw in the 1st. In fact, she is the exact opposite. Sebastian is still sebastian only less cute, less convincing as being stressed out, and the jokes just aren't funny anymore. Flounder has about 2 lines. He now has kids and he talks with a dumb nasal voice. Scuttle is still dumb scuttle only not funny. King Triton's character is probably the best, he still retains the intimidation and love for his daughter, Melody. Ariel and Prince Eric appear not to give a hoot about their daughter. Like i said, all they did was use the characters from the first movie and copy them. This is what they did: Ursula- The new evil villain is Morgana, Ursula's sister who feels like she always lived in Ursula's shadow. I wouldn't be scared of her if she showed up at my doorway with a knife. She can't do anything right and she's a failure as a villain. She has the same voice ursula did. Sebastian & Flounder - Have been replaced by probably the most stupid sidekicks, Tip & Dash, a walrus and a penguin. They try to be hero's but always fail when trying. the plot is so predictable. They become heroes at the end. Yawn. Flatson& Jetsom- Now replaced by a shark who was turned about 10x smaller by triton. Hes really bad too. Morgana and the shark (sharkbait, I think was his name) have no chemistry, good or bad. Ariel-Ah, Ariel. Our lovely mermaid was replaced by her un-lovely daughter, melody. Melody cannot sing, her voice is about 2 octaves higher than it should be, and you want to punch her in the face because shes so fake sugary sweet. She wants to go to the sea, she is clumsy and the kids make fun of her, she has to go find herself. yawn. Not only is the movie boring and unoriginal its so simplistic when you watch this movie you will gasp at how bad it is. Certain parts of the movie make you want to call Disney up and demand why such a horrible movie was made as a sequel to such a wonderful original.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what do wind and rain cause?\\" is \\"flooding\\", given that wind and rain cause abrasion? A:","completion":"The answer \\"flooding\\" is partially correct when answering the question \\"what do wind and rain cause?\\". Although flooding is a significant consequence of heavy wind and rain, it does not encompass all the effects these natural forces have on the environment. Furthermore, as mentioned, wind and rain also cause abrasion. To provide a more detailed and long answer, let's explore various effects of wind and rain, including flooding and abrasion. 1. Flooding: Intense rainfall can saturate the ground, causing rivers, streams, and lakes to overflow. When water levels rise, they may exceed the capacity of stormwater systems, leading to flash floods and urban flooding, which can damage property, infrastructure, and disrupt transportation. Additionally, heavy winds can generate storm surges that contribute to coastal flooding. 2. Abrasion: This occurs when wind and rain break apart rocks and erode landforms by wearing them down over time. Rainwater seeps into small fractures in rocks, and when it freezes, it expands, causing the rock to break apart. Also, wind carries sand and dust particles, which scrape away at rock surfaces like sandpaper, contributing to the erosion process. 3. Soil erosion: Heavy rain can wash away the topsoil, which is essential for plant growth and agriculture. Wind can also play a role in soil erosion by blowing away fine particles, leading to the loss of fertile soil. This can negatively impact agriculture and contribute to the formation of deserts. 4. Landslides and mudslides: Prolonged rainfall can saturate the soil, leading to landslides where large amounts of earth, rock, and debris move down slopes. Mudslides are a related phenomenon, occurring when heavy rain turns soil into a moving mass of mud. Both landslides and mudslides can cause significant damage to property, infrastructure, and the environment. 5. Weathering: Wind and rain can cause chemical and mechanical weathering of rocks. Chemical weathering occurs when rainwater reacts with the minerals in rocks, causing them to decompose or change. Mechanical weathering is the physical breakdown of rocks by wind and rain, which is also related to the abrasion phenomenon mentioned earlier. 6. Air and water pollution: Rain can wash pollutants from the air, including industrial emissions and particulate matter, leading to polluted water sources. Wind, on the other hand, can disperse these pollutants over greater distances, affecting air quality on a larger scale. 7. Effects on ecosystems: Heavy wind and rain can have drastic impacts on ecosystems, such as coastal wetlands and forests, by altering habitats, redistributing nutrients, and affecting food sources. Moreover, intense windstorms, such as hurricanes or tornadoes, can uproot trees and destroy vegetation. In conclusion, while flooding is a significant outcome of wind and rain, it is not the only answer to the question \\"what do wind and rain cause?\\". By considering other effects like abrasion, soil erosion, landslides, mudslides, weathering, air and water pollution, and impacts on ecosystems, we can better understand the diverse ways in which wind and rain shape our environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Continue writing the following text. She did not have room for the sombrero in her suitcase because the","completion":"suitcase was already packed to the brim with clothes, toiletries, and other essentials for her long journey ahead. In fact, as she stood there staring at the colorful wide-brimmed hat, she couldn't help but feel a pang of frustration welling up inside her. The sombrero, with its vibrant patterns and playful tassels, had been a thoughtful gift from her best friend, Mariana, as a farewell token before she embarked on this once in a lifetime trip. For a moment, she contemplated the idea of pulling out a few items from the suitcase and attempting a repacking strategy to create space for the sombrero, but quickly shook her head at the impractical notion. Her suitcase was already bulging at the seams, and the clothing tightly packed like perfectly arranged Tetris pieces. Not to mention, she had spent hours meticulously packing and organizing it in the first place, making sure she had her outfits planned, and her essential items readily accessible. She glanced down at the sombrero again, running her fingers softly along the edge of the circular rim. The sombrero had come to represent a blend of her past, present, and future. It reflected the beautiful memories she had shared with Mariana back home in their tight-knit community and the cultural bond that would always connect them. Furthermore, it symbolized the exciting adventure that lay ahead in her travels, the new experiences she would accumulate, and the stories she would later have to share with Mariana. As she pondered in silence, she knew she couldn't just leave the sombrero behind to collect dust on a shelf, nor did she want to miss out on the warm nostalgia it would provide during her journey. She knew how much it meant to her, and she knew there had to be a solution. That's when inspiration struck her. She quickly rummaged through her carry-on bag and pulled out a large, sturdy carabiner – the one she had brought to secure her water bottle to her backpack during long hikes. With a jolt of newfound determination, she attached the carabiner to the crown strap of the sombrero, making sure it was secure and wouldn't slip off during the bustling airport hustle. Then, she took the free end of the carabiner and clipped it onto the handle of her suitcase. The sombrero now dangled comfortably on the side of her luggage, safely attached and easily accessible. A broad smile spread across her face as she marveled at her ingenuity and problem-solving skills. As she wheeled her suitcase out the door and towards the awaiting cab, the sombrero swung jauntily with each step, revealing glimpses of her colorful heritage and the bond she shared with Mariana. The sombrero's presence turned out to be a wonderful conversation starter with curious fellow travelers, locals, and even flight attendants. It became a symbol of friendship, pride, and adventure, accompanying her in every new landscape and experience, as if Mariana was with her in spirit, cheering her on. At every destination, she would take photos with her beloved sombrero, allowing it to be a constant reminder of the cherished memories and, at the same time, an integral part of her unfolding journey. And when she returned home, she would have even more stories to share, reunited with Mariana under the wide, protective brim of their unbreakable connection."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Starting with the carpeted areas, the person moves the vacuum cleaner back and forth methodically, ensuring that every inch is covered. The vacuum cleaner's brushes work diligently, reaching deep into the carpet fibers to extract dust, dirt, hair, and other debris that has become embedded over time. As the vacuum sucks up the particles, they are deposited into the vacuum cleaner's dustbin or bag, depending on its design. The person continues to guide the vacuum cleaner throughout the room, carefully navigating around furniture and other obstacles. Utilizing various attachments, such as crevice tools and upholstery brushes, the person makes sure to clean in and around these harder-to-reach areas. This helps to provide a thorough and comprehensive clean, removing allergens and health hazards that could accumulate in the environment over time. After finishing with the carpeted areas, the person transitions to the hardwood floors. Before proceeding, they might need to adjust the vacuum cleaner settings or change the brush roll to ensure that it is suitable for cleaning hard surfaces. Once prepared, the vacuum cleaner is guided across the hardwood floors, picking up dirt, dust, and debris in its path. Additionally, interlocking bristles sweep along edges and corners, removing more particles that could have escaped from the vacuum's suction area. Special care is taken not to scratch or damage the hardwood surfaces, as they are sensitive to abrasive materials and can be scratched easily. For this reason, the person might need to ensure that the vacuum cleaner's wheels and brushes are in good condition, and that they are free from any sharp or abrasive debris that could damage the floor. Throughout the entire process, the person may occasionally check the vacuum cleaner's dustbin or bag to ensure that it isn't full. If it is, they would need to empty or replace it to maintain the vacuum cleaner's efficiency and performance. This helps to prevent the vacuum from becoming overburdened and losing suction power during the cleaning process. Once the person is satisfied with the thoroughness of their vacuuming efforts, they turn off the machine by pressing the two buttons once again. They may also unplug the vacuum cleaner from the power outlet, if necessary. Finally, the vacuum cleaner is stored away, ready to tackle any cleaning challenges that the future may hold. In conclusion, when the person presses the two buttons on the vacuum cleaner, it leads to a comprehensive and thorough cleaning process of the carpeted and hardwood floor surfaces in the living space.

The Constitution provided for a \\"Kampuchean People's Representative Assembly\\" to be elected by secret ballot in direct general elections and a State Praesidium to be selected and appointed every five years by the KPRA. The KPRA met only once, a three-day session in April 1976. The members of the KPRA, however, were never elected; the Central Committee of the CPK appointed the chairman and other high officials both to it and to the State Praesidium. Plans for elections of members were discussed, but the 250 members of the KPRA were in fact appointed by the upper echelon of CPK. Democratic Kampuchea was an atheist state, but Buddhist influences still persisted. All religions were banned, and the repression of adherents of Islam, Christianity, and Buddhism was extensive. Nearly 25,000 Buddhist monks were massacred by the regime. In actual fact, all power belonged to the Standing Committee of CPK, the membership of which comprised the Secretary and Prime Minister Pol Pot, his Deputy Secretary Nuon Chea and seven others.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who questioned Kündinger about a music career for his son? from the following article ? Tchaikovsky was born in 1840 in Votkinsk, a small town in present-day Udmurtia, formerly the Imperial Russian province of Vyatka. A precocious pupil, he began piano lessons at the age of five, and could read music as adeptly as his teacher within three years. However, his parents' passion for his musical talent soon cooled. In 1850, the family decided to send Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. This establishment mainly served the lesser nobility or gentry, and would prepare him for a career as a civil servant. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12, Tchaikovsky was sent by his family to board at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school in Saint Petersburg, 800 miles (1,300 km) from his family home in Alapayevsk. Once Tchaikovsky came of age for acceptance, he was transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies.Music was not a priority at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.Tchaikovsky graduated on May 25, 1859 with the rank of titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder. On June 15, he was appointed to the Ministry of Justice in Saint Petersburg. Six months later he became a junior assistant and two months after that, a senior assistant.

Help as much as you can. Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Back in middle school, at least I think it was, I had art class. I didn’t particularly love it but it was interesting enough at the least to hold my attention. We got to class and the teacher pulled up a list of instructions on the projector. She had each of us follow the instructions and she gave us 20 minutes to complete all of them. It may even have been a bit of a race too, to see who finished it first. This becomes a lot more evident in a second. I can’t recall the exact details of the instructions, except that clearly it had to do with art such as having to draw a bunch of things. Anyways, we all went one by one down the instructions getting increasing nervous as to try to be the first one to finish. The class goes quiet while we work. Then I get to the last instruction which reads something along the lines of: “Step 15: Skip steps 1–14 and put your pencil down.” You gotta be freaking kidding me. We’re all so confused and mad at ourselves for not reading the whole of the instructions first. She turned this into a lesson for how we need to learn to read all the instructions first and then start, which was pretty clever. She got us! I remember this vividly to this day. But I look back now on this “prank” and I realize that she was kind of…wrong. Sure if the instructions are short like 15 steps it might be good to glance through before you start. But what about a whole load of instructions? Who the hell is going to read through the instructions for how to build their Death Star LEGO set before even starting to build it.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Creativity is the key to a brighter future, say education and business experts. Here is how schools and parents can encourage this important skill in children. If Dick Drew had listened to his boss in 1925, we might not have an important product: a new type of tape. Drew worked for the Minnesota Mining Company. At work he developed a kind of material strong enough to hold things together. But his boss told him not to think more about the idea. Finally, using his own time, Drew improved the tape, which now is used everywhere by many people. And his old company learned from its mistake. Now it encourages people to spend 15 percent of their work time just thinking and developing new ideas. Creativity is not something one is just born with, nor is it necessarily a character of high intelligence . Just because a person is highly intelligent does not mean that he uses it creatively. Creativity is the matter of using the resources one has to produce new ideas that are good for something. Unluckily, schools have not tried to encourage creativity. With strong attention to test results and the development of reading, writing and mathematical skills, many educators give up creativity for correct answers. The result is that children can give back information but can't recognize ways to use it in new situations. They may know the rules correctly, but they are unable to use them to work out practical problems. It is important to give children choices. From the earliest age, children should be allowed to make decisions and understand their results. Even if it's choosing between two kinds of food for lunch, decision-making helps thinking skills. As children grow older, parents should let their children decide how to use their time or spend their money, but not help them too much if they make the wrong decision. The child may have a hard time, but that is all right. This is because the most important character of creative people is a very strong desire to find a way out of trouble. Answer:","completion":"Which of the following statements is true about creativity according to the article? A) Creativity is solely based on intelligence and is an inborn trait. B) Schools have always prioritized creativity over test results. C) Dick Drew's boss encouraged him to continue working on his tape idea. D) Allowing children to make decisions and understand consequences helps develop thinking skills.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I read this background article the other day: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up. I am facing a new situation today: There are two cities, Chien and Marisol, in France that are leaders in the amount of wine they export to the rest of the world. Although they both export the same amount of wine, they use different sources of power to generate their electricity. Chien uses coal to power the city and Marisol uses nuclear power plants to produce electricity. The citizens of both cities are voting on whether to continue their current method of electricity generation. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Does Chien have a higher or lower chance of acid rain than Marisol? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Chien has a higher chance of acid rain than Marisol. This is because Chien relies on coal for its electricity generation, which involves burning fossil fuels. Burning fossil fuels like coal releases air pollution in the form of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). When these gases are released into the atmosphere, they react with water, oxygen, and other substances to form sulfuric and nitric acids. These acids then mix with raindrops and fall as acid rain. On the other hand, Marisol generates electricity through nuclear power plants, which do not release SO2 and NOx into the atmosphere. Nuclear energy is generated through nuclear reactions, rather than the combustion of fossil fuels. As a result, it does not produce the same pollutants that contribute to acid rain. So, given the information from the background article and the current situation, it is accurate to say that Chien, which relies on fossil fuels, has a higher chance of experiencing acid rain compared to Marisol, which uses nuclear power plants for electricity generation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Botany originated in prehistory as herbalism with the efforts of early humans to identify – and later cultivate – edible, medicinal and poisonous plants, making it one of the oldest branches of science. Medieval physic gardens, often attached to monasteries, contained plants of medical importance. They were forerunners of the first botanical gardens attached to universities, founded from the 1540s onwards. One of the earliest was the Padua botanical garden. These gardens facilitated the academic study of plants. Efforts to catalogue and describe their collections were the beginnings of plant taxonomy, and led in 1753 to the binomial system of Carl Linnaeus that remains in use to this day.","completion":"Task: Read the given passage and construct a question about the information present in the passage.

The New York police have 170 horses working in certain parts of the city. The horses are expensive to feed, but it is even more expensive to look after them. Because the horses must walk on the streets, they need special horseshoes. In fact , they need more than 8,000 of them each year. Every police horse in New York gets new shoes every month. Keeping these shoes in good repair is the job of six blacksmiths. There are only about thirty-five of these blacksmiths in the whole United States. The cost of shoing a horse is between twenty dollars and thirty-five dollars, and it takes a good blacksmith two or three hours to do the job. A blacksmith's job is not an easy one. He must be able to shape a shoe from a piece of metal and then fit it to the horse's foot. The blacksmith must bend over all the time when he is fitting the shoe and must hold the weight of the horse's leg while he works. Clearly, a blacksmith must be very storng. But even more important, he must be able to deal with horses---for before the blacksmith can begin his work, he has to get the horse to lift its leg. One of the blacksmiths in New York is James Corbin. He came to the country from Ireland in 1948. He not only makes horseshoes for the police but also works for a group of horse owners near the city.

You can choose any colors you love! Step 2: Making a Chain of Stitches Now, we are going to make a chain of stitches. This is like connecting loops of yarn together to make a pretty pattern. Hold the yarn and the crochet hook carefully, then practice looping the yarn around the hook and pulling it through. It's like making a row of bouncy, loopy caterpillars! Step 3: Connect the Chain with a Slipstitch When your chain is long enough, it's time to make a circle! We'll connect the two ends using a special stitch called a slipstitch. It's like giving your chain of loops a big, friendly hug! Ask your adult helper to show you how. Step 4: Single Crochet Around the Chain Now, the fun part begins! We will make our circle grow by doing a single crochet stitch all around the chain. This is like adding more layers of loops, making our circle nice and fluffy. Keep practicing your single crochet stitch - it's easy once you get the hang of it! Step 5: Continue to Single Crochet All Rounds Keep crocheting round and round until your circle gets as big as you want it to be! You're doing an amazing job creating your very own magical yarn circle! Remember, practice makes perfect. Step 6: Bind Off Now it's time to finish our circle. We need to \\"bind off\\" to keep everything in place. That means stopping the circle from growing while keeping the shape we've made. Your grown-up helper will show you how to do this. Step 7: Sew the Bottom Closed Lastly, ask your adult helper to sew the bottom closed with some more yarn and a needle. This will keep your circle looking nice and neat! Congratulations, you did it! You've made a lovely crochet circle all by yourself! You should be proud! Show off your beautiful creation to your friends and family. Now you know how to crochet - it's a special skill you can enjoy forever!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is the best way for a full-time employed foreigner in Asia (e.g. Singapore) to get an internationally recognised certification in Russian language? Which schools in Russia are recommended if the foreigner can get away from work for at most a month each time? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. They are two distinct questions addressing two different topics. The first question focuses on the preferences of Russian women regarding foreign races, while the second question is about obtaining an internationally recognized certification in the Russian language for someone residing in Asia. 1. Which is the most attractive foreign race for Russian women? It is important to note that individual preferences and attractions vary greatly, and generalizing an entire group of women by their attraction to specific races may not be accurate or fair. With that being said, there have been some general trends and observations in terms of international relationships in Russia. Historically, Russian women have been seen to be more attracted to men from Western Europe and North America due to cultural, educational, and socio-economic factors. However, in recent years, there has been an increasing interest in men from other regions such as Asia and the Middle East, largely due to globalization and increased exposure to various cultures. Attraction is a complex phenomenon, and factors such as personal experiences, upbringing, and cultural values can play a significant role in shaping an individual's preferences. Therefore, it is crucial to approach this question with sensitivity and the understanding that preferences may change over time and are highly subjective. 2. What is the best way for a full-time employed foreigner in Asia (e.g., Singapore) to get an internationally recognized certification in the Russian language? Which schools in Russia are recommended if the foreigner can get away from work for at most a month each time? There are several ways to obtain an internationally recognized certification in the Russian language, even for someone with a full-time job in Asia. Option 1: Online courses With the increasing popularity of online language courses, many institutions offer flexible and interactive courses that cater to busy professionals. As a full-time employee in Asia, you can enroll in an online Russian course that offers a recognized certification upon completion. Websites like Coursera, RussianforFree, and Russificate offer online courses and resources. Option 2: Language institutions in your area Another alternative is to search for language institutions or Russian cultural centers in your country, which may have in-person classes tailored to your schedule. For instance, in Singapore, organizations like the Russian-Singapore Business Council offer Russian language courses. Option 3: Intensive courses in Russia If you can get a month off work, you may consider attending an intensive Russian language course at a reputable school in Russia. Some of the well-regarded schools for Russian language study include: - Moscow State University (MSU) – Center of International Education - St. Petersburg State University – Russian Language and Culture Institute - Lomonosov Moscow State Linguistic University - Russian Language School at Liden & Denz in Moscow and St. Petersburg - Derzhavin Institute in St. Petersburg These institutions usually offer courses tailored for different skill levels, from beginners to advanced learners, and provide options for accommodation during the program. It is essential to research the schools and their course offerings, fees, and schedules to find the best fit for your needs. It would be helpful to contact each school for information on their programs, scheduling flexibility, and certification options. To obtain an internationally recognized certification, consider taking the Test of Russian as a Foreign Language (TORFL) exam. TORFL is accepted by Russian universities, educational institutions, and employers. It has six competence levels, ranging from Elementary proficiency (A1) to Native-speaker proficiency (C2). In conclusion, while the two questions may seem related due to their association with Russian women and the Russian language, they address two distinct topics. They cannot be considered paraphrases of each other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How does the sentence end? See options at the end The sidewalks contained a lot of litter, so Jeremy walked on the road instead because the OPTIONS: (a). road was dirty. (b). sidewalk was dirty.","completion":"Based on the context given in the sentence, it would be appropriate to end the sentence with option (b) \\"sidewalk was dirty.\\" Here's why: \\"The sidewalks contained a lot of litter, so Jeremy walked on the road instead because the sidewalk was dirty.\\" This sentence tells a small story. At the beginning, Jeremy encounters sidewalks that are full of trash. For Jeremy, the state of the sidewalks is uncomfortable or unsafe to traverse, which the sentence expresses by mentioning that they \\"contained a lot of litter.\\" The sidewalk's trash-filled conditions likely made it appear not only visually displeasing but also inconvenient for pedestrians like Jeremy, creating potential hazards such as risk of slipping, twisting an ankle, or stepping on something harmful. Therefore, the sentence tells us that Jeremy made a decision based on the condition of the sidewalks: he opted to walk on the road instead. The reason \\"because the sidewalk was dirty\\" reflects back onto the initial description of the sidewalks (full of litter), reinforcing why Jeremy chose not to walk there - it was dirty. This provides a solid logical and rational connection between his action (walking on the road) and the condition of the sidewalk, making it more natural and reasonable in the given context. Conversely, if we selected option (a), the sentence would read: \\"The sidewalks contained a lot of litter, so Jeremy walked on the road instead because the road was dirty.\\" This doesn't make a lot of sense because it is contradictory. If the road was also dirty, it's unlikely Jeremy would choose to walk there as an alternative to the dirty sidewalk. So, option (b) \\"sidewalk was dirty\\" fits better logically and in coherence with the remaining parts of the sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He takes some mysterious pills, then calls one of his wife's friends, Susie (Molly Price), confusedly asking whether he should be worried. Susie suggests that he call the local hospital, but they have no record of his wife being admitted. After further consulting Susie, he decides to call the police. When Detective Derm (Gil Bellows) arrives, Derm takes pills similar to Saxon's. They check her workplace and listen to some messages on the answering machine. George Simian (Julian McMahon) has left a message, inquiring about his wife, and Derm remarks that her abandoned car was found near Simian's house. Saxon also has to deal with the college, annoyed that he didn't show up to teach his class, which leads one of his students, Sadie (Emily Bergl), to also leave a message. Saxon suffers a series of hallucinations and blackouts, advancing time quickly. In short time, he receives increasingly irritated calls from work, which he blows off; an abusive phone call from George Simian, followed by a physical altercation; and a visit by Sadie, concerned about his unexplained absences. Saxon declines to tell Sadie about his missing wife, instead telling her that his wife is visiting her mother. Sadie collapses in the bathroom, bloodying her nose, and complains of having heard a woman scream. Saxon explains that the neighbors, who fight often, can sometimes be heard from his house, and he gives her a change of clothes. After she leaves, Derm returns, wanting to search the house for clues. Sadie's bloody shirt is discovered by Derm, who seems satisfied with Saxon's explanation. Derm also finds a diary, which Saxon didn't know his wife kept. In it, Saxon's wife expresses mixed emotions for her husband, including pity, contempt, and fear. Despite his promise to give the diary to Derm, Saxon burns the diary. Geoffrey Costas (Zach Grenier), a psychiatrist who leads a victim support group, visits Saxon, offering him comfort. Saxon initially declines, before soliciting stronger medication, to fight off long-term insomnia. Despite the strong medication, Saxon does not seem to fall asleep, though he suffers more blackouts and apparent hallucinations. Sadie returns to his house, concerned that he has missed more classes, but Susie interrupts them. Saxon angrily brushes aside Susie's concerns and explains that Sadie is just a student. After he gets rid of Susie, Sadie expresses her feelings of loneliness and isolation, as well as admiration for Saxon's poetry. This leads to an abortive tryst, which Saxon abruptly calls off. Humiliated and confused, Sadie leaves. Derm calls Saxon to reveal that they've discovered his wife's body. Depressed, Saxon welcomes the chance to talk to Costas again. They discuss how traumatic events can lead to inappropriate guilt, and Costas convinces Saxon to allow him to speak to the police, on his behalf. However, the police reveal that they have not discovered the wife's body, after all, leading both Costas and Derm to suspect Saxon. Saxon has further hallucinations, leading him to suspect himself, as well. Simian, who had been arrested previously for assaulting Saxon, returns to Saxon's house again, enraged and seeking to kill Saxon. Saxon instead kills Simian, and, consumed with guilt, swallows every pill that he can find. Derm, arriving at the house afterward, kneels down, in front of Saxon, while Saxon denies killing anyone. The bathtub then overflows with blood, and Saxon sees his wife playing the piano.

What is the answer to this question? when do we need to revisit bcp plan and strategy?","completion":"Revisiting and updating a Business Continuity Planning (BCP) strategy is a crucial step in ensuring that an organization remains prepared and resilient in the face of emergencies, disasters, and other unexpected situations. A BCP plan involves identifying potential risks and vulnerabilities, assessing the impact on business functions, and developing measures to minimize or mitigate the effects of those disruptions. It's essential to regularly update and revisit the BCP plan and strategy to ensure its effectiveness and relevance. Here are key situations and circumstances when an organization may need to revisit their BCP plan and strategy: 1. Changes in the Business Environment: The business environment is constantly evolving due to technological advancements, new competitors, changing regulations, and emerging risks. Whenever significant changes in the business environment occur, it's essential to reevaluate the BCP plan to ensure the continuity of critical business operations. 2. Actual Disruptions to the Business: After the occurrence of an actual disruption event, it's vital to revisit the BCP plan and conduct a post-event review. This helps identify any weaknesses or areas for improvement and allows for adjustments to be made to minimize the effects of similar incidents in the future. 3. Regulatory Requirements: Some industries and jurisdictions may require businesses to maintain and update their BCP plans regularly. Companies must comply with these regulations to avoid penalties, maintain their reputation, and ensure they remain eligible for insurance coverage. 4. Internal Changes: Changes in personnel, organizational structure, business operations, or processes may also trigger the need for a BCP plan review. An updated plan should reflect these changes to guarantee that all stakeholders involved are aware of their roles and responsibilities in a crisis. 5. Changes in Key Suppliers or Third-Party Relationships: Organizations often rely on relationships with key suppliers and third parties for essential operations. Changes in these relationships may necessitate revisiting the BCP strategy to ensure that any dependencies or potential single points of failure are addressed. 6. Audit and Governance Requirements: Internal or external audit requirements may also necessitate revisiting the BCP plan. An audit can reveal gaps or shortcomings in the current strategy and provide opportunities for further refinement. 7. Technological Upgrades: Organizations must ensure that their BCP strategy remains aligned with the latest technology and IT systems. As organizations upgrade, acquire, or decommission new technologies, they must assess the potential impact on their BCP plan. 8. Periodic Review Schedule: Finally, a best-practice approach to maintaining an effective BCP plan involves setting a periodic review schedule. Revisiting the strategy and plan annually, or as deemed necessary based on an organization's risk profile, will help ensure that the BCP remains relevant, up-to-date, and effective as the business evolves over time. In conclusion, it's crucial for organizations to revisit their BCP plan and strategy under various circumstances to ensure preparedness and resilience. By keeping the plan up-to-date and iterating on it regularly, businesses can minimize the impacts of disruptions and maintain their competitive edge in an unpredictable world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It’s quite uncommon, but essentially I can get an excruciating migraine in my arm, leg, etc., on top of getting them in my head/temples. For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as “beeping.” Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better.

Now I’m considering finally getting my license (considering - I still don’t like being behind the wheel), I don’t double over in white hot pain randomly anymore, and when I do get a cluster headache, I can still function. It almost sounds a little silly, but really, they were crippling, and being able to work through them on my own? It’s the greatest gift I’ve given to myself.

Finally, in case C, the bacteria does not develop any immunity to antibiotics and eventually perishes. and a hint : Many mutations have no effect on the proteins they encode. These mutations are considered neutral. Occasionally, a mutation may make a protein even better than it was before. Or the protein might help the organism adapt to a new environment. These mutations are considered beneficial. An example is a mutation that helps bacteria resist antibiotics. Bacteria with the mutation increase in numbers, so the mutation becomes more common. Other mutations are harmful. They may even be deadly. Harmful mutations often result in a protein that no longer can do its job. Some harmful mutations cause cancer or other genetic disorders. Please answer this question : In which case there would be some effect, case A or case B? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Case B. In the given situation, case A represents a scenario where bacteria do not respond to antibiotics, meaning that the antibiotics have no effect on the bacteria. This could be due to neutral mutations that neither benefit nor harm the organism. In case B, the bacteria resist antibiotics, which indicates that some mutations have occurred, leading to the development of antibiotic resistance.

Weymouth originated as a settlement on a constricted site to the south and west of Weymouth Harbour, an outlying part of Wyke Regis. The town developed from the mid 12th century onwards, but was not noted until the 13th century. By 1252 it was established as a seaport and became a chartered borough. Melcombe Regis developed separately on the peninsula to the north of the harbour; it was mentioned as a licensed wool port in 1310. French raiders found the port so accessible that in 1433 the staple was transferred to Poole. Melcombe Regis is thought to be the first port at which the Black Death came into England in June 1348, possibly either aboard a spice ship or an army ship. In their early history Weymouth and Melcombe Regis were rivals for trade and industry, but the towns were united in an Act of Parliament in 1571 to form a double borough. Both towns have become known as Weymouth, despite Melcombe Regis being the main centre. The villages of Upwey, Broadwey, Preston, Wyke Regis, Chickerell, Southill, Radipole and Littlemoor have become part of the built-up area. King Henry VIII had two Device Forts built to protect the south Dorset coast from invasion in the 1530s: Sandsfoot Castle in Wyke Regis and Portland Castle in Castletown. Parts of Sandsfoot have fallen into the sea due to coastal erosion. During the English Civil War, around 250 people were killed in the local Crabchurch Conspiracy in February 1645. In 1635, on board the ship Charity, around 100 emigrants from the town crossed the Atlantic Ocean and settled in Weymouth, Massachusetts. More townspeople emigrated to the Americas to bolster the population of Weymouth, Nova Scotia and Salem, Massachusetts; then called Naumking. There are memorials to this on the side of Weymouth Harbour and near to Weymouth Pavilion and Weymouth Sea Life Tower. The architect Sir Christopher Wren was the Member of Parliament for Weymouth in 1702, and controlled nearby Portland's quarries from 1675 to 1717.

With a Caribbean cruise with friends booked for November and a job she loves, Ashley Kurpiel, 31, considers herself lucky. But the Essex-born naturalised American has struggled all her life with a condition that is slowly turning her muscles into solid bone - and has already cost her her right arm. Now, the 31-year-old is hoping to experience as much of life as she can before her muscles seize up for good. Brave: Ashley (right) is slowly losing her ability to move thanks to a disease turning her muscles into bone. Lucky: Ashley, who has already lost an arm to the condition, says she is happy her jaw hasn't locked. Ashley is one of an estimated 700 people worldwide with Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP), an incurable disease sometimes known as 'stone man syndrome' because its devastating effects can leave sufferers completely immobilised, like living statues. 'My condition has made me who I am - an optimistic person with an inner strength and determination to succeed,' said Ashley. 'If I want to do something, then I normally find a way to do it. I don't know how much longer I will have movement in my body, so I want to experience as much as I can now. 'In other cases of FOP people have frozen solid, their jaws locking shut. They can't move and have to talk through their teeth long before they get to my age. So I actually feel extremely lucky.' The condition arises from a mutation of the body's repair mechanism which causes muscles, tendons and ligaments to convert to bone material when damaged. Ashley, whose mother Carol emigrated to Georgia from Hornchurch in Essex before she was born, was diagnosed with the condition when she was three years old - six months after her right arm was amputated by surgeons who wrongly suspected she had cancer. Childhood: Ashley, pictured with her mother Carol, was initially diagnosed with cancer at the age of three. Ambassador: Ashley now hopes to raise awareness of her condition and met the Dalai Lama in 2007. 'During my childhood my mobility was fine, because I was still young,' she added. 'But I was quite unhappy. I felt very different from the other children at school, and I didn't have many friends. I was quite shy and kept myself to myself. It wasn't much of a life.' Her symptoms first began to show when she was a teenager, with gradual muscle stiffening accelerating as she grew older. 'I began to feel my body stiffen gradually. I knew I was finally facing the onset of the condition,' she remembers. 'I'd been told what was going to happen, and feeling the first symptoms made me want to experience everything life had to offer - before it was too late.' She married Shawn Keeney, 31, a man she met online, but the pair divorced in 2005 after three years of marriage. 'I'm still on good terms with Shawn and I look back on our time together with nothing but fondness,' says Ashley. Video source YouTube HitTheResetButton. Achievement: Ashley was able to complete a five kilometre surfing course using a specially adapted board. Proud: Ashley wants to do as much as she possibly can before her ability to move is completely lost. 'Walking down the aisle, with full use of my limbs, was one of the happiest days of my life, and no one can take that memory away from me.' Despite her happy memories, in May 2006, Ashley's life took a turn for the worse after she was involved in a serious car crash. She escaped without any broken bones but her right leg took a heavy impact. 'My doctor warned me that just the slightest bump could trigger the FOP to take hold. After the smash I fully expected my leg to freeze up permanently,' said Ashley. 'One of my worst fears was that my body would fuse upright, meaning I'd never be able to sit again. 'When my leg locked in a standing position I was sure I was facing a worst-case scenario. Luckily when the swelling went down I was able to bend the leg slightly. 'I spent a lot of time sitting in the hope it would fuse in that position. At least then I could sit in a wheelchair and be wheeled around.' Her leg locked into a bent position permanently in May 2007, and Ashley was fitted with a special platform shoe to help her maintain as much mobility as possible. Since the setback, Ashley has been determined to do more with her life and so far, has learned to surf and completed a five kilometre course in a specially-adapted wheelchair in August last year. She has also become a full-time ambassador for amputees and families affected by the FOP and in December she is going on a Caribbean cruise with 100 friends who are amputees. 'I've been blessed to meet so many truly amazing people, especially the Dalai Lama - that was a real honour,' said Ashley of the religious leader, whom she met in 2007. 'I feel so humbled that so many people have taken an interest, and hopefully found some inspiration, in my life.'

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: What shakes the priest's faith in humanity? Movie plot title: Rashomon Movie plot: The film opens on a woodcutter (æ¨æ¨µã; Kikori, played by Takashi Shimura) and a priest (ææ³å¸«; Tabi HÅshi, Minoru Chiaki) sitting beneath the RajÅmon city gate to stay dry in a downpour. A commoner (Kichijiro Ueda) joins them and they tell him that they have witnessed a disturbing story, which they then begin recounting to him. The woodcutter claims he found the body of a murdered samurai three days earlier while looking for wood in the forest; upon discovering the body, he says, he fled in a panic to notify the authorities. The priest says that he saw the samurai with his wife traveling the same day the murder happened. Both men were then summoned to testify in court, where they met the captured bandit TajÅmaru (å¤è¥ä¸¸), who claimed responsibility for killing the samurai and raping his wife. The bandit's story[edit] TajÅmaru (Toshiro Mifune), a notorious brigand, claims that he tricked the samurai to step off the mountain trail with him and look at a cache of ancient swords he discovered. In the grove he tied the samurai to a tree, then brought the samurai's wife there. She initially tried to defend herself with a dagger, but was eventually \\"seduced\\" by the bandit. The woman, filled with shame, then begged him to duel to the death with her husband, to save her from the guilt and shame of having two men know her dishonor. TajÅmaru honorably set the samurai free and dueled with him. In TajÅmaru's recollection they fought skillfully and fiercely, but in the end TajÅmaru was the victor and the woman ran away. At the end of the story to the court, he is asked about an expensive dagger owned by the samurai's wife: he says that, in the confusion, he forgot all about it, and that it was foolish of him to leave behind such a valuable object. The wife's story[edit] The samurai's wife (Machiko KyÅ) tells a different story to the court. She says that TajÅmaru left after raping her. She begged her husband to forgive her, but he simply looked at her coldly. She then freed him and begged him to kill her... A:","completion":"In the movie Rashomon, what shakes the priest's faith in humanity is the varying and conflicting accounts of the events surrounding the murder of the samurai and the assault on his wife. Each person involved — the bandit Tajōmaru, the wife, and even the samurai (through a medium) — provides a different version of events, making it difficult to determine the truth. This challenges the priest's faith because it exposes the complexity and unreliability of human nature, as well as the tendency for people to be dishonest or present their version of events to portray themselves in a better light. Furthermore, the characters' selfishness, dishonesty, and willingness to manipulate or harm others for their own gain contribute to the priest's disillusionment with humanity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The lyrics of both \\"Son of Three\\" and \\"The She\\" suggest extended road trips with unknown outcomes. The album's next song, \\"Put on a Side\\", has a distinctive bassline and a cramped, repressive feel.

What is the last name of the person who was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his? Answer the above question based on the context below: The two sides to Poulenc's musical nature caused misunderstanding during his life and have continued to do so. The composer Ned Rorem observed, \\"He was deeply devout and uncontrollably sensual\\"; this still leads some critics to underrate his seriousness. His uncompromising adherence to melody, both in his lighter and serious works, has similarly caused some to regard him as unprogressive. Although he was not much influenced by new developments in music, Poulenc was always keenly interested in the works of younger generations of composers. Lennox Berkeley recalled, \\"Unlike some artists, he was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his. I remember him playing me the records of Boulez's Le marteau sans maître with which he was already familiar when that work was much less well-known than it is today.\\" Boulez did not take a reciprocal view, remarking in 2010, \\"There are always people who will take an easy intellectual path. Poulenc coming after Sacre [du Printemps]. It was not progress.\\" Other composers have found more merit in Poulenc's work; Stravinsky wrote to him in 1931: \\"You are truly good, and that is what I find again and again in your music\\".In his last years Poulenc observed, \\"if people are still interested in my music in 50 years' time it will be for my Stabat Mater rather than the Mouvements perpétuels.\\" In a centenary tribute in The Times Gerald Larner commented that Poulenc's prediction was wrong, and that in 1999 the composer was widely celebrated for both sides of his musical character: \\"both the fervent Catholic and the naughty boy, for both the Gloria and Les Biches, both Les Dialogues des Carmélites and Les Mamelles de Tirésias.\\" At around the same time the writer Jessica Duchen described Poulenc as \\"a fizzing, bubbling mass of Gallic energy who can move you to both laughter and tears within seconds.

The bowling average is one of a number of statistics used to compare bowlers in the sport of cricket. It is the ratio of runs conceded per wickets taken, meaning that the lower the bowling average is, the better the bowler is performing. The bowling average is commonly used alongside the economy rate and the strike rate to judge the overall performance of a bowler. Where a bowler has taken only a small number of wickets, their average can be artificially low, and an increase in wickets taken can result in large changes in their bowling average. Due to this, qualification caveats are generally applied to determine career records for bowling averages. After applying these criteria, George Lohmann holds the record for the lowest average in Test cricket, having claimed 112 wickets at an average of 10.75. A cricketer's bowling average is calculated by dividing the numbers of runs they have conceded by the number of wickets they have taken. The number of runs conceded by a bowler is determined as the total number of runs that the opposing side have scored while the bowler was bowling, excluding any byes, leg byes, or penalty runs. The bowler receives credit for any wickets taken during their bowling that are either bowled, caught, hit wicket, leg before wicket or stumped. Answer this series of questions: 1.

We can get many different kinds of newspapers in big cities, but in some mountain villages we can see few newspapers. Some newspapers are published once a week, but most of the papers are published once a day with many pages, some even published twice a day!

If \\"The person towards the right is wearing riot uniform while people seem to be filing out.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A police officer is clearing out some protesters by using his riot shield.\\"?","completion":"From the given statement, \\"The person towards the right is wearing riot uniform while people seem to be filing out\\", we can only derive some information about the scene being described. However, we cannot definitively conclude that \\"A police officer is clearing out some protesters by using his riot shield\\" based solely on this information. To examine the situation further, let's break down the information provided in the initial statement: 1. A person towards the right is wearing a riot uniform. 2. People seem to be filing out. Now, let's analyze the information within the suggested conclusion: \\"A police officer is clearing out some protesters by using his riot shield.\\" 1. The subject is specifically identified as a police officer. 2. The people being referred to are identified as protesters. 3. The action being performed is clearing out protesters. 4. The means used to perform this action is a riot shield. Connecting the information given in the first statement to the conclusion suggested, there are several gaps, and assumptive leaps would have to be made to arrive at that conclusion. Firstly, the person wearing a riot uniform could indeed be a police officer, but it could also be a member of another law enforcement or security group. The mere presence of a riot uniform does not explicitly identify the individual's profession as a police officer. Secondly, the fact that people are filing out does not necessarily imply that they are protesters. They could be bystanders, attendees to an event, or simply individuals who happen to be present in the area. It would be speculative to confirm that they are protesters based just on the information provided. Moreover, the initial statement does not mention any specific actions being taken by the person wearing a riot uniform. The conclusion assumes that the individual is actively clearing out people (presumed to be protesters), yet the original statement provides no indication of such a course of action. Lastly, the conclusion specifically highlights the use of a riot shield. While it is true that riot shields are often used by police officers in riot control situations, the initial statement makes no mention of a riot shield. Given these gaps and uncertainties, we cannot logically conclude that \\"A police officer is clearing out some protesters by using his riot shield\\" based solely on the provided statement. More information would be necessary to substantiate the suggested conclusion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Context: Portugal's colonial history has long since been a cornerstone of its national identity, as has its geographic position at the south-western corner of Europe, looking out into the Atlantic Ocean. It was one of the last western colonial European powers to give up its overseas territories (among them Angola and Mozambique in 1975), turning over the administration of Macau to the People's Republic of China at the end of 1999. Consequently, it has both influenced and been influenced by cultures from former colonies or dependencies, resulting in immigration from these former territories for both economic and/or personal reasons. Portugal, long a country of emigration (the vast majority of Brazilians have Portuguese ancestry), has now become a country of net immigration, and not just from the last Indian (Portuguese until 1961), African (Portuguese until 1975), and Far East Asian (Portuguese until 1999) overseas territories. An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country's African possessions gained independence in 1975. By 2007, Portugal had 10,617,575 inhabitants of whom about 332,137 were legal immigrants. Answer:","completion":"Portugal controlled India until 1961."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But recent findings offer good news for older people and for people worried about getting older. Researchers found that people become happier and experience less worry after they reach the age of fifty. In fact, they say by the age of eighty-five, people are happier with their life than they were when they were eighteen years old. The findings came from a survey of more than three hundred forty thousand adults in the United States. The Gallup Organization questioned them by telephone in 2008. At that time, the people were between the ages of eighteen and eighty-five. The researchers asked questions about emotions like happiness, sadness and worry. They also asked about mental or emotional stress. Arthur Stone in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science at Stony Brook University in New York led the study. His team found that levels of stress were highest among adults between the ages of twenty-two and twenty-five. The findings showed that stress levels dropped sharply after people reached their fifties. The study also showed that men and women have similar feeling patterns as they grow older. However, women at all ages reported more sadness, stress and worry than men. Researchers say they do not know why happiness increases as people get older. One theory is that, as people grow older, they grow older, they grow more thankful for what they have and have better control of their feelings. They also spend less time thinking about bad experiences. Professor Stone says the emotional patterns could be linked to changes in how people see the world, or maybe even changes in brain chemistry. The researchers also considered possible influences like having young children, being unemployed or being single. But they found that influences like these did not affect the levels of happiness and well-being related to age. Question: According to Arthur Stone, old people _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"have a positive attitude toward their life\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, according to Arthur Stone, old people have a positive attitude toward their life. The study led by Arthur Stone found that people become happier and experience less worry after they reach the age of fifty, and by the age of eighty-five, people are happier with their life than they were when they were eighteen years old. This suggests that older individuals tend to have a more positive attitude towards their lives as they age. The researchers theorize that people may grow more thankful for what they have, have better control of their feelings, and spend less time thinking about bad experiences as they get older, contributing to this increase in happiness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The film is based on a story written by Valentine Davies. The storyline revolves around Kris Kringle, an endearing older gentleman who is hired to be a department store Santa Claus at Macy's in New York City. He becomes incredibly popular with the shoppers and wins the hearts of many--except for the store's event director, Doris Walker (played by Maureen O'Hara), who is quite skeptical about Christmas and its miracles. Kris Kringle, portrayed by Edmund Gwenn, asserts that he is the real Santa Claus. The declaration catches the attention of the media and the public, eventually leading to a dramatic court case to determine his authenticity. Throughout the ordeal, Mr. Kringle continues to spread the spirit of Christmas by reminding everyone about the importance of love, kindness, and belief. Edmund Gwenn's remarkable performance in \\"Miracle on 34th Street\\" earned him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in 1948. His portrayal of Kris Kringle left a lasting impact on audiences and has become one of the most iconic representations of Santa Claus in American popular culture.

To live a happy, healthy, balanced life, you must learn to focus your energy on well-being. Self-care on all levels should be an integral part of your lifestyle. There is an abundance of information available about the benefits of eating well and exercising regularly to sustain a healthy mind and body. In fact, I write about both regularly. But today I want to move in a little different direction. In addition to those two very basic and critical activities, there are a number of other things you can to improve your mental health and overall well-being. By incorporating them into your daily life, you will be better able to manage most challenges – including struggles with self-doubt, anxiety, and mild depression. Practices that Focus Your Energy on Well-being Accept Your Feelings Stuffing or ignoring your emotions is more damaging than it is helpful. Everyone has emotions. They are a natural part of being human. Bottling them up may seem like a good solution in the moment, but when you do it all the time, you are potentially creating a time bomb that will eventually explode. Unfortunately, you are hurting yourself as you hold them in and you run the risk of hurting those you love when the eruption finally occurs. Rather than acknowledging what you are feeling and allowing yourself to experience emotions, you may medicate, rationalize, blame, bury, deny, smother, drink, or stuff them (pretend they don’t exist). Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them – especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness. It takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety. Don’t stuff your emotions! Let yourself laugh, cry, scream, yell, or pound something (preferably a pillow, grass, sand – not the wall or someone else). Do whatever you need to do, probably in private is the best choice. But, if emotions erupt in public, excuse yourself and let it rip. This is nature’s way of releasing stress. Don’t beat yourself...

News article: Five laws for DIY interior design On my bookshelf is a 1956 DIY guide from Better Homes and Gardens. Its title is as practical and straightforward as the homes from that era: Decorating Book. The interiors in the photos are fascinating and nostalgic, and there are plenty of quaint touches, like an illustration of a husband and wife brandishing their favorite \\"accessories\\": hers are a framed picture, a lamp and a potted plant; his a trophy, a ship in a bottle and a rifle. Of course, this was long before there were terms like man cave. But the fact is, this book has much of the same basic advice designers are touting today, because these are the universal rules that help regular people create the interiors they really want. (And funnily enough, it seems like everyone wants to live in a 1956-excuse me, Midcentury-interior again, but perhaps without the firearms.) If you hired a professional designer to transform your living room, they wouldn't start by asking what colors you like or what style you have in mind. They would ask you, \\"What do you do in this room?\\" Successful interior design revolves around use. A finished interior can look completely fabulous, but if it doesn't suit the way you live in the space, it just won't work. It's also important to be realistic. If you have young kids, for example, don't plan on things staying where they belong or games being played in their designated areas. (But why am I telling you this? You have young kids. You know what it's like.) The point is, don't try to make the lifestyle fit the design scheme; do it the other way around. This is along the lines of the popular advice, \\"choose a theme,\\" but the real goal is to define your tastes and vision much more clearly than saying you'd like a French Country living room or an Asian-inspired bedroom. It helps to actually put your theme in writing. Define how should the room feel-is it a traditional masculine social space with all but the whiff of pipe smoke or is it light, smart and airy, like a Scandinavian family room? All of the stuff you put into the space (and how you arrange it) will either support or detract from the theme, so establishing a keen sense of your direction early in the process is critical to making the best style and purchasing decisions. For many DIY designers, it can help to focus on an object that symbolizes the theme or look you're after. This could be a favorite furnishing, a family heirloom or a piece you lucked into at thrift store that just does something for you. Or, if you're handy, create something that fits. My wife and I designed and built a sofa table that nicely characterizes our design scheme (and at the right price, of course). It's clean, modern and practical, and it has reproduction \\"hairpin\\" legs that were popular at the time when our house was built. I know from personal experience how much it hurts to hear this when you're on a tight budget, but it must be said: Furnishings are the building blocks of a room. Yes, a focal point is important. So are colors and accessories, but those are things you look at; furniture is what you live on. Nothing can make or break a design plan more effectively than furniture. This is because furniture is so many things in one: look, function, texture, style and form. It's both the traffic cop and host; it directs movement through the space and invites people to sit, lie down, cozy up or maintain a comfortable distance. So, before you spend money on any significant elements for an interior, make sure you have the right furniture pieces (or at least the most crucial ones) in place. You don't have to spend a lot of money, either. My favorite piece in our living room (not counting the sofa table) is a 70 Poang chair from IKEA. Apartment Therapy recently published a tour of a modern rustic home in Los Angeles's Mar Vista enclave. Although it features the work of an amazing Los Angeles carpenter, it's the furniture in the sparse but warm-feeling design scheme that really make it work. 4. Coordinate, at Any Level Some folks like things matchy-matchy, while others want anything but an overly \\"perfect\\" look. But even if you're in the latter camp, it's important to have at least some threads of continuity in a design scheme. This can be as subtle as throw pillows that match or complement colors in a prominent piece of wall art. Most guests might not even notice the connection, but it is there, and it helps legitimize the aesthetic scheme. Consider this before you select just any can of paint and start painting. Two of the biggest challenges of doing your own design work are: 1) knowing what's out there and 2) knowing what you like. It's important to remember that interior designers, as with all creative professionals, weren't just born with the ability to do what they do. They've had years of practice and training, exposure to countless ideas and, perhaps most importantly, lots of feedback from others. When you're designing your own interiors, getting some of that experience is up to you. There's a ton of free and inexpensive help out there for DIY designers: online resources for finding ideas and products, choosing colors and textures and asking experts for advice, plus catalogs, magazines and books tailored for every style (and budget) imaginable. Keep in mind that you can also hire a local designer for help with specific aspects of your project. For example, a one-hour color consultation can yield a complete color plan for one or several rooms for the price of a few gallons of good paint. Philip Schmidt writes for Networx.

Letters of introduction from Paris proved effective; on 27 April 1764, four days after their arrival, the children were playing before King George III and his 19-year-old German queen, Charlotte Sophia. A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th. This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as \\"a way to earn the love of this very special nation\\".

(CNN) -- A previously unknown piano work by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was performed Friday at the maestro's home in Salzburg, the Salzburg Mozarteum Foundation said. The piece, recently unearthed in Austria, was played by noted pianist Florian Birsak. It was discovered in an attic of a private home in Tyrol, the foundation said, inside a handwritten book with more than 160 pages. Works by Mozart's father were found within the same book. The piece, 84 measures in length, is marked \\"Allegro molto\\" -- meaning it is meant to be played \\"very quick.\\" It is thought to date from around 1767, which would mean Mozart wrote the work when he was about 11 years old. \\"Throughout the OPTIONS: - Allegro molto, thematic formation, compositional setting and harmony have a number of components that are found repeated in other Mozart piano works,\\" the foundation said in a statement. - Austria, thematic formation, compositional setting and harmony have a number of components that are found repeated in other Mozart piano works,\\" the foundation said in a statement. - CNN, thematic formation, compositional setting and harmony have a number of components that are found repeated in other Mozart piano works,\\" the foundation said in a statement. - Florian Birsak, thematic formation, compositional setting and harmony have a number of components that are found repeated in other Mozart piano works,\\" the foundation said in a statement. - Mozart, thematic formation, compositional setting and harmony have a number of components that are found repeated in other Mozart piano works,\\" the foundation said in a statement. - Salzburg, thematic formation, compositional setting and harmony have a number of components that are found repeated in other Mozart piano works,\\" the foundation said in a statement. - Salzburg Mozarteum Foundation, thematic formation, compositional setting and harmony have a number of components that are found repeated in other Mozart piano works,\\" the foundation said in a statement. - Tyrol, thematic formation, compositional setting and harmony have a number of components that are found repeated in other Mozart piano works,\\" the foundation said in a statement. - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, thematic formation, compositional setting and harmony have a number of components that are found repeated in other Mozart piano works,\\" the foundation said in a statement.","completion":"\\"Throughout the Allegro molto, thematic formation, compositional setting and harmony have a number of components that are found repeated in other Mozart piano works,\\" the foundation said in a statement.

Here is a news article: An elderly man passes by a collapsed building after a powerful earthquake in the town of Ercis in Van province, Turkey, Monday, Oct. 24, 2011. The 7.2-magnitude quake which struck Sunday killed some... (Associated Press) A 2-week-old baby girl on Tuesday was pulled alive from the rubble of an apartment building 72 hours after a 7.2-magnitude earthquake rocked eastern Turkey, flattening more than 2,000 buildings and leaving at least 366 people dead. Television footage showed rescuers in orange jumpsuits clapping as the baby, Azra Karaduman, was removed from the wreckage. A rescuer cradled the naked baby, who was wrapped in a blanket and handed over to a medic. Rescuers in two cities, Ercis and Van, are still struggling to pull out people trapped inside mounds of concrete, twisted steel and construction debris. Authorities have warned survivors not to enter damaged buildings and thousands of people spent a second night outdoors in cars or tents in near-freezing conditions, afraid to return to their homes. Some 1,300 people were injured. Dogan news agency said rescuers had pulled five people out of the rubble alive in the early hours of Tuesday, although many more bodies were discovered. In the hardest-hit city of Ercis, 9-year-old Oguz Isler was trapped for eight hours beneath the rubble of a relative's home. He was finally rescued, but on Tuesday he was waiting at the foot of the same pile of debris for news of his parents and of other relatives who remain buried inside. The boy waited calmly in front of what was left of the five-story apartment block that used to be his aunt's home. The city of 75,000, close to the Iranian border, lies in one of Turkey's most earthquake-prone zones. Turkish rescue workers in bright orange jumpsuits and Azerbaijani military rescuers in camouflage uniforms searched through the debris, using excavators, picks and shovels to look for Isler's mother and father and other relatives still inside. Dogs sniffed for possible survivors in gaps that opened up as their work progressed. \\"They should send more people,\\" Isler said as he and other family members watched the rescuers. An elder cousin comforted him. Mehmet Ali Hekimoglu, a medic, said the dogs indicated that there were three or four people inside the building, but it was not known if they were alive. The boy, his sister and a cousin were trapped in the building's third-floor stairway as they tried to escape when the quake hit. A steel door fell over him. \\"I fell on the ground face down. When I tried to move my head, it hit the door,\\" he said. \\"I tried to get out and was able to open a gap with my fists in the wall but could not move my body further. The wall crumbled quickly when I hit it.\\" \\"We started shouting: 'Help! We're here,'\\" he said. \\"They found us a few hours later, they took me out about 8 1/2 hours later. ... I was OK but felt very bad, lonely. ... I still have a headache, but the doctor said I was fine.\\" Isler's 16-year-old sister, Ela, and 12-year-old cousin, Irem were also saved. \\"They took me out last because I was in good shape and the door was protecting me. I was hearing stones falling on it,\\" said Isler. The government's response to the quake appeared to be well-coordinated because of the country's vast experience in dealing with killer quakes and their aftermaths. Hundreds of rescue teams from throughout Turkey rushed to the area, racing to find survivors, while Turkish Red Crescent dispatched tents, blankets and soup kitchens. However, there was still no power and running water in Ercis. Firefighter trucks carried tons of water while giant generators were sent in on trucks. Turkey lies in one of the world's most active seismic zones and is crossed by numerous fault lines. In 1999, two earthquakes with a magnitude of more than 7 struck northwestern Turkey, killing about 18,000 people. Istanbul, the country's largest city with more than 12 million people, lies in northwestern Turkey near a major fault line, and experts say tens of thousands could be killed if a major quake struck there. __ Associated Press writers Suzan Fraser, in Ankara, and Christopher Torchia, in Istanbul, contributed. ||||| Baby plucked from Turkey quake rubble Updated Rescuers have plucked a two-week-old baby, then her mother and finally her grandmother from the rubble of a Turkish earthquake that killed over 400 people. The three rescues occurred at two-hour intervals in the town of Ercis, which bore the brunt of Sunday's 7.2 magnitude quake in eastern Van province. The first to be saved around midday (local time) was baby Azra Karaduman, just 16 days old, who was whisked by helicopter ambulance to the capital Ankara for medical treatment. She had spent some 48 hours under the rubble. Then teams pulled out the baby's mother Seniha, who had no life-threatening injuries but needed food and water, rescuers said, adding that she was taken to a field hospital some four kilometres away. Seniha was clutching baby Azra to her chest when rescuers reached them. Relief workers then saved Azra's 73-year-old grandmother Gulzade Karaduman, who had a foot trapped in the debris. She was carried off in an ambulance among cheers and applause. I was the happiest person in the world when I held her. Rescuer Kadir Direk The baby's father was believed to be still trapped in the rubble along with five or six other people, rescue workers said, adding that sniffer dogs were deployed to locate the living. \\"It is priceless to find someone alive and all my exhaustion is over,\\" said Oytun Gulpinar, the leader of a team of rescuers who had arrived in Ercis after a 32-hour road journey from the western city of Izmir. \\"I got to hold a 16-day-old baby, which is utterly priceless,\\" he added. Azra was brought out by Kadir Direk, the smallest member of the Izmir team, who described how he managed to squeeze through the debris and then scoop her off the lap of her mother. \\"I was the happiest person in the world when I held her,\\" said the 35-year-old. \\"When I took her from her mother, she asked me to give her a second name.\\" He choose Aysenur, combining the name of the Prophet Mohammed's wife and the word \\"light\\". Later on Tuesday, rescuers managed to save a 10-year-old boy from the wreckage of his house in the city centre of Van, more than 54 hours after the quake hit. Serhat Gul was in the rubble of a seven-storey building, his home, from where his brother and father had been rescued earlier, TV reports said. Earlier, search teams working round the clock rescued a pregnant woman and her two children and also dug out a police officer and his wife from their collapsed homes. As the body bags piled up and charity Red Crescent warned that hundreds or even thousands of people remained buried under the debris, the rescues sparked joy amid the otherwise grim task. The death toll from the quake stands at 432, with more than 1,300 other injured in the country's east. As rescuers pulled out more bodies, residents slept around small fires in towns rattled by aftershocks across Van province, near the Iranian border. Workers used heavy machinery, jackhammers, shovels, pickaxes and bare hands to comb through smashed concrete and steel. Every so often, exhausted rescuers would shout for silence and generators and diggers would stop, straining to hear voices under the wreckage. Seconds later the drone of the machinery would start again. \\"Life has become hell. We are outside, the weather is cold. There are no tents,\\" said Emin Kayram, 53, sitting by a camp fire in the town of Ercis after spending the night with his family of eight in a van parked nearby. His nephew was trapped in the rubble of a building behind him, where rescue workers had been digging through the night. The space we had was so narrow. People were fighting for more space to survive. I rested my head on a dead man's foot. I know I would be dead now if I had let myself go psychologically. Quake survivor Mesut Ozan Yilmaz, 18 \\"He is 18, a student. He is still stuck in there. This is the third day but you can't lose hope. We have to wait here,\\" he said. Crowds formed at one demolished building where bystanders said a trapped boy had made contact by mobile phone. As a rescue team dug at the rubble, one man screamed at the workers: \\"Where were you last night? I told you last night there were people here.\\" Casualties have been mostly in Ercis and the provincial capital Van. Officials are checking outlying areas. \\"It was like judgment day,\\" said Mesut Ozan Yilmaz, 18, who survived for 32 hours under the rubble of a tea house where he had been passing time with friends. Unhurt but lying on a hospital bed under a thick blanket, his face blackened by dust and dirt, Mr Yilmaz gave a chilling account to CNN Turk of how he survived by diving under a table. \\"The space we had was so narrow. People were fighting for more space to survive,\\" Mr Yilmaz said. \\"I rested my head on a dead man's foot. I know I would be dead now if I had let myself go psychologically.\\" As grieving families prepared to bury their dead, others kept vigil by the mounds of concrete rubble and masonry, praying rescue teams would find missing loved ones alive. Rescue teams concentrated efforts in Ercis, a town of 100,000 that was worst hit by the 7.2 magnitude tremor. Not enough tents Residents spent the night outside, fearing to return to their damaged homes. \\"We are afraid. Tremors are happening all the time. Pieces of concrete are falling off buildings,\\" said Farzande Dilmac, 70, pointing to an empty block of flats riven by large cracks. \\"Our people are in a bad state, what can we do?\\" he said as a score of women, their heads wrapped in coloured scarves, began wailing. The Turkish Red Crescent distributed up to 13,000 tents, and was preparing temporary shelter for about 40,000 people, although there were no reliable figures for the homeless. Prime minister Tayyip Erdogan's government has received international offers of assistance from dozens of countries around the world, including from former ally Israel, but has so far accepted aid only from Bulgaria, Azerbaijan and Iran. The Red Crescent was criticised for failing to ensure that some of the neediest, particularly in villages, received tents as night temperatures plummeted. The government has apologised for the slowness in distributing tents. \\"We were sent 25 tents for 150 homes. Everybody is waiting outside, we've got small children, we've got nothing left,\\" said Ahmet Arikes, the 60-year-old headman of Amik, a village outside Van that was reduced to rubble. Television images showed desperate men pushing each other roughly to grab tents from the back of a Red Crescent truck. \\"I didn't think the Red Crescent was successful enough in giving away tents,\\" Huseyin Celik, deputy chairman of the ruling AK Party, told CNN Turk. \\"I apologise to our people.\\" Soon after, the relief agency's chairman told the news channel that 12,000 more tents would reach Van on Tuesday. Deputy prime minister Besir Atalay, overseeing relief operations there, said: \\"From today there will be nothing our people lack.\\" ABC/wires Topics: earthquake, turkey First posted ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A 7.2-magnitude earthquake struck eastern Turkey, causing over 2,000 buildings to collapse and resulting in at least 366 deaths and 1,300 injuries.

As of 2015, the population was 48,210. It is the county seat of Albemarle County, which surrounds the city, though the two are separate legal entities. Charlottesville has eighteen distinctive neighborhoods. It is named after the British Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The Bureau of Economic Analysis combines the City of Charlottesville with the County of Albemarle for statistical purposes, bringing its steadily growing population to approximately 150,000. Charlottesville is the heart of the Charlottesville metropolitan area, which includes Albemarle, Fluvanna, Greene and Nelson counties. - Bella Morte is a gothic band that was formed in 1996 in Charlottesville, Virginia, USA. They incorporate elements of metal, dark wave, deathrock, alternative and synthpop. The band's name means \\"beautiful death\\" in Italian. According to Andy Deane, the name was chosen to \\"suggest that beauty can be found in tragedy\\", which is a theme occurring in every Bella Morte album. - Founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1993, Metropolis Records has developed a strong reputation over the years as a leader in various genres of underground music. Though widely known for electro-industrial, synthpop, future pop, darkwave, and gothic music, the label has always operated with a bent towards all genres of dark alternative music, be it electronics-based or post-punk. - Bleed the Grey Sky Black is Bella Morte 's fourth release on Metropolis Records . It reached # 1 on Metropolis ' pre-order sales in September 2006 . - Dark wave or darkwave is a musical term used for dark, usually gothic rock-influenced music that incorporates synthesizers, or elements of new wave and synthpop, although the term is also applied to post-punk bands that produce a dark atmosphere. The label began to appear in the late 1970s in German music media, coinciding with the popularity of new wave and post-punk. Building on those basic principles, dark wave is used to describe dark, introspective lyrics and an undertone of sorrow for some bands. In the 1980s, a subculture developed primarily in Europe alongside dark wave music, whose members were called \\"wavers\\" or \\"dark wavers\\". - Synthpop (also known as \\"technopop\\"), a subgenre of new wave music first became prominent in the late 1970s and features the synthesizer as the dominant musical instrument. It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic, art rock, disco, and particularly the \\"Krautrock\\" of bands like Kraftwerk. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the post-punk era as part of the new wave movement of the late-1970s to the mid-1980s. - Electro-industrial is a music genre drawing on EBM and post-industrial that developed in the mid-1980s. While EBM has a minimal structure and clean production, electro-industrial has a deep, complex and layered sound. The style was pioneered by Skinny Puppy, Front Line Assembly, and other groups, either from Canada or the Benelux. In the early 1990s, the style spawned the \\"dark electro\\" genre, and in the mid-/late-1990s, the \\"aggrotech\\" offshoot. The fan base for the style is linked to the rivethead subculture. - Post-punk (originally \\"new musick\\") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music. - Deathrock is a subgenre of punk rock incorporating horror elements and spooky atmospherics, that emerged on the West Coast of the United States in the early 1980s.

Brown team arrived in time and started their warm up, but Green team arrived late and skipped their warm up so they experienced some people getting injured. Hint: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate.

Here are the step-by-step instructions and justifications: 1. Select a clean, flat surface: Using a clean surface, like the edge of a countertop or the rim of a bowl, helps to prevent contamination and ensures that you can apply the needed force to crack the egg without risking an uneven crack or shell shards in your egg. 2. Hold the egg: Hold the egg firmly but gently with one hand, positioning it horizontally (sideways) with the narrower end facing one of your fingers, and the wider end facing your thumb. This arrangement allows for better control while applying force to crack the egg and reduces the risk of crushing it. 3. Tap the middle of the egg: Gently hit the middle (the equator) of the egg against the chosen surface, using just enough force to create a small crack in the shell. If you hit too hard, the egg could shatter or become messy; if you hit too lightly, you may not create the desired crack. 4. Separate the shell: Place your thumbs on either side of the crack and gently pull apart the two halves of the eggshell. Be careful not to crush the shell or allow shards to fall into the egg mixture. 5. Release the egg: Open the egg over a bowl, allowing the yolk and egg white to fall into the bowl. Dispose of the eggshell.

Please answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him. Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation.

Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Old age may not sound exciting. But recent findings offer good news for older people and for people worried about getting older. Researchers found that people become happier and experience less worry after they reach the age of fifty. In fact, they say by the age of eighty-five, people are happier with their life than they were when they were eighteen years old. The findings came from a survey of more than three hundred forty thousand adults in the United States. The Gallup Organization questioned them by telephone in 2008. At that time, the people were between the ages of eighteen and eighty-five. The researchers asked questions about emotions like happiness, sadness and worry. They also asked about mental or emotional stress. Arthur Stone in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science at Stony Brook University in New York led the study. His team found that levels of stress were highest among adults between the ages of twenty-two and twenty-five. The findings showed that stress levels dropped sharply after people reached their fifties. The study also showed that men and women have similar feeling patterns as they grow older. However, women at all ages reported more sadness, stress and worry than men. Researchers say they do not know why happiness increases as people get older. One theory is that, as people grow older, they grow older, they grow more thankful for what they have and have better control of their feelings. They also spend less time thinking about bad experiences. Professor Stone says the emotional patterns could be linked to changes in how people see the world, or maybe even changes in brain chemistry. The researchers also considered possible influences like having young children, being unemployed or being single. But they found that influences like these did not affect the levels of happiness and well-being related to age.

Process: - Several types of gases form in the atmosphere - May come from different sources - The gases remain trapped in the atmosphere - Through the suns light the gases hold in heat and energy - Trap them in our atmosphere - The earth may become warmer this way. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more plants use gases happens, how will it affect a SMALLER greenhouse effect. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon that occurs when heat-trapping gases in the Earth's atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, prevent heat radiation from escaping into space. These gases absorb and re-emit the sun's energy to maintain the Earth's temperature at a level suitable for sustaining life. The process of the greenhouse effect can be summarized in the following steps: 1. Various types of heat-trapping gases, also known as greenhouse gases, form in the atmosphere. These gases can come from natural sources, such as volcanic eruptions, or human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agricultural practices. 2. The greenhouse gases remain present in the atmosphere, where they can accumulate over time, depending on their sources and sinks. 3. The sun's light, which consists of energy in the form of shortwave radiation, passes through the Earth's atmosphere and reaches the planet's surface. 4. As the Earth absorbs the sun's energy, it transforms the shortwave radiation into longwave radiation, commonly referred to as heat. 5. This heat radiates outwards from the Earth's surface but is trapped by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. 6. The trapped heat is then re-emitted in all directions, warming the planet by raising the average global temperature. In the perturbation hypothesis, if more plants consume greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, through the process of photosynthesis, it could potentially lead to a smaller greenhouse effect. Plants act as a carbon sink, extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and converting it into carbohydrates during photosynthesis. By removing some of these greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, the overall amount of heat-trapping gases would decrease, potentially lessening the intensity of the greenhouse effect. Direct and indirect effects of the perturbation hypothesis on the greenhouse effect process are as follows: Direct Effects: 1. A decrease in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to increased plant uptake could reduce the overall potential for heat trapping. 2. With fewer greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to absorb and re-emit longwave radiation, more heat might escape into space, resulting in a cooling effect on Earth. Indirect Effects: 1. A decrease in greenhouse gas concentrations could lead to a feedback loop where increased plant growth and carbon uptake further reduces atmospheric greenhouse gases, thereby amplifying the cooling effect. 2. With an overall decrease in global temperature, there may be indirect effects on climate patterns, precipitation, and the occurrence of extreme weather events. 3. If the perturbation hypothesis results in a substantial decrease in the greenhouse effect, it could potentially slow down or mitigate the impacts of global warming and climate change. However, it is important to consider that other factors, such as human activities and natural sources of greenhouse gases, would still play a role in the overall balance of the greenhouse effect. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis, which involves an increase in plant uptake of greenhouse gases, does have both direct and indirect effects on the greenhouse effect process. While the direct effect is the reduction of greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere, several indirect effects may occur, such as alterations in climate patterns and potential mitigation of human-induced global warming. However, it is crucial to consider the complexity and interconnectedness of Earth's climate system when assessing the overall impact of any given perturbation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Process: - Suns heat enters atmosphere - Green house gases enter from the earth - Heat is trapped in atmosphere - Different things on earth are hotter - The overall planet is hotter. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose government buying meat for everyone happens, how will it affect Meat production increase means damaging more plant life. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does indeed have an effect, both directly and indirectly, on the process you mentioned which is essentially the greenhouse effect and global warming. To begin with the direct effect, an increase in meat production as a result of the government buying meat for everyone would considerably escalate the number of livestock, mainly cattle. Livestock farming is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, especially methane, which is more potent than carbon dioxide in terms of heat-trapping capacity. Cattle release methane into the atmosphere through their digestive process known as enteric fermentation. It is estimated that a single cow can emit between 70 and 120 kilograms of methane per year. With an increased demand for meat leading to more livestock production, the amount of methane emitted to the atmosphere will significantly increase. Methane, being a greenhouse gas, traps heat in the atmosphere which results in an increase in the overall temperature of the planet, thereby intensifying global warming. Now, about the indirect effects, a surge in meat production would demand an increase in feed production for the livestock. Feed production often involves deforestation to clear land for cultivating crops like soybeans and corn, which are commonly used in animal feed. Deforestation removes trees that absorb carbon dioxide, another greenhouse gas, from the atmosphere. This can lead to an increase in the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect as carbon dioxide traps heat. Moreover, deforestation often creates degraded lands that can no longer support life. This decreases the overall amount of plant life, which otherwise could have helped absorb CO₂ from the atmosphere, and it breaks the carbon cycle, further increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide. In addition, the process of producing animal feed and raising livestock also requires significant amounts of energy, often generated from fossil fuels, which emit more greenhouse gases when burned. Transportation and refrigeration of meat across the country will likewise increase the carbon footprint. In conclusion, by buying meat for everyone and thereby increasing meat production, the government would inadvertently promote practices that increase the emission of greenhouse gases and contribute to global warming. Therefore, the perturbation does indeed affect your described process, both directly and indirectly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate. I am facing a new situation today: Two meteorologists study Earth's climate. Jerry studies alpine climate, while James studies tropical climates. They both made great progress.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered a thinly veiled criticism of China, even while insisting on closer relations with Beijing, during a speech Friday in Singapore. Speaking at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue defense conference, Modi called for the Indo-Pacific region to embrace freedom of navigation, territorial integrity, and respect for all nations, regardless of their size. \\"We will promote a democratic and rules-based international order in which all nations, small and large, count as equal and sovereign,\\" the Indian prime minister said. \\"We will work with others to keep our seas, space and airways free and open.\\" While those comments did not specifically mention China, Modi's remarks are seen as a reference to Beijing's increasingly assertive behavior toward its smaller neighbors in disputed areas of the South China Sea. Modi also implicitly criticized the United States. He slammed growing protectionism, presumably a reference to recent tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. He also said nations should keep their commitments — a possible reference to Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal. India has grown close with the U.S., especially as China projects its growing military power beyond its shores. The U.S.-India relationship, Modi said, \\"has resumed new significance in the changing world.\\" An important aspect of that partnership is \\"a shared vision of an open, stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific,\\" he added. For decades, India has embraced a non-aligned status, which means it does not choose sides between world powers.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Immunologist The variations in peripheral proteins and carbohydrates that affect a cell’s recognition sites are of prime interest in immunology. These changes are taken into consideration in vaccine development. Many infectious diseases, such as smallpox, polio, diphtheria, and tetanus, were conquered by the use of vaccines. Immunologists are the physicians and scientists who research and develop vaccines, as well as treat and study allergies or other immune problems. Some immunologists study and treat autoimmune problems (diseases in which a person’s immune system attacks his or her own cells or tissues, such as lupus) and immunodeficiencies, whether acquired (such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS) or hereditary (such as severe combined immunodeficiency, or SCID). Immunologists are called in to help treat organ transplantation patients, who must have their immune systems suppressed so that their bodies will not reject a transplanted organ. Some immunologists work to understand natural immunity and the effects of a person’s environment on it. Others work on questions about how the immune system affects diseases such as cancer. In the past, the importance of having a healthy immune system in preventing cancer was not at all understood. To work as an immunologist, a PhD or MD is required. In addition, immunologists undertake at least 2–3 years of training in an accredited program and must pass an examination given by the American Board of Allergy and Immunology. Immunologists must possess knowledge of the functions of the human body as they relate to issues beyond immunization, and knowledge of pharmacology and medical technology, such as medications, therapies, test materials, and surgical procedures.

Let's solve this math problem together. We want to find out what 'j' is. Here's the problem we are trying to solve: -11*j - 614 = 4*j + 166 First, we want to get all the 'j' parts together. So, let's move the 4*j from the right side of the equation to the left side. We do this by subtracting 4*j from both sides: -11*j - 4*j - 614 = 166 Now our equation looks like this: -15*j - 614 = 166 Now, let's move the 614 from the left side to the right side! We do that by adding 614 to both sides: -15*j = 166 + 614 Our equation now looks like: -15*j = 780 Now we just need to find out what 'j' is.

At one time this statement was true, but no longer. Since the 1960s, we have sent many spacecraft into space. Some are still traveling away from Earth. So it is possible to overcome gravity. Do you need a giant rocket to overcome gravity? No, you actually overcome gravity every day. Think about when you climb a set of stairs. When you do, you are overcoming gravity. What if you jump on a trampoline? You are overcoming gravity for a few seconds. Everyone can overcome gravity. You just need to apply a force larger than gravity. Think about that the next time you jump into the air. You are overcoming gravity for a brief second. Enjoy it while it lasts. Eventually, gravity will win the battle. Question: \\"How is gravity overcome?\\" Answer: \\"You need to apply a force larger than gravity\\" Is this answer correct? Available options: a). no b). yes...I think the answer is","completion":"b). yes The answer is correct. Gravity can be overcome by applying a force larger than gravity. Let's delve deeper into this concept to better understand the various ways to overcome gravity and the crucial role it plays in various aspects of life and scientific exploration. Gravity is a natural force that pulls objects with mass towards each other. On Earth, it is the force that gives objects weight and causes them to fall towards the ground when dropped. The strength of gravitational force on an object depends on its mass and the distance from the center of Earth. To overcome gravity, one needs to apply an opposing force greater than the gravitational force acting on an object. This opposing force is known as the \\"counter force.\\" The more massive an object, the stronger the opposing force needed to resist gravity. Therefore, to escape from the Earth's gravitational field, one must apply sufficient counter force. There are several ways to overcome gravity, depending on the situation: 1. Jumping: When you jump, your muscles generate enough counter force to propel you into the air momentarily—you overcome gravity for a brief moment. However, as the counter force dissipates, gravity eventually pulls you back towards the ground. 2. Climbing: Climbing a hill, a set of stairs, or a ladder requires you to use your muscles to continuously apply counter force to counteract gravity, allowing you to maintain an elevated position and move upward. 3. Flying: Aircraft achieve lift by generating an upward force via their wings, which counteracts gravity. This lift is achieved through the shape and angle of the wings and the thrust generated by the engines. 4. Space Travel: Rockets use powerful engines and propellant to generate tremendous counter force, allowing them to escape Earth's gravitational pull and travel through space. Once in space, gravity is much weaker and can be considered negligible compared to the forces the spacecraft experiences while in motion. 5. Satellite Orbits: Artificial satellites orbit the Earth by maintaining a delicate balance between their forward motion and the Earth's gravitational pull. Satellites experience a continuous \\"fall\\" towards Earth but travel forward fast enough that they essentially \\"miss\\" the Earth, staying in orbit. Understanding gravity and how to overcome it is a fundamental concept in physics and engineering. It is crucial for designing machines, structures, and space missions. Overcoming gravity is a challenge that humanity has faced and conquered in numerous ways – from jumping and climbing to inventing machines that fly and sending spacecraft to explore the cosmos."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Exploration is the act of searching for the purpose of discovery of information or resources. Exploration occurs in all non-sessile animal species, including humans. In human history, its most dramatic rise was during the Age of Discovery when European explorers sailed and charted much of the rest of the world for a variety of reasons. Since then, major explorations after the Age of Discovery have occurred for reasons mostly aimed at information discovery. - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. - Space exploration is the ongoing discovery and exploration of celestial structures in outer space by means of continuously evolving and growing space technology. While the study of space is carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, the physical exploration of space is conducted both by unmanned robotic space probes and human spaceflight. - Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole. - Human spaceflight (also referred to as manned spaceflight) is space travel with a crew or passengers aboard the spacecraft. Spacecraft carrying people may be operated directly, by human crew, or it may be either remotely operated from ground stations on Earth or be autonomous, able to carry out a specific mission with no human involvement. - The International Astronomical Union (IAU UAI) is an international association of professional astronomers, at the PhD level and beyond, active in professional research and education in astronomy. Among other activities, it acts as the internationally recognized authority for assigning designations to celestial bodies (stars, planets, asteroids, etc.) and any surface features on them. - Stamatios ( Tom ) M. Krimigis ( Greek : ) is a Greek - American scientist in space exploration . He has contributed to many of the United States ' unmanned space exploration programs of the Solar System and beyond . He has contributed to exploration missions to almost every planet of the Solar System . In 1999 , the International Astronomical Union named the asteroid 8323 Krimigis ( previously 1979 UH ) in his honor . - The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury. - An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who concentrates their studies on a specific question or field outside of the scope of Earth. They look at stars, planets, moons, comets and galaxies, as well as many other celestial objects either in observational astronomy, in analyzing the data or in theoretical astronomy.

Step 2: Analyze possible feelings - Sent in the wrong direction: This is a possible outcome of the situation, but it doesn't describe how Riley would feel about their actions. - Like they were clever: Since they were joking around, Riley might have felt clever for successfully misleading Quinn in a playful manner. - Lead astray: This describes the action that Riley took but doesn't describe how they would feel about it. Step 3: Determine the most likely feeling - Based on the context, it seems that the most probable feeling Riley would experience is \\"like they were clever,\\" as it corresponds with the playful intention behind their actions.

Roberts proved a vocal member of the Convention, particularly in his opposition to women's suffrage. In 1895, Roberts was the losing Democratic candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives, and Roberts believed LDS Church leaders, who were predominantly Republicans, \\"had unfairly influenced the election by publicly reprimanding him and fellow Democrat Moses Thatcher for running for office without express permission of the Church.\\" The LDS Church then issued the \\"Political Manifesto of 1895,\\" which forbade church officers from running for public office without the approval of the church. Both Roberts and Thatcher refused to agree to the Political Manifesto and were suspended from their ecclesiastical offices. Roberts, believing such a requirement was a basic infringement of his civil rights, capitulated just hours before a deadline of March 24, 1896, signed the manifesto, wrote a letter of apology to the First Presidency, and was reinstated. Thatcher was more stubborn: he refused to sign, was expelled from the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and barely evaded excommunication. In 1898, Roberts was elected as a Democrat to the 56th Congress, but the House of Representatives refused to seat him because of his practice of polygamy. The prolonged battle that ensued to keep his seat, which was not successful, left Roberts bitter.

Write a summary based on this article: Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE The CDC is now advising pregnant women to avoid parts of Miami Beach, and all of Miami-Dade County, because of Zika concerns. Wochit Municipal workers clean the streets in Miami Beach to control the spread of mosquitoes. Local authorities are taking steps to prevent an outbreak of Zika in the city while they are waiting to confirm Miami Beach as the new zone of the virus transmission. (Photo: CRISTOBAL HERRERA, EPA) MIAMI BEACH, Fla. — Pregnant women should now avoid a popular section of this tourist district where Zika is spreading, in addition to a smaller area north of downtown Miami, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Friday. Pregnant women and their sexual partners who are concerned about the virus could also consider avoiding \\"nonessential travel\\" to all of Miami-Dade County, according to the CDC. Although Zika mostly spreads through mosquito bites, both men and women can transmit the virus sexually. Florida health officials, who have been grappling with a Zika outbreak in Miami's Wynwood neighborhood, confirmed Friday that five people also have been infected in South Beach, the vibrant community that's located across Biscayne Bay from the rest of Miami and known for its pastel-colored buildings and art deco architecture. The new cases bring the total number of infections spread by local mosquitoes to 36, Gov. Rick Scott said. The five latest patients were infected within a 1.5 square mile area of Miami Beach, said Scott, whose state is the first to experience a Zika outbreak from native mosquitoes. The bulk of the USA's more than 2,200 cases of the virus are related to travel. The affected area of Miami Beach stretches from the beach to the Intracoastal Waterway, from 8th Street to 28th Street, Scott said. People who live in or who have traveled to this area since July 14 should be \\"aware of active Zika virus transmission,\\" the CDC said. Pregnant women who have been to this area since that date should see their doctor or other healthcare provider about getting tested for Zika. Men and women with a pregnant sex partner who have visited the area since July 14 \\"should consistently and correctly use condoms to prevent infection during sex or avoid having sex for the duration of the pregnancy.\\" The CDC recommends all pregnant women be assessed for possible exposure to Zika virus, although not all of them need to be tested. Testing for Zika is time-consuming and the number of lab staff available to perform the tests is limited. Mosquitoes could be spreading the virus in other areas in Miami-Dade County that haven't yet been recognized, said CDC Director Thomas Frieden. \\"There are undoubtedly more infections that we’re not aware of right now,\\" he said. Frieden notes that 80% of Zika patients have no symptoms, making the disease difficult to diagnose. Patients can incubate the virus for up to two weeks before showing signs of the disease, which can include fever, rash, joint pain, pink eye, headache and other problems. The CDC took the unprecedented step earlier this month to warn pregnant women to avoid the Wynwood neighborhood that's located north of downtown. The area of concern in Wynwood has since shrunk as officials investigated the outbreak. Pregnant women are at greater risk than others from Zika because the virus can cause devastating birth defects in fetuses, including serious brain damage. \\"I ask every Floridian to take proper precautions,\\" Scott said. \\"We all have to do our part to wear bug spray and dump standing water,\\" where mosquitoes can breed, he added. \\"If you see standing water, no mater how small, dump it.\\" The new Miami Beach cases include two people from Miami Beach, one from New York, one from Texas and one from Taiwan. Florida \\"will do everything we can to help pregnant women all across our state. We have a safe state and we are going to keep it that way,\\" Scott said. Scott, who has requested additional help from the CDC to deal with the outbreak, said officials are taking aggressive mosquito-control measures. The large number of high-rise buildings in Miami Beach makes it difficult to kill mosquitoes by spraying from the air, Frieden said. That's because the airplanes that spray pesticide tend to fly at altitudes of only about 100 feet. Mosquito-control workers will likely have to spray pesticides by hand, using \\"backpack\\" pesticide containers. The pesticides used in Wynwood appear to kill about 90% of mosquitoes hit with the spray. A member of the National Health Foundation fumigates against the Aedes aegypti mosquito in Brazil. (Photo: EVARISTO SA, AFP/Getty Images) \\"We're just impressed by the resilience of this mosquito,\\" Frieden said. \\"It's a tough mosquito to spray.\\" Scott has asked the CDC for an additional 5,000 Zika antibody test kits \\"to ensure we can quickly test people for the virus and additional lab support personnel to help us expedite Zika testing,\\" he said. He has also asked the Obama administration for an additional 10,000 Zika prevention kits. Scott said he's waiting for a \\"detailed plan\\" on how to work with FEMA. At least 529 pregnant women in the continental U.S. and Hawaii have been infected with Zika, according to the CDC. Seventeen American women have given birth to babies with Zika-related birth defects and six have lost pregnancies due to the disease, according to the CDC. More than 13,000 people have been diagnosed with Zika in Puerto Rico, including at least 1,106 pregnant women, according to the Puerto Rico health department. About 100 Puerto Ricans with Zika have been hospitalized and two have died. Szabo reported from McLean, Va., for USA TODAY. Freeman reports for the Naples (Fla.) Daily News.

As a result, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expanded its advice to travelers, advising pregnant women to avoid the parts of Miami Beach where the virus is spreading. In addition, women and men who have traveled to the area should wait at least eight weeks to try to get pregnant even if they didn't catch Zika during their visit. The agency also went a step further, advising pregnant women and their sexual partners \\"who are concerned about potential Zika virus exposure\\" that they \\"may also consider postponing nonessential travel to all parts of Miami-Dade county.\\" That decision to issue a warning about the entire city was prompted by the agency's concern that there may be other outbreaks in other parts of Miami-Dade that haven't been identified yet, CDC Director Thomas Frieden told reporters during a briefing. \\"What we are doing is stepping back and saying, 'There have now been multiple instances of local transmission,' \\" Frieden said. \\"We will always err on providing more information to the public.\\" Five Zika cases have been linked to the new outbreak in Miami Beach, involving three men and two women from Miami, New York, Texas and Taiwan, officials said. That brings the total number of Zika cases that have been spread by mosquitoes in Florida to 36. \\"We believe we have a new area where local transmissions are occurring in Miami Beach,\\" Gov. Rick Scott told reporters at a news conference. Officials believe the virus is only spreading in a 1 1/2 mile part of Miami Beach, but that area includes the much-visited South Beach area, Scott said. The tourism industry in Florida is particularly concerned with the spread of Zika and the impact it may have on businesses. On Thursday, Scott announced measures designed to limit Zika, including offering mosquito spraying free of charge to businesses in Miami-Dade County. \\"Tourism is a driving force of Florida's economy and this industry has the full support of our state in the fight against the Zika virus,\\" Scott said in a statement. The new outbreak comes as officials believe they are bringing the first outbreak in the trendy Wynwood neighborhood under control. Officials announced Friday they had cleared three new blocks of Wynwood because there is \\"no continued evidence of transmission\\" there. Fourteen blocks had been cleared earlier. But Frieden noted that officials expect it will be harder to contain the outbreak in Miami beach for several reasons. The area's high-rise buildings mean the aerial spraying that has been working in Wynwood won't work in Miami Beach. In addition, it will be more difficult to convince people to wear long sleeves and pants in a part of the city where people go to spend time on the beach, he said. The Wynwood outbreak prompted the CDC to take the unprecedented step of advising pregnant women to stay away from the area. It was the first time the CDC had ever advised people to avoid any part of the continental United States because of an infectious disease. In response to the Miami Beach outbreak, Scott said he had requested an additional 5,000 Zika tests, additional lab personnel to expedite testing and 10,000 more Zika prevention kits for pregnant women. Separately, Puerto Rico is reporting a surge in Zika cases. The island's health department said Friday that 2,496 more cases had been confirmed in Puerto Rico over the last week. That marks the highest weekly tally since the virus was first detected on the island in December. The health department also announced the first death in Puerto Rico from Guillain-Barre syndrome linked to Zika. The latest cases bring the total number of laboratory confirmed Zika cases in Puerto Rico to 13,186. Of those, 1,106 are pregnant women. Jason Beaubien contributed to this report. ||||| Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) said on August 19 that officials have identified a new area of Zika virus transmission through local mosquitoes in a small area in Miami Beach, the second area in Miami-Dade County where the Zika virus is spreading. (Reuters) Florida Gov. Rick Scott confirmed Friday that the Zika virus is being spread locally by mosquitoes in Miami Beach, a development that marks an expansion of the outbreak in South Florida and immediately prompted a new travel advisory by federal officials. \\"We believe we have a new area where local transmissions are occurring in Miami Beach,” Scott said at a noon press conference. This area covers about 1.5 square miles between 8th and 28th streets and between the beach and Intracoastal Waterway -- a stretch that encompasses the vibrant, densely packed South Beach tourist district. It also encompasses the Miami Beach Convention Center, which is set to host the Asia America Trade Show for vendors around the world starting Sunday. Health officials said at least five people have been infected with Zika in this area, including two who live in Miami Beach. One person from Texas, one from New York and another from Taiwan have returned home after being infected while in Miami Beach. “This situation is very unfortunate. It’s not something we’d wish upon any community,” Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine said. [Zika can infect adult brain cells, not just fetal cells, study suggests] The news marks a second front in Miami's fight against local transmission of the virus. Previously, officials had pinpointed local infections in a one-square-mile area north of downtown Miami known as Wynwood. That prompted federal health authorities to urge pregnant women not to visit the area, the first time they ever had warned against travel to a part of the continental United States because of the outbreak of an infectious disease. Source: Florida Gov. Rick Scott. THE WASHINGTON POST The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quickly issued a second travel advisory Friday afternoon, saying pregnant women should also avoid the designated area of Miami Beach. The agency said that pregnant women who live in the area or have to travel there should take extra precautions to guard against mosquito bites, including wearing repellent. It gave the same direction for these women's sexual partners. In a call with reporters Friday, CDC director Tom Frieden said Miami Beach presents a difficult situation for health officials trying to halt the Zika outbreak. The area has a constant stream of visitors, many of them international, who could carry the virus elsewhere should they get infected. [Zika and the race to quell outbreaks: My talk with Anthony Fauci, NIH’s top vaccine expert] In addition, the low-flying planes that have been spraying specialized insecticide over Wynwood cannot do so over Miami Beach because of the high-rise buildings that front the Atlantic Ocean and often windy conditions. And the city's South Beach is a beach, after all, notorious for skimpy bikinis and a general lack of clothing at all hours. \\"The amount of exposed skin also makes it harder to prevent infections there,\\" Frieden said. \\"We think this will be a challenging area.\\" Scott said Miami-Dade County already had begun an intensified mosquito control campaign in Miami Beach. He sought to reassure state residents -- and especially the tourism industry -- that his administration was doing everything possible to combat more spread of the virus. He said the state would be requesting more resources from the CDC, including additional Zika testing kits. \\"Tourism is a driving force of our economy, and this industry has the full support of our state in the fight against the Zika virus,\\" Scott said. \\"We want to do all we can to ensure Florida remains safe for businesses and our families.\\" The mayor reiterated similar points late in the afternoon, stressing local officials’ stepped-up mosquito control efforts. “The last thing I’d want to be in Miami Beach right now is a mosquito,” Levine said. And William Talbert III, president of the Greater Miami Convention & Visitors Bureau, voiced confidence that officials would be able to control the outbreak, that tourists would continue to come given the relatively modest risks to everyone but pregnant women and that the area’s economy would not suffer a serious blow. The tourism industry employs more people than any other locally. \\"We've had a record summer,\\" Talbert said. But while Frieden praised the work of Florida officials and said intense spraying and other efforts had killed many mosquitoes in the Wynwood neighborhood, he noted that the Aedes aegypti mosquito primarily responsible for spreading Zika is resilient. \\"It's a tough mosquito to kill,\\" he said. \\"This is truly the cockroach of mosquitoes.\\" On Thursday, Scott's office adamantly disputed reports that mosquitoes were transmitting Zika in Miami Beach, despite multiple health officials telling reporters that indeed was the case. In his press conference Friday, the governor faced questions about whether he had tried to obscure evidence of an expanding outbreak, in part to protect the state's massive tourism industry. He said that state health investigators had only finished their inquiry into the new cases Friday morning and that he had rushed to Miami to deliver the news and meet with local leaders. \\"We’re going to provide timely accurate information for public health,\\" Scott said. \\"I want everybody in this state to stay safe. I want our visitors to stay safe.\\" The virus, which has now spread to 70 countries, has been linked to a rare and severe birth defect known as microcephaly, which in newborns is characterized by an abnormally small head and often underdeveloped brain, as well as an array of other fetal abnormalities. In rare cases, Zika also has been linked in adults to Guillain-Barré syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that can cause paralysis and even death. Nationally, there are more than 2,200 confirmed Zika cases in the states and more than 8,000 in U.S. territories, the vast majority of those in Puerto Rico. The CDC is tracking 529 pregnant women with the virus nationwide and nearly 700 in those territories. The Obama administration has sought nearly 2 billion in emergency appropriations to help fight the spread of Zika, but Congress has been deadlocked for months and left for its summer recess without approving any funding. The administration recently announced plans to reallocate 81 million from other programs at the National Institutes of Health and elsewhere. Still, officials said, the money being used to combat Zika \\"will be virtually exhausted by the end of the fiscal year” on Sept. 30. Friday afternoon, the Florida Department of Health reported a total 488 travel-related cases of Zika and 36 locally acquired cases. Sixty-eight cases involve pregnant women. In Miami-Dade, the agency has identified at least four cases of apparently mosquito-borne Zika that occurred outside of the two areas identified for active transmissions. Celeste Philip, Florida's surgeon general, said Friday that officials have not yet determined where those isolated cases contracted Zika. \\"It’s like solving a mystery, it takes time for us to look at all that information and makes connections,\\" Philip said. She added, \\"I want to assure everyone that if we identify local areas of transmission, we will alert the public and the media immediately.\\" The clusters of outbreaks around Miami are not a surprise to many health experts, who anticipated that the Zika virus would be tricky to contain after it began spreading locally in the United States. While the Aedes aegypti travels no more than about 500 feet in its lifettime, people have the capacity to quickly carry the virus to the far ends of the globe. \\"There are undoubtedly more infections that we are not aware of right now,\\" Frieden said, noting that roughly 80 percent of people infected by Zika never experience symptoms such as fever, rash or joint pain. \\"We can't predict how long this will continue, but we do know that it will be difficult to control.\\" The Post's Brady Dennis talks with Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, about the process of getting a potential Zika vaccine tested and ready for the public.

And studies show that too much multitasking can lead to increased stress, anxiety and memory loss. In order to multitask, the brain uses an area known as the prefrontal cortex . Brain scans of volunteers performing multiple tasks together show that as they shift from task to task, this front part of the brain actually takes a moment of rest between tasks. You may have experienced a prefrontal cortex \\"moment of rest\\" yourself if you've ever dialed a phone number and suddenly forgotten who you dialed when the line is answered. What probably occurred is that between the dialing and the answering, your mind shifted to anther thought or task, and then took that \\"moment\\" to come back. Research has also shown that for many volunteers, job efficiency declines while multitasking, as compared to when they perform only one task at a time. Multitasking is easiest when at least one of the tasks is habitual, or requires little thought. Most people don't find it difficult to eat and read the newspaper at the same time. However, when two or more attention-requiring tasks are attempted at one time, people sometimes make mistakes. We often don't remember things as well when we're trying to manage several details at the same time. Without mental focus, we may not pay enough attention to new information coming in, so it never makes it into our memory stores. That is one of the main reasons we forget people's names--even sometimes right after they have introduced themselves. Multitasking can also affect our relationships. If someone...

Each of those parts will have some instruction. Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction. Use the following format: Part # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Q: In this task, based on the given context word, you are asked to create a pair of sentences each containing a blank (_) and their corresponding answer. The sentence pair should look similar, and should be about two related but different objects; for example \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \\"small\\" and \\"big\\") which express contrasting properties about the two objects. The answer must not be associated with the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in twin sentences. Also, the answers should not be ambiguous. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. E.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that ObjectX and Y have the same number e.g. when ObjectX is singular, ObjectY must be singular, too. The two objects (ObjectX & ObjectY) should be used ONCE in each sentence. Here is a list of contrastive words that may be used as trigger words. You should create more such trigger words and use them in your twin sentences. | Attribute | triggerword | contrastive triggerword | | age | old | new | | altitude | low | high | | area | small | vast | | brightness | dark | light | | clarity | obscure | clear | | cleanness | dirty | clean | | complexity | simple | complex | | cost | cheap | expensive | | density | sparse | dense | | depth | shallow | deep | | distance | near | far | | electric conductivity | low | high | | flexibility | rigid | flexible | | granularity | fine | coarse | | hardness | soft | hard | | length | short | long | | magnitude | small | large | | mass | small | large | | odor | weak | strong | | pressure | low | high | | resistance | low | high | | shape | round | sharp | | shape | flat | spiky | | size | small | large | | sound | quiet | loud | | sound pitch | low | high | | speed | slow | fast | | stability | unstable | stable | | strength | weak | strong | | temperature | low | high | | texture | smooth | rough | | thermal conductivity | low | high | | thickness | thin | thick | | volume | small | large | | weight | light | heavy | | width | narrow | wide | | location | in | out | | location | up | down | | location | above | below | | location | on | off | | location | to | from | Context Word: skillet.

Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies. Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him. Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case, Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely.

The veteran walks around the cemetery and, upon seeing one specific gravestone, collapses to his knees, overwhelmed by emotion. The film flashes back to the morning of June 6, 1944, the beginning of the Normandy Invasion, as American soldiers prepare to land on Omaha Beach. They suffer heavily from their struggle against German infantry, machine gun nests, and artillery fire. Captain John H. Miller, a company commander of the 2nd Ranger Battalion, survives the initial landing and assembles a group of his Rangers to penetrate the German defenses, leading to a breakout from the beach. After the battle, the body of a dead soldier lying face down on the beach, with \\"S. Ryan\\" inscribed on the back of his uniform, is shown. Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C, at the U.S. War Department, General George Marshall is informed that three of the four brothers of the Ryan family were killed in action and that their mother is to receive all three telegrams in the same day. He learns that the fourth son, Private First Class James Francis Ryan, is a paratrooper and is missing in action somewhere in Normandy.

Los Angeles (CNN) -- A prominent California Democrat campaign fund manager charged with defrauding a state legislator of 677,181 is in settlement negotiations with federal prosecutors, a law enforcement source said Tuesday. Kinde Durkee, whose Durkee & Associates firm is based in Burbank, California, has been charged with two counts of mail fraud regarding the alleged misappropriation of 677,181 in campaign funds belonging to California Assemblyman Jose Solorio, a Democrat whose office is based in Anaheim, authorities said. The law enforcement source asked for anonymity because the source wasn't authorized to speak publicly about the negotiations. Durkee is accused of filing false disclosure reports to hide the misappropriations, according to an affidavit by FBI Agent Reginald Coleman. Durkee, who appears to have signature authority over more than 400 bank accounts, including those for political campaigns, allegedly moved \\"substantial\\" sums of money from client campaign committees to her firm's accounts or other campaign accounts, Coleman said in the affidavit. Durkee also allegedly spent funds from clients' accounts to make her firm's payroll and to pay for her mortgage, her American Express bill, her mother's assisted living facility expenses and other personal expenses, Coleman's affidavit said. In an interview with the FBI on September 1, \\"Ms. Durkee admitted that she had been misappropriating her clients' money for years, and that forms she filed with the state were false,\\" Coleman wrote. Durkee and her attorney could not be reached by CNN for comment on Tuesday. In the wake of the charges, U.S. Rep.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Nucleic Acids The nucleic acids differ in their type of pentose sugar. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is nucleotide that stores genetic information. DNA contains deoxyribose (so-called because it has one less atom of oxygen than ribose) plus one phosphate group and one nitrogen-containing base. The “choices” of base for DNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a ribose-containing nucleotide that helps manifest the genetic code as protein. RNA contains ribose, one phosphate group, and one nitrogen-containing base, but the “choices” of base for RNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil. The nitrogen-containing bases adenine and guanine are classified as purines. A purine is a nitrogen-containing molecule with a double ring structure, which accommodates several nitrogen atoms. The bases cytosine, thymine (found in DNA only) and uracil (found in RNA only) are pyramidines. A pyramidine is a nitrogen-containing base with a single ring structure Bonds formed by dehydration synthesis between the pentose sugar of one nucleic acid monomer and the phosphate group of another form a “backbone,” from which the components’ nitrogen-containing bases protrude. In DNA, two such backbones attach at their protruding bases via hydrogen bonds. These twist to form a shape known as a double helix (Figure 2.29). The sequence of nitrogen-containing bases within a strand of DNA form the genes that act as a molecular code instructing cells in the assembly of amino acids into proteins. Humans have almost 22,000 genes in their DNA, locked up in the 46 chromosomes inside the nucleus of each cell (except red blood cells which lose their nuclei during development).

WBBM-TV writer Jeff Joniak described the Bears as in \\"clean-up mode\\" after a poor performance in Tampa. The battle between the Bears' rushing attack and the Steelers' run defense featured the former averaging just 2.9 yards per carry (27th in the league) taking on a defense that allowed just 74 yards per game and 3.3 yards per carry. Joniak added Chicago's running game should try to make progress on early downs to allow Mike Glennon to succeed against Pittsburgh. Defensively, Joniak wrote the Bears had \\"their hands full\\" as Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was aided by receivers Antonio Brown and Martavis Bryant, running back Le'Veon Bell, and tight end Jesse James. In spite of Pittsburgh's success in contrast with Chicago's struggles, a common belief was that the Steelers would often \\"play down to their competition,\\" one that was spurned in the wake of Glennon's 2014 Buccaneers upsetting the Steelers 27-24. The first two drives of the game ended with punts, but on the Bears' first punt of the game, Steelers returner Eli Rogers muffed the ball and Sherrick McManis recovered. Jordan Howard would score a three-yard touchdown run on the drive. On the Steelers' next drive, Roethlisberger was sacked by Bryce Callahan and fumbled, with Akiem Hicks recovering. The takeaway failed to result in points, however, as Connor Barth missed a 47-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Roethlisberger threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to Brown, which the Bears responded via Glennon's two-yard touchdown pass to Adam Shaheen. On the final play of the first half, Chris Boswell's 35-yard field goal was blocked by McManis into Marcus Cooper's hands. Cooper raced down the field before suddenly slowing down before he reached the end zone, which allowed Pittsburgh's Vance McDonald to knock the ball away at the one-yard line. The ball was then batted out of the end zone, which led to a penalty against the Steelers and an untimed play for the Bears. A false start penalty on Charles Leno Jr. prompted the Bears to instead kick a 24-yard field goal. In the second half, the Bears suffered their first turnover of the game when Howard was stripped by Ryan Shazier; the Steelers took advantage to score on Bell's one-yard touchdown run. A second giveaway occurred when Glennon's pass for Zach Miller was intercepted by J. J. Wilcox, which enabled the Steelers to tie the game on Boswell's 32-yard field goal. The game remained scoreless through the rest of the half, resulting in overtime. After winning the coin toss to start overtime with the ball, the Bears quickly scored on the second play of the series; Tarik Cohen broke through for a 73-yard touchdown run, but was ruled to have stepped out of bounds at the Steelers' 37-yard line. Two plays later, Howard scored the game-winning touchdown on a 19-yard run. In claiming their first victory of the season, the Bears' running backs provided a solid performance, recording a combined 220 yards on the ground - 200 yards more than in week two.

He doesn't wear a tie, leaves his dress shirts untucked and tools around town on a Yamaha motorcycle. He is an unlikely heartthrob in Germany, where a news anchor compared him to Bruce Willis: “Visually, he’s someone you could imagine starring in a film like ‘Die Hard 6.' ” He's a prolific tweeter, with 526,000 followers, and he runs a low-budget blog. His wife, installation artist Danae Stratou, is pretty cool, too; she is thought to have inspired a song by the band Pulp. As Greece's finance minister, Varoufakis, 54, had the barbs to match his look. In the past few days, he accused Greece’s creditors -- France and Germany -- of economic \\"terrorism.\\" Previously, he described the austerity measures imposed on Greece by Europe as “fiscal waterboarding.\\" And he has derided the troika – the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank -- as “a committee built on rotten foundations.” But it turned out that the brash Varoufakis was a little too brash. After using his confrontational personality to help galvanize opposition to the European austerity program that Greece voted to reject by a surprisingly wide margin Sunday, Varoufakis resigned Monday. He hinted that Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras thought he may have become a bit of liability with the Europeans, whom the Greeks still need to negotiate with if they want to fund their banks and stay within the euro zone. \\"The referendum of 5th July will stay in history as a unique moment when a small European nation rose up against debt-bondage,\\" Varoufakis wrote on his blog on Monday. \\"Soon after the announcement of the referendum results, I was made aware of a certain preference by some Eurogroup participants, and assorted ‘partners’, for my … ‘absence’ from its meetings; an idea that the Prime Minister judged to be potentially helpful to him in reaching an agreement.\\" He added: \\"I shall wear the creditors’ loathing with pride.\\" Varoufakis, an economist who until recently was a visiting professor at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, pledged his support for Tsipras and the new finance minister. The Europeans are meeting Monday and Tuesday to look for a new solution to the crisis, while Greece has nowhere to turn for the cash it needs to keep its banks running and government operating. Without action soon, it might be forced to abandon the euro. It doesn't appear likely that Germany, the continent's economic behemoth and decision-maker, is looking to ease its stance at all post-referendum. Many critics say the decision to hold a referendum -- made a week ago after Tsipras broke off negotiations over another financial relief package, saying they were fruitless -- now exposes Greece to a worse depression than it already has been experiencing. \\"Tsipras and his government are leading the Greek people on a path of bitter abandonment and hopelessness,\\" German Economic Affairs Minister Sigmar Gabriel said, according to Reuters. Tsipras had \\"torn down the last bridges on which Greece and Europe could have moved towards a compromise.\\" Navigating this treacherous landscape will no longer fall to Varoufakis, who has been orchestrating his country’s response to the debt crisis that has pushed Greece's unemployment rate to 25 percent. The Greek government had been urging voters to say no to the austerity package, which included pension cuts, reduced military spending and increases in value added tax, among other measures. Varoufakis had insisted that a “no” vote would not necessarily result in Greece leaving the euro, that future negotiations could focus on debt restructuring and that the referendum would lead to a better future. Democracy deserved a boost in euro-related matters. We just delivered it. Let the people decide. (Funny how radical this concept sounds!) — Yanis Varoufakis (@yanisvaroufakis) June 26, 2015 Varoufakis is a fascinating character -- a brilliant economist with a fiercely independent viewpoint. He calls himself an \\"erratic Marxist\\" -- he considers some of Marx's ideas hugely influential in framing his thinking, and he totally discards others. This stems in part from his background: His father was a communist-turned-steel magnate who spent eight years in a concentration camp under a Greek military dictatorship, while his mother worked for gender equality with the socialist party. “In truth, Karl Marx was responsible for framing my perspective of the world we live in, from my childhood to this day. It is not something that I volunteer to talk about in ‘polite society’ much these days because the very mention of the M-word switches audiences off,\\" he wrote. Yet Varoufakis says he is not really a Marxist. As a young student of economics, he chose to pursue neoclassical economics rather than Marxism, and his writing suggests he believes that Marxism is deeply flawed in some ways and impractical in others. What Varoufakis borrows most clearly from Marxism is not an economic system, but a way of thinking about capitalism. He says that the value of Marx's \\"dialectic\\" -- a tradition of argument that actually began with the Greeks -- is seeing in something the seeds of its opposite. He says that popular thinking about economics is sorely lacking in this approach. Most people don't understand the “joint production” of debts and surpluses, of growth and unemployment, wealth and poverty, good and evil, he wrote. Varoufakis has a complex attitude toward the euro zone. He has been a harsh critic; he campaigned against the euro in the 1990s, and believes that the European Union has deep inequalities. Yet he also believes its disintegration could be dangerous, leading to a rise of fascism in Europe. “If the euro zone collapses, we are all going to be embroiled in a postmodern 1930s,” he said in the seminar below in 2013. Varoufakis says he was deeply influenced by the experience of watching Britain under the conservative government of Margaret Thatcher. At the time, he expected the continued recession under Thatcher to revive the left, but instead the long-lasting recession weakened the left and permanently undermined progressive politics in Britain, he writes. This is a lesson he takes to the euro zone. “I confess I would much rather be promoting a radical agenda, the raison d’être of which is to replace European capitalism with a different system,\\" he wrote in February. \\"Yet my aim here is to offer a window into my view of a repugnant European capitalism whose implosion, despite its many ills, should be avoided at all costs. It is a confession intended to convince radicals that we have a contradictory mission: to arrest the freefall of European capitalism in order to buy the time we need to formulate its alternative.” Most of all, Varoufakis says he opposes the suffering imposed by austerity. He argues that bankrupt banks face more lenient conditions than bankrupt states. He also described Greece as a destroyed economy that is borrowing from one European bailout mechanism to pay back another, a situation he called “the epitome of misanthropy.” “I don’t have a dogmatic position on whether one should leave the euro or not; for me it’s a question of costs and benefits of human suffering,” he said in the 2013 speech. \\"Europe’s elites are behaving today as if they understand neither the nature of the crisis that they are presiding over, nor its implications for the future of European civilisation,\\" he wrote in February. \\"Atavistically, they are choosing to plunder the diminishing stocks of the weak and the dispossessed in order to plug the gaping holes of the financial sector, refusing to come to terms with the unsustainability of the task.\\" Ana Swanson is a reporter for Wonkblog specializing in business, economics, data visualization and China.

Summarize this article: — North Carolina has become the 31st state to add an amendment on marriage to its constitution, with voters banning same-sex marriage and barring legal recognition of unmarried couples by state and local governments. North Carolina is the last state in the South to add such an amendment, and supporters hoped for a resounding victory. Incomplete returns show the amendment up 61.05 percent to 38.95 percent. Primary turnout was heavy. Though there were many other races on the ballot, including primaries for statewide offices and congressional seats, the amendment appeared to drive much of the political discussion. Marriage rights for gay couples has been a topic of national debate this year, and North Carolinas amendment and the campaigns for and against it drew international attention. North Carolinians think of the state as progressive, but thats within the context of the rest of the South, said Andrew Taylor, a political scientist at N.C. State University. This is a socially conservative state, he said. The state has a 16-year-old law banning same-sex marriage. At least two other states will be voting on gay marriage rights in November. Minnesota has a constitutional amendment on its ballot. Maine has a referendum to allow same-sex marriage. Voters in Maryland and Washington state may be asked to affirm new state laws allowing same-sex marriage. Money from national interest groups poured into North Carolina. The National Organization for Marriage contributed 425,000 to the Vote for Marriage campaign, according to the latest reports, and the Human Rights Campaign and its affiliates contributed nearly 500,000 to the opposition Coalition to Protect All N.C. Families. Vote for Marriage raised more than 1 million, and the Coalition to Protect All N.C. Families raised more than 2 million. U.S. amendment called for The Rev. Billy Graham appeared in a full-page ad supporting the amendment, and others in his family recorded pro-amendment messages. About 250 amendment supporters crowded a ballroom at the Hilton North Raleigh for the celebration that was part standard-issue campaign victory party and part wedding reception. There was a cash bar, and music that included love songs. The centerpiece was a seven-tier white wedding cake, capped by a plastic heterosexual couple embracing. After the Associated Press declared that the amendment would pass, Tami Fitzgerald, the Vote for Marriage chairwoman, took the stage to thank the churches, political groups and other volunteers who had helped deliver the win. Ladies and gentlemen, through Gods great mercy we have won an overwhelming victory tonight, she said. The voters, she said, sent a clear and unmistakable desire to protect marriage in our state, in our country. As you all know, marriage was not invented by government. Our creator established it as the union of a man and a woman in an exclusive lifelong covenant and it has merely been recognized by government as the key to a strong and flourishing society. Amendment opponents had former President Bill Clinton and his former chief of staff Erskine Bowles record telephone messages to voters. President Barack Obamas campaign put out a statement saying he opposed the amendment. Opponents worked to raise doubts about the amendments consequences, including running television ads that focused on weakened domestic violence protections for unmarried couples, and loss of health insurance for children of same-sex couples. The early returns projected at the front of the downtown Raleigh event hall were mostly ignored by the crowd of amendment opponents who joined the gathering. Jen Jones, communications director for Protect All NC Families, said the campaign would have done nothing differently. We had an unprecedented coalition, she said. We were on TV as much as we wanted to be. We talked to everyone we could about unintended consequences. Incomplete returns show the amendment losing in only a handful of counties, including Wake, Durham, Orange, Chatham, Buncombe and Watauga. The amendment was losing in Mecklenburg County, but results there were incomplete. Opponents anticipate a slew of lawsuits with the courts ultimately deciding how the amendment will effect employment-related benefits and legal arrangements between unmarried couples. Church involvement credited The Vote for Marriage campaign has its foundation in churches and ran television ads featuring the Bible. They fought back against what they characterized as opponents myths, saying that the amendment would have no impact on domestic violence protections. The involvement of the local churches across this state was absolutely the turning point, said the Rev. Mark Harris, president of the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina. The string of national amendment victories supports arguments for amending the U.S. Constitution to allow only heterosexual marriages, Harris said. Before the campaigns ramped to full intensity, Harris called for a civil conversation on the issue. Civility seemed to melt away by Tuesday. A Cabarrus County man posted a YouTube video of himself firing a shotgun into a vote against sign. A Durham neighborhood listserv stopped taking comments on the amendment when the debate got too hot. Campaigners for and against the amendment called a steady stream of complaints into the Wake County Board of Elections on Tuesday, each side complaining about the opponents illegal electioneering. Ive never seen anything like this, said Gary D. Sims, Wakes deputy elections director. A strong election draw For some voters, the amendment was the main or only reason they came to the polls. Cameron Hughes, 25, was in the process of moving to Charlotte for a new job in banking, but came all the way back to Chapel Hill Tuesday afternoon and drove straight to his polling place on Estes Drive. Fueling his trip in equal measure were gasoline and cold anger that the amendment was even on the ballot. Its an embarrassment and its pathetic, and Im ashamed to have to come out here and vote on something like this, and, if the polls are right, Im ashamed that apparently a large majority of the citizens of my state are pro-bigotry, he said. Hughes made the long trip to ink in just one oval on his ballot. He said that he had been so focused on finishing up work on a graduate degree in recent months that he hadnt been able to properly study the candidates for various offices. Lynne Greene, of Cary, voted for the amendment, at the Fellowship of Christ Presbyterian Church polling site. She said she could support civil unions but not gay marriage. I have an issue with the use of the word marriage, said Greene, a Republican who is retired. I believe a marriage is between a man and a woman. People are conflicted Polling by the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling and the conservative Civitas Institute both showed the amendment winning by double digits, but the Public Policy Poll showed that a majority rejected the amendment after they learned it would also ban civil unions and domestic partnerships. People are conflicted, said Jasmine Beach-Ferrara, executive director of the Campaign for Southern Equality, a group advocating for full marriage rights for gay couples. They hear one thing in their faith community, particularly that homosexuality is a sin. They have an LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) family member or neighbor or co-worker. People are trying to reconcile those two experiences. Voters said they were confused about the amendments wording, and that confusion continued in some polling places where some voters received ballots without the constitutional question on it that were intended for 17-year-old voters A Triangle voter advocacy group says it has received numerous complaints from people who were given the wrong ballot while trying to vote Tuesday. The N.C. Election Protection hot line, part of a nationwide voter education coalition coordinated by the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law, fielded calls from voters all day who were given a ballot without the amendment, said Elizabeth Haddix, staff attorney with the UNC-Chapel Hill Center for Civil Rights, which sponsored the hot line Tuesday. Weve certainly gotten a heavy volume of calls, many more than we expected in a primary, she said.

North Carolina could be the next state to pass a... (Associated Press) Chart shows political swing states that have passed or are considering laws regarding same-sex couples (Associated Press) With 35 percent of precincts reporting Tuesday, unofficial returns showed the amendment passing with about 58 percent of the vote to 42 percent against. In the days before the vote, members of President Barack Obama's cabinet expressed support for gay marriage and former President Bill Clinton recorded phone messages urging voters to reject the amendment. Meanwhile, supporters ran their own ad campaigns and church leaders urged Sunday congregations to vote for the amendment. The Rev. Billy Graham was featured in full-page newspaper ads supporting the amendment. ||||| North Carolina’s voters on Tuesday approved a constitutional amendment that bans same-sex marriage, joining 29 other states and the rest of the South. The vote has been hotly debated in the state: over 3 million has been spent on the rival campaigns, ministers have formed coalitions pushing for and against passage, cities have passed resolutions condemning the measure, former President Bill Clinton and the Rev. Billy Graham have weighed in on opposite sides and law professors have skirmished over the consequences. About half a million people voted early, a record for a primary in the state. The amendment vote took place along with other partisan primaries, some of them closely contested. North Carolina, a religious but also relatively moderate state on social issues, already has a law banning same-sex marriage. But Republican lawmakers pushed an amendment out of concern that the law was in danger of being struck down by judges. While public opinion is shifting rapidly across the country and same-sex marriage continues to achieve legal recognition state by state, polls in North Carolina had shown a narrowing but comfortable margin for passage. Opponents acknowledged that their hopes rested on turnout, and tried to fight the polling gap with money — raising almost twice as much as the amendment supporters — and a robust network of volunteers and get-out-the-vote staff. Jeremy Kennedy, the campaign manager for the main opposition group, Coalition to Protect All NC Families, said that opponents of the amendment had studied the fate of the so-called personhood amendment in Mississippi, which was defeated in November not because the electorate supported abortion rights but largely due to concerns that the amendment’s language was far too broad and could have unintended consequences. “This is not a faith argument,” he said. “We’re not asking you to make an endorsement about how you feel about gay marriage.” The proposed amendment declares that “marriage between one man and one woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized in this state.” A group of family law professors across the state called the language vague and untested, and warned that, in addition to applying to all variations of same-sex unions, it could also apply to the more than 150,000 straight couples in the state who live together but are unmarried. This could invalidate domestic-violence protections, undercut child custody arrangements and jeopardize hospital visitation rights, they said. Three law professors from Campbell University, a Baptist college about 30 miles south of Raleigh, came out with a paper contesting this analysis, saying that this “much broader view of the Amendment and its consequences has little support in the Amendment’s language or context, or in court decisions from North Carolina or other states.” While opponents made the unintended consequences arguments to voters who might otherwise support the amendment, polling showed that feelings about the issue were divided as they were across much of the nation: along generational lines. “The biggest predictor of this is partisanship, but also age” said Christopher Cooper, a professor of political science at Western Carolina University. “At this point it’s really a mobilization game amongst younger voters.” ||||| Summary:","completion":"North Carolina became the 31st state to add an amendment on marriage to its constitution, banning same-sex marriage and preventing legal recognition of unmarried couples by state and local governments. This makes it the last state in the South to add such an amendment. Marriage rights for gay couples emerged as a significant national debate, and North Carolina's amendment drew international attention. Although the state already had a 16-year-old law banning same-sex marriage, the addition of the amendment to the constitution further solidifies this stance. Campaigns for and against the amendment received funding from national interest groups, such as the National Organization for Marriage and the Human Rights Campaign. Key figures like the Rev. Billy Graham, former President Bill Clinton, and President Barack Obama's campaign expressed their views on the amendment. Opponents of the amendment raised questions about potential consequences, including possible weakened domestic violence protections for unmarried couples and loss of health insurance for children of same-sex couples. However, proponents of the amendment praised church involvement and framed the discussion around the traditional view of marriage as a union of a man and woman. Two other states, Minnesota and Maine, are due to vote on gay marriage rights in November, while Maryland and Washington state are expected to address the issue of same-sex marriage in new state laws."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Without a good clipper, doing undercut hair for men can be difficult. Ideally, your clipper will be a single-length clipper. But if you want to do fading and tapering, you will need a clipper that allows length adjustments. The ideal clipper to do undercut hair for men is one of high quality and high durability. An Andis cordless clipper, for instance, is a popular option. As for corded clippers, an Andis or Oster model is preferable. With a single-length clipper, choose one that is numbered one, two, or three. You could also use a number zero, but this tends to be too short. A clipper set at four or above is usually too long, though some men might want to “test drive” an undercut by getting the short part of their hair clipped with a number four clipper. The temples are the corners of the hairline where the hairline curves and thins, and provide an important guide when trying to do undercut hair for men. The temples sit in different locations on each person’s face. To identify a person’s temples, first locate their hairline, the place where their hair meets their forehead. You might also be able to locate the temple based on the position of the ears. The tops of the ears, traced forward to the edges of the face, typically intersect the temples. Trace the hairline to its outer edges on the left and right side. When you notice the hairline angle up and out, you’ve located the upper temple. Parting the hair will make it easier for you to see which hair you need to be cutting. Make a clean part and then clip the long hair on the top of their head back so it's not in your way. If their hair is too short to clip back, use water or a styling product to keep their hair parted.

The inquest revealed that miscommunication between air traffic controllers played a significant role in the devastating accident. Following a thorough investigation, it was determined that air traffic controllers had misunderstood a key piece of jargon used by Brian Normington during radio communications. The misunderstanding led to crucial information regarding the position of his aircraft not being accurately relayed to Sophie Hastings and her crew aboard the twin-engine Cessna. The families of the victims, who had been waiting for answers for four years, expressed their frustration and grief at the revelations. They held the air traffic control personnel responsible for the accident due to their failure to adhere to the proper procedure and clear communication practices. In response to the verdict, the air traffic control agency committed to making changes to their training and communication protocols to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future. They issued a public apology to the families of the victims and pledged to make continuous improvements in their operations. As the story comes to a close, the community of Coventry Airport mourns the loss of the five individuals whose lives were tragically cut short in the mid-air collision. The memory of Brian Normington, Sophie Hastings, John 'Harvey' Antrobus, James Beagley, and Sybille Gautrey lives on, serving as a sobering reminder of the vital importance of clear communication and thorough training within the aviation industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It’s also a natural time to have a meaningful or sweet discussion with her and, since you’ll already be walking side by side, it’s a perfect scenario for you to put your arm around her. Avoid discussing anything heavy or negative. Walk slowly and keep your body language relaxed. Suggest taking a stroll with her at a nearby park on a pretty afternoon. Another good excuse for a walk is to go window shopping or run an errand. Wherever you happen to be hanging out or whatever you might be doing, always try to sit or stand close to her when it makes sense to do so. Obviously, don’t follow her into the bathroom or anything like that, but in general, staying by her side creates a “couple” atmosphere and provides ample opportunities to get your arm around her. If she seems uncomfortable with your nearness or makes excuses to get away, give it a rest. You want her to feel liked, not stalked. If she looks cold or if you happen to be out together on a windy or overcast day, be a gentleman and offer her your jacket. Not only will she think you’re romantic, but putting your jacket over her shoulders provides an excellent opportunity to sneak your arm around her. Place the jacket sweetly around her shoulders, and then let your arm remain naturally around them. Smile at her and give her shoulder a little squeeze after you’re got your arm around her. She’ll most likely look up at you when you do this, and you two will share a real moment of closeness. If all else fails, give this classic a try! Yawn a bit and naturally lift your arms up in a stretch, being as casual as you can. When you bring your arms down, put one of them around her shoulders. If this feels a little obvious, you can always overact the move in a very obvious, cheesy way. This will probably make her laugh, and you should too! Sharing a laugh will break the ice and create a sense of comfort and ease between the two of you, and you’ll have your arm snugly around her.

The US is well known for jazz , which has gained world-wide popularity. In contrast to classical music, which follows formal European traditions, jazz is natural and free-form. It is full of energy, expressing the moods, interests, and feelings of the people. It has a modern sound that makes people very excited. In the 1920s jazz sounded like America. And So it does today. The origins of this music are as interesting as the music itself. Jazz was produced by American blacks, who were brought to the Southern States as slaves. They were sold to plantation owners and forced to work long hours in the cotton and tobacco fields. This work was hard and life was short. When a Negro died, his friends and relatives formed a group to carry the body to the cemetery. A band often went with them. On the way to the cemetery the band played slow and sad music. But on the way home the mood changed. _ Everybody was happy. Death had removed one of their members, but the living were glad to be alive. The band played happy music, which made everyone want to dance. It was an early form of jazz. Music has always been important in their lives. Coming mainly from West Africa, the black men who were brought to America already possessed a rich musical tradition. This music centered on religious ceremonies in which dancing, singing, clapping and stamping to the beat of a drum were important forms of musical expression. As these people settled in to their fields, they made up work songs. Singing made the hard work go faster. Another musical form that helped to develop jazz was the blues. Blues songs always describe something sad -- an unhappy love affair, a money problem, bad luck. To this day, the expression \\"feeling blue\\" means being sad.

The letter is addressed to a woman named Seetha, who is apparently Suryaprakash's long-lost mother. Intrigued and determined to find her, Suryaprakash embarks on a journey to piece together his family history and solve the mystery surrounding her disappearance. The journey takes Suryaprakash to the small, quiet town of Mirzapur, where his mother was last seen. As he delves deeper into the town's past, he discovers that Seetha was once a renowned vocalist and a powerful figure in the town's arts and culture scene. Her boundless talents, however, made her some enemies in the community who accused her of using her gifts for personal gain. A scandalous rumor about Seetha eventually led to her mysterious departure from Mirzapur. As Suryaprakash investigates further, he starts noticing odd occurrences and suspicious characters surrounding him. He learns that the nefarious accusations made against his mother were not mere hearsay, but a meticulously planned conspiracy to defame her and usurp her social stature. As the conspiracy unravels, Suryaprakash finds himself in the middle of a power struggle involving the town's corrupt mayor, an unscrupulous business tycoon, and a devious music maestro who had once seen Seetha as a threat to his career. While revealing the truth about his mother's sacrifices and true character, Suryaprakash also uncovers a series of events that ultimately led to her tragic death. In the process, Suryaprakash also discovers his own talents in music and singing inherited from his mother, prompting him to embrace his heritage. As he enlists the help of an aspiring singer, Aaradhya, they use the power of music and Seetha's songs to unite the town and confront the villains behind the conspiracy. Ultimately, Suryaprakash brings the culprits to justice and reclaims his mother's legacy – restoring Mirzapur's rich cultural heritage and introducing his newfound talent to the world as a tribute to his mother, Seetha."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The picture celebrates Hollywood glamour and punctures it all at once, as it gets a lot of comic mileage out of pompous and ego-maniacal actors and duplicitous studio executives. The cast includes a gaggle of great character comedians--Allyn Joslyn as a crafty press agent, Ted Healy as Dick Powell's would-be manager, Fritz Feld as an excitable restaurant patron, Glenda Farrell as Mona Marshall's sarcastic Gal Friday, Edgar Kennedy as a put-upon drive-in manager, Mabel Todd as Mona's goofy sister, and Hugh Herbert as her even goofier dad.

Paragraph: Although Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.

Answer the question...instruments in all of my love by led zeppelin??","completion":"\\"All of My Love\\" is a song by the legendary English rock band Led Zeppelin. It is the sixth track on their 1979 album \\"In Through the Out Door.\\" The song, written by Robert Plant and John Paul Jones, is a tribute to Plant's late son Karac, who passed away in 1977 at the age of five. \\"All of My Love\\" is notable for its tender and heartfelt lyrics, as well as its unique instrumentation within the hard rock and blues context of Led Zeppelin. In this track, the following instruments were played by the band members: 1. Vocals: Robert Plant, the frontman and lead singer of Led Zeppelin, handles the main vocal duties on \\"All of My Love.\\" Plant's emotive singing style and powerful voice are critical components of the track. Plant is known for his wide vocal range and distinctive timbre, which is on full display in this heartfelt and emotional song. 2. Synthesizers and Keyboards: John Paul Jones, the bassist and keyboardist of Led Zeppelin, had a monumental role in shaping the sound of \\"All of My Love.\\" He played multiple keyboard instruments on this track, including the Yamaha GX-1, a polyphonic synthesizer. The synthesizer is responsible for the rich, layered textures that give the song its ethereal quality. Additionally, Jones played a Hammond organ on the song, which contributes to the overall lush and spacious atmosphere. 3. Electric Guitar: Jimmy Page, the lead guitarist and co-founder of Led Zeppelin, plays electric guitar on \\"All of My Love.\\" Page's guitar work is notably understated compared to his typical performance style. Instead of flashy guitar solos, Page focused on crafting melodic lines and chords that complemented the song's emotive nature. His guitar playing is more in the background, supporting the rich texture created by the synths and keyboards. 4. Drums: John Bonham, the drummer of Led Zeppelin, is known for his powerful and thundering drumming style, which can be heard in several of the band's most famous tracks. However, on \\"All of My Love,\\" he opted for a more subtle and gentle style, in line with the song's emotional tone. Bonham played drums with precision and restraint, providing a solid foundation for the track. 5. Bass Guitar: While synthesizers and keyboards take center stage in \\"All of My Love,\\" John Paul Jones also provides bass guitar to the song. The bass guitar is not as prominent in the mix but plays an essential role in anchoring the harmony and providing a sense of fullness to the overall sound. In conclusion, \\"All of My Love\\" by Led Zeppelin features a combination of instruments that create a unique and emotional experience for the listener. The track relies on the heartfelt vocals of Robert Plant, layered synthesizers and keyboard textures by John Paul Jones, mellifluous electric guitar by Jimmy Page, and subtle yet powerful drumming by John Bonham. \\"All of My Love\\" showcases the versatility and dynamic range of Led Zeppelin through its instrumentation, making it a standout track in their discography."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His father, shamed and burdened by Mohammed's blindness, arrives late to pick him up and then tries to convince the headmaster to keep Mohammed over the summer. The headmaster refuses, so Mohammed's father eventually takes him home. Mohammed's father, who is a widower, now wants to marry a local girl and is preparing for the wedding. He approaches the girl's parents with gifts and they give him approval. He tries to hide the fact that he has a blind son because he fears the girl's family will see that as a bad omen. Meanwhile, Mohammed happily roams around the beautiful hills of his village with his sisters. He touches and feels the nature around him, counting the sounds of animals, and imitating them. He displays a unique attitude towards nature, and seems to understand its rhythms and textures as a language. Mohammed goes to the local school with his sisters and reads the lessons from his textbook in Braille, which amazes the children and the teacher. Fearing his bride-to-be's family will learn of Mohammed, his father takes him away and leaves him with a blind carpenter who agrees to make him an apprentice. The blind carpenter mentors the boy, who wants to see God. Mohammad says God does not love him and thus made him blind and tells him about how his teacher told him that God loves them more as they are blind, but then asks why God should make him blind if he loves him more. He also tells him that he wanted to be able to see God, to which his teacher had said that God is everywhere and that you can also feel God. The carpenter then just says that he agrees with his teacher and walks away, possibly affected by the boy's words, as he himself is blind.

It's a punctuation rule in English. The rule is when you join two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so), a comma should precede the conjunction. It's vital to follow punctuation rules because they can change the meaning of a sentence entirely. When you read a sentence, punctuation marks help you understand how to read it out loud. Even while reading silently, they provide cues about how to interpret written words. For example, without the comma in the sentence you provided, it might be read as saying that your system (including Outlook) is working fine after upgrading, yet Outlook can't function normally. This is contradictory and confusing. The comma clears up this confusion by showing that the part about Outlook is a new, separate thought: after the upgrade, the general system is fine, but Outlook has problems. In conclusion, it's crucial to get your punctuation right to convey your message, which can also help readers understand and appreciate your writing better. Correct punctuation is also respectful to your readers, as it doesn't require them to re-read sentences to grasp the intended meaning.

Meanwhile, in 1274, the former Dali Kingdom was officially reorganized as the Province of Yunnan, with Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar as governor. In May 1275, the governor sent a report to the emperor stating that the embassy had not returned; that the Burmese evidently had no intention of submitting; and that war was the only way forward. But the emperor rejected an outright invasion. Just coming off a disastrous Japanese campaign, the emperor was unwilling to commit the central government troops to what he considered a low priority affair. He was now focused on delivering the final blow against the Song; the emperor ordered the Yunnan provincial army to secure the borderlands in order to block the escape path of the Song refugees. He also sanctioned a limited border war if Pagan contested the takeover. As planned, the Yunnan army proceeded to consolidate the borderlands in 1275-76. Elsewhere, the main Mongol armies had captured most of the Song territory by 1276. By 1277, at least one Burmese vassal state named \\"Gold Teeth\\" had submitted to the Mongols. Like in 1272, the Burmese government responded by sending an army to reclaim the rebellious state; but unlike in 1272, the Mongols had posted a sizable garrison there. Though it was ultimately under Mongol command, many of the officers and most of the soldiers of the garrison were Turkic-speaking peoples or people from the further west: Turks from Samarkand, Bukhara, Merv and Nishapur, but also captive soldiers from the Persian Khwarazmid empire, the Kipchaks, and even Bulgars from the lower Volga.

There are numerous films relating to WW2, but Mother Night is quite distinctive among them: In this film, we are introduced to Howard Campbell (Nolte), an American living in Berlin and married to a German, Helga Noth (Lee), who decides to accept the role of a spy: More specifically, a CIA agent Major Wirtanen (Goodman) recruits Campbell who becomes a Nazi propagandist in order to enter the highest echelons of the Hitler regime. However, the deal is that the US Government will never acknowledge Campbell's role in the war for national security reasons, and so Campbell becomes a hated figure across the US. After the war, he tries to conceal his identity, but the past comes back and haunts him. His only \\"friend\\" is Wirtanen, but even he cannot do much for the avalanche of events that fall upon poor Campbell... The story is deeply touching, as we watch the tragedy of Campbell who although a great patriot, is treated by disdain by everybody who surrounds him. Not only that, but he also gradually realizes that even the persons who are most close to him, have many secrets of their own. Vonnegut provides us with a moving atmosphere, with Campbell's despair building up and almost choking the viewer. Nolte plays the role of his life, in my opinion; he is even better than in \\"Affliction\\", although in both roles he plays tragic figures who are destined to self-destruction. Sheryl Lee is also excellent, and the same can be said for the whole cast in general. I haven't read the book, so I cannot appraise how the film compares to it.

Passage:Eschewing the art-music world, Harnell sought work in pop and jazz, working as a for-hire pianist after returning to New York City in 1950. He played in Lester Lanin's band at this time and found work as an accompanist for singers such as Judy Garland, Maurice Chevalier, and Marlene Dietrich. From 1958 to 1961, he was Peggy Lee's full-time accompanist and arranger for the albums Anything Goes:Cole Porter and Peggy Lee & the George Shearing Quartet. In 1962, he was hurt in a car crash, and while he recovered, Kapp Records asked him to work on writing potential hits in the then-hot genre of bossa nova. Harnell's biggest success was with his arrangement of \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\", which was a hit in the US in 1963 (number 14 Pop, number 4 AC) and which won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance. The song also peaked at number 6 in Harnell's hometown, on WMCA in New York, on January 16, 1963. The album from which it was taken went to number 3 on the Billboard 200. Harnell would go on to release nearly 20 easy listening albums, on Kapp, Columbia, and Motown among others. Links: a. Motown b. Billboard c. Kapp Records d.

Berry farm produced conventional milk, while Rose farm produced organic milk. But I can use this background: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).

If so, you probably noted the V-shaped formation of the birds or the birds flying in a ball-like formation. Why do birds fly this way? Many theories have been developed to explain the formation patterns of different types of birds. One theory is that birds fly in certain formations to take advantage of the laws of nature. The birds know that flying in a V-shaped pattern will save energy. Like the lead cyclist in a race who decreases wind force for the cyclists who follow, the lead bird cuts wind force for the birds that follow. This decrease in wind force means that the birds use up to 70 percent less energy during their flight. When the lead bird becomes tired, a more rested bird takes over that position. But saving energy is important for more than one reason. Sometimes food is short during migration flights. Keeping energy enables the birds to fly longer distances between meals. When food is sighted, the birds guide one another in a different way. When a bird identifies a familiar feeding area, it might turn around in order to signal the group to change direction. Then, this bird becomes the new leader. It helps guarantee that other birds will know exactly where it is going. Then the whole group makes a change in direction, gently streaming from the sky down to the ground. This formation is like an arrow pointing to the location of food. Scientists have also studied the birds that sometimes fly in a ball-like formation. Researchers believe that the birds come together if a predator is spotted. The predator may then become impatient waiting for a single bird to fly away from the group. The birds will often dip and dive as a group, frustrating even the most persistent enemy. Scientists report that this is a very effective method of defense against an attack. The birds care for their fellow fliers through teamwork. As transportation expert Henry Ford once said, \\"If everyone is moving forward together, then... Question: Which is the best title for the passage?

Question: Who does Saxton and the countess find on the train? Movie plot title: Horror Express Movie plot: Professor Alexander Saxton (Christopher Lee) is an anthropologist returning home to Europe via the Trans-Siberian Railway. He brings with him a large crate containing the prize from his expedition to the Himilayas: the frozen remains of a primitive humanoid creature, which Saxton is sure is the missing link in the evolutionary chain. Also on board is Dr. Wells (Peter Cushing), another Englishman and a colleague of Saxton's.Mysterious deaths occur even before the train sets out. A known thief is found dead on the platform after having looked into the crate. His corpse is discovered bleeding from the eyes, which have turned blank and white. A slightly unbalanced monk named Pujardov (a Rasputin-esque figure, played by the Argentine actor Alberto de Mendoza), claims that the crate is evil. Pujardov is the spiritual adviser for Count Maryan Petrovski (George Rigaud) and his wife, Irina (Silvia Tortosa), and he tries to demonstrate to them that the crate is an omen of evil: in a bizarre rationalization, he claims that where there is evil, there is no place for the sign of the cross, and a piece of chalk fails to make the marking of the cross on the side of the crate. Saxton dismisses it as a trick and discredits the monk.Saxton is eager to keep his find a secret from everyone, especially Dr. Wells, but Wells pays the baggage man to look into the crate when everyone is gone and tell him what's inside. Later, the man does this and is also killed by the creature, which possesses a glowing red eye. After gazing at the red eye, the man's eyes begin to bleed and turn white until he falls down dead. The ape-man quickly picks the lock of the crate just like the Chinese thief did back at the beginning of the train's voyage. The creature leaves the crate and places the baggage man's corpse inside instead; the others discover it later and Saxton is forced to come clean about his discovery. Inspector Mirov (Julio Peña) represents authority on the train, and he tries to keep the news of the death quiet among the passengers,...

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sort of like a very primitive episode of \\"General Hospital\\" set in a natal ward (and one for tough cases at that), this fast-moving programmer has a satisfying emotional impact -- mainly because Eric Linden, as the distraught young husband in the main plot, is so palpably a wreck, and with such good reason. His expectant wife, Loretta Young, is brought to the ward at the beginning of a 20-year prison sentence for offing a lecher who probably had it coming to him; Ms. Young, as always, doesn't do anything to disinvite audience sympathy, and she's a little too good to be true, though sympathetic and lovely to look at, of course. Her difficult pregnancy and relationships with the other girls of the ward form the heart of the movie, and the outcome -- not an entirely happy one -- feels right. Aline MacMahon, \\"one of the cinema's few perfect actresses,\\" in the apt words of film historian David Thomson, exudes warmth and authority as the head nurse, and Glenda Farrell, as a none-too-willing new mom of twins, gets to croon \\"Frankie and Johnny\\" as a drunken lullaby. Frank McHugh figures in another subplot, and he gets to show more range than Warners usually permitted him. It's scaled and paced modestly, and Linden's expectant-dad panic stays with you for days -- this sort of part was often played for laughs, but he's a terrified young kid in trouble, and very persuasive. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is mostly positive. The reviewer dedicates significant portions of the review to praise for the story, characters, and performances. For instance, they highlight the satisfying emotional impact of the film, laud Eric Linden's performance as the distraught young husband, and commend Loretta Young's portrayal of an expectant mother. Specific performances by Aline MacMahon and Glenda Farrell are singled out as noteworthy, with McMahon being described as \\"one of the cinema's few perfect actresses.\\" In relation to the narrative, the reviewer notes that the outcome feels right and matches the tone and progression of the story, which signifies their appreciation for the film's plot. Although they mention that Loretta Young's character may be \\"a little too good to be true,\\" they quickly add that she sustains audience sympathy which is essential in story-telling. This is more of a balanced critique than a negative comment. Finally, Frank McHugh's role is celebrated for its range, again underlining the reviewer's overall positivity toward the film's performances, despite the modest scale of the film. The only point that could be interpreted as slightly negative is the mention of the film’s pacing being \\"modest,\\" but this seems to be more of a neutral observation rather than a negative criticism. Therefore, upon detailed reading, the review exudes a highly affirmative sentiment about the film, making it a 'positive' review."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I longed for the comfort of my family, the laughter of my friends, and the homecooked meals that my maw used to make. Wichita had been an exciting adventure, but now, all I could think about was how much I missed the simple pleasures of my former life. I wondered if the distance I had created through my pursuit of these city experiences had not only taken me far away from my roots, but also who I really was. As I walked through the city streets, the bustling commotion of people, cars, and flashing lights felt overwhelming. I craved the crisp, clean air of the Kansas plains and the rustic charm of the rolling wheat fields. In the back of my mind, I could hear my maw warning me that this detour might change the course of my existence forever. The incessant consumption of hamburgers had become symbolic of the deeper void I was trying to fill - one of longing for connection, belonging, and the embrace of those who knew me best and loved me without judgment. When I moved to Wichita, I thought I was chasing my dreams and escaping the limitations of my small-town existence. I had imagined a life of opportunity, growth, and excitement. Instead, I found myself tethered to a lifestyle that felt empty and shallow. My days were filled with meaningless interactions, my nights spent seeking solace in the greasy satisfaction of one hamburger after another. As I reflected on the past few months, I found it increasingly difficult to deny the truth: my life in Wichita was a far cry from what I had envisioned. I couldn't help but think that my maw's worries may have held some wisdom. With each hamburger I devoured, I could feel myself slipping further into a world that I neither recognized nor enjoyed. As the pull of my Kansas home grew stronger each day, I wondered if it was time to find my way back—before it was too late. I decided it was time to take control of my life again and rediscover the person I was before Wichita had taken hold of me. I started by cutting back on the hamburgers, reintroducing healthier foods, and gradually restoring balance to my diet. I also began reaching out to old friends and family members, ensuring that I stayed connected to the warmth and love that I had left behind in pursuit of my \\"big city\\" dreams. With each day that passed, I found myself growing more confident in my decision to return to my roots. I believed that I could find contentment in the simple joys of life, with the people who loved and understood me. Although the journey wouldn't be an easy one, I felt that it was a necessary step toward rediscovering happiness and a life filled with purpose. So, I packed my bags, said my goodbyes to Wichita, and returned to Kansas, knowing that while this chapter of my life was coming to a close, another awaited me with open arms. As I reconnected with my maw, family, and friends, I found myself quickly wrapped up in the warmth of their love, and a deep sense of belonging that had eluded me in the city. It wasn't long before I realized that I had made the right choice - to come back home, where the simple life and genuine connections with others were worth more than any flashy, urban lifestyle could ever offer. And while the temptation of a hamburger may still linger from time to time, I soon learned that there was a certain satisfaction that comes from a wholesome, homecooked meal - one that no city experience could ever hope to replace. Because at the end of the day, family and connection, and remaining true to one's self, are what truly make life meaningful and fulfilling."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I knew that my daughter’s cat, who has been part of our family since my daughter was in second grade, was dying of a fast growing cancer. I couldn’t tell my daughter because I didn’t want to upset her and take her mind off her studies and impending graduation. Once our Vet determined that there was nothing further that could be done she showed me how to give pain meds and fluids at home to keep her comfortable in hopes that she would live long enough to allow my daughter to say goodbye after her graduation. The entire week I stayed with our cat around the clock. She had completely stopped eating and drinking and was slowly dying before my eyes. She slept most of the time except when I had to put the needle in between her shoulder blades to give her fluids. Then she would cry quietly and look at me with pleading eyes. Her breathing was becoming so shallow that I had to get close to her and listen to see if she was still alive. After a week of this I began to realize that the most unselfish thing I could do for this beautiful creature was to let her go. I wrapped her in her favorite blanket and and drove her to our Vets office after they had closed for the day. She was so skinny and frail but when I held her close she still purred. I thanked her for the 14 years she had been one of my daughter’s closest companions and I held her as she took her last breath.

Spontini, one of whose best operas was based on the life of that much mis-married enthusiast for divorce, John Milton, took to wife a member of the Erard family.

Article:","completion":"Title: Sebastian Vettel Shatters Records as the Youngest F1 World Champion in Red Bull's Astounding Victory at Abu Dhabi Sebastian Vettel made history on November 14, 2010, at Abu Dhabi, by becoming the youngest-ever Formula 1 World Champion. As the lights went out on the grand and lucrative Yas Marina Circuit, the young German Red Bull Racing driver set an unparalleled record by winning the title-deciding race in the United Arab Emirates, proving to the world that F1's youth is a force to be reckoned with. The race was the culmination of F1's most unpredictable and chart-topping season, which saw five different drivers vying for the championship. However, none could match the astonishing performance of 23-year-old Vettel, who displayed exemplary racecraft and relentless determination. While Vettel conquered the race and rose from third to first in the standings, the fortunes of Ferrari's Fernando Alonso seemed to plummet as he finished the race in a disappointing seventh place. With only 11 points between them at the start of the race, the two-time World Champion saw his championship hopes vanish in the desert heat. Ferrari's cautious strategy and its unyielding focus on covering Mark Webber's movements ultimately led to Alonso's downfall, as he finished a heartbreaking fifteen points behind Vettel in the final standings. The McLarens of Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button had an electrifying presence on the track, with the British duo finishing second and third in the race. Despite trailing Vettel in points throughout the season, they exhibited splendid teamwork, compelling strategies, and aggressive driving, maintaining McLaren's dignity as a top contender in Formula 1. Both Hamilton and Button have previously tasted World Championship success in 2008 and 2009 respectively, and their impressive results at Abu Dhabi were a testament to their experience and skill. Red Bull Racing concluded the 2010 season with 498 points, sealing their first Constructors' Championship title and affirming their dominance in the Formula 1 landscape. Not only did the Austrian energy drink giant-sponsored team produce a championship-winning car, but they also demonstrated exceptional teamwork, strategy, and optimization of speed throughout the season under the meticulous guidance of Christian Horner, the Team Principal. Sebastian Vettel's monumental victory in Abu Dhabi marks not just the ascent of youth in Formula 1, but also the emergence of Red Bull Racing as a powerhouse of speed and innovation. The meteoric rise of the young German prodigy has rewritten the history of this prestigious motorsports event and introduced a new generation of drivers set to redefine the limits of speed, endurance, and greatness. The record-breaking achievement by Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull Racing at the splendid Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi has etched their names in the annals of Formula 1 history. As the sun sets on another exhilarating season, the world awaits with bated breath for the next generation of speed machines and prodigious talents to take the stage and continue defining the exhilarating world of Formula 1 racing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They later found out the bad news. Mike had been infected with HIV. Luckily enough Pete was healthy, he didn't get any diseases. and a hint : The Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) is the virus that causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ). Most researchers believe that the HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century. HIV is transmitted by sexual contact and by contact with infected bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, breast milk, and vaginal secretions. It is also passed from mother to fetus. HIV is now a pandemic , with an estimated (as of 2008) 38.6 million people now living with the disease worldwide. It is estimated that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognized in 1981. For further information about HIV/AIDS, see the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) web site at http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/factsheets/ .

HIV is transmitted by sexual contact and by contact with infected bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, breast milk, and vaginal secretions. 2. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. Now, let's analyze these details step-by-step: 1. Both Mike and Pete had unprotected sex with their respective dates. - This indicates that both of them were exposed to possible infections due to the nature of unprotected sex. 2. Mike was infected with HIV. - This suggests that Mike's partner had the virus, and it was transmitted during their sexual encounter. 3. Pete was healthy and did not get any diseases. - This means that Pete was not infected with HIV or any other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) after his sexual encounter. From this analysis, we can conclude that, among the two friends, it is Pete who did not get infected with a virus that is transmitted by contact with infected blood (in this case, HIV)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Noninfectious diseases are not contagious because they are not caused by pathogens. Instead, they are caused by such factors as lifestyle choices, environmental toxins, or mutations. Q: Why are noninfectious diseases not contagious? A: Available choices: I. they are contagious II. they are viral III. they are inherited IV. non-pathogen caused Answer:","completion":"Noninfectious diseases are not contagious because of option IV: they are not caused by pathogens. To understand why this is the case, it is important to differentiate between infectious and noninfectious diseases based on their causes and modes of transmission. Infectious diseases are caused by pathogens, which are microorganisms that can infect a host, causing a disease. Pathogens include viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. These diseases are contagious because they can be transmitted from one person to another through direct or indirect contact. For instance, an individual might contract a bacterial infection by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face, or by inhaling airborne viruses released by an infected person's cough or sneeze. On the other hand, noninfectious diseases cannot be passed from one person to another through contact because they are not caused by pathogens. Instead, these diseases are brought about by various factors such as lifestyle choices, environmental toxins, or genetic mutations. Lifestyle choices that contribute to noninfectious diseases include poor diet, lack of exercise, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption. These behaviors can lead to chronic conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Individuals might also be exposed to environmental toxins in their surroundings, like pollutants in the air and water or hazardous chemicals in consumer products. Long-term or high-level exposure to these toxins can increase an individual's risk of developing noninfectious diseases like asthma or kidney disease. Lastly, genetic mutations can also result in noninfectious diseases, as seen in genetic disorders like cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia. In summary, noninfectious diseases are not contagious because they are caused by factors such as lifestyle choices, environmental toxins, and genetic mutations rather than by pathogens, which are responsible for the spread of infectious diseases. Consequently, the transmission modes that apply to infectious diseases do not pertain to noninfectious diseases, as they cannot be transmitted from one person to another through direct or indirect contact."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Representing yourself in court can be a tricky endeavor. There are confusing legal terms to learn, strict procedures to follow and volumes of case law that often need to be understood to prepare a case. Lake County officials and a private agency that assists indigent litigants in Illinois want to make the practice easier by creating a self-help center for people who choose to represent themselves in legal matters. The center, which will be housed in the law library at the main courthouse in Waukegan, could open later this summer. \\"I think it's going to be extremely helpful,\\" Court Administrator Bob Zastany said. \\"There is a population out there that will take advantage of this resource.\\" The self-help center will be the only one of its kind in the county. Only a few operate nationwide, officials said.

The organization has received a 25,000 grant from the Illinois Equal Justice Foundation, a nonprofit group that funds programs designed to increase access to legal information and assistance, to help pay for the effort. Prairie State will share the money with the county. The county's law library is on the first floor of the governmental center at 18 N. County St. The new self-help center will be designed to help litigants find the information they need to properly represent themselves in court, an undertaking that can be complicated and confusing. \\"Some people can do OK on their own, and some people can do OK with some help,\\" said Linda Rothnagel, the managing attorney for Prairie State Legal Services. \\"But other people can't do it.

Erik scored a fantastic goal called a \\"rabona\\" when he wrapped his left foot around his right leg and kicked the ball. This goal happened during a Europa League game between Tottenham and Astera Tripoli. People were amazed by the goal, but Martin Keown said it was a bit self-indulgent, meaning Erik might have been showing off a bit. Martin also said that if Erik can find a good balance in his playing style, he will be a great player. Meanwhile, Harry Kane scored three goals during the match, which is also very impressive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Under the public policy exception, employers cannot fire an employee for doing something that is in the public interest. Your employer also can't fire you for refusing to do something that would violate the law or undermine some public interest. Choices: (a). You're not expected to withdraw federal or state student loan exemptions from your employment after your termination. Without these exemptions, you may have to quit your job.. (b). It's not common for an employer to openly state a reason for terminating you that violates public policy-but it can happen. For example, suppose your employer has been sued after a customer slipped and fell.. (c). States also may not remove or renew the public policy exception if the exception applies to the employer. If you are fired for refusing to take a job, for example, you may still be able to sue for negligence, fraud, or other questionable business practices.. (d).

It's not common for an employer to openly state a reason for terminating you that violates public policy-but it can happen.

Other choices are incorrect for the following reasons: (a) This choice is unrelated to the topic of public policy exceptions and at-will employment. (c) This choice seems to be confusing in terms of context and does not clearly connect with the public policy exception discussed in the paragraph.

Question: What skill does Cynthia have Movie title: 100 Girls Movie plot: After leaving a party at a women's dormitory (aka the \\"virgin vault\\"), Matthew (Jonathan Tucker) is trapped in an elevator with an unknown, and unseen, woman when the power goes out. Matthew and this unknown woman have sex in the dark. When Matthew wakes up in the morningâstill in the elevatorâhe finds himself alone with a pair of her panties.[1] On a mission to find his mystery maiden by finding a matching bra for the panties, Matthew becomes the maintenance man of the virgin vault. After releasing mice, he goes room to room, setting traps. He convinces the panicked women to leave their rooms and then starts to look for a match. When he is unsuccessful, he continues to break things (such as the air conditioning) in an effort to find his woman. He also fixes the television set, which is greatly received by women he refers to as \\"Jane-ites\\", as they have a great interest in films adapted from books by Jane Austen. He doesn't get much help from his roommate Rod (James DeBello), who keeps telling him to give up, and together they philosophize about men and women. Rod tells him that he doesn't need a girlfriend and that it's futile to try to find the \\"bra matching the panties\\", and Matthew accuses him of being too machismo. Rod introduces Matthew to the \\"penile power\\", which involves the use of weights attached to his penis as a means of increasing the organ's size. He does this and insults women to make himself feel better about the problem he has with his manhood; he suffers from hypospadias. Early on, Matthew watches as a woman named Patty (Emmanuelle Chriqui) and her boyfriend Crick (Johnny Green) fight. Crick is the epitome of the macho man stereotype, with his big pectorals, conceited attitude, and abusiveness. He wears a pony-tail, a manicured goatee, \\"male make-up\\", and chews nicotine gum, much to Matthew's dismay. Matthew tries to save Patty, but is hurt by Crick. Crick leaves, and Patty tries to help Matthew, but Matthew can't help but think of Patty's reputation as a \\"slut.\\" While searching one...

As mobile gaming, mobile commerce and mobile computing in general explode, so do the opportunities for mobile exploits. Put simply, tapping the wrong link on your phone can land you in just as much trouble as clicking the wrong link from your laptop or other computer. A phishing attack — wherein a user is prompted by a seemingly legitimate page to enter certain log-in credentials such as PayPal or banking information — isn’t a sophisticated hack that programmatically sifts through your data or bricks your hardware. Rather, it relies on a certain lack of caution and naiveté on the part of users. And given the state of mobile applications, cybercriminals can often use the same mechanisms — Facebook scams, spam email, etc. — that they’d use to nab your data while you’re using a more traditional computer. Mobile security firm Lookout has done some research on mobile phishing attacks and compiled the data into this infographic. Is mobile security something you think about or are concerned about?

With the continued rise of mobile activities like commerce, computing, and gaming, opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit these platforms have also risen.

Phishing attacks involve prompting users, through seemingly legitimate pages, to input their login credentials such as banking details or PayPal information. Such attacks are not advanced hacks that programmatically filter through your data or incapacitate your device, but rather, they rely on a user's lack of caution and naivety. Considering the current situation of mobile applications, these same cybercriminal tactics used in traditional computers - like Facebook scams or spam emails - can be employed to steal your personal information.

She got the paper card rather than the plastic card for her mother, because the one made of the","completion":"paper carried a more organic, personal, and environmentally-friendly touch, which resonated strongly with her mother's values and preferences. Her mother had always emphasized the importance of reducing waste and being conscious of the choices we make when it comes to materials. She believed that the excessive use of plastic was one of the leading causes of pollution and environmental degradation. Therefore, she encouraged her family members and friends to make sustainable and eco-conscious decisions in their day-to-day lives. This deeply ingrained value system in her mother played a significant role in guiding her decision while choosing the perfect card. The paper card also offered a unique, handmade aesthetic that appealed greatly to her mother's artistic sensibilities. The charm of this one-of-a-kind card, adorned with intricate designs and lovingly crafted details, was something that a mass-produced plastic card simply could not replicate. The time, effort, and thought that went into creating the paper card reflected the extent of the daughter's love and care for her mother. Additionally, the paper card was symbolic of the broader social, economic, and environmental movements that her mother passionately championed. With an increasing awareness of how plastic is overwhelming our landfills and oceans, endangering marine life and ecosystems, her mother was an advocate for change. She believed that every action counts, and she was proud to see her daughter making a conscious decision in favor of sustainability. Aesthetically, the texture and warmth of the paper card provided a tactile experience that a plastic card simply could not offer. The feel of the paper between her mother's fingers, the scent of authentic and natural materials, and the faint rustling sound of the paper as it was unfolded all contributed to an immersive and intimate emotional experience that went far beyond the physical aspect of the card. Furthermore, the paper card served as a testament to the strong bond and shared values between the mother and her daughter, bringing the two of them even closer together. By taking her mother's ideals to heart, the daughter demonstrated great respect and understanding for her mother's values, nurturing a deep emotional connection that transcended the simple gesture of gifting a card. In summary, the choice to opt for the paper card over the plastic card was a thoughtful, meaningful, and environmentally responsible decision that reflected the daughter's love, respect, and appreciation for her mother's values and beliefs. The card symbolized and strengthened their bond, while also serving as a tangible representation of their shared commitment to creating a more sustainable and nurturing world for future generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The scientists are then shown working on the electronic surveillance installation and encountering problems with rats chewing the insulation on their power cables. Some 'false' readings are seen before the system fails. The antagonists are introduced at this point and the scientists and their colonels are depicted meeting various untimely and gruesome ends.Next the film cuts to an apparent military operation in Kandahar, Afghanistan in which the troops are depicted as not being cohesive as a group and show individual weaknesses. The operation ends when a 'civilian' woman approaches the group and reveals multiple grenades under her garment, at this point the operation is revealed to be a training exercise for rookie troops on US soil. The sergeant lambastes the troops for their failure then tells them they are going on a mission to bring supplies to scientists working on a surveillance system in a top secret area. By this time many of the troops have their individual characters established, namely that Napoleon is actually anti-war and that Crank is particularly gung-ho and violent.On arriving at the secret base there is no sign of the scientists.

What is the title of this article: The independence of the Thirteen Colonies in North America in 1783 after the American War of Independence caused Britain to lose some of its oldest and most populous colonies. British attention soon turned towards Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. After the defeat of France in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1792–1815), Britain emerged as the principal naval and imperial power of the 19th century (with London the largest city in the world from about 1830). Unchallenged at sea, British dominance was later described as Pax Britannica (\\"British Peace\\"), a period of relative peace in Europe and the world (1815–1914) during which the British Empire became the global hegemon and adopted the role of global policeman. In the early 19th century, the Industrial Revolution began to transform Britain; by the time of the Great Exhibition in 1851 the country was described as the \\"workshop of the world\\". The British Empire expanded to include India, large parts of Africa and many other territories throughout the world. Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, British dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many regions, such as Asia and Latin America. Domestically, political attitudes favoured free trade and laissez-faire policies and a gradual widening of the voting franchise. During this century, the population increased at a dramatic rate, accompanied by rapid urbanisation, causing significant social and economic stresses. To seek new markets and sources of raw materials, the Conservative Party under Disraeli launched a period of imperialist expansion in Egypt, South Africa, and elsewhere. Canada, Australia, and New Zealand became self-governing dominions.","completion":"Title: \\"From Colonial Loss to Global Hegemony: The Rise of the British Empire in the 19th Century and the Pax Britannica Era\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sangre de Grado, or Croton lechleri, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to northwestern South America. The name \\"dragon's blood\\" is attributed to the thick red latex extracted from the tree's bark. The latex is famously known for its medicinal properties, widely utilized in traditional medicine as well as modern pharmaceutical products. The primary uses and benefits of Sangre de Grado include: 1. Wound healing: The red latex has been used in traditional medicine to treat wounds, cuts, and skin injuries due to its soothing and anti-inflammatory properties. 2. Gastrointestinal health: Sangre de Grado is believed to help treat gastrointestinal problems, such as diarrhea and ulcers, by promoting gut health and regulating bowel movements. 3. Antimicrobial and antiviral properties: The latex contains components that exhibit antimicrobial and antiviral properties, which are potentially helpful in combating infections. 4. Antioxidant properties: Sangre de Grado is known to have antioxidant effects, which can help protect the body from oxidative stress and damage caused by free radicals. While these medicinal properties can be beneficial, it is essential to consider the context and intention of the gift when deciding if Sangre de Grado would be appropriate for Valentine's Day. Valentine's Day is traditionally celebrated as a day to express love and affection between romantic partners, often through the exchange of gifts such as flowers, chocolates, or other sentimental tokens. Given that Sangre de Grado is a medicinal plant primarily used for its healing properties, it might not be perceived as a romantic or symbolic gift in most cultures. The association with red latex or \\"dragon's blood\\" may also not convey the message of love and affection that is typically expected on Valentine's Day. In conclusion, although Sangre de Grado is a fascinating and beneficial plant, it may not be the most suitable or traditional gift for a partner on Valentine's Day. It is advisable to consider the cultural context and personal preferences of the recipient before choosing a gift that truly represents the celebratory nature of the occasion and the emotions of love and affection."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Combine them by subtracting 1776*z from 1342*z. 1342*z - 1776*z = -434*z Now, the equation is 7540 = -434*z - 2442. Step 2: Isolate the z term. To isolate the z term, we'll first need to move the constant (-2442) to the other side of the equation. We do this by adding 2442 to both sides. 7540 + 2442 = -434*z 9982 = -434*z Step 3: Solve for z.

A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the Reserve that was renamed the Cascade National Forest in 1907?, using the article: The Three Sisters area was occupied by Amerindians since the end of the last glaciation, mainly the Northern Paiute to the east and Molala to the west. They harvested berries, made baskets, hunted, and made obsidian arrowheads and spears. Traces of rock art can be seen at Devils Hill, south of South Sister. The first Westerner to discover the Three Sisters was the explorer Peter Skene Ogden of the Hudson Bay Company in 1825. He describes \\"a number of high mountains\\" south of Mount Hood. Ten months later in 1826, the botanist David Douglas reported snow-covered peaks visible from the Willamette Valley. As the Willamette Valley was gradually colonized in the 1840s, Euro-Americans approached the summits from the west and probably named them individually at that time. Explorers, such as Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth in 1839 and John Frémont in 1843, used the Three Sisters as a landmark from the east. The area was further explored by John Strong Newberry in 1855 as part of the Pacific Railroad Surveys.In 1862, to connect the Willamette Valley to the ranches of Central Oregon and the gold mines of eastern Oregon and Idaho, Felix and Marion Scott traced a route over Scott Pass. This route was known as the Scott Trail, but was superseded in the early 20th century by the McKenzie Pass Road further north. Around 1866, there were reports that one of the Three Sisters emitted some fire and smoke.In the late 19th century, there was extensive wool production in eastern Oregon. Shepherds led their herds of 1,500 to 2,500 sheep to the Three Sisters. They arrived in eastern foothills near Whychus Creek by May or June, and then climbed to higher pastures in August and September. By the 1890s, the area was getting overgrazed. Despite regulatory measures, sheep grazing peaked in 1910 before being banned in the 1930s at North and Middle Sister, and in 1940 at South Sister.In 1892, President Grover Cleveland decided to create the Cascades Forest Reserve, based on the authority of the Forest Reserve Act of 1891.

Q:Process: - Open the Dishwasher - Slide out the bottom rack - Take a dirty plate - Rinse the plate - Place the dish in the rack - Repeat leaving enough space for water to reach all items - Fill the soap cup - Turn on the dishwasher. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a clog in pipe happens, how will it affect HELPING the dishwasher to clean better. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis being considered in this scenario is the occurrence of a clog in the dishwasher's pipe. When a clog occurs in a dishwasher's pipe, it can lead to a variety of possible outcomes, some of which may have direct or indirect effects on the overall performance of the dishwasher. In this detailed answer, I will explore the various ways in which this perturbation might affect the dishwasher's cleaning process, as well as evaluate whether the proposed clog could potentially contribute to any improvement in cleaning efficiency. 1. Impeded water supply: A clog in the dishwasher's pipe could lead to an obstruction in the flow of water, resulting in poor water supply to the dishwasher's system. This can directly impact the overall effectiveness of the cleaning process, as the dishwasher will not have access to a proper, steady flow of water required to clean the dishes. In this case, the perturbation would have a negative effect on the cleaning process. 2. Reduced water pressure: Another possible direct consequence of a clog in the pipe is reduced water pressure in the dishwasher. This can lead to a less efficient spray of water during the cleaning cycle, hampering the ability to remove food particles and residue from the dishes. Decreased water pressure will not help improve the dishwasher's cleaning effectiveness and would, therefore, have a negative effect on the cleaning process. 3. Overflowing and residue buildup: An indirect impact of a clog in the dishwasher pipe can be the inability to drain water effectively, leading to water pooling within the dishwasher and possibly causing residue or food particles to accumulate on the dishes. This would further compromise the cleaning process, rendering the dishwasher less effective. 4. Potential damage to the dishwasher: A clog in the dishwasher's pipe can cause wear and tear on the appliance's internal components by forcing the device to work harder to pump water through the obstructed pipe. This strain on your dishwasher can indirectly affect its cleaning effectiveness, as damaged or deteriorated components may lead to reduced performance. In conclusion, while the perturbation hypothesis proposes the possibility of a clog in the dishwasher pipe, there is no convincing evidence to suggest that this occurrence would help improve the dishwasher's ability to clean dishes better. On the contrary, both direct and indirect effects of a clog tend to degrade the dishwasher's overall performance, reducing its cleaning efficiency rather than enhancing it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. John Holmes is so famous, he's infamous (as the Three Amigos would say). This is a Rashomon-like story about the events surrounding the Wonderland Murders of the early 1980's, in Los Angeles. The story is pieced together from the retelling of a few of the participants. There is story from the friend's perspective, namely David Lind (played by Dylan McDermott). He is a participant in the robbery assault at Eddie Nash's place (Eddie Nash is a infamous drug dealer - and is the suppose to be the same character Alfred Molina played in Boogie Nights) and is heavily into the drug scene. There is John Holmes' perspective (played by Val Kilmer), which makes him out to be a pawn stuck between two kings (with a severe case of cocaine cravings). There is also the patchwork recollections of John's wife (Sharon - played by Lisa Kudrow) and his girlfriend (Dawn - played by Kate Bosworth) that fill in the spaces between the two stories. It is basically the same time frame that we are looking at, just each character's version. The only thing that is missing is the perspective from the dead people. Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights portrays John Holmes as a slightly heroic character, with a tragic yet comedic karma. He is a caricature of a real person. He was more of less, a mixed up kid that got what he got through his \\"large\\" endowment. Director James Cox turns the comedy off and makes this episode in John's life into a nightmare for all of us watching. The details of the real life murders make this movie even more eerie. Val Kilmer took what he learned of Jim Morrison, from the Doors, enhanced the performance for the Salton Sea, and then further enhanced that to bring us the deterioration of John Holmes through cocaine. All of the actors pull off very realistic looking portrayal's of cocaine junkies. Josh Lucas' performance stands out as one of the best in the movie. He plays Ron Launius (I think this character is suppose to be the same as the Thomas Jane character from Boogie Nights). Ron was the leader of the gang, loved having John Holmes around as a novelty and had a cocaine craving like sharks enjoy blood. The cocaine use seems so realistic as to make one think. Did they really use Splenda ?? Where Boogie Nights has a bubblegum pop feel to it (lots of color and 70's nostalgia), Wonderland is dark. The action is fast and furious, with a lot of jumps. It is twitchy and grainy. There is no comedy, just a never ending pace, as if the director is trying to put us into the nervous, fast paced, edgy cocaine high to make us feel what the characters are feeling. This is a graphic movie. It has one of the most intensely violent scenes I have ever seen in a movie. It actually shows the murders themselves (through the eyes of John Holmes at first and then from a third person perspective). It is so graphic, it looks like police evidence of a crime. I had to pause after this scene and remind myself this was just a movie. This movie is definitely not recommended for everyone. I recommend it as a good alternative to Boogie Nights, for those interested in the other sides of John Holmes. -Celluloid Rehab Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie (see options below)?

Wanderer shares with Seeker that Melanie was traveling with her brother, Jamie, and her boyfriend, Jared Howe, to find Melanie's uncle Jeb in the desert. Wanderer admits that Melanie is still present, so Seeker decides to be transferred into Melanie's body to get the information herself. With the help of Melanie, Wanderer escapes and makes her way to the desert, where she is found by Jeb, who takes her to a series of caves hidden inside a mountain where the humans (including Jared and Jamie) are hiding. Wanderer's presence is met with hostility by all but Jeb and Jamie. Melanie instructs Wanderer not to tell anyone she is still alive, since it would provoke them, though she later allows her to tell Jamie.

Background: Enrique Martin Morales (born December 24, 1971), commonly known as Ricky Martin, is a Puerto Rican singer, actor and author. Martin began his career at age 12 with the all-boy pop group Menudo. After five years with the group, he released several Spanish-language solo albums throughout the 1990s. He also acted on stage and on TV in Mexico, where he achieved modest stardom. Context: After receiving commercial success throughout Asia, Europe, and Latin America, Martin prepared his first English album in 1999 in an attempt to cross over to the United States market. The self-titled album, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and sold 661,000 copies in its first week of release, became the most successful album debut on the Billboard charts by a Hispanic artist. It contained material by writers and producers such as Desmond Child, Diane Warren, William Orbit, George Noriega and his longtime childhood friend Draco Rosa. The album also featured special guests: Madonna on the Spanish-English duet \\"Be Careful (Cuidado con mi Corazon)\\" and Meja on \\"Private Emotion\\". Two weeks after the album's release, Martin was featured on the cover of Time with the title \\"Latin Music Goes Pop!\\". Before the album's release, Janet Jackson collaborated with Ricky Martin for the Latin American version of \\"Ask for More\\", a promotional single and commercial released as part of an advertising campaign for soft drink company Pepsi. The first and most prominent single was \\"Livin' la Vida Loca\\", which reached number one in many countries around the world, including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand. \\"Livin' la Vida Loca\\" is Ricky Martin's biggest hit. The video for \\"Livin 'La Vida Loca\\" was directed by Wayne Isham and starring model Nina Moric. It was followed by \\"She's All I Ever Had\\" which peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. Both tracks peaked at number one on the Hot Latin Songs. \\"Livin' la Vida Loca\\" is generally seen as the song that began the Latin pop explosion of 1999 and made the transition of other Latin artists (first Jennifer Lopez and Enrique Iglesias, then later Shakira) into the English-speaking market easier. Ricky Martin became one of the top-selling albums of 1999, and was certified 7x platinum in the United States, selling over 22 million copies worldwide. In October 1999, Martin embarked on a very successful year-long Livin' la Vida Loca Tour. After this success, a new English-language album, Sound Loaded, was released in November 2000. It debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 and was certified 2x platinum by the RIAA. \\"She Bangs\\" and \\"Nobody Wants to Be Lonely\\" (duet with Christina Aguilera) peaked at number twelve and thirteen on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively. Both singles reached number one on the Hot Latin Songs. Sound Loaded has sold over 8 million copies worldwide. In February 2001, Martin released a Spanish greatest hits album entitled La Historia, which went to number one for five weeks on the Billboard Top Latin Albums and debuted at number eighty-three on the Billboard 200. It also topped the chart in Sweden for three weeks. The album contained reworkings of two of his early songs \\"Fuego Contra Fuego\\" and \\"El Amor de Mi Vida\\". In November 2001, an English-language greatest hits album, The Best of Ricky Martin was released outside North America. It contained two new remixes of \\"Amor\\".

Damon is not shown; instead, Etty illustrates the scene from Damon's viewpoint. By placing the audience in Damon's position, Etty aimed to induce the same reactions in the viewer as Damon's dilemma as described by Thomson; that of whether to enjoy the spectacle despite knowing it to be inappropriate, or to follow the accepted morality of the time and look away, in what art historian Sarah Burnage has described as \\"a titillating moral test for spectators to both enjoy and overcome\\".The pose of Musidora is based on that of the Aphrodite of Cnidus and the Venus de' Medici. It is possible that Etty was also familiar with Thomas Gainsborough's Musidora, which shares similar elements. Gainsborough's Musidora, his only large nude, was never exhibited in his lifetime and remained in private hands until 1847, but Etty was familiar with its then-owner Robert Vernon and may have seen it in his collection. The setting for the painting is a pool in the grounds of The Plantation, a house in the village of Acomb, near York. The Plantation was the home of his close friend and patron the Reverend Isaac Spencer, vicar of Acomb, and its grounds were a scene Etty had previously painted. In 1846 Etty bought a house in York for his retirement; Burnage speculates that Etty chose Acomb on the grounds that a view of York was quintessentially English.Although Etty had traditionally worked in the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, and closer to the style of Titian. This is likely owing to the nature of the subject matter.

To illustrate her longevity another way, the Berlin Wall was still standing when the diminutive Japanese made her Wimbledon debut in June 1989. Her opponent on the day was another player reminiscent of another era -- Zina Garrison -- with the American beating the then 19-year-old in straight sets in an inauspicious start for the youngster.

Howland talked but little on their way back to camp. The scene that he had just witnessed affected him strangely; it stirred once more within him all of his old ambition, all of his old enthusiasm, and yet neither found voice in words. He was glad when the dinner was over at Thorne's, and with the going of the mail sledge and the senior engineer there came over him a still deeper sense of joy. Now _he_ was in charge, it was _his_ road from that hour on. He crushed MacDonald's hand in a grip that meant more than words when they parted. In his own cabin he threw off his coat and hat, lighted his pipe, and tried to realize just what this all meant for him. He was in charge--in charge of the greatest railroad building job on earth--_he_, Jack Howland, who less than twenty years ago was a barefooted, half-starved urchin peddling papers in the streets where he was now famous! And now what was this black thing that had come up to threaten his chances just as he had about won his great fight? He clenched his hands as he thought again of what had already happened--the cowardly attempt on his life, the warnings, and his blood boiled to fever heat.

Don is getting screened for cancer. Because his cancer is caught early, at the first screening, the chance of a cure is greater or lesser? Answer:","completion":"The chance of a cure for Don is greater because his cancer is caught early, at the first screening. Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. There are various types of cancers, such as breast, lung, prostate, and colon cancer, amongst others, and each has its unique characteristics. Early detection and treatment are critical in improving the chances of a successful outcome and, in many cases, a complete cure. When cancer is detected early, it is often confined to a small area, making it easier to remove surgically or treat with radiation or chemotherapy. Additionally, the cancer may not have had the chance to spread to other parts of the body, reducing the complexity of the treatments and the likelihood of recurrence. Early-stage cancer is usually less aggressive than advanced-stage cancer, meaning it may respond better to treatments aimed at destroying the cancer cells and stopping their proliferation. In Don's case, since his cancer was detected at the first screening, it indicates that the cancer is in its early stages. Therefore, his chance of a complete cure is significantly greater compared to if the cancer had been discovered at a later stage. Early detection allows for a more targeted and effective treatment plan, increasing the probability of eliminating the cancer entirely. Furthermore, catching cancer early also affords Don the opportunity to explore various treatment options. Medical professionals can personalize and tailor treatment plans based on the specific type of cancer, its location, and stage. This customized approach ensures that Don receives the most appropriate and advantageous treatments for his unique situation, further increasing the likelihood of a cure. In summary, the sooner cancer is treated, the greater the chances of a cure, as is demonstrated in Don's case. Early detection, such as identifying cancer during the first screening, significantly improves the odds of successful treatment and a complete cure. It allows for targeted therapies, personalized treatment plans, and a more favorable prognosis for the patient."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Would \\"A plot of a normal distribution (or bell-shaped curve) where each band has a width of 1 standard deviation – See also: 68-95-99.7 rule\\" be a reasonable answer? Select from the following. 1). No 2). Yes Answer:","completion":"1). No Standard deviation in statistics is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion within a dataset. While the statement you provided touches upon the concept, it does not fully explain or define standard deviation. A more comprehensive answer is needed. Standard deviation is a valuable tool in statistics because it gives a quantifiable measure of how spread out the values in a data set are. The larger the standard deviation, the more spread out the data is; conversely, the smaller the standard deviation, the more closely clustered the data is around the mean. In the context of a normal distribution (a bell-shaped curve characterized by symmetry and the mean, median, and mode being equal), the standard deviation is used to quantify how much of the data falls within a certain range around the mean. The 68-95-99.7 rule, also known as the empirical rule, states that within a normal distribution: - Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation (±1σ) of the mean. - Approximately 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations (±2σ) of the mean. - Approximately 99.7% of the data falls within three standard deviations (±3σ) of the mean. Although the statement you provided mentions the normal distribution and the empirical rule, it does not give a clear definition of the standard deviation. A better answer would be: \\"Standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion within a dataset. It is used to quantify the spread of the values in the dataset with respect to the mean. In the context of a normal distribution (a bell-shaped curve), standard deviation helps us understand how much of the data falls within a certain range around the mean, as explained by the empirical rule (68-95-99.7 rule).\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This musical is based on James A. Michener's Pulitzer Prize-winning book, \\"Tales of the South Pacific,\\" which is a collection of short stories based on the author's experiences during World War II. The song appears in Act II of the musical and is sung by the character Lieutenant Cable, a young and educated Marine officer who is grappling with his feelings for Liat, a young Tonkinese woman. Written in the form of a poignant ballad, \\"You've Got to Be Carefully Taught\\" serves as a critique of racist attitudes ingrained in people from a young age and the societal impact that comes from these prejudiced notions. The lyrics of the song are as follows: \\"You've got to be taught To hate and fear, You've got to be taught From year to year, It's got to be drummed In your dear little ear You've got to be carefully taught. You've got to be taught to be afraid Of people whose eyes are oddly made, And people whose skin is a diff'rent shade, You've got to be carefully taught. You've got to be taught before it's too late, Before you are six or seven or eight, To hate all the people your relatives hate, You've got to be carefully taught!\\" In the context of \\"South Pacific,\\" the song not only addresses the issue of racial prejudice within the character of Lt. Cable, but also touches on a broader theme of racism during World War II. Furthermore, it highlights the internal struggle that Lt. Cable faces, as he is torn between his love for Liat and societal expectations. \\"You've Got to Be Carefully Taught\\" received mixed reactions upon its debut. The song's powerful message against racism was considered controversial for its time, and several members of the U.S. Congress even criticized the song for promoting communist ideals. Nevertheless, both Rodgers and Hammerstein refused to remove the song from the show, and it has since become one of the most significant songs in the history of American theater. The song has been covered by various artists and remains relevant today as a powerful reminder about the dangers of racism and prejudice. It challenges listeners to confront their own biases and encourages them to contemplate the importance of education and upbringing in shaping one's perspective on race and diversity. Through its enduring message and timeless melody, \\"You've Got to Be Carefully Taught\\" serves as an essential piece of musical history, continuing to resonate with audiences around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Read this and answer the question Several solid dielectrics are available, including paper, plastic, glass, mica and ceramic materials. Paper was used extensively in older devices and offers relatively high voltage performance. However, it is susceptible to water absorption, and has been largely replaced by plastic film capacitors. Plastics offer better stability and ageing performance, which makes them useful in timer circuits, although they may be limited to low operating temperatures and frequencies. Ceramic capacitors are generally small, cheap and useful for high frequency applications, although their capacitance varies strongly with voltage and they age poorly. They are broadly categorized as class 1 dielectrics, which have predictable variation of capacitance with temperature or class 2 dielectrics, which can operate at higher voltage. Glass and mica capacitors are extremely reliable, stable and tolerant to high temperatures and voltages, but are too expensive for most mainstream applications. Electrolytic capacitors and supercapacitors are used to store small and larger amounts of energy, respectively, ceramic capacitors are often used in resonators, and parasitic capacitance occurs in circuits wherever the simple conductor-insulator-conductor structure is formed unintentionally by the configuration of the circuit layout. What is another type of reliable capacitor that is resistant to temperature and voltage changes?","completion":"Another type of reliable capacitor that is resistant to temperature and voltage changes is a glass or mica capacitor.

Answer this question: mexico earthquake how long did it last 2017??","completion":"The 2017 Mexico earthquake, also known as the Puebla earthquake, struck on September 19, 2017, at approximately 1:14 pm local time (18:14 UTC). It had a magnitude of 7.1 on the moment magnitude scale and was centered near the town of Raboso, in the state of Puebla, about 120 km (75 miles) southeast of Mexico City. The earthquake's shaking itself lasted for approximately 20 seconds. However, the impacts of the earthquake were felt for a much longer time. The event resulted in the loss of 369 lives, injured thousands, and caused widespread structural damage throughout Central Mexico. The states of Puebla, Morelos, and Mexico were the most severely impacted, along with Mexico City. Rescue and recovery efforts were carried out by emergency services, volunteers, and international support teams for several weeks after the earthquake. Search and rescue operations continued until September 28, when the last person was pulled out from the rubble of a collapsed building. In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, people throughout Mexico and around the world came together to respond to the disaster. Aid efforts were coordinated by the Mexican government, international aid organizations, and local residents who came together to assist their fellow citizens. The earthquake prompted the Mexican people to unite and demonstrate a tremendous amount of resilience and solidarity. The 2017 Mexico earthquake occurred on the 32nd anniversary of the devastating 1985 Mexico City earthquake, which killed around 10,000 people and injured more than 30,000. The coincidence of these events led to an increased awareness of the importance of earthquake preparedness and the need for effective building codes and regulations in the country. In the years following the 2017 Mexico earthquake, the Mexican government and various non-governmental organizations have continued to work towards disaster risk reduction, strengthening building regulations, and improving emergency response capabilities. The long-lasting impacts of the earthquake have served as a reminder of the importance of investing in disaster preparedness and response initiatives, not just in Mexico but around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A one-armed criminal, a Boglodite named Boris the Animal, stages a jailbreak (along the way killing Obadiah Price, a fellow inmate he'd made a deal with). His intention is to rewrite history, with Agent K, the one who arrested and imprisoned him, being a major factor in his plan...On Earth, Agent K and his partner Agent J cover up an arrival of an alien spacecraft, and hear of the prison break. At a Chinese restaurant thats a local haunt for aliens, Agent K discovers Boris (who had previously gone to see Obadiah's son Jeffrey) and the two fight, with J joining in. K is upset that the alien he should have killed is out loose again; he deems it his own affair and forbids J to help him, suspending him. A puzzled J checks up on Boris: he appeared in 1969 to stop the prevention of the ArcNet Shield, a device that K deployed to protect the world from harm (but which killed off the Boglodites, as they can only survive by feeding off worlds). He managed to kill on 15 July 1969 an alien named Roman the Fabulous and on the following day... at this point O cuts him off and tells him not to investigate any further.

Given the fact \\"An example of seed dispersal is animals eating seeds\\", what is the answer to the question or completion \\"When a bear eats berries he will be contributing to what process?\\" OPTIONS: -food for young; -hunters; -seed propagation; -hunger;","completion":"When a bear eats berries, he will be contributing to the process of seed propagation. Seed propagation refers to the various methods by which plants spread and reproduce through the germination of their seeds. In this case, the bear consumes berries that contain seeds, which are then dispersed after being ingested and eventually excreted by the bear. This process of seed dispersal is important for many reasons. First, it allows for genetic diversity within populations of plants. As seeds are carried away from their parent plant and dispersed throughout the environment, they have a better chance of growing amongst other plants with different genetic attributes. This genetic mixing reduces the likelihood of inbreeding within a plant population, making it more robust and better able to withstand various environmental challenges. Second, seed dispersal helps plants to colonize new areas. Many plants, especially those found in harsh or isolated environments, rely on animals to help spread their seeds over long distances. By foraging on berries and other fruit-bearing plants, bears and similar creatures help these plants expand their range and establish themselves in new habitats. Third, this process aids in plant survival by giving seeds a better chance of finding suitable environments in which to grow. When a seed is excreted by a bear, it is often deposited along with nutrients from the animal's waste, providing a small but valuable boost of nutrients to help the seedling establish itself. This also moves the seeds away from their parent plant, reducing competition for limited resources such as light, water, and nutrients. In summary, when a bear eats berries, it contributes to the process of seed propagation. This process is essential for many reasons, including promoting genetic diversity within plant populations, aiding in plant colonization of new areas, and increasing the chances of seedling survival and establishment. This complex interplay between plants and animals showcases the remarkable interconnectedness of life on Earth and highlights the importance of preserving both plant and animal species to maintain a healthy, balanced ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
