Context: I was introduced to the amazing range of handmade products from Okoii back in July and intended to post reviews in early September; however, was struck down with a particularly potent uterine parasite that left me comatosed on the couch each evening by about 8.00pm, so blogging had to take a massive back step. Now that my energy levels are returning I though that it is about time I told you about these amazing products! Okoii products are handmade by Yoko, formally from Japan, now living in Australia. Her aim was to introduce Australian women to traditional natural ingredients from Japan and Asia that they may not previously have been aware of. Some of these ingredients have been used in Japan for upwards of 1000 years, and recently the benefits of such ingredients have been scientifically proven. When you place an order with Okoii, your products are then made by hand, one by one, so you know that they are as fresh as they can possibly be. Other than Lush' Fresh Face Masks, I can't think of any other product that would be as fresh as Okoii. I find it quite exciting to know that when I purchase a product from Okoii, that it hasn't been sitting on the shelf of a warehouse for months, slowly deteriorating. It is recommended that the products be kept in the fridge to maintain their freshness and the all come with a recommended used by date that is between 3-6 months from when it was made. The first product that I am going to introduce you to is the Luxury Rice Bran Face Soap. I decided to review this one on its own for two reasons. Firstly, it was my absolute favourite of all the Okoii products I tried; and secondly, it was actually the product that I was most fearful of trying. Why? Well, the first beauty rule that is drummed into every girls head is to NEVER USE SOAP ON YOUR FACE and I was being forced to break this rule (I am a first born goodie goodie who NEVER breaks the rules - this was tough for me to do!).

Article: In a certain store where they sell puddings, a number of these delicious things are laid out in a row during the Christmas season. Here you may select the one which is most to your taste, and you are even allowed to sample them before coming to a decision. I have often wondered whether some people, who had no intention of making a purchase, would take advantage of this privilege. One day I asked this question of the shop girl, and I learned it was indeed the case. \\"Now there's one old gentleman, for instance,\\" she told me, \\"he comes here almost every week and samples each one of the puddings, though he never buys anything, and I suspect he never will. I remember him from last year and the year before that, too. Well, let him come if he wants it, and welcome to it. And what's more, I hope there are a lot more stores where he can go and get his share. He looks as if he needed it all right, and I suppose they can afford it.\\" She was still speaking when an elderly gentleman limped up to the counter and began looking closely at the row of puddings with great interest. \\"Why, that's the very gentleman I've been telling you about,\\" whispered the shop girl. \\"Just watch him now.\\" And then turning to him: \\"Would you like to sample them, sir? Here's a spoon for you to use. \\"The elderly gentleman, who was poorly but neatly dressed, accepted the spoon and began eagerly to sample one after another of the puddings, only breaking off occasionally to wipe his red eyes with a large torn handkerchief. \\"This is quite good\\". \\"This is not bad either, but a little too heavy\\". All the time it was quite evident that he sincerely believed that he might eventually buy one of these puddings, and I am positive that he did not for a moment feel that he was in any way cheating the store.

Write highlights for this article: By. Daily Mail Reporter. Danger: A study found pregnant women who take antibiotics could be tampering with their child's immune system. Pregnant women who take antibiotics could be putting their unborn children at risk of disease. Researchers have found that drugs used to beat infections can interfere with a baby’s immune system. By contrast mothers can help to kick-start a child’s ability to avoid illness by passing on certain germs. A study by the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in the US showed that bacteria in the gut play a crucial role in fostering the rapid production of infection-fighting white blood cells. They found that, as with humans, mice have a surge of white blood cells around birth, but this response is reduced when their mothers are exposed to antibiotics. This left the creatures much more vulnerable to deadly E. coli infections, especially when they were born prematurely. The researchers showed that signalling mechanisms within the gut’s vast colony of micro-organisms regulate the production of white blood cells in baby mice. Exposing both the mothers and babies to antibiotics reduced the diversity of gut bacteria, many of which are beneficial, and also impaired resistance to infection in the newborn. Critically ill babies are often treated with antibiotics as a precaution, without proof of infection. The study appeared in the journal Nature Medicine. Hitesh Deshmukh, first author of the study, said: 'At birth, newborns move from a largely sterile environment to one full of microorganisms. 'Animals and humans adapt to this new situation by ramping up the production of granulocytes within the first days of life.' Doctors advised unborn babies benefit from bacteria which builds up their strength, rather than medication. A similar procedure in humans, called a fecal transplant, has recently been successful in treating severe bacterial infection in adults. However, such transplants have not been performed in newborns, and the scientists warn that a lot more research is needed before they can determine what implications these animal results may have in guiding human treatment. Despite the findings, babies will continue to be treated with antibiotics as it is very difficult to determine whether newborns are infected with bacteria. But the research urged clinicians to strive to decrease antibiotic use as a long-term goal.","completion":"This article says that taking antibiotics while pregnant may risk a baby's health. Researchers found that antibiotics can interfere with a baby's immune system. Instead, when moms share some germs, it helps babies avoid getting sick.

When moms have antibiotics, it makes it harder for the baby to fight against bad germs, like E. coli. Doctors say it's better for babies to build up strength from good bacteria instead of taking medicines. While more research is needed, the study suggests that using fewer antibiotics might be a good goal for the long-term."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If you don't understand the culture, you will get some problems with them. Asian people are different from any other cultures if you think you know them, you might want to think again. How are they different? When it comes to most Asian culture, respect is everything. You can do anything you want but don't disrespect an Asian man. You will get some real consequences afterward and especially if he is your boss. It's something called \\" _ \\" in the Asian culture. It's ridiculous sometimes but it's their culture. Sometimes their culture can come in between their relationship at work. Asian people might expect a lot of respect from their co-workers when their co-workers just see them as an equal. Americans are very different from Asian people. If you're Asian, you might want to understand the American culture and even adapt to their culture if you work with them. It will be easier for you since you're in their countries. Imagine an American working in China, expecting Chinese co-workers to get along with him when he criticizes them straight out on every single matter in front of everyone. I think they will take him outside and take care of him. It just doesn't work that way with Asian people. If you're an American boss giving your Asian employee a review, you will see that they will have a problem with your negative remarks. They will think that you don't like them, disrespectful, and want to get rid of them; when in fact, you're just doing your job. Of course, it's not fair for you as an American boss but just expect that it can be something that is on your Asian employee's mind. The Americans can't get along well with the Asians probably because _ . A) their cultures are different B) they don't like each other C) both of them are too proud D) they have different political views Answer:","completion":"The primary reason that Americans and Asians may find it difficult to get along with each other is A) their cultures are different. Cultural differences can create misunderstandings, misinterpretations, and challenges in communication between individuals from different backgrounds. When working together, people from different cultures often have expectations of how relationships are built, how decisions are made, and how problems are solved, which can lead to confusion and conflict if not managed effectively. One significant difference between Asian and American cultures is their approach to communication. Many Asian cultures adhere to a high-context communication style, where meaning is conveyed through non-verbal cues, tone of voice, and context. This contrasts with the low-context communication style often found in Western cultures like the United States, where direct speech and explicit information are expected and appreciated. Another cultural difference is related to the concept of face, referred to as \\"mianzi\\" in Chinese culture and \\"cheon\\" (천) in Korean culture among others. This concept plays a vital role in building and maintaining interpersonal relations and social status in many Asian societies. Saving face is critical in these cultures, and any perceived disrespect may lead to loss of face and damaged relationships. In contrast, American culture values more direct and open communication, often leading to misunderstanding or unintentional disrespect when communicating with someone from an Asian background. Moreover, the American emphasis on individualism may conflict with the collectivism that is deeply rooted in many Asian cultures. In collectivist societies, the needs and interests of the family or group are prioritized over that of the individual. This difference in values may cause rifts between coworkers or supervisors, as Asian employees might prioritize harmony and group cohesion, while Americans may place importance on personal achievement and self-expression. In conclusion, both Americans and Asians need to make an effort to understand and respect each other's cultural backgrounds to establish successful and harmonious working relationships. Appropriately communicating and adjusting behaviors can aid in overcoming cultural barriers. It is important to recognize that while cultural differences can be challenging, they also provide an opportunity for individuals to learn, grow, and develop stronger connections with others from diverse backgrounds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize this article: KABUL—U.S. and Afghan officials on Tuesday said they were getting closer to a deal for U.S. troops to stay in Afghanistan, but they differed over whether the U.S. had committed to a letter from President Barack Obama acknowledging mistakes made by the U.S. in the war. President Hamid Karzai requested that Mr. Obama write the letter in exchange for softening his opposition to letting American forces raid Afghan homes after the coalition's mandate expires in December 2014, said his spokesman, Aimal Faizi. If made, this American gesture would be reciprocated by Kabul's agreement to permit these raids in circumstances when American lives are at risk, he said. Enlarge Image Afghan policemen check a vehicle in Kabul on Tuesday, two days before a meeting to weigh a security deal. European Pressphoto Agency More Lull in Taliban Action Not Expected In Washington, White House and State Department officials wouldn't confirm whether Mr. Obama would send such a letter. White House press secretary Jay Carney said he wouldn't comment on a \\"letter that hasn't been written.\\" Mr. Faizi said the compromise decision was made in a phone call between Messrs. Karzai and Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday. Mr. Kerry initially offered to write the letter himself, but Mr. Karzai insisted it must come from Mr. Obama, Mr. Faizi said. The developments came just ahead of Thursday's inauguration of the Loya Jirga, a traditional assembly that would consider the so-called bilateral security agreement between the two countries. A senior State Department official said Mr. Karzai requested the \\"reassurances, including the option of a letter from the administration.\\" The official said there was no agreement on a letter yet but that one that states the government's position was under discussion. U.S. officials said they believe that conflicting accounts of the call reflect last-minute political posturing by Mr. Karzai ahead of the Loya Jirga. In the call with Mr. Karzai, Mr. Kerry didn't specify any intention to issue a letter in which the U.S. would apologize for American conduct in the war, U.S. officials said. But the officials said they could envisage issuing a letter in which the U.S. expresses \\"regret\\" for civilian casualties in past military operations, in line with previous U.S. statements. In the U.S., Republican lawmakers have criticized Mr. Obama for what they see as a willingness to apologize for American military action abroad, and any letter to Mr. Karzai could carry political overtones. The security agreement, which would provide for a limited American training and counterterrorism force in Afghanistan after 2014, is crucial for continuing international aid, the main source of funding for the Afghan army and police that are facing a resilient Taliban insurgency. Mr. Obama's letter to Mr. Karzai and the Afghan people is supposed to \\"mention that there were mistakes made in the conduct of military operations by U.S. forces in the past decade, and that the Afghan people have suffered, and we understand their pain, and therefore can give assurances that these mistakes will not be repeated,\\" said Mr. Faizi. He added that Mr. Obama's letter would be presented to the Loya Jirga together with the security deal. Susan Rice, Mr. Obama's national security adviser, said Tuesday that the president has no intention of apologizing. \\"There's no such discussion of an apology,\\" she said on PBS. \\"So let's take that off the table. That's not in the cards.\\" She added that the talks on a security agreement are \\"very close to completion,\\" but added it was \\"possible\\" the two sides won't reach a deal on remaining details. The U.S. spent hundreds of billions of dollars in Afghanistan since the 2001 invasion, losing 2,922 American lives in the war so far. Mr. Karzai has repeatedly condemned the U.S. forces for inflicting civilian casualties. U.S. officials said in recent weeks that they had believed that the draft text of the agreement was ironed out during marathon talks between Messrs. Karzai and Kerry in Kabul in October. Mr. Karzai, however, reopened some of the most contentious issues in recent days. The dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, Vali Nasr, a former senior State Department official dealing with Afghanistan, said Mr. Karzai was shoring up his nationalistic credentials in this latest confrontation with Washington as U.S. troops withdraw. \\"He has to be viable as a nationalist leader,\\" Mr. Nasr said. \\"He is definitely playing a domestic game.…The Loya Jirga right now puts added pressure on him to appear not to be an American cat's paw.\\" Mr. Karzai's most-pointed demand to revise the security agreement was his insistence that American troops would no longer be allowed to enter Afghan homes under any circumstances, not even when accompanied by Afghan security forces, after 2014. Such a blanket ban would severely constrain, if not scuttle altogether, the counterterrorism mission that the U.S. hopes to maintain in Afghanistan to target al Qaeda. It would make it impossible for U.S. personnel to gather intelligence and evidence inside al Qaeda's hide-outs, and would even outlaw rescue missions to recover kidnapped or injured U.S. personnel. Retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan and now is a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, said counterterrorism raids are \\"the area where the United States is going to be particularly sensitive to restrictions,\\" adding, \\"Forces in combat, under fire, are going to require a little bit of that flexibility.\\" During Tuesday's phone call with Mr. Karzai, Mr. Kerry suggested that the Americans may be permitted to enter Afghan homes in \\"exceptional circumstances\\" when American troops' lives are at risk, Mr. Faizi said. Mr. Karzai initially replied by saying he wanted to add both the Afghan proposal and the American language in the draft agreement to be submitted to the Loya Jirga, and let its 2,500 delegates decide. He also invited Mr. Kerry to come to Kabul and try persuading the delegates to accept the American version in a speech to the assembly, an offer the U.S. rejected, Mr. Faizi said. The Loya Jirga, most of whose delegates were selected by provincial authorities, and whose membership list was approved by Mr. Karzai, is highly unlikely to do anything against the wishes of the Afghan president. As an alternative, Mr. Faizi said, Mr. Karzai also suggested the U.S. could sign the deal with a new government that is slated to be elected in April. At the end of the phone call, however, the Afghan president agreed to the \\"exceptional circumstances\\" request in exchange for a letter from Mr. Obama, Mr. Faizi said. The exact wording of that clause in the security agreement will be determined by negotiators from the two countries before the Loya Jirga considers the document, he said. Mr. Obama's letter should also guarantee that these exceptions \\"will not be misused\\" and \\"strictly defined,\\" Mr. Faizi said. It is possible, Mr. Faizi acknowledged, that the Loya Jirga may come up with \\"new suggestions\\" to amend the security agreement, requiring a new round of negotiations in coming weeks. U.S. military commanders initially pressed for the security agreement to be reached by October, saying they needed to start planning for any new post-2014 force as soon as possible. Any further delays would make this planning even more difficult, American officials have said. —Dion Nissenbaum contributed to this article. Write to Yaroslav Trofimov at yaroslav.trofimov@wsj.com and Nathan Hodge at nathan.hodge@wsj.com ||||| KABUL, Afghanistan — Months of fraught negotiations and public posturing over how a long-term American military force could remain in Afghanistan have suddenly come down to a demand for a single personal gesture: a display of contrition by President Obama for military mistakes that have hurt Afghans. Afghan officials said Tuesday that in return for such a letter from Mr. Obama, President Hamid Karzai would end his vehement opposition to American counterterrorism raids on private Afghan homes — one of the most contentious issues between allies over a costly dozen-year war — clearing the way for an agreement to keep a smaller American troop force in the country past the 2014 withdrawal deadline. As described by Mr. Karzai’s spokesman, Aimal Faizi, the letter would be tantamount to an apology, though he did not use that word. But not even that would be enough to ensure the final passage of a security agreement the United States had pressed to have in hand before next year. The Afghans have made final approval subject to an Afghan grand council of elders, a loya jirga, that is to begin meeting on Thursday, and aspects of the security deal remain deeply unpopular with the public. The White House spokesman, Jay Carney, would not confirm details on Tuesday, but he nodded to the potential deal-breaking potential of the meeting. “There are ongoing negotiations,” he said. “I would simply say this agreement is not reached until it goes through the loya jirga.” The 11th-hour discussions were the latest lurch in a start-and-stop negotiation process that has exposed raw feelings between allies, and has also highlighted Mr. Karzai’s taste for public brinkmanship. Just two days ago, Afghan officials said that the raid issue had created a stubborn impasse. Afghan and American officials said that the potential for breakthrough was opened by a phone call from Secretary of State John Kerry to Mr. Karzai on Tuesday. According to Mr. Faizi, Mr. Kerry offered to write a letter assuring the importance of an agreement and acknowledging American mistakes, and Mr. Karzai issued a counteroffer: He would compromise if the letter was from Mr. Obama instead. Mr. Faizi said Mr. Kerry agreed to those terms. But Susan E. Rice, the national security adviser, flatly denied in an interview with CNN on Tuesday night that there would be any presidential apology. “No such letter has been drafted or delivered,” Ms. Rice said. “There is not a need for the United States to apologize to Afghanistan. Quite the contrary. We have sacrificed and supported them in their democratic progress and in tackling the insurgency and Al Qaeda.” A senior State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss continuing negotiations, was more noncommittal, saying that a letter acknowledging past issues like civilian casualties was a possibility being weighed. “We will consider his request for reassurances, including the option of a letter from the administration stating our position,” the official said. Under the Afghan description, in return for the letter, Mr. Karzai would then accept wording that allowed American Special Operations raids to search and detain militants within Afghan homes, but only under “extraordinary circumstances” to save the lives of American soldiers. That would seem to greatly hamper the American intent behind those operations, which commanders have said are critical to taking the fight directly to Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. Among members of the Afghan public, though, foreign raids on private homes are seen as deeply offensive, and the prospect of continued American commando operations after 2014 is unlikely to receive a warm reception from the roughly 3,000 delegates to the loya jirga. But Mr. Faizi said that a letter from Mr. Obama would help win critics over. And Afghan political observers have noted that Mr. Karzai, who despite his harsh negotiation tactics has repeatedly mentioned the importance of a lasting security deal with the United States, had the power of approval over the delegate list, making it more likely he could sway the council. Mr. Faizi made it clear that the Afghans had a very detailed understanding of what they expected a letter from Mr. Obama to say, and without that there would be no deal. The letter would clarify what was meant by “extraordinary circumstances” justifying home raids, and go beyond that as well. “The idea was to indeed mention that there were mistakes made in the conduct of military operations in the past, in the conduct of military operations by United States forces in the last decade, and that Afghans have suffered, and that we understand the pain and therefore we give assurances and make sure those mistakes are not repeated,” Mr. Faizi said. Afghan officials said they expected to see the text of the letter by Wednesday before Mr. Karzai signs off on the security agreement. With one day remaining to finalize the wording of the security agreement before the loya jirga meets, Mr. Faizi said that was the remaining issue in talks, carried out in their last phase by Mr. Karzai with the American ambassador, James B. Cunningham, and the American military commander, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. “The rest, everything is solved,” Mr. Faizi said. He also said that the Afghan side had agreed to acquiesce on another sticking point: the American requirement that the United States retain legal jurisdiction over its soldiers in Afghanistan. In essence, that would make United States military personnel immune to Afghan prosecution for their actions in the country, though they would remain subject to American prosecution. A similar requirement led to the collapse of talks with Iraq to establish a long-term security deal, and an immediate final withdrawal of American troops from that country in 2011. In recent weeks, American officials have mentioned that the result in Iraq could be duplicated, and that the 2014 military withdrawal from Afghanistan could be made complete and final if their terms on home raids and legal jurisdiction were not met. ||||| Summary:","completion":"The US and Afghan governments are getting closer to a deal regarding the continued presence of US troops in Afghanistan after the coalition's mandate expires in December 2014. Although there have been some differences between the two sides, such as whether an acknowledgment letter from President Barack Obama on past mistakes committed by the US during the war should be sent, progress has been made and both sides have shown a willingness to compromise. President Hamid Karzai softened his opposition to American forces raiding Afghan homes after 2014 in exchange for Obama's letter, which would signify an understanding of the Afghan people's suffering and guarantee that past mistakes would not be repeated. The security agreement, providing for a limited American training and counterterrorism force in Afghanistan after 2014, is essential for maintaining international aid to the country as it faces a resilient Taliban insurgency."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Seventeen-year-old Carl (Tom Sturridge), recently expelled from school, is sent to stay with his godfather Quentin (Bill Nighy), who runs the station \\"Radio Rock\\" anchored in the North Sea. The eclectic crew of disc jockeys and staffers, led by the brash American DJ \\"The Count\\" (Philip Seymour Hoffman), quickly accept Carl as one of their own. At the start of the film Doctor Dave (Nick Frost) and Carl conspire to have Carl lose his virginity. Dave has his girlfriend get naked and lie in bed for him while he turns off the lights and goes into the bathroom, where has has Carl hidden. Carl then gets naked and walks into the dark room in an attempt to deceive Dave's girlfriend. However she turns the lights on and sees who was really about to have sex with her, and Carl gets embarrassed and leaves. In London, government minister Sir Alistair Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh) resolves to shut down pirate radio stations due to their commercialism and low morals, instructing his subordinate Twatt (Jack Davenport) to find legal loopholes that will serve this end. They attempt to cut off the stations' revenue by prohibiting British businesses from advertising on unlicensed radio stations. Quentin counters this by bringing massively popular DJ Gavin Kavanagh (Rhys Ifans) out of retirement and onto Radio Rock, enticing his advertisers to work around the law by paying their bills from abroad. Gavin's popularity creates a rivalry between himself and The Count, who was initially brought to Radio Rock as Gavin's replacement.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. “It is the key to self improvement!”, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don’t quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve. The writer believes that - people should learn - people should isten - not enough information - people should take feedback Answer:","completion":"Embracing failure and accepting critical feedback play a crucial role in personal and professional growth. The right balance between self-confidence and the awareness of one's limitations is essential to make the most out of such opportunities for self-improvement. Here's how feedback and failure can be turned into advantages: 1. Cultivate a growth mindset: A growth mindset emphasizes the belief that skills and abilities can be improved over time. By adopting this perspective, you will be more open to learning from your mistakes and using feedback as a catalyst for growth. 2. Practice active listening: When receiving feedback, listen carefully without being defensive. This will allow you to genuinely understand the other person's perspective and take their advice into account in your future work. 3. Reflect on your experiences: Take the time to ponder on feedback you've received or past failures. Analyze what went wrong, identify areas for improvement, and develop a plan to address these shortcomings. 4. Focus on your strengths: Recognize your strengths and leverage them to overcome your weaknesses. By focusing on your strong points, you can develop the confidence needed to tackle your limitations and be more receptive to critical feedback. 5. Develop resilience: Understand that failure is a natural part of the learning process. By building resilience, you'll be able to bounce back more quickly from setbacks and maintain your motivation to keep learning and growing. 6. Foster a supportive and open environment: Encourage open communication within teams to promote the sharing of ideas, constructive criticism, and opportunities for learning. This will create a culture where feedback is not only welcome but actively sought after. 7. Manage your emotions: It's easy to feel hurt by negative feedback or failure. However, learning to manage your emotions and respond positively to such situations can help you stay focused on your goals and continue to grow. 8. Seek mentorship: Find experienced professionals who can provide guidance, support, and constructive criticism as you progress in your career. Their advice and feedback will be invaluable in helping you improve your skills and navigate challenges. By employing these techniques, you can make feedback and failure work to your advantage.

During the sessions, Morton had Johansen record his vocals several times and incorporated sound effects such as gongs, gunshots, and feminine choruses. In a report on the album's progress for Melody Maker, journalist Lenny Kaye wrote that they were taking more time than they had on their first record, \\"bringing in occasional strings and horns, following Shadow's advice not 'to settle'.\\" Morton and the band shared an affinity for each other, as he found the group's energy in the studio refreshing, while Johansen was fond of Morton and the \\"looser\\" feel he provided for their music. \\"That man is completely unpretentious\\", Johansen said of the producer. \\"He doesn't think he ever did a marvellous thing in his life.\\" The New York Dolls and Morton produced little original material together.

Help as much as you can. Renaissance is a French word. It means \\"rebirth\\". It's a strange name for a period of history. What was exactly \\" reborn\\" during the Renaissance? To answer this question, we need to look back at the time of the Roman Empire. At this time Roman artists, scientists and writers influenced by Greek ideas were the world's most advanced. They had become skilled observers of the natural world around them, and had become experts in studying animals, plants, the human body or the stars and planets. They wrote down their ideas about what they saw, and based their theories about the world on their observations. During the fourth and fifth centuries the Roman Empire slowly broke down. Many of the Romans' art and sculptures were destroyed and some manuscripts were lost as well. But most importantly, some of the ancient attitudes were lost. A questioning approach to the world was replaced by an unquestioning one. Why did this happen? One reason was to do with the influence of the Christian Church. Through the thousand years following the fall of the Roman Empire, the Church controlled many aspects of life including education and learning. The Church ran all the universities and thought that the aim of a university should be to teach old ideas more clearly, not to introduce new ones. The scholars in the universities were expected to study God and heaven from the Bible and ancient books, rather than the world around them. Take medicine for example. The main textbook for doctors had been written by a Greek doctor called Galen more than a thousand years earlier. But when Roger Bacon, a thirteenth-century priest , said that a new approach to medicine was needed --- doctors should do their own original research instead of reading writers from the past such as Galen-the Church put him in prison. By the time of the fourteenth century, however, some parts of the Christian Church were becoming less strict about their ideas and there was a new state of mind among artists, doctors and scientist. People wanted to find out more about... Roger Bacon was put in prison because he _ .

Movie plot title: Elegy Movie plot: David Kepesh is a cultural critic and professor, in a state of 'emancipated manhood': His relationships with women are usually casual, brief and sexual in nature. Previously married, he has a son who has never forgiven him for leaving his mother. His friend, Pulitzer Prize-winning poet George O'Hearn, suggests that he \\"bifurcate\\" his life: have conversations and enjoy art with a wife, and \\"keep the sex just for sex\\". David is also in a casual 20-year relationship with Caroline, another former student. He encounters Consuela Castillo, a beautiful and confident student who attends one of his lectures. She captures his attention like no other woman, and they begin a serious relationship. George advises him to leave her before she leaves him, but David cannot bring himself to give her up. They are a couple for a year and a half, during which he continues to sleep with Caroline; neither woman knows of the other's existence. Over dinner, Consuela invites David to her graduation party. After some hesitation, he agrees to attend. On the day of the event, David phones Consuela and claims he is stuck in traffic and it will be unavoidably delayed. In reality, he is sitting in his car, anxious about meeting Consuela's family. Heartbroken, Consuela hangs up, and they end their relationship. Shortly afterward, George suffers a stroke during a poetry conference after David introduces him, and later dies. David realizes too late that he genuinely loved Consuela, and ends his relationship with Caroline.

I've been watching it for years now and to me it still don't look right somehow. Maybe it's just me thinking it, sending myself doolally after what I've done. But I swear every morning it creeps up and it's looking at me, all knowing like. And when you reckon the sun's acting like that over you there isn't a right lot you can do about it, beyond burying yourself away like a mole in the soil. That's what I've been doing more or less in the score or so years that have gone by since. But however tight I shut them curtains to stop that damn sun lighting me up, it still don't stop the inside of my head from pounding out the truth. No way it's ever going to stop harassing me neither, not unless the deaf and dumb lass was to happen right back on my doorstep and give me the chance to tell her that it wasn't never meant to work out this way. The deaf and dumb lass went by the name of Mitzi Barker. Her being deaf and dumb, she was the kind of lass you went up the lane with if you didn't want no-one shouting their gob off about it after. Funny but it's the small things I recall best about her, like the way her hair reeked of bonfires and how that little old checkered dress of hers rode right up her thigh with no help from me. After we'd finished our business we'd head over the trout farm and I'd hunker down and poach us up a couple of rainbows for our tea. That Mitzi Barker, she was thin as an ear of barley and I always figured a good nosh-up was the least I could do for her troubles.

The narrator describes their routine of going up the lane together and spending time with each other, and how he would poach a couple of rainbow trouts for them to share as a meal afterwards. He mentions that Mitzi was very thin, and he felt that providing her with a good meal was the least he could do in return for her company and the moments they shared. The narrator's description of Mitzi and their time together reveals a great deal about their relationship and the circumstances surrounding it. It shows that, despite her being deaf and mute, Mitzi and the narrator shared a deep connection, one that was perhaps strengthened by their simple, shared experiences, such as enjoying a meal of trout by the trout farm. These memories, however, haunt the narrator as he keeps reflecting on that fateful day when something went wrong between them. The sun, in its daily appearance, constantly reminds him of what he has done and how he has failed Mitzi. No matter how hard he tries to escape and hide from the truth, it remains in his mind, tormenting him with the knowledge that if Mitzi were to come back, he could never truly make amends for the harm he has caused. The story of the narrator and Mitzi Barker is one of regret, guilt, and a longing for closure that may never come. It is a poignant reminder of the weight of our actions and how the choices we make can haunt us for years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Pidgeon was the first person to do this via the Panama Canal, and the first person to solo circumnavigate the world twice. On both trips, he sailed a 34-foot yawl named the \\"Islander\\", which Pidgeon constructed by himself. Prior to his first trip, Pidgeon had no prior experience sailing. He accounts for his adventures in his book, \\"Around the World Single-Handed: The Cruise of the \\"Islander\\"\\" (1932). Biography. Harry Clifford Pidgeon was born 31 August 1869 on a farm in Iowa.

Should I validate this answer? OPT: I. No II. Yes The answer is:","completion":"I. No The suggested answer does not accurately address the question about the three mental states in psychology. It is important to provide a comprehensive and detailed answer to ensure a proper understanding of the topic. The three primary mental states in psychology include conscious, preconscious, and unconscious. 1. Conscious: The conscious mind represents our current awareness and thoughts. It includes everything that we are currently aware of, such as our sensations, perceptions, emotions, and thoughts. The conscious mind is responsible for processing the information we receive from our external environment and internal responses. 2. Preconscious: The preconscious mind contains accessible information that is not currently in our conscious awareness but can be easily brought to the forefront if needed. For example, memories and knowledge that we have stored throughout our lives can be accessed through the preconscious mind when required. 3. Unconscious: The unconscious mind consists of thoughts, feelings, and memories that are hidden away from our conscious awareness. These psychic contents may influence our behavior and decision-making without us realizing it. Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, believed that the unconscious mind plays a significant role in shaping human behavior and is the reservoir for repressed and unacceptable desires, thoughts, and feelings. In conclusion, it is crucial to differentiate the three primary mental states in psychology – conscious, preconscious, and unconscious – to understand their unique roles in influencing human behavior and mental processes. The suggested answer does not provide this necessary information, so it should not be validated.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What were the names of the two people who were less optimistic about Barrett's erratic behavior?, using the article: Morrison and EMI producer Norman Smith negotiated Pink Floyd's first recording contract, and as part of the deal, the band agreed to record their first album at EMI Studios in London. Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967. The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts. One month later, it was released under the Tower Records label. Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child, who commented: \\"I found [Barrett] in the dressing room and he was so ... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, [and] we got him out to the stage ... The band started to play and Syd just stood there. He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down\\".Forced to cancel Pink Floyd's appearance at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival, as well as several other shows, King informed the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion. Waters arranged a meeting with psychiatrist R. D. Laing, and though Waters personally drove Barrett to the appointment, Barrett refused to come out of the car. A stay in Formentera with Sam Hutt, a doctor well established in the underground music scene, led to no visible improvement. The band followed a few concert dates in Europe during September with their first tour of the US in October. As the US tour went on, Barrett's condition grew steadily worse. During appearances on the Dick Clark and Pat Boone shows in November, Barrett confounded his hosts by not responding to questions and staring off into space.

Article: Keep the scooter still and lift the front wheel off of the ground to practice the barspin. As you stand on the scooter, lift your non-dominant hand away from the handlebars and spin them towards your body with your dominant hand. Keep rotating the bars as far as you can move them. To keep your scooter still while you practice, you can put the back wheel up against a wall. Alternately, you can just stand on the brake on the back of your scooter to keep it from moving. You could also position the scooter so that the front wheel is over a curb and isn't touching the ground. Once you have rotated the bars as far around as you can with your dominant hand, reach your non-dominant hand under the dominant one to grab the other handle as it comes. Keep spinning the bars towards their starting position, rotating your dominant hand back to a normal, forward-facing grip as you do. Keep on practicing until you can do this one smooth motion. It’ll be much easier to do the trick when you can spin your handlebars without thinking about it. Once you’ve got the movement sorted, you can practice spinning while the scooter is moving. Stand with your legs shoulder-width apart and swing your scooter between them so it moves front to back. When the scooter reaches it’s highest point in front of you, try and spin the handles. This is the best way to mimic a real barspin without you having to leave the ground. In order to do a barspin, you’ll need to get some air with a bunny hop. Start riding your scooter at a comfortable speed and then jump straight up in the air. As you do, hold onto the handlebars of the scooter and lift it up with your body. Practice doing a bunny hop until you can jump easily and as high as possible. The higher you jump, the more time you’ll have to get your barspin perfect and regain control of the handlebars before you hit the ground. See how high you can bunny hop. Make sure you keep your feet firmly planted on the deck of your scooter and keep your front wheel straight when you land your bunny hop. Start riding on your scooter at a comfortable speed and do a bunnyhop, keeping your scooter level. As you reach the highest point of the hop, use the hand movement you practiced to spin the bars around and catch them again. Hold on tightly to the handlebars and bend your knees slightly as you land to give you more control over the scooter when you’re back on the ground. If you’re worried about crashing, you can practice on a softer surface like grass first.

Erin was always scared to use a public toilet unlike Cynthia because","completion":"Cynthia was fearless. It was an odd fear for Erin to have, but it plagued her throughout her entire life – the fear of public restrooms. It began when she was just five years old. She had walked into a public restroom with her mother and unknowingly stepped on a piece of gum. Her mother's angry scolding left her scarred and anxious, associating public restrooms with a sense of danger and contamination. Years passed and Erin tried her best to work through her fear. She always tried to schedule outings with breaks built in, so she could return to her safe home bathroom. Despite her quirks, Erin managed to build a strong bond with Cynthia during their college years. Cynthia, on the other hand, had an uncanny ability to adapt to any surrounding – from the most pristine of restrooms to the dingiest of public stalls. She had a certain level of confidence that Erin had always admired, and she hoped that some of it would rub off on her. One day, Cynthia invited Erin to the annual cultural fair held downtown. It was an event filled with music, dance, food, and craft stalls – an atmosphere Cynthia loved and knew Erin would enjoy too. Despite the excitement in her heart, Erin's mind began to panic: how would she manage to avoid the dreaded public restrooms with all the food and drink available? Despite her concerns, Erin took a deep breath and decided to say yes to her friend's invitation. She couldn't let this fear control her life. On the day of the fair, they set off early in the morning, the sun shining brightly and the smell of delicious food wafting through the air. Cynthia sensed Erin's anxiety but was determined to help her friend conquer her fears. As the day went by, the two friends had a great time exploring numerous stalls, trying various dishes, and dancing together. However, as fate would have it, nature called. Erin felt the familiar pang of panic rise in her chest. Seeing the look on her friend's face, Cynthia understood what was going on. Cynthia took Erin's hand and led her to the public restroom area. \\"Erin, listen to me. I know you're scared, and that's okay. But I'll be right here with you, and I'll make sure nothing goes wrong. You have to face this fear and realize that it's only a part of your mind playing tricks on you. Are you with me?\\" With Cynthia's unwavering support, Erin found herself breathing more easily. Steeling her resolve, she nodded. \\"Okay, I'm with you. Let's do this.\\" Hand in hand, they approached the restrooms. The old fear began to creep up on Erin, but Cynthia continued to encourage her. With every step, Erin became stronger, more determined to defeat her fear. Once they reached the entrance, Cynthia squeezed Erin's hand and smiled. \\"You're not alone, remember that.\\" Erin walked into the restroom, feeling her heartbeat quicken. The echo of footsteps and the sound of running water were all she could hear. In a distant corner, she noticed a cleaning cart – a sign that the place had been recently cleaned. As she entered a stall and locked the door, she tried to concentrate on her breathing. A few minutes later, her task was finally done. When Erin exited the restroom, she was greeted with a big smile and a hug from Cynthia. \\"I'm proud of you. You faced your fear, and you're still standing.\\" While their adventure at the cultural fair continued, Erin felt an overwhelming sense of accomplishment. Indeed, she was still standing after facing her biggest fear. As they walked hand in hand towards the next exciting exhibit at the fair, Erin couldn't help but feel more vibrant and alive than ever. Erin's journey to overcome her fear of public restrooms wasn't an easy one, but with the help of her friend Cynthia and the strength she found within herself, she took a significant step forward. From that day on, Erin's fear began to lessen, and she found herself embarking on new adventures with a newfound sense of confidence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Phillips, who works in China, released his report saying China's suicide rate from 1995 to 1999 reached 0.023 percent, the country has been ranked among those with the highest suicide rates in the world. But Jing Jun, a professor of sociology in Tsinghua University, challenges that view and presents the true picture through his nationwide research. Jing and his students took one year to set up the first national database on suicide rate to grasp the overall trend of suicides in China. They collected data from the Health Statistics Annuals of the World Health Organization (sample size 10 million), and the country's Health Statistics Annuals (which cover 100 million people). The database covers 23 years, from 1987 to 2009. Jing calculates the suicide rate in China based on these data. Though the suicide rate was comparatively high in the early years, his study shows it has dropped in recent years, as opposed to the ascending trend in the rest of the world. According to Jing's calculation, China's suicide rate had dropped to about 0.01 percent in 2004. In 2009, the figure dropped further to 0.007 percent, which is rather low compared with the global rate of 0.016 percent. Even if the \\"missing\\" suicides were added, China's suicide rate in 2009 would still be below 0.008 percent.[:Zxxk.Com] Jing has found that one of the main reasons why the suicide rate has dropped was the steady and big decline in the number of suicides committed by rural women. In the early years, researchers generally agreed that the suicide rate among Chinese women was higher than among men, which is pretty rare in the rest the world. But the suicide rate among Chinese women, especially in rural areas, has declined remarkably in recent years. In fact, it is almost equal to that of Chinese men. As a sociologist, Jing regards suicide as a social issue, and believes improvement of social policies will reduce the suicide rate even further.

Bristol was founded by 1000; by about 1020, it was a trading centre with a mint producing silver pennies bearing its name. By 1067 Brycgstow was a well-fortified burh, and that year the townsmen beat off a raiding party from Ireland led by three of Harold Godwinson's sons. Under Norman rule, the town had one of the strongest castles in southern England. Bristol was the place of exile for Diarmait Mac Murchada, the Irish king of Leinster, after being overthrown. The Bristol merchants subsequently played a prominent role in funding Richard Strongbow de Clare and the Norman invasion of Ireland. The port developed in the 11th century around the confluence of the Rivers Frome and Avon, adjacent to Bristol Bridge just outside the town walls. By the 12th century Bristol was an important port, handling much of England's trade with Ireland, including slaves. There was also an important Jewish community in Bristol from the late 12th century through to the late 13th century when all Jews were expelled from England. The stone bridge built in 1247 was replaced by the current bridge during the 1760s. The town incorporated neighbouring suburbs and became a county in 1373, the first town in England to be given this status. During this period, Bristol became a shipbuilding and manufacturing centre. By the 14th century Bristol, York and Norwich were England's largest medieval towns after London. One-third to one-half of the population died in the Black Death of 1348–49, which checked population growth, and its population remained between 10,000 and 12,000 for most of the 15th and 16th centuries.

The shoes- named Square Eyes- contain an electronic pressure sensor and a tiny computer chip to record how many steps the wearer has taken in a day. A wireless transmitter passes the information to a receiver connected to a television, and this decides how much evening viewing time the wearer deserves , based on the day's efforts. The design was inspired by a desire to fight against the rapidly ballooning waistlines among British teenagers, says Gillian Swan, who developed Square Eyes as a final year design project at Brunel University in London, UK. \\"We looked at current issues and childhood overweight really stood out,\\" she says. \\"And I wanted to tackle that with my design.\\" Once a child has used up their daily allowance gained through exercise, the television automatically switches off. And further time in front of the TV can only be earned through more steps. Swan calculated how exercise should translate to television time using the recommended daily amounts of both. Health experts suggest that a child take 12,000 steps each day and watch no more than two hours of television. So, every 100 steps recorded by the Square Eyes shoes equals exactly one minute of TV time. Existing pedometers normally clip onto a belt or slip into a pocket and keep count of steps by measuring sudden movement. Swan says these can be easily tricked into recording steps through shaking. But her shoe has been built to be harder for lazy teenagers to cheat. \\"It is possible, but it would be a lot of effort,\\" she says. \\"That was one of my main design considerations.\\" Options: A They control a child's evening TV viewing time.

With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. - Salyut 5 (meaning \\"Salute 5\\"), also known as OPS-3, was a Soviet space station. Launched in 1976 as part of the Salyut programme, it was the third and last Almaz space station to be launched for the Soviet military. Two Soyuz missions visited the station, each manned by two cosmonauts. A third Soyuz mission attempted to visit the station, but failed to dock, whilst a fourth mission was planned but never launched. - Vitaly Mikhaylovich Zholobov (born 18 June 1937) is a retired Soviet cosmonaut who flew on Soyuz 21 space flight as the flight engineer. - Human spaceflight (also referred to as manned spaceflight) is space travel with a crew or passengers aboard the spacecraft. Spacecraft carrying people may be operated directly, by human crew, or it may be either remotely operated from ground stations on Earth or be autonomous, able to carry out a specific mission with no human involvement. - The Almaz (\\"Diamond\\") program was a highly secretive Soviet military space station program, begun in the early 1960s. - Mir (; lit. \\"peace\\" or \\"world\\") was a space station that operated in low Earth orbit from 1986 to 2001, run by the Soviet Union and later by Russia. \\"Mir\\" was the first modular space station and was assembled in orbit from 1986 to 1996. It had a greater mass than any previous spacecraft. At the time it was the largest artificial satellite in orbit, succeeded by the International Space Station after Mir's orbit decayed. The station served as a microgravity research laboratory in which crews conducted experiments in biology, human biology, physics, astronomy, meteorology and spacecraft systems with a goal of developing technologies required for permanent occupation of space. - The International Space Station (ISS) is a space station, or a habitable artificial satellite, in low Earth orbit. Its first component launched into orbit in 1998, and the ISS is now the largest artificial body in orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised modules, external trusses, solar arrays, and other components. ISS components have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and American Space Shuttles. - Tiangong-2 is a Chinese space laboratory and part of the Project 921-2 space station program. Tiangong-2 was launched on 15 September 2016, 22:04:09 (UTC+8). - A low Earth orbit (LEO) is an orbit around Earth with an altitude between (orbital period of about 88 minutes), and (about 127 minutes). Objects below approximately will experience very rapid orbital decay and altitude loss. - Soyuz 5 (\\"Union 5\\") was a Soyuz mission using the Soyuz 7K-OK spacecraft launched by the Soviet Union on 15 January 1969, which docked with Soyuz 4 in orbit. It was the first-ever docking of two manned spacecraft of any nation, and the first-ever transfer of crew from one space vehicle to another of any nation, the only time a transfer was accomplished with a space walk two months before the US Apollo 9 mission performed the first ever internal crew transfer. - Tiangong-1 is China's first prototype space station, serving as both a manned laboratory and an experimental testbed to demonstrate orbital rendezvous and docking capabilities. Launched unmanned aboard a Long March 2F/G rocket on 29 September 2011, it is the first operational component of the Tiangong program, which aims to place a larger, modular station into orbit by 2023. Tiangong-1 was initially projected to be deorbited in 2013, to be replaced over the following decade by the larger Tiangong-2 and Tiangong-3 modules, but as of October 2016 it was still aloft, though in a decaying orbit. - A spacecraft is a vehicle, or machine designed to fly in outer space. Spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes, including communications, earth observation, meteorology, navigation, space colonization, planetary exploration, and transportation of humans and cargo. - Boris Valentinovich Volynov (born 18 December 1934) is a Soviet cosmonaut who flew two space missions of the Soyuz programme: Soyuz 5, and Soyuz 21. He was the first halakhic (by mother) Jewish cosmonaut. - The Soyuz programme (or meaning \\"Union\\") is a human spaceflight programme that was initiated by the Soviet Union in the early 1960s, originally part of a Moon landing project intended to put a Soviet cosmonaut on the Moon. It was the third Soviet human spaceflight programme after the Vostok and Voskhod programme. - Landing is the last part of a flight, where a flying animal, aircraft, or spacecraft returns to the ground. When the flying object returns to water, the process is called alighting, although it is commonly called \\"landing,\\" \\"touchdown\\" or \\"splashdown\\" as well. A normal aircraft flight would include several parts of flight including taxi, takeoff, climb, cruise, descent and landing. - A space station, also known as an orbital station or an orbital space station, is a spacecraft capable of supporting crewmembers, which is designed to remain in space (most commonly as an artificial satellite in low Earth orbit) for an extended period of time and for other spacecraft to dock. A space station is distinguished from other spacecraft used for human spaceflight by lack of major propulsion or landing systems. Instead, other vehicles transport people and cargo to and from the station. three space stations are in orbit: the International Space Station, which is permanently manned, China's Tiangong-1 (defunct) and Tiangong-2 (launched 15 September 2016, not permanently manned). Previous stations include the Almaz and Salyut series, Skylab, and most recently \\"Mir\\". - Soyuz 21 ( Russian : 21 , Union 21 ) was a 1976 Soviet manned mission to the Salyut 5 space station , the first of three flights to the station . The mission 's objectives were mainly military in scope , but included other scientific work . The mission ended abruptly with cosmonauts Boris Volynov and Vitaly Zholobov returning to earth after 49 days in orbit . The precise reason for the early end of the mission was the subject of much speculation , but was reported to be an emergency evacuation after the Salyut atmosphere developed an acrid odor . - Skylab was the United States' first space station, orbiting Earth from 1973 to 1979, when it fell back to Earth amid huge worldwide media attention. Launched and operated by NASA, Skylab included a workshop, a solar observatory, and other systems necessary for crew survival and scientific experiments. It was launched unmanned by a modified Saturn V rocket, with a weight of . Lifting Skylab into low earth orbit was the final mission and launch of a Saturn V rocket (which was famous for carrying the manned Moon landing missions). Skylab was not simply a place of habitation; it was a place of massive science experiments for which when the bulk of data was returned, such as on films that had to be physically returned to Earth began the process of analyzing scientific and engineering data as each mission was completed. Skylab's solar observatory was one major aspect of study, and solar science was significantly advanced by the telescope; it observed the Sun as it never before.

Looking for a harder-hitting rock sound than that of All That You Can't Leave Behind, U2 began recording their eleventh studio album, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, in February 2003 with producer Chris Thomas. After nine months of work, the band had an album's worth of material ready for release, but they were not satisfied with the results; Mullen said that the songs \\"had no magic\\". The group subsequently enlisted Steve Lillywhite to take over as producer in Dublin in January 2004. Lillywhite, along with his assistant Jacknife Lee, spent six months with the band reworking songs and encouraging better performances. Several other producers received credits on the album, including Lanois, Eno, Flood, Carl Glanville, and Nellee Hooper; Bono acknowledged that the involvement of multiple producers affected the record's \\"sonic cohesion\\". Released in November 2004, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb received favourable reviews from critics. The album featured lyrics touching on life, death, love, war, faith, and family. It reached number one in 30 countries, including the US, where first-week sales of 840,000 copies nearly doubled those of All That You Can't Leave Behind, setting a personal best for the band. Overall, it sold 9 million copies globally.

The original paragraph explicitly states that \\"The county was formed in 1780 and named for future President Thomas Jefferson, who was Governor of Virginia at the time.” So, it can safely be concluded that Thomas Jefferson was indeed the governor of Virginia. He served as the governor from 1779 to 1781. During his term as governor, he faced several challenges, including invasions by the British. He was also pivotal in leading the effort of moving the state capital from Williamsburg to Richmond. Despite the contemporaneous difficulty, which later led to a political investigation, Jefferson managed to accomplish noteworthy societal reforms throughout his governorship. These included the abolishment of entail and primogeniture - inheritance laws that deeply favored the gentry - and the relaxation of naturalization laws to promote immigration. Thomas Jefferson's governorship preceded his presidency. After his term as governor, he went on to serve as U.S. minister to France before eventually becoming the third President of the United States. Notably, during his presidency, he authorized the famous Louisiana Purchase, which significantly expanded the territory of the United States. His influence and popularity were such that a newly-formed county in Kentucky chose to name it after him in 1780, a true testament to his long-standing impact on the nation.

He is taken for interrogation to the Schloss Adler, a fortress high in the Alps of southern Bavaria. A team of Allied commandos, led by British Major John Smith (Richard Burton) and U.S. Army Ranger Lieutenant Morris Schaffer (Clint Eastwood), is briefed by Colonel Turner (Patrick Wymark) and Admiral Rolland (Michael Hordern) of MI6. Their mission is to parachute in, infiltrate the castle, and rescue General Carnaby (Robert Beatty) before the Germans can interrogate him. MI6 Agent Mary Elison (Mary Ure) accompanies the mission in secret, her presence known only to Major Smith. Early in the mission, two of the operatives are mysteriously killed, but Major Smith is unperturbed, keeping Lt. Schaffer as a close ally and secretly updating Rolland and Turner on developments by radio.

Step 4: Identify the primary commodity produced by this industry. Justification: Understanding the most significant product of the industry will help us provide a specific answer to the user's question. So, based on these steps: Step 1: The steam engine was initially introduced in the English empire in the early 18th century, with key inventions made by Thomas Savery and Thomas Newcomen, and later improved by James Watt in the 1760s and 1770s. Step 2: The main industries during this period were textile, mining, iron, and agriculture. Step 3: The steam engine had a significant impact on many industries, but the mining and textile industries saw the greatest benefits during the initial period. The steam engine allowed for greater productivity and efficiency by pumping water out of mines, and the textile industry benefited from spinning and weaving machines powered by steam engines. Step 4: The primary commodity produced by the mining industry was coal, and the primary commodity produced by the textile industry was cotton.

The ceremony was attended by Lennon's son Julian and his first wife Cynthia in a park overlooking the River Mersey in this northwest English city, where the singer-songwriter and his fellow Beatles launched their careers. \\"We come here with our hearts to honour Dad and to pray for peace and say 'thank you' to each and every one of you, and everybody involved in the celebrations today,\\" said Julian Lennon, 47. His 71-year-old mother Cynthia, who met Lennon at Liverpool Art College, added that people should not mourn him but should enjoy his life. \\"Don't be morbid, enjoy the joy that he had and what we all have from his music,\\" she told the crowd of dignitaries and fans from all over the world who gathered in the city's Chavasse Park for the unveiling ceremony. It was one of a number of events planned worldwide to celebrate Lennon's birthday and his legacy, 30 years after he was shot dead outside his Manhattan apartment in December 1980. His widow, Yoko Ono, took part in celebrations in Iceland -- even though she admitted Lennon had never liked to mark the progress of time. \\"The last birthday, he told me: 'I can't quite believe I'm going to be 40'. I don't think he liked that part,\\" she said in an interview published in The Times newspaper Saturday. \\"I don't think of him as 70. He was always that sort of strutting around, very, very energetic guy, and to me he's still like that,\\" she continued, adding: \\"I think he would have aged well, he had a good bone structure.\\" The 77-year-old was due to light up the \\"Imagine Peace Tower\\" in the Icelandic capital Reykjavik later Saturday, before performing with her Ono Plastic Band and her son Sean Lennon at an evening concert in the capital. The tower, a three-year-old art installation composed of a strong, vertical beam of light which can reach up to 4,000 meters (13,100 feet), is lit up every year and stays lit until December 8, the anniversary of his death. Organisers of the Liverpool monument hope their new sculpture can provide an alternative base for Lennon's fans. Designed by US artist Lauren Voiers and commissioned by a US arts organisation, the Global Peace Initiative, it comprises a globe with multicoloured symbols of peace and musical references swirled above it. There are two hands outstretched to the sky, doves of peace, a keyboard and a white feather, which Julian Lennon said was a symbol of his father's spirit. \\"One of the things my father said to me was that should he pass away, if there was some way of letting me know he was going to be OK, it was by, in some shape or form, presenting me with a white feather,\\" he said. Asked how her husband would have faced the modern world today, Yoko Ono said he would have loved computers and would have used them to make music and communicate around the world. Lennon would also have remained a peace activist, she said: \\"He would have been very, very angry that violence and war are still going on.\\" Copyright © 2010 AFP. All rights reserved.

Help as much as you can. Information: - In biology, a species complex is a group of closely related species that are very similar in appearance to the point that the boundaries between them are often unclear. Terms sometimes used synonymously but with more precise meanings are: cryptic species for two or more species hidden under one species name, sibling species for two cryptic species that are each other's closest relative, and species flock for a group of closely related species living in the same habitat. As informal taxonomic ranks, species group, species aggregate, and superspecies are also in use. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) is the set of rules and recommendations dealing with the formal botanical names that are given to plants, fungi and a few other groups of organisms, all those \\"traditionally treated as algae, fungi, or plants\\". It was formerly called the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN); the name was changed at the International Botanical Congress in Melbourne in July 2011 as part of the \\"Melbourne Code\\" which replaces the \\"Vienna Code\\" of 2005. As with previous codes, it took effect as soon as it was ratified by the congress (on Saturday 23 July 2011), but the documentation of the code in its final form was not finished until some time after the congressional meeting. Preliminary wording of some of the articles with the most significant changes has been published in September 2011. - Botany, also called plant science(s), plant biology or phytology, is the science of plant life and a branch of biology. A botanist or plant scientist is a scientist who specialises in this field. The term \\"botany\\" comes from the Ancient Greek word (\\"botan\\") meaning \\"pasture\\", \\"grass\\", or \\"fodder\\"; is in turn derived from (\\"boskein\\"), \\"to feed\\" or \\"to graze\\". Traditionally, botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress. Nowadays, botanists study approximately 400,000 species of living organisms of which some 260,000 species are vascular plants and about 248,000 are flowering plants. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - The plural (abbreviated ), in many languages, is one of the values of the grammatical category of number. Plural of nouns typically denote a quantity other than the default quantity represented by a noun, which is generally one (the form that represents this default quantity is said to be of \\"singular\\" number). Most commonly, therefore, plurals are used to denote two or more of something, although they may also denote more than fractional, zero or negative amounts. An example of a plural is the English word \\"cats\\", which corresponds to the singular \\"cat\\". - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - FOSSIL is a standard protocol for allowing serial communication for telecommunications programs under the DOS operating system. FOSSIL is an acronym for \\"Fido Opus SEAdog Standard Interface Layer\\". \\"Fido\\" refers to FidoBBS, \\"Opus\\" refers to Opus-CBCS BBS, and \\"SEAdog\\" refers to a Fidonet compatible mailer. The standards document that defines the FOSSIL protocol is maintained by the Fidonet Technical Standards Committee. - In ecology, a niche is a term with a variety of meanings related to the behavior of a species living under specific environmental conditions. The ecological niche describes how an organism or population responds to the distribution of resources and competitors (for example, by growing when resources are abundant, and when predators, parasites and pathogens are scarce) and how it in turn alters those same factors (for example, limiting access to resources by other organisms, acting as a food source for predators and a consumer of prey). \\"The type and number of variables comprising the dimensions of an environmental niche vary from one species to another [and] the relative importance of particular environmental variables for a species may vary according to the geographic and biotic contexts\\". - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - In biology, offspring are the young born of living organisms, produced either by a single organism or, in the case of sexual reproduction, two organisms. Collective offspring may be known as a brood or progeny in a more general way. This can refer to a set of simultaneous offspring, such as the chicks hatched from one clutch of eggs, or to all the offspring, as with the honeybee. - Biology is a natural science concerned with the study of life and living organisms, including their structure, function, growth, evolution, distribution, identification and taxonomy. Modern biology is a vast and eclectic field, composed of many branches and subdisciplines. However, despite the broad scope of biology, there are certain general and unifying concepts within it that govern all study and research, consolidating it into single, coherent field. In general, biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life, genes as the basic unit of heredity, and evolution as the engine that propels the synthesis and creation of new species. It is also understood today that all the organisms survive by consuming and transforming energy and by regulating their internal environment to maintain a stable and vital condition known as homeostasis. - In biological classification , rank is the relative level of a group of organisms ( a taxon ) in a taxonomic hierarchy . Examples of taxonomic ranks are species , genus , family , class , kingdom , etc. A given rank subsumes under it less general categories , that is , more specific descriptions of life forms . Above it , each rank is classified within more general categories of organisms and groups of organisms related to each other through inheritance of traits or features from common ancestors . The rank of any species and the description of its genus is basic ; which means that to identify a particular organism , it is usually not necessary to specify ranks other than these first two . Consider a particular species , the red fox Vulpes vulpes : its next rank , the genus Vulpes , comprises all the ' true foxes ' . Their closest relatives are in the immediately higher rank , the family Canidae , which includes dogs , wolves , jackals , all foxes , and other caniforms ; the next higher rank , the order Carnivora , includes feliforms and caniforms ( lions , tigers , bears , hyenas , wolverines , and all those mentioned above ) , plus other carnivorous mammals . As one group of the class Mammalia , all of the above are classified among those with backbones in the Chordata phylum rank , and with them among all the animals in the Animalia kingdom rank . Finally , all of the above will find their earliest relatives somewhere in their domain rank Eukarya . The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature defines rank as : The level , for nomenclatural purposes , of a taxon in a taxonomic hierarchy ( e.g. all families are for nomenclatural purposes at the same rank , which lies between superfamily and subfamily ) - In biology, phylogenetics (Greek: , - \\"phylé\\", \\"phylon\\" = tribe, clan, race + - \\"genetikós\\" = origin, source, birth) is the study of the evolutionary history and relationships among individuals or groups of organisms (e.g. species, or populations). These relationships are discovered through phylogenetic inference methods that evaluate observed heritable traits, such as DNA sequences or morphology under a model of evolution of these traits. The result of these analyses is a phylogeny (also known as a phylogenetic tree) a diagrammatic hypothesis about the history of the evolutionary relationships of a group of organisms. The tips of a phylogenetic tree can be living organisms or fossils, and represent the \\"end,\\" or the present, in an evolutionary lineage. Phylogenetic analyses have become central to understanding biodiversity, evolution, ecology, and genomes. - In biology, a taxon (plural taxa; back-formation from \\"taxonomy\\") is a group of one or more populations of an organism or organisms seen by taxonomists to form a unit. Although neither is required, a taxon is usually known by a particular name and given a particular ranking, especially if and when it is accepted or becomes established. It is not uncommon, however, for taxonomists to remain at odds over what belongs to a taxon and the criteria used for inclusion. If a taxon is given a formal scientific name, its use is then governed by one of the nomenclature codes specifying which scientific name is correct for a particular grouping. - Ecdysozoa is a group of protostome animals, including Arthropoda (insects, chelicerata, crustaceans, and myriapods), nematoda, and several smaller phyla. They were first defined by Aguinaldo \\"et al.\\" in 1997, based mainly on phylogenetic trees constructed using 18S ribosomal RNA genes. A large study in 2008 by Dunn \\"et al.\\" strongly supported the Ecdysozoa as a clade, that is, a group consisting of a common ancestor and all its descendants. - In biology, a phylum (plural: phyla) is a taxonomic rank below kingdom and above class. Traditionally, in botany the term division was used instead of \\"phylum\\", although from 1993 the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepted the designation \\"phylum\\". Depending on definitions, the kingdom Animalia contains approximately 35 phyla, Plantae contains about 12, and Fungi contains around 7. Current research in phylogenetics is uncovering the relationships between phyla, which are contained in larger clades, like Ecdysozoa and Embryophyta. - Nomenclature codes or codes of nomenclature are the various rulebooks that govern biological taxonomic nomenclature, each in their own broad field of organisms. To an end-user who only deals with names of species, with some awareness that species are assignable to families, it may not be noticeable that there is more than one code, but beyond this basic level these are rather different in the way they work. - In biological classification, subspecies (abbreviated \\"subsp.\\" or \\"ssp.\\"; \\"plural\\": \\"subspecies\\") is either a taxonomic rank subordinate to species, or a taxonomic unit in that rank. A subspecies cannot be recognized independently: a species will either be recognized as having no subspecies at all or at least two (including any that are extinct). - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. What is the relationship between 'taxonomic rank' and 'taxonomy'? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Taxonomic rank and taxonomy are related concepts in the field of biological classification. Taxonomy is the scientific discipline concerned with the identification, naming, and classification of living organisms into distinct groups based on their shared characteristics. Taxonomic rank, on the other hand, refers to the relative level of a group of organisms (a taxon) within the hierarchical structure of the classification system. In taxonomy, various taxonomic ranks are used to categorize organisms, such as species, genus, family, order, class, phylum, and kingdom. Each rank represents a more inclusive and broader grouping than the one below it. For example, a species represents a group of similar individuals, while a genus includes multiple closely related species. As taxa are classified based on their evolutionary relationships, taxonomic ranks help to reflect the degrees of similarity and differences among organisms. In summary, taxonomy is the overall process and system of classifying and organizing living organisms, while taxonomic rank represents the hierarchical levels within that system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize: As soon as you notice a jam beginning to form, stop the shredder to keep things from getting any worse. This gives you a chance to slow down, assess the situation and prepare to fix the jam. Jamming signs to be watchful for include a slowing down of the paper moving through the shredder, an outright stop, and a whirring, \\"straining\\" noise that should be readily obvious. One reason that shredders sometimes jam is that there isn't anywhere for the paper to go once it is shredded because the wastebasket is full. If your wastebasket is full, try emptying it and re-trying which may be enough to resolve your jam. If the jam still won't clear, proceed to the following steps. Because jamming is a common problem, most modern shredders come with a built-in option to run in reverse. Switch the shredder to its \\"reverse\\" option (usually there is a well-marked button on the top of the shredder) before plugging it back in. Ensure your fingers or any other tools are not near the shredder opening when you plug it in. Reversing the shredder will usually clear a minor jam in a matter of seconds. However, in especially bad cases, the shredder may jam again when it runs in reverse. In this case, unplug the shredder again, switch it to \\"auto\\" or \\"forward\\" (the precise option may vary on your shredder) and plug it back in. Be prepared to alternate between auto and reverse as needed. A jam that's bad enough to gum up your shredder when it runs in reverse may be bad enough to jam it yet again when it runs forward for the second time. However, by switching between forward and reverse, it's almost always possible to gradually work your paper out of a jammed shredder. One of the most common reasons for a shredder jam is simply that too much paper was fed into the shredder at once. Once you clear your jam, try shredding a smaller amount of paper if this was the cause for the jam, the smaller second load should pass through with less difficulty. If you still can't seem to get your jam to clear after alternating between reverse and auto/forward, you may have an extra-severe jam that needs to be cleared manually. Never fear, consult the section below for further help.","completion":"The passage provides steps for clearing a paper jam in a shredder. The first signs of a jam might include slowing down of paper movement, an outright stop, or straining noises. The cause of the jam could be an overfilled wastebasket or overfeeding of paper. The initial resolution steps involve stopping the shredding, assessing the situation, emptying the wastebasket if full, and retrying.

Creating a self portrait is not your typical selfie! When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students. Question: How long would the author wait before they had the children do a second self portrait?

Seven-segment displays handle all numbers and a limited set of letters. Starburst displays can display all letters. Dot-matrix displays typically use 5x7 pixels per character. Seven-segment LED displays were in widespread use in the 1970s and 1980s, but rising use of liquid crystal displays, with their lower power needs and greater display flexibility, has reduced the popularity of numeric and alphanumeric LED displays.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Dot-matrix displays utilize tiny pieces that converge to display numbers and letters. Step 1: Understand the context provided From the context, we learn about three types of alphanumeric LED displays: seven-segment, starburst, and dot-matrix. We need to identify the type that uses tiny pieces to display numbers and letters. Step 2: Compare the three types of alphanumeric LED displays - Seven-segment displays can handle numbers and a limited set of letters but do not mention small pieces. - Starburst displays can display all letters, however, don't mention small pieces explicitly. - Dot-matrix displays use 5x7 pixels per character, which implies they have tiny pieces that come together to form the numbers and letters. Step 3: Choose the best fit Dot-matrix displays use many tiny dots, or pixels, to form the display. In this case, they fit the description of using small pieces that converge to create the numbers and letters the best. Therefore, the answer to the question is dot-matrix displays."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Write an article that answers the following question: how many points did marshall gain?","completion":"Title: Decoding Marshall's Points Gain: An In-Depth Analysis Introduction The question \\"How many points did Marshall gain?\\" requires some context to provide an accurate and comprehensive answer. Since Marshall is a fairly common name, we must first identify which Marshall we are discussing: a sports player, a character from a story or TV show, or any other context in which points are involved. In this article, we will explore several scenarios in which a person named Marshall could potentially gain points and provide an in-depth analysis of each situation. Scenario 1: Marshall Faulk, American Football Player Marshall Faulk is a former American football player who played in the NFL as a running back for the Indianapolis Colts and the St. Louis Rams. He is widely regarded as one of the best running backs in the league's history. To determine Faulk's points gain, we would need to review his career statistics and calculate the number of touchdowns he scored. In his career, Faulk had 136 total touchdowns, including 100 rushing, 36 receiving touchdowns, and 2 punt returns. In American football, a touchdown is worth six points. Hence, Marshall Faulk gained a total of 816 points (136 touchdowns x 6). Scenario 2: Marshall Eriksen, Fictional Character from \\"How I Met Your Mother\\" Marshall Eriksen is a fictional character from the popular TV show \\"How I Met Your Mother.\\" Though there isn't a specific \\"points system\\" in the show for the characters, we can examine a pivotal moment in one of the show's episodes where Marshall takes part in a drinking game called \\"Edward Forty-Hands.\\" In this game, a person has two 40-ounce bottles taped to their hands and must finish them to win. While there is no exact points system for this game, we can consider Marshall's gain as a successful completion of the challenge and award him an arbitrary 1 point for his achievement. Scenario 3: Marshall Lee, Character from \\"Adventure Time\\" Marshall Lee is a fictional character from the animated TV show \\"Adventure Time.\\" He is the gender-swapped version of the character Marceline, a vampire queen, and a bass-playing musician. There is no established points system for this character in the series. However, if we were to create a point system for the musical performances of Marshall Lee, we could analyze his singing and playing skills in various episodes and assign points accordingly based on an adopted rating scheme (e.g., quality, style, voice, and melody). For this scenario, we would need to devise a clear evaluation system and review each individual performance to determine his points gain accurately. Conclusion The question \\"How many points did Marshall gain?\\" cannot be answered without proper context. As we explored various scenarios with characters named Marshall, we observed different points systems in each situation. Additionally, several contexts may not have any established point systems, requiring the creation of an evaluation method to determine their points gain. In conclusion, to answer this question accurately and comprehensively, the context surrounding Marshall and the point system must first be identified."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Some of Chopin's well-known pieces have acquired descriptive titles, such as the Revolutionary Étude (Op. 10, No. 12), and the Minute Waltz (Op. 64, No. 1). However, with the exception of his Funeral March, the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others. There is no evidence to suggest that the Revolutionary Étude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind; it merely appeared at that time. The Funeral March, the third movement of his Sonata No. 2 (Op. 35), the one case where he did give a title, was written before the rest of the sonata, but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it.

First question: \\"How do I handle a verbal fight in the work place (it just happened), knowing this person will mark me as an 'enemy' and I will probably meet this person in the same 'work community' later?\\" Second question: How do I know a long distance relationship will work in person? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Choose from: * no. * yes.","completion":"No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. They address different situations and require separate responses. First question: \\"How do I handle a verbal fight in the workplace (it just happened), knowing this person will mark me as an 'enemy' and I will probably meet this person in the same 'work community' later?\\" To handle a verbal fight in the workplace, follow these steps: 1. Find a safe space to cool down: After the argument, it's essential to distance yourself from the person involved and calm your emotions to think objectively about the situation. 2. Reflect on the conflict: Spend some time considering what led to the fight and analyze your emotions, reactions, and the words exchanged. 3. Seek advice from a trusted colleague or mentor: Discuss the situation with someone who understands the dynamics of your workplace and can provide guidance and insight. 4. Apologize if necessary: If you find that you were responsible for the escalation, an apology to the other person involved can go a long way in mending the relationship. 5. Talk to your supervisor or HR: If the conflict affects your ability to work effectively, it's essential to have a discussion with your supervisor or HR to mediate the situation. 6. Develop a plan to improve communication: To prevent future conflicts, take the initiative to establish better communication methods with the person involved and maintain a professional demeanor. 7. Practice active listening: When in meetings or interactions with this person, focus on truly understanding their perspective and ask questions for clarity instead of reacting defensively. 8. Maintain a positive attitude: Try not to let the conflict affect your work or your relationships with other colleagues. Be cooperative and stay focused on your tasks. Second question: \\"How do I know a long distance relationship will work in person?\\" Determining whether a long distance relationship will work in person can be challenging, but you can look for the following signs: 1. Strong communication: If you and your partner have maintained regular, open, and honest communication during your long-distance relationship, it's a good sign that you two can work well in person. 2. Similar values and expectations: Ensure both of you have shared values and expectations regarding your relationship, future goals, and personal boundaries. 3. Trust and support: A strong foundation of trust and willingness to support each other emotionally, and in your individual pursuits, indicate that your relationship may thrive when you're physically together. 4. Conflict resolution skills: Every relationship experiences disagreements, but if you and your partner can resolve conflicts respectfully and constructively even from afar, it bodes well for your relationship in person. 5. Shared vision of the future: Discuss your long-term personal and relationship goals, and make sure you're both on the same page about where you see yourselves in the future. 6. Enjoy each other's company: During your virtual or in-person interactions, pay attention to how much you enjoy spending time with your partner. High levels of positive engagement usually mean that your relationship will continue to be enjoyable when you're together. 7. Plan visits: Schedule in-person visits whenever possible, as spending physical time together will allow you both to get a better sense of how your relationship performs in person. 8. Follow your instincts: Trust your intuition and listen to what your gut is telling you about the relationship. If you feel a strong connection and believe that you can make it work in person, chances are you're right. In conclusion, although these two questions address different situations, they both have underlying themes of communication, trust, and relationship building."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Many animal and plant species have become extinct and many more are in critical danger. Finding ways to protect the earth's wildlife and conserve the natural world they inhabit is now more important than ever. Dodo The Dodo is a classic example of how human caused damage to the earth's biology. The flightless Dodo was native to the Island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. It lived off fruit fallen from the island's trees and lived unthreatened until humans arrived in 1505. The easily controlled bird became a source of food for sailors and was attacked by animals introduced to the island by humans such as pigs, monkeys and rats. The population of Dodos rapidly decreased and last one was killed in 1681. Rhinos The Rhino horn is a highly priced item for Asian medicine. This has led to the animal being hunted in its natural habitat. Once widespread in Africa and Eurasia, most rhinos now live in protected natural parks and reserves .

Additionally, the reviewer recommends an alternative resource, John Larson's \\"Summer for the Gods,\\" as a more evenhanded account, implying that the work by Morris is not balanced or fair in its representation of the subject matter. There are several key elements in the review that indicate its negative tone: 1. The use of the term \\"very slanted\\" in the title suggests a strong bias in the work reviewed, indicating that it does not present a well-rounded, objective view of the topic. 2. The phrase \\"Morris, as ever, twists the facts around to make his case\\" implies that the author has a history of manipulating information to pursue their agenda, which is a negative criticism of their writing and argumentative style. 3.

The comparison of the work to John Larson's \\"Summer for the Gods\\" highlights the reviewer's preference for what they perceive as a more balanced and well-researched alternative. The mention of the Pulitzer Prize-winning status of the alternative work aims to further emphasize the reviewer's dissatisfaction with Morris's work and bolster the credibility of their criticism.

It shares the same 2-oxo-pyrrolidone base structure with pyroglutamic acid. Piracetam is a cyclic derivative of GABA (gamma-Aminobutyric acid). Presently piracetam is used in many European countries, Asia and South America. In the United States, it is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for any medical use and it is not permitted to be sold as a dietary supplement. In the UK, piracetam is prescribed mainly for myoclonus, but is used off-label for other conditions. Evidence to support its use for many conditions is unclear. - Levetiracetam, marketed under the trade name Keppra among others, is a medication used to treat epilepsy. It is used for partial onset, myoclonic, or tonic-clonic seizures. It is the S-enantiomer of etiracetam. - Phenylpiracetam (INN: fonturacetam, brand names Phenotropil, Carphedon), also called is a phenylated analog of the drug piracetam which was developed in 1983 in Russia where it is available as a prescription drug. Research on animals has indicated that phenylpiracetam may have anti-amnesic, antidepressant, anticonvulsant, antipsychotic, anxiolytic, and memory enhancement effects. - Anticonvulsants (also commonly known as antiepileptic drugs or as antiseizure drugs) are a diverse group of pharmacological agents used in the treatment of epileptic seizures. Anticonvulsants are also increasingly being used in the treatment of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder, since many seem to act as mood stabilizers, and for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Anticonvulsants suppress the rapid and excessive firing of neurons during seizures. Anticonvulsants also prevent the spread of the seizure within the brain. Some investigators have observed that anticonvulsants themselves may cause reduced IQ in children. However these adverse effects must be balanced against the significant risk epileptic seizures pose to children and the distinct possibility of death and devastating neurological sequelae secondary to seizures. Anticonvulsants are more accurately called antiepileptic drugs (abbreviated \\"AEDs\\"), and are often referred to as antiseizure drugs because they provide symptomatic treatment only and have not been demonstrated to alter the course of epilepsy. - Etiracetam is a chemical compound belonging to the racetam family, which was developed as a nootropic drug. It is racemic; its biologically active enantiomeric form is levetiracetam, now marketed as an antiepileptic drug. - Stimulants (also referred to as psychostimulants) is an overarching term that covers many drugs including those that increase activity of the body, drugs that are pleasurable and invigorating, or drugs that have sympathomimetic effects. Due to their rendering a characteristic \\"up\\" feeling, stimulants are also occasionally referred to as \\"uppers\\". Depressants or \\"downers\\", which decrease mental and/or physical function, are in stark contrast to stimulants and are considered to be the functionally opposite drug class. Stimulants are widely used throughout the world as prescription medicines as well as without a prescription (either legally or illicitly) as performance-enhancing or recreational drugs. The most frequently prescribed stimulants as of 2013 were lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, and amphetamine. It is estimated that the percent of the population that has abused amphetamines, cocaine and MDMA combined is between .8% and 2.1%. - Motivation is a theoretical construct used to explain behaviour. It gives the reasons for people's actions, desires, and needs. Motivation can also be defined as one's direction to behavior, or what causes a person to want to repeat a behavior and vice versa. A motive is what prompts the person to act in a certain way, or at least develop an inclination for specific behavior. According to Maehr and Meyer, \\"Motivation is a word that is part of the popular culture as few other psychological concepts are.\\" - Nootropicsalso called smart drugs or cognitive enhancersare drugs, supplements, or other substances that improve cognitive function, particularly executive functions, memory, creativity, or motivation, in healthy individuals. The use of cognition-enhancing drugs by healthy individuals in the absence of a medical indication is one of the most debated topics among neuroscientists, psychiatrists, and physicians which spans a number of issues, including the ethics and fairness of their use, concerns over adverse effects, and the diversion of prescription drugs for nonmedical uses, among others. Nonetheless, the international sales of cognition-enhancing supplements exceeded billion in 2015 and the global demand for these compounds is still growing rapidly. - In medicine, an adverse effect is an undesired harmful effect resulting from a medication or other intervention such as surgery. - Epilepsy is a group of neurological diseases characterized by epileptic seizures. Epileptic seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable to long periods of vigorous shaking. These episodes can result in physical injuries including occasionally broken bones. In epilepsy, seizures tend to recur, and have no immediate underlying cause. Isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy. People with epilepsy in some areas of the world experience stigma due to the condition. The cause of most cases of epilepsy is unknown, although some people develop epilepsy as the result of brain injury, stroke, brain tumors, infections of the brain, and birth defects. Known genetic mutations are directly linked to a small proportion of cases. Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal nerve cell activity in the cortex of the brain. The diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms such as fainting and determining if another cause of seizures is present such as alcohol withdrawal or electrolyte problems. This may be partly done by imaging the brain and performing blood tests. Epilepsy can often be confirmed with an electroencephalogram (EEG), but a normal test does not rule out the condition. Epilepsy that occurs as a result of other issues may be preventable. Seizures are controllable with medication in about 70% of cases. Inexpensive options are often available. In those whose seizures do not respond to medication, then surgery, neurostimulation, or dietary changes may be considered. Not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong, and many people improve to the point that treatment is no longer needed. As of 2013 about 22 million people have epilepsy. Nearly 80% of cases occur in the developing world. In 2013 it resulted in 116,000 deaths up from 112,000 deaths in 1990. Epilepsy is more common in older people. In the developed world, onset of new cases occurs most frequently in babies and the... - A drug is any substance (other than food that provides nutritional support) that, when inhaled, injected, smoked, consumed, absorbed via a patch on the skin, or dissolved under the tongue, causes a physiological change in the body. - Oxiracetam (ISF 2522) is a nootropic drug of the racetam family and very mild stimulant. Several studies suggest that the substance is safe even when high doses are consumed for a long period of time. However, the mechanism of action of the racetam drug family is still a matter of research. Oxiracetam is not approved by Food and Drug Administration for any medical use in the United States. - Executive functions (collectively referred to as executive function and cognitive control) are a set of cognitive processes including attentional control, inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility, as well as reasoning, problem solving, and planning that are necessary for the cognitive control of behavior: selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that facilitate the attainment of chosen goals. Executive functions gradually develop and change across the lifespan of an individual and can be improved at any time over the course of a person's life. Similarly, these cognitive processes can be adversely affected by a variety of events which affect an individual. Neuropsychological tests are used to measure executive functions, and are usually performed as part of a more comprehensive assessment to diagnose neurological and psychiatric disorders. - Racetams are a class of drugs that share a pyrrolidone nucleus. Some, such as piracetam, are considered nootropics. Some such as oxiracetam and phenylpiracetam are also stimulants. Others such as levetiracetam and seletracetam are anticonvulsants. - Etiracetam is a nootropic drug of the racetam family . It is racemic ; its biologically active enantiomeric form is levetiracetam . - Seletracetam (UCB 44212) is a pyrrolidone-derived drug of the racetam family that is structurally related to levetiracetam (trade name Keppra). It was under development by UCB Pharmaceuticals as a more potent and effective anticonvulsant drug to replace levetiracetam but its production has been halted. - In chemistry, an enantiomer, also known as an optical isomer, is one of two stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other that are non-superposable (not identical), much as one's left and right hands are the same except for being reversed along one axis (the hands cannot be made to appear identical simply by reorientation). Organic compounds that contain a chiral carbon atom usually have two non-superposable structures. These two structures are mirror images of each other and are, thus, commonly called enantiomorphs (\\"enantio\\" = opposite ; \\"morph\\" = form), hence this structural property is now commonly referred to as enantiomerism.

It was the biggest known botched attack in eight years of fighting the group. The Nigerian army says it is engaged in a \\"final push\\" against the Islamists. Commanders have apologised for the \\"accidental\\" bombing, which they said was because of \\"the fog of war\\". Human Rights Watch said this did not absolve them of responsibility, and called for compensation for the victims. A local government official from the area, Babagana Malarima, said a mistake had been made when it was earlier reported that the number of those killed had risen to 236. The error had been made by those in the camp settlement who had added the number of dead to the number of injured to come up with the figure, he told the BBC. In the immediate aftermath of the attack last Tuesday, the medical charity MSF said 52 people had died. The wounded were treated in an MSF tented clinic as there are no hospitals in Rann, where displaced people are living in makeshift shelters. An aid worker told the BBC that the attack, in which at least two bombs were dropped, caused terror and chaos at the camp. He said he saw dead children lying on the ground, others left as orphans and terrible injuries among survivors. Aid workers estimated 20,000-40,000 people had been sheltering in Rann, near the border with Cameroon, after fleeing attacks by Boko Haram. The emergency services official, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, said all those who had died at Rann had now been buried. Those critically injured were still receiving treatment in the state capital, Maiduguri, while others were being treated locally by international aid agencies and local services. The Red Cross has said it has distributed food to more than 25,000 people in Rann since Saturday. It said they had received enough rice, beans, oil, salt and corn soya blend to last for five weeks. \\"People in Rann were happy to receive food.

Write a text based on this summary: study links late cancer diagnosis with lack of insurance Text:","completion":"Title: Uninsured Individuals at Greater Risk for Late Cancer Diagnosis, Study Finds A recent study has revealed a concerning correlation between the lack of insurance and late cancer diagnosis, highlighting the importance of accessible healthcare for early detection and treatment. According to the study published in [name of journal], researchers found that individuals without insurance are more likely to be diagnosed with cancer at an advanced stage, compared to those who are insured. This concerning finding underscores the critical role health insurance plays in enabling timely cancer screening and detection. The study analyzed data from thousands of patients with various types of cancer, including breast, lung, and colorectal cancer, among others. Through meticulous examination, researchers were able to identify a clear trend: patients without insurance were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with cancer at a later stage, thus reducing their chances of successful treatment and survival. There are several reasons for this unfortunate correlation. Uninsured individuals often experience financial barriers that prevent them from accessing routine healthcare, which may include crucial cancer screening and early detection tests. Additionally, the lack of insurance may cause individuals to delay seeking medical attention for symptoms until they become severe, further complicating the chances for timely diagnosis and treatment. The findings of this study emphasize the importance of addressing the issue of unequal healthcare access and encouraging the implementation of affordable insurance options. Ensuring that everyone has access to early cancer screening and detection services can greatly reduce the number of late-stage cancer diagnoses and ultimately improve overall survival rates. In conclusion, the study linking late cancer diagnosis to the lack of insurance highlights the urgent need for accessible and affordable healthcare options for all individuals. Ensuring that everyone has the necessary insurance coverage to access vital cancer screening and early detection services can make a significant difference in timely diagnosis, effective treatment, and overall cancer survival rates."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Disabling a car alarm can be a temporary fix before seeking professional auto assistance. However, keep in mind, car alarms are meant to be anti-theft, and when tampered with, some systems prevent a vehicle from starting as a security measure. Alarm systems consist of a few components. Control unit. This part is often referred to as the brain because it functions as the command center for the system. Alarm transmitter. This comes in two forms: key-chain remote or the key. Sensors. Alarms vary and can get complex with various sensors such as pressure, door, or window sensors. Siren. Alarms need some type of warning signal; some systems have their own siren component while others are wired to car stereo. Wires. Wires connect the siren to the control unit, the control unit to the fuses, and the control unit to the sensors. Open up the hood and locate the battery. Using a socket wrench, unscrew the negative terminal (-) of the battery and pull it off. This is a safety measure; messing around with a vehicle's electronics can be dangerous. If you have a factory car alarm, check in your owner’s manual as a guide. The alarm system is usually under the hood near the steering wheel. If you have an after-market car alarm, it may be installed in any part of the car, but companies usually install them under the steering wheel. Some alarm control units have labels for each wire. Removing the wires attached to the control unit and removing the wires attached to the siren are two ways to disable and silence your alarm. Pull the wire of the siren. This will silence the alarm and might be a good temporary fix before seeking professional assistance. Remove the control unit. If you pull out the brain, there will be no alarm in the car. However, depending on the way your car alarm was set up, this might disable your vehicle from starting. After you pull a wire, plug the battery back in to make sure the alarm isn't going off again. Turn on your car and give the engine a rev.

Mary Youngblood plays a type of flute that is held in front of the player, and has what type of finger holes? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Mary Youngblood is renowned for her skills in playing the Native American Flute, which like many traditional and ethnic flutes, is held in front of the player. This type of flute is a woodwind instrument and is embedded within the cultural and spiritual traditions of Native American tribes. The Native American flute typically has finger holes that are open and essentially free of keys or pads which are commonly found on flutes like the Western concert flute. The specific number of the finger holes can vary depending on the particular design of the flute, but in general, they typically have either five or six finger holes. Most traditionally, a six-hole Native American Flute would have five holes arranged in a line and a sixth hole under the first for the thumb or positioned slightly off from the line of the first five. The instrument can create different pitches based on covering different combinations of the finger holes while playing. Unlike modern flutes which have a system of keys to cover the holes, Native American flutes require the musician's fingers to cover the holes directly. It's part of what gives the flute its distinct, hauntingly beautiful sound, as the musician can subtly alter the pitch and tone depending on the exact placement and pressure of their fingers on every hole. To answer your question directly, Mary Youngblood plays a type of flute (the Native American Flute) that is held in front of the player and has open finger holes.

Gay returns home from the office to find the beautiful Helen Reed (Wendy Barrie) waiting to see him. Helen is the secretary of Wood and on her employer's behalf invites The Falcon to the same party Elinor wanted him to go to. She goes on to explain that some of Wood's parties have been plagued by jewel thefts and Maxine is particularly concerned about a diamond owned by Mrs Vera Gardner (Lucile Gleason) one of the guests. Unable to resist Gay accompanies Elinor to the party while instructing Goldie to infiltrate the event too.However, Elinor becomes angry when she realises why Gay changed his mind about attending the party and retaliates by dancing with one of the other guests Manuel Retana (Turhan Bey).

Unfortunately, when the police arrive Detectives Bates (Edward Brophy) and Grimes (Eddie Dunn) arrest Goldie as a material witness as he was the only person in the room where Mrs Gardner was killed. Gay follows Goldie to the police station where he speaks to Inspector Mike Waldeck (Arthur Shields)...","completion":"Based on the movie plot of The Gay Falcon, Gay Laurence (The Falcon) suspects that Gardner arranged to have her diamonds \\"stolen\\" because of her unusual behavior during the party. When Gardner dances with Gay, she secretly hands him her diamond, an action that puzzles Gay greatly. This act might suggest that Mrs. Gardner is planning an insurance scam by passing her valuable diamonds to Gay, then potentially staging their theft in order to make an insurance claim. There is also a connection to the larger insurance scam plot, where some of Maxine Wood's parties have been plagued by jewel thefts. Considering the premise of the film revolves around stopping crooks from running an insurance scam, it is reasonable to suspect that Gardner was involved. Additionally, Mrs. Gardner's sudden death adds suspicion to the overall situation, making it more likely that she was part of the criminal plot or had knowledge of it, leading to her murder.

Scientists count about 50 hot spots on the Earth. Hot spots may be in the middle of a tectonic plate. Hot spots lie directly above a column of hot rock called a mantle plume . Mantle plumes continuously bring magma up from the mantle towards the crust ( Figure below ). Q: What substance comes toward earth's crust through mantle plumes? Choices: - rocks - water - gas - magma A: The answer is:","completion":"magma. Magma is the substance that comes towards the Earth's crust through mantle plumes. To understand this process, it's essential to dive into the concepts of mantle plumes, hot spots, and volcanoes. Mantle plumes are columns of hot, partially molten rock that rise from deep within the Earth's mantle. They can extend for hundreds or even thousands of kilometers and are thought to originate near the boundary between the Earth's core and the mantle. Mantle plumes are thought to be the source of \\"hot spots,\\" which are regions of increased volcanic activity. Hot spots, as mentioned in the paragraph, are found across the Earth's surface and can occur in the middle of a tectonic plate or along the boundaries between plates. There are approximately 50 hot spots identified around the world, and they are regions where mantle plumes are gradually providing magma to the layer just below the Earth's surface. This increased volcanic activity is often accompanied by the formation of volcanoes. Volcanoes are landforms that form as a result of volcanic processes, such as the movement of magma through the Earth's crust and subsequent eruptions. These eruptions release hot gases, ash, and molten rock called lava. Magma, the molten rock material originating from deep below the Earth's surface, serves as the primary substance moving through mantle plumes toward the Earth's crust. Mantle plumes play a crucial role in providing continuous magma from the mantle towards the Earth's crust. This supply of magma enables the formation of volcanoes and the generation of volcanic hot spots, making these geological processes interconnected."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Good Mental Health Away From Home Starts Before College When Eliza Lanzillo went off to college, she was excited to leave behind her old school, her old routines—and her old mental health challenges. “I thought of it as a clean slate. Nobody knows my history. I could be a new person,” says the now 21-year-old junior at Brown University. “I didn’t want people to see me as the girl with anorexia.” Ms. Lanzillo started struggling with the eating disorder and anxiety in high school. She had been doing so well the summer before college that she stopped therapy when she arrived for college in Providence, R.I. But a few months into her first semester, she relapsed. With high school seniors now deciding where they’ll be attending college in the fall, now is the time, psychologists and psychiatrists say, for teens and their parents to focus on how to maintain good mental health away from home. This is particularly vital for the growing number of teenagers who have already struggled with mental illness in high school. About 14.3% of college students were diagnosed with or treated for anxiety problems during the past year, and 12% were diagnosed with or treated for depression, according to a spring 2014 survey of 79,266 college students by the American College Health Association. That is up from 10.4% for anxiety and 10.2% for depression in the fall 2008 survey. Anxiety and depression are the most common disorders, according to the survey. Why mental illness seems to be rising among college students is unclear. Better medications and therapies are likely making it possible for more young adults with even serious mental disorders to attend college. The growing number of outreach programs by colleges is likely bringing more young adults into treatment. Advocacy groups like Active Minds Inc., a nonprofit with chapters on 428 campuses, are trying to reduce the stigma around having a mental illness. But many students arrive unprepared, experts say. “What happens is everyone is under the impression that at the end of high school, magically college will be different,” says Anne Marie Albano, director of the Columbia University Clinic for Anxiety and Related Disorders in New York. “That once she or he gets away from the same old routine and the same old peers that never connected with him, and the teachers who were mean, it is going to be different. And it isn’t.” Indeed, in a study published in JAMA Psychiatry in 2014 that followed 288 adolescents and young adults with anxiety disorders, nearly half relapsed within six years of treatment. Late adolescence is also when more serious illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder often kick in. Living away from home for the first time, making new friends and handling the rigors of college coursework can all make the transition to college difficult—especially when those are added on top of an existing mental illness. “Even good change is stressful,” says Micky M. Sharma, a clinical psychologist and the director of the Office of Student Life Counseling and Consultation Service at Ohio State University. He says traffic in the counseling center surges in mid-October, around the time of the first midterm exams. Psychologists and psychiatrists say it is critical for students to become as independent as possible during the months before school starts. Parents are on the hook, too. Now is the time for them to learn to let go. They should move from doing things for teens to taking on the role of adviser or coach, experts say. That includes formulating strategies and weighing solutions to problems with children and—after they make attempts at independence—reviewing how things went. This often means parents must confront their own anxieties about their children failing. Ideally, parents should be practicing letting go all along and not waiting until just before college starts. Concerned adults should try to avoid becoming what Dr. Sharma calls snowplow parents: those who remain too involved at college. “They will just come in and knock me out of the way to make sure their son or daughter gets what they need. Just because you can text your son and daughter 10 times a day doesn’t mean that should be happening.” Dr. Albano at Columbia runs a six-to-eight-week college readiness program for high school seniors with anxiety disorders and depression. During “exposure” group sessions, teenagers role-play to practice talking to professors and meeting new people—and learn to deal with negative or anxious thoughts that arise. Dr. Albano has Columbia colleagues act the part of skeptical professors. The teens practice asking for help or extensions on assignments. Students are also sent to cafeterias at local universities to practice getting food and approaching groups of peers. Then, in periodic transition sessions, parents and teens meet together. The goal is to help parents ease up on any overprotection. Often, parents of children who have struggled with mental illness have responded by doing more and more things for them. Then the children “start falling behind their peers in developmental tasks,” Dr. Albano says. Dr. Albano has compiled a list of young adult milestones that include managing money responsibly and establishing emotional independence from parents as part of the overall program dubbed LEAP (for Launching Emerging Adults Program). Parents and teens fill out what she calls scaffolding forms that detail which life tasks the teens can do independently, which they can’t and which are in the gray zone—ones they sometimes do on their own, sometimes not. The families work on moving tasks from the dependent zone to the independent one. Dr. Albano says college-bound students should go to yearly physicals by themselves. They should also take at least one out-of-town trip alone, including making travel reservations and getting to the train or plane by themselves. “If you end up on a train going to Boston instead of Baltimore, all the better,” Dr. Albano says. “They learn it is not a catastrophe to make mistakes.” Students arriving on campus also need to make sure they can handle taking their medication and getting refills on their own. Louis Kraus, chief of child psychiatry at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, suggests students get a seven-day pill pack and set a daily alarm on their smartphones to help remember medication. Dr. Kraus has frank discussions about drinking with students on stimulants and benzodiazepines, drugs that can be deadly when combined with alcohol. If teens are stable, they may be able to continue working with their home psychologist or psychiatrist via phone or Skype sessions, Dr. Kraus says. But establishing a relationship with a doctor near campus is critical if there’s a risk of a relapse or medication changes. While college counseling centers often offer emergency sessions, waits to initiate regular therapy appointments can be several weeks long. Many centers have caps on the number of sessions students can have. About ¼ of colleges have no access to psychiatrists except as a private referral, according to a 2013 survey by the Association for University and College Counseling Center Directors. Still, these problems are solvable. Ms. Lanzillo, the Brown student, found her equilibrium after finding treatment near campus. The transition also proved tricky for Josh Ratner, a 21-year-old junior at the University of Maryland in College Park. He says not having some basic life skills made his move to college much more stressful. “A lot of parents don’t realize they’re babying their kids. When you have mental health issues, the really simple things become intimidating.” Mr. Ratner, who struggles with ADHD and anxiety but says he is now doing well, recalls a time when his car broke down at school. “I didn’t know what tire I needed, what service station to go to,” he says. “I spent a whole day missing classes on the phone with my Dad.” Write to Andrea Petersen at Andrea.Petersen@wsj.com What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The most important parts of this news article focus on the significance of preparing for good mental health when transitioning from high school to college, especially for those who have experienced mental illness in high school. Anxiety and depression are rising among college students, with 14.3% and 12% of them being diagnosed or treated for these disorders in the past year, respectively. Maintaining good mental health away from home requires preparation to ensure independence and adaptability to new environments and challenges. Experts suggest that both students and their parents need to concentrate on fostering independence in the months preceding college. Parents should act more as advisers or coaches, helping their children strategize, consider solutions, and learn from their attempts at independence. Parents must also learn to let go and avoid becoming overly involved when their children start college. To help students build independence, mental health professionals recommend the practice of role-playing, exposure to group sessions, and gradually transferring dependent tasks to independent ones in the months leading up to college. Additionally, students should learn to manage their medications and establish a relationship with a doctor near campus in case of a relapse or medication change.

Rex Ryan and his fraternal twin, Rob, were born in Ardmore, Oklahoma, on December 13, 1962, to Doris and Buddy Ryan. When the boys were aged two, their parents amicably divorced. Following the divorce, their mother attended the University of Chicago to earn her doctorate. Rex, Rob, and their older brother Jim moved with her to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where she secured an administrative position at the University of Toronto. The Bills opened the 2015 season with a 27-14 win over the Indianapolis Colts. Frustrated by the Bills leading the NFL in penalties heading into their Week 5 game against the Tennessee Titans, Ryan gave the entire team wristbands with the message \\"Yes sir\\". These were the only words he wanted his players to use with officials if they were flagged. After being flagged 17 times in Week 4 loss against the New York Giants, the Bills were penalized only seven times in their 14-13 victory over the Titans. The Bills entered their bye week with a 3-4 record after losing in London to the Jacksonville Jaguars. Ryan gave the whole team the week off during the bye, and he himself found a secluded beach to \\"get away and focus\\". The Bills came out of their bye week and defeated the Miami Dolphins by a score of 3-17, improving their season record to 4-4. Ryan is now 2-5 all time following a bye week. Ryan returned to MetLife Stadium in Week 10 for a much anticipated Thursday Night Football game against the Jets. The Bills won the game by a score of 22-17, and improved to 5-4 on the season. Ryan faced questions before and after the game about his decision to name IK Enemkpali, who had been released by the Jets in preseason after breaking quarterback Geno Smith's jaw in an altercation, as Buffalo's captain for the game. The Bills were unable to make the playoffs in their first season with Ryan as coach, as they were eliminated in Week 15 with a 35-25 loss to the Washington Redskins on December 20, extending their drought to 16 seasons, the NFL's longest active drought. They finished the season with an 8-8 record. Entity:","completion":"Rex Ryan"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:What is the final step of the following process: - Plants and animals long ago died - They are buried under layers of soil - Pressure builds over time - The remains liquefy A:","completion":"The final step of the process you described is the formation of fossil fuels. Once plants and animals have died and become buried under layers of soil, with pressure building over time and causing their remains to liquefy, they eventually transform into valuable sources of energy known as fossil fuels. This transformation occurs through a series of biological, chemical, and geological processes that take millions of years to complete. Fossil fuels include coal, petroleum (oil), and natural gas. These fuels are primarily composed of carbon and hydrogen, and they are used worldwide to produce electricity, generate heat, and provide transportation. The specific type of fossil fuel formed depends on the composition of the original organic material, the environmental conditions during its decomposition, and the amount of heat and pressure exerted on the remains. The formation of coal, for example, generally begins with the accumulation of plant material in swampy environments. The plant material, which is rich in carbon, undergoes various chemical and biological processes, eventually forming peat. As peat becomes buried under more sediment, it experiences increasing temperature and pressure, triggering a series of changes eventually leading to the formation of coal. Petroleum and natural gas, on the other hand, primarily form from the remains of small marine organisms, such as plankton and algae. These organisms accumulate on the seafloor and become buried in sediment over millions of years. They undergo a series of chemical transformations under the influence of heat and pressure, eventually forming a complex mixture of hydrocarbons known as kerogen. Depending on factors such as temperature, pressure, and the type of kerogen, it can eventually transform into petroleum or natural gas. Once fossil fuels are formed, they accumulate within porous rock layers beneath the Earth's surface, often trapped by impermeable layers that prevent them from escaping. They can then be extracted through various methods, such as mining for coal and drilling for oil and natural gas. Tapping into these rich sources of energy has played a crucial role in the development of modern society, though the burning of fossil fuels has also raised serious environmental concerns, including increased greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Consequently, the search for cleaner and renewable energy sources is of utmost importance for the future sustainability of our planet."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The phrase \\"The River Urechioiu is a tributary of the Sitna River in Romania\\" and \\"The Urechioiu River is a tributary of the Sitna River in Romania\\" essentially convey the same meaning. In both sentences, the Urechioiu River is identified as a tributary of the Sitna River in Romania. The only difference between the two sentences is the order of the words \\"River\\" and \\"Urechioiu.\\" In the first sentence, \\"River\\" comes before the name, while in the second sentence, \\"River\\" follows the name. Despite the slight difference in wording, both sentences present the same information, confirming that the Urechioiu River is a tributary of the Sitna River. The term \\"tributary\\" refers to a smaller river or stream that flows into a larger river or body of water. In this context, the Urechioiu River flows into the Sitna River, which is common knowledge established in both sentences. In addition, both sentences specify that these rivers are located in Romania, which again confirms that they share the same meaning. Furthermore, it is not uncommon to see slight variations in the way river names are mentioned in different texts or references. People from different regions might use different conventions to name rivers – some might place the word \\"River\\" before the name, while others might place it after. In such instances, the key aspect to understand is the relationship between the rivers, which is clearly mentioned as a tributary association in both sentences. In conclusion, both statements convey the same meaning with a subtle difference in wording. The Urechioiu River is unmistakably identified as a tributary of the Sitna River in Romania, regardless of how the name structure is presented in either sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Insiders say Rivers’ absence has shaken up the crew and paved the way for a massive power struggle among the co-hosts. “Joan kept everyone together,” a source tells Confidenti@l, “When she was there, none of this was happening: They all loved her and looked up to her, but it’s all been a power play since she’s been gone.” “Giuliana thinks she’s the star of the show now that it’s not Joan,” explained the source, adding, “ Kelly (Osbourne)’s unhappy and there’s all this money up for grabs,” referring to Rivers’ salary. A second source says that Osbourne and Rivers’ replacement, Kathy Griffin, even got into a shouting match over the late comic’s legacy at E!’s red-carpet review. “Kelly had a blowout fight with Kathy when she started the show,” the second “Fashion Police” insider tells us. “There were words, because Kelly talks about Joan constantly — which is OK; we all love Joan, and Melissa (Rivers, Joan’s daughter and executive producer of the show) talks about her openly — but (Osbourne would) imply Kathy wasn’t Joan.” “Kathy is there to do a job,” added the source. “She doesn’t want to fight with Kelly.” The first source says that when Osbourne threatened on Twitter to quit over Rancic’s remark that Coleman — who wore dreadlocks on the Oscars red carpet — looked like she “smells of weed,” it would not have come as a shock to the producers. “Kelly’s had an attitude,” said the source, “She’s kind of over it.” “She wants more money, but it’s not really about the money for her,” the source added. “She comes to work and everyone’s like, Is she going to leave? What is she going to do? They do think she may leave.” “Giuliana has been stepping it up and being more aggressive after Joan,” said the source, “She felt like she should have more say-so in producing (the show) than she’s given.” “Giuliana feels like she brings a lot to the show,” added the source, “and not only should she be paid more but she should be featured more on the show.” On Thursday, Rancic dragged out the controversy further, throwing a writer for the show under the bus. She told AccessHollywood.com it was a staffer, not her, who came up with the offending joke. The entertainment news site reported that nobody, including Melissa Rivers, flagged it as racist.

Many people still remember when they were young, they often played games like hide-and-seek and chess. Playing teaches children how to get along with others, and it also helps to exercise the mind and body. However, children today spent most of their playing time in front of the computer, playing video games. A recent survey found that in the US children between 8 and 12 spent at least 13 hours a week playing video games or \\"gaming\\". Boys of this age spend even more time, almost 16 hours a week. Although some people will say that gaming is helpful, it brings many problems as well. One big problem is that kids who spend most of their time on games might have difficulty communicating with real people. They might have trouble sharing and resolving problems because they do not practice these shills when sitting alone at a computer. Another problem is about health. Game players usually sit for hours without doing any exercise. And they might not eat healthily. As a result, they might be out of shape. Next, game players might have trouble with their lessons. Many of them spend more time playing games than working on their homework. In the end, _ . Finally, it is always possible that the gamers become addicted .

What is current scenario of world? What would the current scenario be if there was no World War? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Pick your answer from: (i) no. (ii) yes.","completion":"(i) no. The current scenario of the world is a complex interplay of numerous factors, including political, technological, environmental, social, and economic aspects. It is characterized by rapid advancements in technology, increasing globalization, and the ongoing challenges of climate change. The COVID-19 pandemic has also played a significant role in shaping the present landscape, with far-reaching impacts on public health, economies, and social dynamics. With respect to the political scenario, various countries are engaging in negotiations and diplomacy to address global issues, such as climate change and trade. On the other hand, tensions between nations remain, particularly in the case of the United States and China, which have conflicts over trade practices, intellectual property, and regional dominance. In terms of technology, artificial intelligence, automation, and digitalization continue to disrupt traditional industries while creating new opportunities for innovation and growth. The rapid advancement of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, is helping decrease dependence on fossil fuels and combat climate change. Environmentally, the world is grappling with the increasing urgency to address climate change and its associated challenges. The Paris Agreement, signed by 196 countries, aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, but implementing effective climate policies remains a challenge. Socially, the world is more interconnected than ever before, thanks to advancements in communication and transportation technology. However, these connections have also revealed stark differences in wealth and access to resources between countries, leading to persistent global inequality. Economically, many countries are continuing to recover from the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a significant impact on global financial markets, employment rates, and supply chains. Governments around the world have implemented various stimulus measures to support their economies, with varying degrees of success. Now, let's consider the second question. If there had been no World War, the current scenario would potentially look quite different. It is worth noting that discussing hypothetical events is inherently speculative, but there are some aspects we can explore. Without the World Wars, specifically World War II, it is highly doubtful that we would have experienced the rapid technological advancements that emerged during and after those conflicts. The wars accelerated research and development in fields such as aviation, telecommunications, and nuclear energy. The geopolitical landscape would also likely be significantly altered, with European colonial empires possibly remaining intact for a longer period or undergoing different trajectories of decolonization. Additionally, the political ideology might have evolved very differently. The end of World War II set the stage for the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was characterized by a battle of opposing ideologies: capitalism and communism, respectively. Without the World Wars, this rivalry could have taken on a different form, or possibly other ideologies may have emerged as dominant forces. Lastly, the formation of international organizations such as the United Nations and the European Union could have been affected. These entities were established, in part, as a response to the devastation caused by the World Wars, and their absence might have influenced the nature and significance of global cooperation today. To sum up, the current scenario of the world is defined by multifaceted interactions among political, technological, environmental, social, and economic factors. If there were no World Wars, key elements of today's world could be altered, including political dynamics, globalization, and technological innovations. The two questions posed are not paraphrases of each other, as they address two distinct inquiries: one asks about the present circumstances, while the other explores a hypothetical alternate history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Answer the above question based on the context below: \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" is a song recorded by Barbadian singer Rihanna for her third studio album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007). It was released worldwide on September 7, 2007, as the fourth single of the album. The song was written by Tawanna Dabney and its producers StarGate; Michael Jackson also received a songwriting credit for the sampling of the line \\"Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa\\" from Jackson's 1983 single \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\".

Article:Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide, NatWest, Santander and Virgin Money have confirmed they will offer the savings product. It is aimed at helping first-time buyers save for a deposit and includes a government top-up. The industry has said the scheme should run alongside building more homes. First-time buyers purchasing an owner-occupied home worth up to £250,000, or £450,000 in London, will be eligible for a Help to Buy Isa when it launches on 1 December. The monthly maximum contribution from savers into a Help to Buy Isa will be £200, following an initial deposit of up to £1,000, with the government adding £50 a month at the most. The accounts will run indefinitely once opened. But if someone accumulates £12,000 over that time, a maximum of £3,000 will be added by the taxpayer. Recent figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that a typical first-time buyer faces paying 5.1% more for a property than they did a year ago. The average price paid for a starter home in May was £211,000. Data from the Council of Mortgage Lenders showed that the typical first-time buyer needed a deposit of 18.6% in May.

L'utilisation de munitions pendant un conflit armé doit prendre en considération tous les principes du droit international humanitaire, que les munitions puissent ou non devenir des restes explosifs de guerre. Translate to English","completion":"The use of ammunition during an armed conflict must take into consideration all the principles of international humanitarian law, regardless of whether the ammunition may or may not become explosive remnants of war. The employment of ammunition in an armed conflict should adhere to all principles outlined under international humanitarian law, irrespective of the possibility of the ammunition turning into explosive remnants of war. In essence, using munitions in a conflict zone necessitates thorough observance of international guidelines dedicated to minimizing harm to civilians, combatants no longer taking an active part in hostilities, and the environment. International humanitarian law (IHL) established these principles to ensure that armed conflicts are conducted in a manner that reduces unnecessary suffering and collateral damage. The four central tenets of IHL include distinction, proportionality, military necessity, and humanity. 1. Distinction: This principle asserts the differentiation between combatants and non-combatants (civilians). Parties involved in conflict must ensure that any attack is directed solely at military objectives and combatants, while sparing civilians and non-military objects. 2. Proportionality: The requirement of proportionality means that any attack must not cause harm that is excessive in relation to the anticipated military advantage. It aims to prevent the use of munitions that would lead to excessive civilian casualties or extensive destruction of civilian property. 3. Military Necessity: This principle obliges armed forces to minimize destruction, violence, and the use of overwhelming force, focusing solely on what is needed to achieve a military objective. The use of munitions should be limited to ensuring the swift and decisive victory of the conflict with minimal harm and damage to all parties involved. 4. Humanity: Also referred to as the principle of unnecessary suffering, it prohibits utilizing munitions that may inflict excessive suffering or injury to combatants or spread uncontrollable harm to the environment. The use of certain types of weapons, such as chemical or biological weapons, is strictly prohibited under this principle. When employing ammunition in a conflict context, it is crucial that parties also take into consideration the possible lasting consequences in the form of explosive remnants of war. These unexploded ordnances pose severe threats to civilian populations, hinder socio-economic development, and obstruct post-conflict reconstruction efforts. In conclusion, the use of ammunition during armed conflicts demands strict adherence to international humanitarian law principles. This approach ensures that all parties involved in the conflict strive to reduce any potential harm to civilians, the environment, and combatants no longer taking an active part in hostilities. Additionally, considering the impacts of explosive remnants of war is vital in order to mitigate lasting repercussions on affected communities and environments."},{"prompt":"Read the bio below and try to give details on dennis hargrove cooke 's: - death place - title - caption - successor - death date - predecessor - term end - term start - birth date - name - image - birth place Bio: dennis hargrove cooke -lrb- february 23 , 1904 -- march 1982 -rrb- was the fourth president of what is now east carolina university . he was born on february 23 , 1904 in maiden , north carolina . dr. cooke received the a.b. degree from duke university in 1925 . he also earned an m.a. degree from duke in 1928 . he was a teaching fellow at duke university in 1928-29 , and a teaching fellow at peabody college in 1929-30 . he then received a doctorate in 1930 from peabody college . before becoming president , cooke served as an elementary school principal , high school principal , associate professor , and chairman of the department of educational administration . cooke assumed his duties at east carolina teachers college on august 1 , 1946 and announced his resignation in may 1947 .

Tom and Kate receive an e-mail from the kidnappers demanding 2,000,000. Tom calls the FBI, who begin operating from his New York City penthouse under Special Agent Lonnie Hawkins. In private, Tom voices his belief that a union machinist, Jackie Brown, who is in prison following one of Mullen's business scandals, may have been behind it. They visit Brown in prison, but he angrily denies any involvement with the kidnapping. Tom agrees to the FBI's instructions for delivering the ransom. Receiving a phone call from Shaker, who is electronically disguising his voice, Tom follows his instructions. He meets Cubby in a New Jersey quarry but refuses to hand the money over when Cubby fails to give him the directions Shaker had promised him. A fight ensues and the FBI intervene and shoot Cubby. He dies before he can reveal Sean's location. Shaker later arranges another drop off.

Fire investigation officer Matt Cullen, who examined the scene, said: “When we got up into the roof, we were baffled as there were no obvious ignition sources – no one had been up to there for a long time and there were no electrics that could have sparked a blaze. We looked everywhere, but the smoking gun was found when we discovered a partially burnt birds nest. Neighbours told us they often saw birds flying in and out of a hole in the roof. We believe that one of the birds picked up a cigarette butt that was still smouldering and dropped it into the nest, causing it to catch fire and set the roof alight. “The incident is a great example of why it’s important to put your cigarettes out fully – you never know what might become of your smouldering butts! Luckily for the residents, their neighbours saw the smoke and raised the alarm, so fire crews could get in quickly and bring it under control.” Four fire engines and 21 firefighters and officers went to the blaze on Landor Road in Stockwell.

Labour and disability charities are facing a growing public backlash for making a ‘disgusting spectacle’ of remarks by a Government minister about minimum pay for disabled workers. Shadow Cabinet minister Angela Eagle looked shocked as a BBC Question Time audience turned on her when she demanded that welfare reform minister Lord Freud should resign or be sacked. She insisted the peer had been ‘offensive’ in remarks secretly recorded by a Labour official at a fringe meeting of last month’s Conservative Party conference. Scroll down for video. Shadow Cabinet minister Angela Eagle on Question Time when she demanded Lord Freud be sacked. Lord Freud was responding to a councillor with a severely disabled daughter who suggested that people with mental health problems may be unable to work because employers are unwilling to pay them the statutory minimum. Lord Freud suggested that some disabled workers were seen as ‘not worth’ the £6.50 minimum wage and mused on whether the Government might be able to top up their wages to enable more to get into workplaces. Labour leader Ed Miliband ambushed David Cameron with a transcript of the recording at Prime Minister’s Questions this week, also insisting the minister should be sacked. He has remained in his job after apologising, but Miss Eagle insisted on Thursday night: ‘I do think he should resign. I think what he said… has caused a great deal of offence to disabled people. ‘There are 50 per cent of people with disabilities who are not in work at the moment. The answer to that isn’t to somehow weaken the minimum wage and make them work for less than the minimum wage.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said on the programme it was clear Lord Freud had been talking about the state ‘topping up’ the incomes of disabled people. Lord Freud suggested that some disabled workers were seen as ‘not worth’ the £6.50 minimum wage. One audience member agreed: ‘I think Angela Eagle is being extremely disingenuous. I think we all knew what he meant, even though he said it clumsily.’ Another person in the audience in Newbury, Berkshire, told Miss Eagle: ‘What you are doing is hypocritical point scoring and it’s disgusting.’ A young woman said: ‘I just wanted to see whether you [Eagle] would use this as a political football and you have done – thanks Angela.’ Yesterday a Conservative MP also defended Lord Freud, insisting that the minimum wage was having a detrimental impact on disabled people’s chances of finding work. Jackie Doyle-Price, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, said the way Lord Freud’s remarks had been twisted by Labour and parts of the charitable sector was ‘frankly disgusting’. It emerged the charity Mencap, which has led criticism of Lord Freud, itself warned an estimated 1,000 people with severe learning disabilities had part-time jobs or had their working hours cut as a direct result of the national minimum wage. In 2000, it called for an urgent revision of the rules to enable ‘low output work’ to be exempted from the rules. It now says the system to support disabled people into work has been transformed in the last 15 years and debate has moved on, ‘as has our position’. Conservative MP Henry Smith said: ‘Certain charities have seemed quick to make political attacks on what is a very serious and complex issue. Charities should not be acting as mouthpieces for Labour’s political point scoring.’ Former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit, whose wife Margaret was badly disabled in the Brighton bomb, said the attacks on Lord Freud were a ‘disgusting spectacle’. ‘What Lord Freud was being asked about was whether there are handicapped people who cannot produce enough to justify in purely economic terms a wage of £6 an hour. My wife was capable of earning her pay as an experienced nurse until the sadistic criminals of IRA/Sinn Fein crippled her. She is worth no less today, but she could not justify a pay rate of £6 an hour. Lord Freud was mulling over how to help such people.’ Labour's Department for Trade and Industry published guidance in 2003 on when and where it might be acceptable to pay disabled people far less than the minimum wage. The department, then run by Patricia Hewitt, said the minimum wage applied to all workers – able-bodied or disabled. However, disabled people could be exempted from the minimum wage when they did work-related activity for therapeutic reasons, with no contractual obligation to work. The guidance gave various examples of when that could apply, after the Government consulted with organisations including Scope, Mencap and the TUC. It gave the example of a farm where people develop social skills through involvement in agriculture, horticulture, caring for animals and training. Other examples included a charity running a workshop for people with mental health problems, which it suggested, could pay them as little as £4 per day. A third example was a trust running a facility for mental health outpatients which does activities such as packing and assembly. They could be paid varying amounts up to just £20 per week. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"The important parts of this article are: 1. Shadow Cabinet minister Angela Eagle faced backlash on BBC Question Time for demanding Lord Freud's resignation or dismissal over remarks about minimum pay for disabled workers. 2. Lord Freud was recorded suggesting that some disabled workers were seen as \\"not worth\\" the £6.50 minimum wage and considered whether the Government might top up their wages to enable more to get into workplaces. 3. Ed Miliband also insisted the minister should be sacked but Lord Freud stayed in his position after issuing an apology. 4. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt mentioned that Lord Freud was discussing the state \\"topping up\\" the incomes of disabled people. 5. Some audience members and Conservative MP Jackie Doyle-Price defended Lord Freud, stating that his remarks were taken out of context and turned into a political issue. 6. The charity Mencap, which criticized Lord Freud, previously warned that the national minimum wage had negatively impacted around 1,000 people with severe learning disabilities. 7. Former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit called the backlash against Lord Freud a \\"disgusting spectacle\\" and emphasized the complexity of the issue."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Kids usually get toys from \\"Santa\\" on Christmas Day, but it's also customary to give gifts to others you love. Presents don't have to be big or expensive. Even giving a chocolate bar, baked goods, or small handmade gifts is welcome. It's also a good time of year to offer gifts to those in need. For instance, you can give toys to toy drives for families who are down on their luck or send packages to troops overseas. For a bit of fun, try opening 1 gift on Christmas Eve. Books or pajamas make good Christmas Eve gifts. However, while gift-giving is fun, there's no reason to go into debt for it. Make sure you spend only what you can afford. Sending Christmas cards is a tradition this time of year, and it's a way to let people know you care. Include a little note about how you're thinking of the person and wish them well. You can also send Christmas cards to nursing homes or troops overseas to let them know they're remembered at Christmas. Charity is a hallmark of Christmas, and one way you can participate in that is to pick a charity to give money to. Some common ones that people give to this time of year include food banks, homeless shelters, and other charities that serve those who are down on their luck. You won't have to look hard to find someplace to give, as many charities put up donation centers and boxes this time of year. You could also buy groceries anonymously for a family you know is struggling. You don't have to give money to help out this time of year. Offer to hang Christmas decorations for a neighbor who can't do it or send them baked goods. Collect food, blankets, coats, or other supplies for local charities, or volunteer at a homeless shelter or soup kitchen on Christmas Day.

But after rejection and a series of misfortunes she finds herself working in a burlesque club. The club proves to be a place of conflict and self-discovery, helping Lauryn to realize that even though plans may change, dreams never do. -LieslJadeThe movie opens in Indiana, where Lauryn Kirk (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) says goodbye to her brother, Joel (John Reardon) before departing for Chicago to audition for a famous dance school, the fictional Chicago School of Music and Dance. Although Joel - who works as a mechanic in the family garage - is wary of Lauryn's decision to enroll, he eventually gives her his blessing. When Lauryn enters the stage, however, her dance (mostly a hip hop routine) was halted by the judge, who hostilely rejects her, saying that they need to see something more \\"sensual and feminine\\". Dejected, Lauryn goes to a diner to down her sorrows, but soon finds her car towed off. Upon seeing her misfortunes, Dana (Tessa Thompson), a friendly waitress from the diner invites Lauryn to her apartment and out of the pouring rain. Dana subsequently offers Lauryn a place to stay, considering Lauryn could not go back home and face her brother. The next day, Dana brings Lauryn to a club called Ruby's (whose dances are rooted in burlesque), where she meets with Russ (Riley Smith), the slick-talking disc jockey, and Brenda (Karen LeBlanc), the club owner.

Is the premise \\"Two young boys wander through a crowd wearing bright yellow shirts.\\" true if \\"The two boys are swimming in the ocean.\\"?","completion":"The premise \\"Two young boys wander through a crowd wearing bright yellow shirts\\" cannot be considered true if the statement \\"The two boys are swimming in the ocean\\" is accurate, as the two scenarios depict different situations. However, it is crucial to examine each scenario closely to determine the validity of the initial premise based on the second statement provided. In the first scenario, it is described that two young boys are wandering through a crowd while wearing bright yellow shirts. This scenario presents an image of the boys being on land, likely in a public place, where there is a gathering of people. The crowd implies that they are not alone and that there could be an event or situation where people have gathered. The bright yellow shirts on the boys could either be a stylistic choice or indicate that they are part of a group or event. On the other hand, the second statement indicates that the two boys are swimming in the ocean. This directly contradicts the first scenario, as swimming in the ocean would require the boys to be in the water, away from any crowd they could be wandering through on land. Furthermore, it is unlikely that they would be wearing bright yellow shirts while swimming, as they would typically be dressed in swimwear or possibly wetsuits, depending on the water conditions and temperature. Additionally, people usually do not swim in a crowd, as it could be dangerous and hinder their ability to swim effectively. In light of the given information, one can conclude that the original premise is not true if the second statement holds. They depict two entirely different situations with distinct environments, activities, and conditions involved. Consequently, if the two boys are indeed swimming in the ocean, it cannot be true they are wandering through a crowd wearing bright yellow shirts at the same time."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that had their hand out to a 1-foot-tall gnome? In mid-1917 nine-year-old Frances Griffiths and her mother—both newly arrived in the UK from South Africa—were staying with Frances' aunt, Elsie Wright's mother, in the village of Cottingley in West Yorkshire; Elsie was then 16 years old. The two girls often played together beside the beck (stream) at the bottom of the garden, much to their mothers' annoyance, because they frequently came back with wet feet and clothes. Frances and Elsie said they only went to the beck to see the fairies, and to prove it, Elsie borrowed her father's camera, a Midg quarter-plate. The girls returned about 30 minutes later, \\"triumphant\\".Elsie's father, Arthur, was a keen amateur photographer, and had set up his own darkroom. The picture on the photographic plate he developed showed Frances behind a bush in the foreground, on which four fairies appeared to be dancing. Knowing his daughter's artistic ability, and that she had spent some time working in a photographer's studio, he dismissed the figures as cardboard cutouts. Two months later the girls borrowed his camera again, and this time returned with a photograph of Elsie sitting on the lawn holding out her hand to a 1-foot-tall (30 cm) gnome. Exasperated by what he believed to be \\"nothing but a prank\\", and convinced that the girls must have tampered with his camera in some way, Arthur Wright refused to lend it to them again. His wife Polly, however, believed the photographs to be authentic. Towards the end of 1918, Frances sent a letter to Johanna Parvin, a friend in Cape Town, South Africa, where Frances had lived for most of her life, enclosing the photograph of herself with the fairies. On the back she wrote \\"It is funny, I never used to see them in Africa. It must be too hot for them there.\\"The photographs became public in mid-1919, after Elsie's mother attended a meeting of the Theosophical Society in Bradford.

Here's a short story: The toddler moved faster in the sandbox than in the patch of grass because it had (A) more resistance (B) less resistance. What is the most sensical answer between \\"sandbox\\" and \\"patchy grass\\"?","completion":"The most sensical answer between the two scenarios would be (B) less resistance, which is the sandbox. Let's analyze both scenarios to provide a comprehensive explanation: In the sandbox: A sandbox is typically composed of small particles, such as sand, which when compacted, create a relatively stable and smooth surface for the toddler to move on. Sand particles tend to stick together, thanks to their minute size and the moisture present in the environment. The static friction between the sand particles creates a firm footing, thus allowing the toddler to maintain a steady pace without exerting much effort. As compared to natural ground, a sandbox offers a consistent and even surface. This consistent texture allows for minimal variance in the terrain, making it easy for the toddler to move faster as they don't have to adjust their balance and grip repeatedly, unlike on patchy grass. In addition, sand offers little resistance against the toddler’s movements, which makes it relatively easier for them to move about. In the patch of grass: The patch of grass, on the other hand, offers more resistance when compared to the sandbox. A patchy grass surface is often uneven and has irregularities, such as tufts of grass, bumps, or other elements that make it hard for the toddler to maintain a constant pace. These natural elements necessitate constant adjustments in balance and force the toddler to tread cautiously, potentially slowing them down as they need to adapt their movements to the irregular terrain. Furthermore, grass surfaces are inherently more slippery than sandy ones, particularly due to the presence of dew or moisture. The increase in slipperiness demands more effort from the toddler to achieve a firm grip on the ground, which could reduce their overall speed. The increased difficulty in maintaining a strong footing significantly increases the resistance the toddler experiences in comparison to the sandbox. In conclusion, between the sandbox and patchy grass, the most sensical answer is indeed the sandbox, as it offers less resistance, allowing the toddler to move faster. The consistency and stability provided by the sand surface, as well as the reduced slipperiness, contribute to this outcome."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Let's examine the statements in detail. 1. Minervén Sport Club, usually Minervén Bolívar Fútbol Club, formerly known as Minervén, is a Venezuelan football (soccer) club. 2. Minervén Sport Club, usually Minervén Bolívar Fútbol Club, formerly known as Minervén, is a Venezuelan football club. Both sentences describe the same subject: the Minervén Sport Club. In addition, they both mention that this club is usually referred to as Minervén Bolívar Fútbol Club and was formerly known as Minervén. Furthermore, they both identify the club's status as a Venezuelan football club.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The Peace of Utrecht established the principle that to preserve the balance of power, the thrones of Spain and France would remain separate, regardless of dynastic rules of inheritance. This makes it a significant milestone both in the development of the nation state and the concept of collective security. Britain is often portrayed as the main beneficiary of the war, with Utrecht marking the beginning of its rise to commercial domination of Europe. It ended the war as the largest naval power in the world while the Netherlands, France and Spain were economically exhausted and their fleets severely reduced. France accepted the Protestant succession, ensuring a smooth inheritance by George I in August 1714 and ended support for the Stuarts by the terms of 1716 Anglo-French Treaty. Possession of Gibraltar and Menorca gave British control of the Western Mediterranean and it gained commercial access to Spanish America; resentment over this would lead to the 1739 Anglo-Spanish War. Spain retained its independence, the majority of its Empire and Philip was confirmed as King; in return, they ceded the Spanish Netherlands and most of their Italian possessions to Austria, Sicily to Savoy and Gibraltar and Menorca to Britain. Under the Bourbons, it became far more centralised, the Nueva Planta decrees of 1707 abolishing regional political structures and transferring their powers to Madrid. Reforms strengthened state finances and Spain recovered remarkably quickly; while British naval power prevented the capture of Naples and Sicily in 1718, it successfully did so in 1734 with Menorca regained in 1782.

This is suggested by the fact that you curled up on the couch, likely in an attempt to rest and alleviate your discomfort.

Well that is all completed now but I’ve had some other family stuff going on and with looking after my baby daughter spare time for blogging is pretty scarce at the moment. I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First, let me answer the questions individually before addressing whether they are asking the same thing. First Question: What are the best drops songs? To understand this question, we need to recognize the term \\"drops\\" as a significant feature in electronic dance music (EDM) and sometimes in other popular genres like pop, rock, hip-hop, and R&B. The \\"drop\\" is the high-energy section where the beat kicks in, and it's typically preceded by a build-up that increases tension. The drop propels the song forward and often leaves the listener feeling exhilarated. The best \\"drops\\" songs, therefore, would be those with powerful, catchy, and highly engaging drops. Since musical taste can be subjective, I will provide a list of drops that have become popular or have been praised by many: 1. Skrillex - \\"Bangarang\\": With its rough bass and catchy hooks, Bangarang is a classic when it comes to excellent drops that elicit strong reactions from listeners. 2. Martin Garrix - \\"Animals\\": This instrumental track took the EDM scene by storm in 2013. The drop's powerful, pulsating beat and big-room sound makes it an iconic choice. 3. Showtek ft. We Are Loud! & Sonny Wilson - \\"Booyah\\": The combination of reggae-inspired vocals and massive beats creates an unforgettable drop. 4. Knife Party - \\"Centipede\\": This high-energy track is known for its intense drop featuring the menacing sound of a centipede. 5. Zedd ft. Foxes - \\"Clarity\\": The beautiful vocal harmonies combined with a powerful progressive house drop make for a compelling listening experience. 6. DJ Snake & Lil Jon - \\"Turn Down for What\\": The hard-hitting, electronic baseline is what sets this drop apart, making it a popular choice in dance clubs worldwide. 7. The Chainsmokers ft. Daya - \\"Don't Let Me Down\\": Daya's vocals with the electro-infused beat create a catchy drop, making it a favorite among fans. 8. Tiesto & KSHMR ft. VASSY - \\"Secrets\\": This melodic track features a euphoric progressive house drop that has solidified its place as a fan favorite. 9. Calvin Harris & Disciples - \\"How Deep Is Your Love\\": With groovy basslines and captivating hooks, the drop in this song is infectious and dance-inducing. 10. Major Lazer & DJ Snake ft. MØ - \\"Lean On\\": This globally successful track features a mix of moombahton and electro house elements, making for an engaging and unique drop. Second Question: What are the best drop songs? With this question, the term \\"drop\\" is being used in the same context as in the first question. As a result, the list of best drop songs would be similar to the best \\"drops\\" songs list provided above. Are these two questions asking the same thing? Yes, these two questions are essentially asking about the same thing, as they both inquire about songs with powerful, high-quality drops. Consequently, the responses would be quite alike, highlighting the best drop songs in electronic dance music and other related genres based on popular opinion and listener preferences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The statement \\"Cheerleaders are practicing pyramid routines.\\" implies that cheerleaders are engaged in the activity of performing or rehearsing pyramid formations. Pyramid routines are a type of cheerleading move where the cheerleaders form a human pyramid, with members of the team supporting each other to create a multi-tiered structure. This often involves a combination of acrobatics, balance, and teamwork to ensure the stability and safety of the formation. As the statement explicitly mentions that cheerleaders are practicing pyramid routines, it logically follows that cheerleaders are doing pyramids. In this context, \\"doing pyramids\\" refers to the act of executing or practicing the aforementioned pyramid routines. In cheerleading, pyramids are typically integrated into larger routines, which may include other components such as jumps, tumbling, and stunts. The purpose of these routines is often to demonstrate the skills, athleticism, and teamwork of the squad, as well as to generate excitement and support for the team or event being cheered for. Additionally, performing pyramids requires a significant amount of practice and dedication from the cheerleading team. Developing the strength, coordination, and trust necessary to safely and effectively carry out these routines can take time and effort, so it is not uncommon for cheerleaders to spend a considerable portion of their practice time working on pyramid routines. In conclusion, based on the given statement \\"Cheerleaders are practicing pyramid routines,\\" it logically follows that \\"Cheerleaders are doing pyramids.\\" This is because practicing pyramid routines inherently means that the cheerleaders are engaged in the activity of performing or rehearsing human pyramid formations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

James was 35 and had been HIV positive for 20 years, and Bill, who was 54 and was not HIV positive. They booked them and let them go. But I can use this background: HIV , or human immunodeficiency virus, causes AIDS. AIDS stands for \\"acquired immune deficiency syndrome.\\" It is a condition that causes death and does not have a known cure. AIDS usually develops 10 to 15 years after a person is first infected with HIV. The development of AIDS can be delayed with proper medicines. The delay can be well over 20 years with the right medicines. Today, individuals who acquire HIV after 50 years of age can expect to reach an average human life span. What is an answer for this question: Which person didn't have to take medicines to slow down the virus? A:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, person A, James, who is 35 years old and has been HIV positive for 20 years, would have likely needed to take medicines to slow down the progression of the virus. HIV, if left untreated, can eventually lead to the development of AIDS, which is a life-threatening condition. The proper use of medications, such as antiretroviral therapy (ART), can significantly delay the development of AIDS, sometimes even by more than 20 years. Person B, Bill, who is 54 years old and not HIV positive, would not need to take any medications related to HIV or AIDS, as he is not infected with the virus. The background information suggests that someone who acquires HIV after 50 years of age can still expect to reach an average human lifespan with proper treatment. However, in Bill's case, he doesn't have HIV, so there is no need for him to take any medicines to address this particular issue.

My apologies as I need to give a little back story first. Please bear with. I first came to the DC/NOVA area via the US Army. It had a very small town feel. I was amazed no traffic, extremely affordable housing market, friendly, helpful and caring people and trees as far as the eyes could see. It was top 3 places I had lived in this country. After the Tech boom peaked near 2000 and after 9/11 the flood gates opened and people spilled in from all over the Earth for the bountiful opportunities. The housing market skyrocketed and people were tripling++ the values of their homes. It is now home to some of the wealthiest counties in the US. Why is this all relevant? All the prosperity brought greed, selfishness and gluttony to a whole new level. People had massive disposable income they had never had before. Nothing is too grossly indulgent anymore and they throw away vast amounts of money trying to one up the last kids party without giving a thought to what a kid needs or the fact they are teaching kids that over indulgence is okay. Now, my son and I were invited to a birthday party for this FIVE year old. The sole Parent had rented the club house, surrounding grounds and pool area of a local country club.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Who does the commander of the Sacred guard fall in love with?, using the article: The story is set in 490 BC, the time of the Medic Wars, during which Persian armies sweep through the Ancient world. Having brought home to Athens the Olympic victor's laurel crown, Phillippides becomes commander of the Sacred Guard, which is expected to defend the city-state's liberty, a year after the expulsion of the tyrant Hippias. Athenian supporters of Hippias conspire, hoping to sideline Phillippides with a marriage to Theocrites' expensive servant Charis, and thus neutralize the guard. She fails to seduce him, as his heart is already taken by a young girl before he learns her name is Andromeda, daughter of Creuso. Everything personal is likely to be put on hold when the news breaks that the vast army of Darius, the Persian King of Kings, is marching on Greece, hoping that its internal division will make its conquest a walk-over. Theocrites instructs Miltiades to hold back the Sacred Guard to defend the temple of Pallas after a likely defeat, and proposes instead to negotiate terms with Darius, but is told an alliance with Sparta could save the Hellenic nation. Phillippides makes the journey and survives an attempt on his life by conspirators; he returns with Sparta's engagement during the Persian attack in far greater numbers on Militiades valiant troops. Charis, left for dead after overhearing Darius's orders, reaches the camp to tell that the Persian fleet, now commanded by the traitor Theocrites, is heading for the Piraeus to take Athens. Miltiades sends Phillippides ahead to hold out with the Sacred Guard until his hopefully victorious troops arrive, and after his perilous journey back they successfully beat back the Persians., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","completion":"The commander of the Sacred Guard, Phillippides, falls in love with Andromeda, the daughter of Creuso. This is seen in the text where it states, \\"his heart is already taken by a young girl before he learns her name is Andromeda, daughter of Creuso.\\" Step 1: Identify the main subject of the question, which is \\"the commander of the Sacred Guard.\\" Step 2: Find the part of the article that refers to the commander of the Sacred Guard, which is when it mentions Phillippides. Step 3: Look for information about Phillippides' love interest in the article. This can be found in the sentence that describes his heart being taken by a young girl, Andromeda.

Sentence: \\"John spoke intimately to Mary.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","completion":"A linguist would likely rate the sentence \\"John spoke intimately to Mary.\\" as acceptable linguistically for several reasons. In evaluating a sentence's linguistic acceptability, linguists consider its grammaticality, semantics, pragmatics, and social appropriateness. Let's consider each of these aspects in relation to the given sentence. 1. Grammaticality: The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the general Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure typical of English sentences. The subject, \\"John,\\" is a proper noun, the verb \\"spoke\\" is in the simple past tense, and \\"intimately,\\" an adverb, modifies the verb \\"to speak.\\" The prepositional phrase \\"to Mary\\" indicates the recipient of John's speech. All the parts of speech used are appropriate and correctly placed. 2. Semantics: Semantically, the sentence is clear and unambiguous. \\"Intimately\\" is an adverb that gives more information about how John spoke to Mary. In this context, \\"intimately\\" implies that the conversation was personal, private, or had emotional depth. There is no confusion regarding what the sentence is trying to convey. 3. Pragmatics: Pragmatically, the sentence is also acceptable. The implied context of a conversation between two people is easily understood by most English speakers. Furthermore, the adverb \\"intimately\\" might hint at how the relationship between John and Mary is close or significant, suggesting that this detail is relevant or essential in the particular situation in which the sentence is used. 4. Social appropriateness: The sentence does not contain any offensive, discriminatory, or taboo language or subjects. Therefore, a linguist would likely consider it socially appropriate, although this factor may be more subjective and dependent on the culture and the context in which the sentence is used. In conclusion, a linguist would rate the sentence \\"John spoke intimately to Mary.\\" as acceptable linguistically, as it is grammatically correct, semantically clear, pragmatically understandable, and socially appropriate. The sentence serves as an example of proper English syntax, and it conveys an uncomplicated yet meaningful message about a particular conversation between two individuals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What Are Some Of The Biggest Red Flags In An Interviewee? This question originally appeared on Quora: What are some of the biggest red flags in an interviewee? Answer by Sarah Smith, VP of Recruiting/HR, on Quora I’ve had the fortune to interview hundreds of people (maybe over a thousand by now) in private education and technology and have found the following to be the biggest red flags in interviews: Victim Mentality To me as an interviewer, there is no bigger red flag than victim mentality. When I ask, “Tell me about your interest in this role,” and I get an answer along the lines of, “Well, I’m at Facebook/Google/Microsoft/<insert other larger company> and have really tapped out on what I can learn here. There’s no more room for me to grow,” you’ve pretty much lost me. Are you seriously trying to tell me that there are literally no more opportunities for learning at a 10-30-100 THOUSAND person company? If you cannot find anything to learn there, how are you going to do when you have to roll up your sleeves and do a fair bit of less glamorous work at a start-up? I’ve worked in some very mundane jobs earlier in my career and have never been “bored”. There is always something to learn. Similarly, I see a huge red flag when an applicant talks about their boss “hating” them or really anyone in the organization that is “against” them. Talk of being “limited” or “capped” are also words I associate with victim mentality. It’s certainly possible that you are at a company or team that is a sinking ship and you want to get out, but you can always find something to learn in all situations and paint your interest in a role in a positive, learning light. Lack of Product Knowledge or Passion I have little patience for candidates who have not used our product. It is the easiest, most straight-forward way to prepare for an interview. I’m baffled by candidates who have never used our product or say that they don’t use it much. You are about to spend likely 50%+ of your waking hours on this product. Shouldn’t you love it and be compelled by it? Take the time to read a few blog posts from the company. Use the product. Ask and answer a few questions. It will help you know if you want to actually work on it and will help you perform better and more knowledgeably in your interviews. As one other guidepost, I recommend thinking about preparing for an interview like you would prepare for a final exam. You should spend hours and hours reading and preparing. Whenever I’ve interviewed anywhere, I spent at least 10-20 hours researching before the first conversation. Show that you really want the opportunity! Arrogance Luckily, it’s rare for someone to make it too far in our process if they are arrogant but every once in awhile someone gets to onsite. If we hear of anyone treating anyone at our company poorly (receptionist, recruiting team, interviewers, custodial staff), that’s a huge red flag. If you come into an interview with a huge ego, it’s unlikely to go away when you’re working in a team with humble, nice people. Short Terms of Employment I don’t immediately reject applicants who have a shorter term at one company but I’d certainly want to know why. For example, if I saw an applicant at any pre or post-IPO tech company for less than a year or two, I’d ask why as I want to confirm whether they were involuntarily terminated. If so, then I’d want to understand more about the circumstances and whether the position we’re considering them for is likely a much better fit. Swearing Again, while I wouldn’t completely rule out a candidate for swearing in an interview, it would be a big red flag. To me, swearing in an interview shows very poor judgment and lack of self-awareness in the situation. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"In an interview, some of the biggest red flags include a victim mentality, lack of product knowledge or passion, arrogance, short terms of employment, and swearing, as these factors may indicate that a candidate may not be a suitable fit for the company or team."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the product they purchased as it did not fulfill their expectations or desired outcome. They state that the product was intended to distract their son from the discomfort caused by the car seat, but they encountered problems in attaching it properly. Furthermore, the product would often fall off while in transit. Instead of serving its primary purpose, the product failed to entertain or distract their son from crying and therefore could not provide a solution for their issues with the car seat. The discovery of the lullaby version of Radiohead's \\"No Surprises\\" is mentioned as an alternative solution to the problem, rendering the purchased item unnecessary. In conclusion, the reviewer's experience with the product is mostly negative because it did not address their needs and was difficult to use.

But zucchini, summer’s most underloved vegetable (technically, yes, it’s a fruit), comes in for a lot of grief. It’s so prolific! It’s so cheap! What are we going to do with all of it? I suppose it’s not just zucchini’s omnipresence but its mild flavor — and indeed, the difficulty of bringing out some of its character — that makes us feel challenged. But along with the ubiquitous yellow squash that you prepare in the same way, zucchini is the workhorse of late summer, firm enough to stand up to all cooking methods, tender enough to eat raw, quick-cooking and amenable to all kinds of flavors. Bonus: They maintain firmness and freshness longer than any of the more beloved summer vegetables. When buying, look for the smallest zucchini and yellow squash; they don’t have to be designated “baby,” but something under six inches long and an inch or so in diameter is ideal; it will have better flavor and smaller, less cottony seeds. If a zucchini is tender enough, you can even eat the stem. You may also come across the flying-saucer-shaped pattypan squash, which is a bit trickier to cut up but can be used in any of the recipes here. No doubt you have grilled and sautéed zucchini, and have probably also eaten it raw (even if it’s just a bite taken while chopping it to be sautéed), but it’s possible you’ve yet to explore the wonders of zucchini in the microwave. Microwaving makes zucchini silky and tender with the push of a button; if you’re without a microwave, you can move those recipes to a saucepan over medium heat. Appreciate the zucchini.

An earlier conflict, which lasted from 1485 to 1491, had led to a stalemate. By 1516, the Ottomans were free from other concerns—Sultan Selim I had just vanquished the Safavid Persians at the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514—and turned their full might against the Mamluks, who ruled in Syria and Egypt, to complete the Ottoman conquest of the Middle East. Based on the above article, answer a question.

So, what's the best answer to the question? Choices: 1). waves 2). Loss of motion 3). sight 4). death 5). stillness 6). heat 7). sound 8). noise Answer:","completion":"Based on the hints provided by the teacher, the best answer to the question \\"What can snapping a rubber band cause?\\" is 8). noise. When a rubber band is snapped, it causes the particles within the rubber band to vibrate. This vibration is transferred to the surrounding air particles, creating sound waves. These sound waves travel through the air and ultimately result in the perception of noise by our ears. Furthermore, the teacher's hint also mentioned that vibration can lead to wear and fatigue of parts. This implies that the noise generated from the snapping of a rubber band may result from the rapid movement and friction of its particles. The relationship between vibration and noise can also be understood as follows: when an object vibrates, the movement of particles near the object's surface causes fluctuations in the surrounding pressure. These pressure fluctuations then propagate through the air or any other medium as waves, eventually reaching our ears, which perceive these pressure variations as sound. Noise is typically characterized as random, unwanted, or unpleasant sound, which is often the result of irregular vibrations. In this context, the snapping of a rubber band creates noise since the vibration and subsequent sound generated are abrupt and unexpected. This makes the option of noise the most suitable answer to the quiz question as it reflects the direct result of snapping a rubber band based on the provided hints."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Some species of ants farm aphids, protecting them on the plants where they are feeding, and consuming the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their alimentary canals. This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony. Queens leaving to start a new colony take an aphid egg to found a new herd of underground aphids in the new colony. These farming ants protect the aphids by fighting off aphid predators. Pam and Ellie are two entomologists. they are both studying ants at the moment: Ellie is studying leafcutter ants, while Pam is studying ants that farm aphids. Which scientist read less about dairying ants milking the aphids? The answer is:","completion":"Ellie read less about dairying ants milking the aphids. In this scenario, we have two entomologists who are studying different aspects of ants' behaviors and habits. Pam is focused on ants that farm aphids, while Ellie is investigating leafcutter ants. It is crucial to understand the different behaviors and characteristics of the specific ants they are studying. Dairying ants, also known as aphid-tending ants, are known for their mutualistic relationship with aphids, where they protect the aphids and consume the honeydew they produce. This process involves the ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae, as mentioned in the given question. The study of these ants and their behavior with aphids is directly related to Pam's research as her interest lies within ants that farm aphids. On the other hand, Ellie is investigating leafcutter ants. Leafcutter ants are famous for their behavior of cutting leaves and using them as a substrate to cultivate fungus gardens, which serve as their primary food source. While this is also an exciting and complex topic in entomology, it is separate from the study of dairying ants and their relationship with aphids. Leafcutter ants do not have the mutualistic relationship with aphids, and therefore milking aphids is not a behavior observed within this group. Consequently, Ellie would read less about dairying ants milking the aphids, as her research focus is on a different type of ant with distinct habits, specifically the leafcutter ants. Her study does not involve the ants' relationship with aphids, and thus, she would not delve deeper into the process of ants milking the aphids. Meanwhile, Pam's research directly examines the symbiotic relationship between ants and aphids, making it more likely for her to read extensively on dairying ants milking the aphids."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This statement seems to convey a negative opinion towards a work, event, or person. The choice of words in the sentence indicates a certain level of disappointment, annoyance, or dissatisfaction. Firstly, the word \\"earnest\\" can be seen as a positive trait, showing a genuine and sincere nature. However, in this case, we can interpret it as overly serious, trying too hard, or lacking an element of humor or lightness that may be expected. This use of \\"earnest\\" is likely to contribute negatively to the overall sentiment. Secondly, \\"unsubtle\\" hints at a lack of nuance or complexity. Someone or something described as unsubtle might be accused of failing to incorporate subtlety or intricacies which could have made it more engaging or interesting. This word clearly carries a negative connotation, implying that the subject is lacking depth or sophistication. Lastly, \\"Hollywood-predictable\\" suggests that the subject is formulaic, clichéd, or lacking originality. This term is often used to criticize movies, stories, or events that follow well-worn tropes and storylines, neglecting to take risks or offer something fresh and innovative. This also contributes negatively to the overall sentiment of the sentence. Taking all these factors into consideration, one can conclude that the sentiment of the sentence \\"earnest, unsubtle, and Hollywood-predictable\\" is negative as it highlights dissatisfaction with the subject, implying that it is overly serious, lacking depth, and unoriginal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It's unfortunate because until this book, John Sandford had given us 14 (I believe) other FANTASTIC Prey novels. It was a joy to buy the latest Prey novel and see Davenport work his magic. In this newest one, however, not only does it lack the edge of the earlier ones, it also makes Davenport a mediocre detective. Nowhere does Lucas Davenport shine in this book. Any bad guys that are caught in this book - none of them were caught DUE TO Davenport. It was purely coincidental. He didn't actually DO ANYTHING in this novel, which, to me is the worst part. I'll still purchase the next Prey novel fresh off the presses, because I've got faith in Mr. Sandford. He just happened to have an off day, and unfortunately, it shows in this book.

They recently met and discussed their health problems over coffee. Tom had hypertension and the doc told him to change his diet. Which friend had to start drinking skim milk? Hint: Hypertension , which is also called \\"high blood pressure,\\" occurs when a person’s blood pressure is always high. Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this reason, hypertension is often called the \\"silent killer.\\" Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and medication.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Background: Douglas Richard Flutie (born October 23, 1962) is a former quarterback in the National Football League (NFL), Canadian Football League (CFL), and United States Football League (USFL). Flutie first rose to prominence during his college football career at Boston College, where he received the Heisman Trophy and the Davey O'Brien National Quarterback Award in 1984. His \\"Hail Flutie\\" touchdown pass in a game against Miami on November 23, 1984 (dubbed \\"The Pass\\") is considered among the greatest moments in college football and American sports history. Flutie was selected as the 285th pick in the 11th round of the 1985 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Rams, making him the lowest drafted Heisman Award winner among those who were drafted. Context: Flutie played football for Boston College, the only Division I-A school to recruit him, from 1981 to 1984, and won the Heisman Trophy, Maxwell Award, and the Davey O'Brien National Quarterback Award in his senior year (1984). Flutie became the first quarterback to win the Heisman since Pat Sullivan in 1971. Flutie left school as the NCAA's all-time passing yardage leader with 10,579 yards and was a consensus All-American as a senior. He earned Player of the Year awards from UPI, Kodak, The Sporting News, and the Maxwell Football Club. The quarterback coach for Boston College from 1981 - 1983 was Tom Coughlin. Flutie gained national attention in 1984 when he led the Eagles to victory in a high-scoring, back-and-forth game against the Miami Hurricanes (led by QB Bernie Kosar). The game was nationally televised on CBS the day after Thanksgiving and thus had a huge audience. Miami staged a dramatic drive to take the lead, 45-41, in the closing minute of the game. Boston College then took possession at its own 22-yard line with 28 seconds to go. After two passes moved the ball another 30 yards, only 6 seconds remained. On the last play of the game, Flutie scrambled away from the defense and threw a \\"Hail Mary pass\\" that was caught in the end zone by Gerard Phelan, giving BC a 47-45 win. Flutie won the Heisman trophy a week later, but the voting had finished before the game; Flutie said, however, that \\"without the Hail Mary pass I think I could have been very easily forgotten\\". The subsequent rise in applications for admission to Boston College after Flutie's \\"Hail Mary\\" gave rise to the admissions phenomenon known as the \\"Flutie Effect\\". This idea essentially states that a winning sports team can increase the recognition value of a school enough to make it more attractive to potential applicants. In addition to his collegiate athletic achievement, Flutie maintained a distinguished academic record at Boston College. He was a candidate for a Rhodes Scholarship, for which he was named a finalist in 1984. Upon graduating, Flutie won a National Football Foundation post-graduate scholarship. In November 2008, Flutie was honored by Boston College with a statue of him throwing his famous \\"Hail Mary\\" pass outside of Alumni Stadium. His number, 22, has been retired by the Boston College football program. Despite his successful college achievements, whether Flutie was too small to play professional football was uncertain. When asked on television \\"Can a guy who's five-foot-nine, 175 pounds make it in the pros?\\", he answered \\"Yes, he can. But it's a matter of ability and not size. I feel I can play; I don't know for sure, and those questions will be answered in the future.\\" Flutie was seen as extremely attractive to the USFL, which was desperate for a star to reinvigorate the league as it was in financial difficulty. Meanwhile, the Buffalo Bills, who had the first pick of the 1985 NFL Draft, still had the rights to Jim Kelly (who had earlier spurned them to go to the USFL) and also had concerns about Flutie's height. He was selected by the USFL's New Jersey Generals (owned by Donald Trump) in the 1985 territorial draft, which took place in January, months before the 1985 NFL Draft. Flutie went through negotiations with Trump and agreed on a deal that would make him the highest paid pro football player and highest paid rookie in any sport with 7 million over 5 years; Flutie was officially signed on February 4, 1985. Having already signed with the USFL, Flutie was not selected in the NFL Draft until the 11th round, and the 285th overall pick by the Los Angeles Rams. Flutie entered the USFL with much hype and fanfare. However, many began to wonder if the scouts who said Flutie could not compete on the pro level were right. In February 1985, Flutie made his USFL debut against the Orlando Renegades. His debut was not impressive, as his first two professional passes were intercepted by Renegades line backer Jeff Gabrielsen. The only two touchdowns that New Jersey scored came from turnovers by Orlando quarterback Jerry Golsteyn. By the time Flutie's debut was over, he completed only 7 of 18 passes, for a total of 174 yards, while running for 51 yards. Flutie completed 134 of 281 passes for 2,109 yards and 13 touchdowns with the Generals in 1985 in 15 games. He suffered an injury late in the season that saw him turn over the reins to reserve quarterback Ron Reeves. The Generals went on to sport an 11-7 record and a 2nd-place finish in the USFL's Eastern Conference. The USFL folded in 1986, and Flutie and punter Sean Landeta were the league's last active players in the NFL. Flutie played in the Canadian Football League for 8 years. He is considered as one of the greatest quarterbacks ever to play Canadian football. In 1990, he signed with the BC Lions for a two-year contract reportedly worth 350,000 a season. At the time he was the highest paid player in the CFL. Flutie struggled in his first season, which would be his only losing season in the CFL. Over the next seven years he would go 99-27 as a starter. In his second season, he threw for a record 6,619 yards on 466 completions. Flutie was rewarded with a reported million-dollar salary with the Calgary Stampeders. Flutie won his first Grey Cup in 1992 with the Stampeders. He was named the Grey Cup MVP. During his last years in Calgary, Flutie's backup was Jeff Garcia, who later went on to start for the NFL's San Francisco 49ers. Flutie won two more Grey Cups with the Toronto Argonauts, in 1996 (The Snow Bowl, held in Hamilton, Ontario) and 1997 (held in Edmonton, Alberta), before signing with the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League in 1998. Prior to his final two Grey Cup victories with the Argonauts, Flutie was hampered by the opinion, supported by the media, that he was a quarterback who could not win in cold weather. In both 1993 and 1994, the Stampeders had the best record in the league, but lost the Western Final each year at home in freezing conditions. After first refusing to wear gloves in freezing temperatures, in later years Flutie adapted to throwing with gloves in cold weather. His career CFL statistics include 41,355 passing yards and 270 touchdowns. He holds the professional football record of 6,619 yards passing in a single season. He led the league in passing five times in only eight seasons. He once held four of the CFL's top five highest single-season completion marks, including a record 466 in 1991 which was surpassed by Ricky Ray in 2005. His 48 touchdown passes in 1994 remains a CFL record. He earned three Grey Cup MVP awards, and was named the CFL's Most Outstanding Player a record six times (1991-1994, and 1996-1997). He passed for 5,000+ yards six times in his career and remains the only player in pro football history to pass for 6,000+ yards in a season twice in his career. On November 17, 2006, Flutie was named the greatest Canadian Football League player of all time from a top 50 list of CFL players conducted by TSN. In 2007, he was named to Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, the first non-Canadian to be inducted. Question: When did he start in Canada. Whats the answer?","completion":"Douglas Richard Flutie started his professional football career in Canada in the year 1990. This information is inferred from the text that states \\"In 1990, he signed with the BC Lions for a two-year contract reportedly worth 350,000 a season.\\" I arrived at this answer by scanning through the provided text for relevant information about when Flutie began playing football in Canada.

Instructions: In this task, you are given a question and a context passage. You have to answer the question based on the given passage. Input: How do you know that the main topic of discussion is not overall considered high power?, Context: LEDs have also been used as a medium-quality voltage reference in electronic circuits. The forward voltage drop (e.g. about 1.7 V for a normal red LED) can be used instead of a Zener diode in low-voltage regulators. Red LEDs have the flattest I/V curve above the knee. Nitride-based LEDs have a fairly steep I/V curve and are useless for this purpose. Although LED forward voltage is far more current-dependent than a Zener diode, Zener diodes with breakdown voltages below 3 V are not widely available. Output:","completion":"The main topic of discussion is not overall considered high power because the passage focuses on the use of LEDs as a medium-quality voltage reference in electronic circuits and their comparison with Zener diodes in low-voltage regulators.

Before they can begin hunting, which the son does not want to do anyway, they are killed by flying jellyfish-like creatures, which penetrate their skin with needle-tipped tentacles. Some time later, four teenagers, Tom, Greg, Beth and Sandy, hike in the same area, ignoring the warnings of local truck stop owner Joe Taylor (Jack Palance). A group of Cub Scouts is also in the area; their leader (Larry Storch) is also killed by the alien creatures, while his troop runs into an unidentified humanoid and flee. The teenagers set up camp at a lake, but after a few hours, Tom and Beth disappear. Sandy and Greg go looking for them and discover their bodies in an abandoned shack. They drive away in their van, while being attacked by one of the starfish which tries to get through the car's windshield. After they get rid of it, they arrive at the truck stop. Greg tries to get help from the locals, but they do not believe him, except for Fred 'Sarge' Dobbs (Martin Landau), who is a mentally ill veteran. Meanwhile, Sandy encounters the humanoid and flees into the woods, where Joe Taylor finds and returns her to Greg. While they discuss the situation, the sheriff arrives, but Sarge shoots him and begins to become more paranoid. Greg and Sandy leave with Taylor, who reveals he has been attacked by the humanoid before and secretly keeps the flying jellyfish as trophies. They search for the shack and once there, Taylor goes inside to only find the bodies of Tom, Beth and the cub scout leader. They discuss waiting for the creature when Taylor is attacked by another \\"jellyfish\\". The young people run once again, leaving him behind as ordered. They stop a police car and get into the back seat, but find Sarge driving. He abducts them, believing them to be aliens.

Write a title: New York - The Web portal Lycos Europe on Friday terminated a spam-fighting campaign that had been criticized as a breach of Internet civility.","completion":"Title: \\"The End of Lycos Europe's Controversial Anti-Spam Crusade: Balancing Technology and Internet Etiquette\\" Introduction: Over the years, the increasing levels of spam have become a major concern for internet users around the world. As technology continues to advance, it has become crucial for companies and organizations to find ways to combat the growing issue that threatens the effectiveness and integrity of email communication. In an attempt to address this challenge, Lycos Europe launched an aggressive anti-spam campaign that quickly became enveloped in controversy. Eventually, the online portal decided to end the operation amid accusations of breaching the boundaries of internet civility. The Lycos Europe Anti-Spam Campaign: Launched in the early 2000s, Lycos Europe's ambitious anti-spam campaign aimed to fight spam by targeting the sources of the unwanted messages. To accomplish this, they developed a screen saver named \\"Make Love Not Spam,\\" which, when run by users, would repeatedly send requests for access to known spammers' servers. The objective was to generate a tremendous amount of traffic on these servers and ultimately overwhelm them, rendering them unable to continue their spamming operations. The Backlash and Criticism: While the intentions of Lycos Europe's campaign may have been noble, their methods drew heavy criticism from various sectors of the online community. Many internet users were concerned about the ethics of fighting spam with seemingly hostile actions, as it raised questions about online vigilante justice and the potential for damaging unintended targets. Furthermore, critics argued that the campaign violated the principles of internet civility by encouraging large-scale Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which are generally regarded as unethical and illegal in most countries. The Termination of the Campaign: As the anti-spam campaign continued, pressure from critics led Lycos Europe to reconsider their approach. The company ultimately decided to terminate the crusade in the pursuit of a more balanced and ethical method of combating spam. In a statement to the public, Lycos Europe acknowledged the concerns of the online community and expressed their commitment to promoting internet civility while continuing their fight against spam. The Aftermath and Lessons Learned: The story of Lycos Europe's terminated anti-spam campaign offers a valuable lesson about the significance of maintaining ethical boundaries when fighting online issues. Although spam remains a pressing concern that requires technological innovation, the case demonstrates the importance of avoiding extreme measures that may infringe on the principles of internet civility. The termination of the campaign serves as a reminder that responsible companies should strive to develop solutions that respect the rules of the online community and promote responsible digital citizenship. Conclusion: The controversy surrounding the Lycos Europe anti-spam campaign highlights the challenges that the modern-day internet faces in balancing effective spam-fighting techniques and upholding the principles of civility and acceptable conduct. While the technology-driven initiative met a swift end, it leaves behind an important message that in the world of the internet, ethical considerations must be prioritized in the battle against spam."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

I taught the kitten the way Pa taught me: I threw him into water where he could not stand, and I watched, ready to grab him if he went under. Tiger did not thrash desperately like me. He merely paddled urgently for the edge of the plastic pool with his head high and his thin legs churning. Little Bit said, \\"Dog paddle,\\" and we all laughed. \\"Tiger paddle,\\" I said, and we all laughed some more, even Jordy. That was probably when Ma noticed the kitten swimming lessons and stopped them. Our swimming lessons happened in two places. When Pa took us, we went to Hawkins Springs behind Mrs. DeLyons' Fountain of Youth Motor Hotel. When Ma took us, we drove to Mermaid Springs State Park, where we would sometimes meet Mr. Drake. I liked Mermaid Springs better because I felt safe there. Ma could not swim, so she never made me jump off a dock into deep water, and she always insisted that I wear an orange styrofoam cylinder on my back like a skindiver or spaceman. Ma usually sat on a towel on the grass near the beach, reading a magazine or a book while tanning her legs. Every now and then she would call to us not to go too far or not to splash each other. When she wore her one-piece red swimming suit, she would come in up to her waist, then lower herself to her shoulders, being careful not to get her hair wet. On the rarest occasions, she would wear a swimming cap and float on her back in the shallow water. Often she stayed in her shorts and shirt, adding sunglasses and removing shoes as her concession to summer and the beach. Question: Where did Pa take them for lessons?

Given the question: Article: Surprisingly, no one knows how many children receive education in English hospitals, still less the content or quality of that education. Proper records are just not kept. We know that more than 850,000 children go through hospital each year, and that every child of school age has a legal right to continue to receive education while in hospital. We also know there is only one hospital teacher to every 1,000 children in hospital. Little wonder the latest survey concludes that the extent and type of hospital teaching available differ a great deal across the country. It is found that half the hospitals in England which admit children have no teacher. A further quarter have only a part-time teacher. The special children's hospitals in major cities do best; general hospitals in the country and holiday areas are worst off. From this survey, one can estimate that fewer than one in five children have some contact with a hospital teacher--and that contact may be as little as two hours a day. Most children interviewed were surprised to find a teacher in hospital at all. They had not been prepared for it by parents or their own school. If there was a teacher they were much more likely to read books and do math or number work; without a teacher they would only play games. Reasons for hospital teaching range from preventing a child falling behind and maintaining the habit of school to keeping a child occupied, and the latter is often all the teacher can do. The position and influence of many teachers was summed up when parents referred to them as \\"the library lady\\" or just \\"the helper\\". Children tend to rely on concerned school friends to keep in touch with school work. Several parents spoke of requests for work being ignored or refused by the school. Once back at school children rarely get extra teaching, and are told to catch up as best they can. Many short-stay child-patients catch up quickly. But schools do very little to ease the anxiety about falling behind expressed by many of the children interviewed. Question: Which of the following statements is true? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Not enough is known about hospital teaching.\\"? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, \\"Not enough is known about hospital teaching.\\" is a true statement.

They clearly enjoyed the film and convey a sentiment that indicates high regard and endorsement for it. However, the review is not entirely devoid of neutral tones. A brief mention of the conflicts between the characters is primarily a plot observation and not a criticism, but it does not add to the positive sentiment and is rather neutral. Ultimately, the overall sentiment of this review can be classified as positive given the ongoing praise and admiration the reviewer expresses for the film, the performances, and the screenplay."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Mr Vineer, who now walks with crutches, was in Craigavon court supported by his family. Speaking afterwards, he said he was pleased and relieved. His mother, Helen-Louise, said: \\"The night they found him, they told us they expected him to die, and when he survived for 24 hours, they thought he would be in a vegetative state for the rest of his life - so he has proved them wrong, and that's my boy.\\" She said the attack on her teenage son had left him with brain damage. \\"He has tremors in his left arm, and being left-handed that causes him problems,\\" she said. \\"His balance has been affected, his short-term memory has been affected and his speech can be quite slurred at times.\\" Scott Vineer also revealed that he was now preparing for a different challenge, that of being best man at his mother and step-father's wedding in August. \\"I'll have to write a speech and all.

He was found close to the towpath on Laganbank Road with severe brain and head injuries, having been beaten and left unconscious behind a disused warehouse. The attack left Scott in a coma for three months, and he returned home six months after the incident. As a result of the assault, Scott now has brain damage, tremors in his left arm, issues with balance, short-term memory problems, and at times experiences slurred speech. Ryan Craig, from Ashmount Gardens, Lisburn, was initially set to go on trial for attempted murder in relation to the attack. However, he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge, leading to the crown deciding not to proceed with the trial. Scott, now walking with crutches, was present in court with the support of his family and expressed relief and satisfaction with the outcome. Scott's mother, Helen-Louise, reflected on the doctors' initial prognosis that her son was expected to die or remain in a vegetative state for the rest of his life, emphasizing that he has proved them wrong. She commented on the impact the attack has had on her son's life, including the challenges he faces due to the lasting effects of his injuries. Despite the ongoing struggle, Scott is preparing for the positive challenge of being the best man at his mother and step-father's wedding in August. He recognizes that delivering a speech will be nerve-wracking but believes he will overcome it.

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. He repeatedly calls on his followers to embrace martyrdom since \\"The walls of oppression and humiliation cannot be demolished except in a rain of bullets.\\" For those yearning for a lost sense of order in an older, more tranquil world, he offers his \\"Caliphate\\" as an imagined alternative to today's uncertainty. For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world. Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction. Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith. Many Americans have wondered, \\"Why do 'they' hate us?\\" Some also ask, \\"What can we do to stop these attacks?\\" Bin Laden and al Qaeda have given answers to both these questions. After reading the above, is \\"Jahiliyya\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Who calls on his followers to embrace martyrdom since \\"The walls of oppression and humiliation cannot be demolished except in a rain of bullets.\\"?\\"? Pick your answer from: [-] no. [-] yes.","completion":"[-] no. \\"Jahiliyya\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"Who calls on his followers to embrace martyrdom since 'The walls of oppression and humiliation cannot be demolished except in a rain of bullets.'\\"? Jahiliyya refers to a period of ignorance before the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed, as described by Sayyid Qutb in his writings. The correct answer would be Osama bin Laden, as he is the one mentioned in the text as calling on his followers to embrace martyrdom. The other option, \\"yes,\\" is incorrect because Jahiliyya is not an individual, but rather a term used by Qutb to describe a condition or period that he saw as the antithesis of Islam."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Alvaro Negredo has been named in Valencia's squad for the first time since breaking his foot before his loan move from Manchester City. The Spanish forward could now make his long-awaited debut for the club against regional rival Elche at Mestalla Stadium on Saturday. 29-year-old Negredo scored 23 goals in 48 games as Manchester City won the Premier League and Capital One Cup last season. Alvaro Negredo poses during his unveiling as a Valencia player last month The Spanish forward has not played for Valencia after breaking his foot in a pre-season game in July But the former Sevilla man has been sidelined since breaking his right foot in one of City's pre-season games in July.

This move offers the Spanish striker an opportunity to showcase his skills and regain his form after the unfortunate foot injury. Valencia's decision to include this purchase clause in the loan agreement signals their confidence in Negredo's ability to make a significant impact on the team's performance. The loan agreement with Manchester City allows Valencia to assess Negredo's progress during his time at the club and make an informed decision on the obligatory purchase clause. This is a mutually beneficial arrangement for both clubs, as Manchester City can continue to monitor Negredo's progress while Valencia benefits from the striker's talent and experience. Negredo's previous success in La Liga, primarily with Sevilla, and his impressive stint at Manchester City have demonstrated his ability to perform at the highest level. Valencia's faith in Negredo stems from his proven goal-scoring record and ability to link up well with teammates in the final third. The upcoming match against regional rival Elche is the perfect opportunity for Negredo to make his long-awaited debut and begin acclimatizing with his new teammates at Mestalla Stadium. The passionate atmosphere at the stadium is likely to motivate Negredo to perform well and win over the Valencia faithful. In conclusion, the most logical way to complete the passage is to state that Alvaro Negredo is currently at Valencia on a one-year loan deal that includes an obligatory purchase clause at the end of the deal. This arrangement benefits both clubs involved and provides Negredo with an opportunity to get back to top form after recovering from his foot injury. Valencia's fans will eagerly await the debut of their new forward and hope that his addition to the team will translate into success on the pitch."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I chose a transparent lemon yellow gloss with tiny flecks of iridescent glitter in, and over the following months I treated myself to several other Juicy Tube variants including a shimmery nude gloss called Pamplemousse which I wore on nights out for years (incidentally Pamplemousse is still going!). Fast forward several (ahem…) years and Juicy Tubes are still going strong, but there’s a new member of the Juicy family vying for attention – the Juicy Shaker.*. Another lip product, this one is a nourishing tinted lip oil which acts a bit like a gloss, and I was sent two of the new shades to try out – Piece of Cake and Show Me The Honey. Juicy Shakers are a bi-phase nourishing lip oil, when the product is allowed to settle the pigment falls to the bottom and the oil rises to the top, giving a split effect. Then you need to shake the bottle to mix the two layers together, giving the product it’s name. The ingredients include sweet almond oil, omega 3 and cranberry oil and really help care for your lips unlike most other glosses.

And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the equation -5*h - 5 = 5 for h, follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the term with the variable h First, we need to isolate the term that includes the variable h on one side of the equation. In this case, we will begin by adding 5 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side: -5*h - 5 + 5 = 5 + 5 This simplifies to: -5*h = 10 Step 2: Solve for h Now that we have isolated the term with h, we can solve for the value of h by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of h which is -5: -5*h / (-5) = 10 / (-5) This simplifies to: h = -2 So the solution to the equation -5*h - 5 = 5 is h = -2."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Paragraph : The farther you stretch the band, the greater the resistance is. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Jim would feel more resistance stretching the rubber band to 40 cm compared to 30 cm. The reason for this is that the resistance increases with the distance the rubber band is stretched. In this case, 40 cm is farther than 30 cm, which means there will be greater resistance when the rubber band is stretched to 40 cm. The elasticity of the rubber band creates tension as it is stretched, and this tension leads to an increased resistance against further stretching. Therefore, Jim would experience a higher resistance when stretching the rubber band to 40 cm rather than 30 cm."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the question: Information: - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history. - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Fort Eben-Emael is an inactive Belgian fortress located between Liège and Maastricht, on the Belgian-Dutch border, near the Albert Canal. It was designed to defend Belgium from a German attack across the narrow belt of Dutch territory in the region. Constructed in 19311935, it was reputed to be impregnable and at the time, the largest in the world. The fort was neutralized by glider-borne German troops (85 men) on 10 May 1940 during the Second World War. The action cleared the way for German ground forces to enter Belgium, unhindered by fire from Eben-Emael. Still the property of the Belgian Army, the fort has been preserved and may be visited. - The Battle of Maastricht was one of the first battles that took place during the German Campaign on the Western Front during World War II. Maastricht was a key city in order to capture the Belgian Fort Eben - Emael and split the allied armies in half . - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.

Engineers George Melton and Allan Chadwick work furiously to complete a design on time, even though it is Christmas Eve. Michael O'Brien, the third partner in the firm, arrives with presents for all and kindly lets their employees leave. The three old men then go home to the mansion they share with Madame Tanya, an elderly countess dispossessed by the Russian Revolution, for a dinner with prestigious guests. When the guests cancel at the last minute, George is convinced it is because of his dark past. To relieve George's black mood, Michael comes up with an idea to obtain new guests for dinner.

Canadian media scholar Harold Innis had the theory that people use different types of media to communicate and which one they choose to use will offer different possibilities for the shape and durability of society (Wark, McKenzie 1997). His famous example of this is using ancient Egypt and looking at the ways they built themselves out of media with very different properties stone and papyrus. Papyrus is what he called 'Space Binding'. it made possible the transmission of written orders across space, empires and enables the waging of distant military campaigns and colonial administration. The other is stone and 'Time Binding', through the construction of temples and the pyramids can sustain their authority generation to generation, through this media they can change and shape communication in their society (Wark, McKenzie 1997). What ancient civilization did Harold Innis use as an example of his theory?","completion":"Harold Innis, the Canadian media scholar, used the ancient civilization of Egypt as an example to demonstrate his theory of coregulation. His theory posits that the choice of media used for communication profoundly influences the shape and longevity of a society. Innis carefully analyzed how different types of media - 'space-binding' and 'time-binding' - were used in ancient Egypt and how they fostered different modes of communication, organization, and control, which in turn affected the overall structure and function of the society. 'Space-binding' was exemplified by the use of papyrus in ancient Egypt. This lightweight, portable media made it possible to transmit written orders across vast distances, thereby enabling centralized control over remote territories. With papyrus, the Egyptian civilization could conduct military campaigns and administer colonies that were geographically distant. By facilitating communication across space, papyrus essentially allowed the Egyptian empire to expand its political and economic influence. In contrast, 'time-binding' media, as demonstrated by the use of stone, allowed the Egyptian authority to persist over prolonged periods. Monuments such as temples and pyramids were built of stone, a durable material that withstands the test of time. These stone structures served not just as architectural marvels but also as media for communicating authority, culture, and laws. They stood as enduring symbols of power, helping successive generations recollect and respect their rulers and gods, aligning them with the societal norms and expectations. In other words, the wisdom, commandments, and narratives of the society were imprinted on these stone structures, making authority and tradition persist over time. These artifacts essentially enabled society to transmit cultural values and societal structures across generations. Thus, Innis' theory showcases how the selection of media - be it papyrus aiding communication over space, or stone facilitating communication over time - can affect societal norms, power structures, and even the perpetuity of the civilization. The Egyptian civilization, with its innovative use of both 'space-binding' and 'time-binding' media, stands as a classic example of this theory."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: Two women sitting on a deck. Hypothesis: the women are enjoying a summer day .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","completion":"While the hypothesis that the two women are enjoying a summer day may be a possible interpretation of the premise, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The premise only states that two women are sitting on a deck, but it does not provide sufficient information about the context, situation, or emotions of the individuals to ascertain if the hypothesis is true. Let's break down the hypothesis and premise in detail: Premise: 1. There are two women. 2. These women are sitting on a deck. Hypothesis: 1. The women are enjoying their time. 2. It is a summer day. In order to validate the hypothesis, we need more information or further evidence to corroborate its components. For example, if we knew that the weather was warm and sunny, this would provide support for the notion that it is a summer day. Additionally, if the two women were observed laughing, talking happily, or engaging in leisure activities, this would lend credence to the idea that they are enjoying themselves. There are multiple alternative scenarios that could also fit the premise. The women could be sitting on the deck during a different season, such as spring or autumn, and merely happen to be outside. They could be discussing serious matters or feeling upset, in which case they would not be enjoying their time. Alternatively, they may just be outside to get some fresh air, with neither enjoyment nor discontentment as a driving factor. In conclusion, while the hypothesis that the two women are enjoying a summer day could very well be true, there is not enough evidence provided by the premise alone to definitively confirm it.

Read this article and answer this question The Patriots travelled to the Metrodome for a Monday Night Football showdown with the Minnesota Vikings, who, like the Patriots, boasted an excellent run defense. The Patriots, who took to the air with a spread offense for the entire game, opened with a seven-play, 86-yard strike that ended with a touchdown pass from Brady to wide receiver Reche Caldwell. Their next drive was for 93 yards which resulted in a 23-yard Gostkowski field goal. And just before halftime the Patriots moved 74 yards in 11 plays to take a 17-0 lead on a nine-yard scoring toss to tight end Benjamin Watson. The only Vikings score of the game came on a 71-yard punt return by Mewelde Moore in the third quarter; Laurence Maroney immediately answered on the ensuing kickoff, with a 77-yard return to Minnesota's 21-yard line, his second return of over 70 yards in as many weeks. The Patriots' lead grew to 17 after a seven-yard touchdown reception by Brown with 9:03 in the third quarter and then became 31-7 with a touchdown catch by Jackson. The Patriots defense also intercepted four passes from quarterbacks Brad Johnson and Brooks Bollinger. On Bollinger's first drive after relieving Brad Johnson he was sacked three times in a row for a net loss of 23 yards. With their fourth straight victory, the Patriots advanced to 6-1.This was the Patriots' third and final game played in the Metrodome.

ACTION2: Wanting a larger room instead of my brother. - This action expresses a personal preference or desire. - The reasoning behind this preference might affect the ethical judgment (e.g. selfishness or entitlement, or maybe because of a valid need for more space?).

The language used (\\"Dumb\\") and the fact that the user cannot access or use a specific feature (cybertron) suggest a negative experience. Considering the traditional rating scale of ★ to ★★★★★, where ★ is the lowest possible rating and ★★★★★ is the highest, I would infer that the reviewer would most likely give this product or service a low rating. There is no explicit mention of a specific number of stars, but the overall sentiment points towards a low rating. Taking all these factors into account, in order to provide a detailed and long answer, let's analyze the review and break it down further: 1. The user uses the word \\"Dumb,\\" which implies frustration and dissatisfaction. This sentiment suggests that the user would give a low rating. 2. The user is unable to utilize the \\"cybertron\\" feature, which seems to play a role in their overall dissatisfaction. If the feature is essential to the product or service, the user's inability to access it would further lower the rating. 3. The review does not provide more context about other aspects of the product or service that they might have liked or appreciated; therefore, there is no reason to believe that the user would give a higher rating based on other factors. In conclusion, while it's impossible to pinpoint the exact ★-rating this user would give based solely on the review provided, we can reasonably deduce that it would likely be a low rating, leaning towards a ★ or ★★. The combination of the expressed dissatisfaction, lack of access to an essential feature, and absence of any positive comments supports this determination."},{"prompt":"Combine facts and answer this: Holston River joins up at Knoxville with which river that begins in Transylvania County, North Carolina?

Write a text based on this summary: opposition lashes out at gov t over chunghwa telecom strike plan Text:","completion":"Title: Opposition Resolutely Condemns Government's Handling of Chunghwa Telecom Strike Plan The opposition has vehemently criticized the government's approach towards the Chunghwa Telecom workers' impending strike plan, with key figures highlighting the necessity for an immediate resolution to the problems surrounding the employees' rights and labor conditions. By allowing the workers' grievances to go unaddressed for an extended period, the government finds itself in the middle of significant social and political turmoil. Chunghwa Telecom, the leading telecommunications company in the nation, plays an essential role in maintaining and providing a stable communication infrastructure for millions of individuals. Recent events, however, have caused a deep divide amongst its employees, with the announcement of a potentially large-scale strike drawing more attention than ever before. The strike, as planned, stands to disrupt activities significantly, affecting customers nationwide. The opposition has been quick to question the government's decision-making processes concerning the growing unrest within Chunghwa Telecom. It specifically points towards a lack of action or intervention effort to address the workers' demands. According to the opposition, the government's failure to initiate appropriate dialogues, negotiate with stakeholders, or take prompt corrective actions is proof of its incompetence in handling significant labor-related matters. Concerns have been raised by the opposition about the widespread ramifications of the telecom strike plan. With services potentially being halted or significantly delayed, millions of customers would be left without a reliable means of communication, severely impacting businesses and government operations. The opposition also emphasized the possible aftermath of the strike plan: losing the public's faith in the government's ability to maintain a stable and functional society. In response to the escalating turmoil, the opposition has suggested several measures the government should prioritize to resolve the ongoing situation effectively. One of them includes initiating transparent negotiations with the aggrieved workers of Chunghwa Telecom, where they are given an open platform to express their grievances and partake in devising a mutually agreeable solution. It is of paramount importance that the employees feel heard and included in the decision-making process, as it would provide them with a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. Another point highlighted by the opposition encompasses the establishment of a robust and just labor management system, which is of utmost importance as workers must be treated fairly while safeguarding their rights. A well-structured labor system allows disputes to be addressed with mediation that is swift, efficient, and fair, reducing the likelihood of future conflicts and promoting a healthy work environment. Finally, the opposition calls for an in-depth review of Chunghwa Telecom's management structure and internal policies, as these are the core factors that have provoked unrest among its workers. Areas such as salary structures, promotions, and employee benefits must be scrutinized carefully to ensure that the primary causes of the discontentment are eliminated. In conclusion, the opposition's strong backlash against the government's handling of the Chunghwa Telecom strike plan represents a call for action and policy change. It is vital that the government demonstrates its dedication to addressing the needs and rights of its workforce. If left unresolved, the ongoing situation would not only cause damage on a national scale, but will also erode the fundamental trust people hold in the government's competence and capabilities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The factory, which manufactures automotive spare parts, is known for its high employee satisfaction. However, recently, a small group of workers has realized that they are being spied on by their lower-level managers. The workers, Bill, Sarah, Roxanne, and Tim, start noticing that these managers, led by David, have become increasingly paranoid, performing bag checks, listening in on conversations, and even installing new security measures. Rumors of layoffs and potential downsizing begin to circulate around the factory, leading to unrest among the employees. The group decides to investigate why the managers are spying on them and what secrets the factory could hold. They start attending local town hall meetings, trying to determine when these changes in the factory's management began. Tim, an old-timer at the factory, recalls a mysterious new investor who had joined the board a couple of years ago. Coincidentally, Tim also observed a significant change in management since then. The group decides to infiltrate the management offices after hours, hoping to find some answers. Breaking in, they hack into the plant manager's computer and discover a hidden email chain between the mysterious investor, David, and other lower-level managers. It becomes clear that the investor, Raymond Watson, is using the factory for something more sinister than vehicle part production. The truth begins to unravel as they uncover a conspiracy to manufacture illicit arms components within the factory and export them to international terrorist organizations. As the group digs deeper, they realize that Raymond's influence and power extend to the local government and law enforcement authorities, plunging the entire town into a web of corruption. In a race against time, the four friends decide to gather evidence and bring down Raymond and his cohorts before the authorities catch on and hunt them down. As the plot unfolds, a series of betrayals, double crossings, and narrow escapes will push the group to their limits, testing alliances they believed were ironclad. Ultimately, they piece together enough information to expose the conspiracy, proving the complicity of the lower-level managers and bringing the factory back to its original purpose.

In the climax, Bill, Sarah, Roxanne, and Tim find themselves in a life-or-death showdown with Raymond and his cohorts, as well as corrupt law enforcement officers. They emerge victorious, leading to the arrest of Raymond and his accomplices. The factory is restored to its former glory, with honest employees regaining their sense of security and trust in management.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"No, these three questions are quite distinct from one another. The first question seeks advice on health or nutrition - specifically, whether it's recommended to consume eight glasses of lime water each day. The second question is asking about a technical process, whether reverse osmosis (RO) water can be used to soften hard water that contains lime scales. Finally, the third question itself is a comparative question -- it seeks to determine whether the first two questions are similar in nature. Though they all involve water and lime in some manner, their focus varies widely. Let's delve into each of these questions in more detail: 1. \\"Is it good to take 8 glass of lime water a day?\\": This question is focused on the health impacts of drinking a specific amount of lime water each day. Lime water, a solution made from limes and water, contains vitamin C and other nutrients and antioxidants that can have numerous health benefits. These might include aiding digestion, improving skin quality, assisting weight loss, and boosting immunity. However, drinking as many as eight glasses per day might not be necessary to achieve these benefits - in fact, consuming too much citric acid (found in limes) could potentially have negative impacts, such as eroding tooth enamel. The specific answer to this question would likely depend on an individual's health condition and overall dietary habits, but it's generally advisable to maintain a balanced and varied diet. 2. \\"Can RO water soften hard water having lime scales?\\": The focus of this question is on water chemistry and treatment methods. Hard water contains high concentrations of minerals such as calcium and magnesium, which can form lime scale in water pipes and on fixtures. Reverse osmosis is a process that pushes water through a semi-permeable membrane to remove impurities. While it's effective at removing many contaminants, RO isn't generally regarded as the most effective method for softening hard water because it doesn't specifically target the minerals that cause this hardness. Water softening typically requires a process like ion exchange, which specifically targets these minerals. 3. \\"Would you say that these questions are the same?\\": The short answer to this question is no, the first two questions are not the same. Despite the similarities in subject matter (lime and water), the specific queries address different topics - the first is about health and nutrition, while the second relates to water treatment methods."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They help the animals get food for energy, make sure their young survive, or ensure that they, themselves, survive. Behaviors that help animals or their young survive, increase the animals’ fitness. Animals with higher fitness have a better chance of passing their genes on to the next generation. If genes control behaviors that increase fitness, the behaviors become more common in the species. This occurs through the process of evolution by natural selection. Now, I have a new situation: Two bears are living in the same forest.

Women between the ages of 40 and 60 are more likely to develop lumps or cysts within the breasts. Hormonal changes can cause cysts to develop, so you may notice breast cysts develop right before your menstrual cycle begins.","completion":"Taking this into consideration, it is important for women in this age range to be vigilant about monitoring their breasts for any changes. One effective way to do this is by performing regular self-examinations. Familiarize yourself with the normal texture and appearance of your breasts, so you can promptly identify any new lumps or areas of discomfort. You should ideally perform these self-exams once a month, preferably a week after your menstrual period when your breasts are least likely to be tender or swollen. In addition to self-exams, you should also schedule annual visits with your healthcare provider for a clinical breast examination. For women aged 45 to 54, it is recommended that they undergo mammograms every year, while women aged 55 and over should have mammograms every two years. These diagnostic tools are essential for early detection of breast lumps, cysts, and potential malignancies. If a cyst or lump is discovered, further evaluation and treatment may be required. Breast cysts can be classified into two categories: simple cysts and complex cysts. Simple cysts are filled with fluid and are typically benign. Complex cysts, on the other hand, may contain both fluid and solid components. While these can still be benign, in some cases, they may be indicative of a more serious issue. If you are diagnosed with a simple breast cyst that is asymptomatic, your healthcare provider may recommend a \\"watchful waiting\\" approach, which involves monitoring the cyst for any changes in size or shape. This approach is typically chosen when the cyst is believed to be harmless, and surgical intervention is not deemed necessary. However, if the cyst is causing discomfort or anxiety, or if there is a concern about its nature, your doctor may choose to drain the fluid using a fine needle aspiration (FNA) procedure. This procedure is done under local anesthesia and helps to alleviate any associated discomfort. In the case of complex breast cysts, further evaluation may be needed to determine the most appropriate course of action. Your healthcare provider may order a breast ultrasound, breast MRI, or biopsy to gather more information about the cyst's structure and composition. If any suspicious features are identified, a more invasive intervention, such as a lumpectomy or surgical excision, may be recommended. It is also crucial to assess and manage any associated risk factors for breast cysts. Lifestyle modifications such as maintaining a healthy weight, engaging in regular physical activity, and minimizing alcohol consumption can help promote overall breast health. Additionally, quitting smoking is a decisive factor in maintaining not only breast health but overall well-being. In summary, treating breast cysts begins with understanding the risk factors and utilizing early detection methods like self-exams, clinical breast exams, and mammograms. Depending on the nature of the cyst, watchful waiting, needle aspiration, or surgical intervention may be necessary, accompanied by the incorporation of wellness practices and lifestyle adjustments to promote optimal breast health. It is crucial to consult with your healthcare provider for personalized recommendations, as each individual's needs may vary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The hypothesis suggests that these forfeitures should be considered when dealing with inventory accounting. Step 2: Evaluate the connection. Given that the premise focuses on a specific situation (forfeitures related to tax liabilities) within the broader topic of inventory accounting, it sets the context for the hypothesis. The hypothesis then expands on that context by stating that these forfeitures must be factored into the accounting process. Step 3: Make a conclusion. Since the hypothesis is a logical extension of the premise and the two statements align in their focus on the importance of forfeiture consideration, the conclusion is: Answer: a). yes. The premise entails the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

As the owner of the largest music company globally, Vivendi Universal has established itself as a dominant force in the sector. This divestment illustrates Philips Electronics' strategic decision to refocus their resources and streamline their investments to align better with their core business areas. The Philips-Vivendi Universal partnership initially proved beneficial for both companies, allowing Philips Electronics to expand its presence in the entertainment industry and Vivendi Universal to strengthen its position in the technology sector. However, the dynamic landscape of the music and entertainment business has prompted Philips and Vivendi to take stock of their priorities and reassess their investment portfolios. By selling its stake in Vivendi Universal, Philips Electronics can now concentrate on bolstering its primary product lines and innovation in the technology market. Over time, the music industry has been witnessing a profound transformation driven by the increased proliferation of digital streaming services and the diminishing demand for physical media like CDs and DVDs. As such, Philips Electronics' decision to divest from Vivendi Universal reflects its strategic reassessment of the future trajectory of the music business. The company is now redirecting its resources to nurture its core competence in technology and electronics product manufacturing, considering the radical shift in consumer preferences and the rapid pace of technological advancements. The sale of Philips Electronics' 3 percent stake in Vivendi Universal is particularly timely and relevant in light of ongoing conversations about mergers and acquisitions in both the technology and entertainment industries. It is essential for companies like Philips Electronics to maintain agility in their investment strategies to adapt to highly competitive markets. By detaching its interests from Vivendi Universal, Philips is responding proactively to a constantly evolving business environment, demonstrating an acute awareness of the challenges and opportunities presented by the digital revolution. It is essential to note that the implications of this strategic move for Philips Electronics extend far beyond the financial outcomes and the reframing of investment portfolios. In essence, this decision could set the stage for a new era within the company's history, characterized by its commitment to innovation and technological evolution. As Philips Electronics solidifies its focus on its core competencies and expertise in the electronics sector, the company will be better positioned to explore new growth opportunities, develop groundbreaking products, and achieve sustained success in the long run. In conclusion, Philips Electronics' divestment of its 3 percent stake in Vivendi Universal signifies a new chapter in the company's strategic outlook and evolution. As consumer preferences, technological advances, and market trends reshape the music and entertainment landscapes, Philips Electronics' decision to refocus its resources on its primary areas of expertise demonstrates exemplary foresight and adaptability. By refining their investment priorities, Philips Electronics can concentrate on innovation and the creation of cutting-edge products that will captivate audiences and ensure the company's lasting success in an age of digital transformation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This implies that the fisherman is near the coastline, navigating his canoe in relatively calm waters. There is no mention of any adverse weather or water conditions in this statement. On the other hand, the second statement introduces a completely new and unrelated scenario – a fisherman caught in a tsunami in the middle of the sea. A tsunami is a massive wave or series of waves caused by seismic activity, volcanic eruptions, or underwater landslides. Tsunamis can cause widespread destruction and loss of life when they reach coastal areas, but they are different from the usual image of a wave crashing on the shoreline and a canoe gently gliding across calm water. The two statements describe entirely different situations without any connection between them. The first statement does not provide any evidence or indication that the fisherman in question will encounter a tsunami, nor does it suggest that he is located in an area prone to tsunamis or dangerous ocean conditions. Therefore, it does not logically follow that \\"A fisherman is caught in a tsunami in the middle of the sea\\" based on the given statement, \\"A lone fisherman paddles his canoe along a shore.\\" To establish a logical connection between these two statements, there would need to be additional information provided to link them, such as a description of the area, geological conditions, or specific events that could lead to a tsunami."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Grapes are grown - A selection of grapes are gathered - The grapes are washed - The stems are removed from the grapes - The grapes are crushed and added to a fermation container - Yeast is added to the container - The yeast eats the sugar in the yeast, releasing alcohol - Question: suppose the wine demand decreases happens, how will it affect wine production will rise. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"If the demand for wine decreases, it will generally have an impact on the overall wine production. The extent of this influence varies depending on the scale of the decrease in demand and the responsiveness of the wine producers. However, it is essential to analyze how this decrease in demand would affect the different stages of wine production and the subsequent implications for the wine industry. 1. Grapes are grown: A decrease in wine demand might lead to a reduction in the incentives for vineyard owners to cultivate grapes primarily meant for winemaking. As a result, they might explore other opportunities to grow alternative crops or grapes for table consumption or other grape-derived products like grape juice or vinegar. This could potentially lead to lower grape production intended for wine-making. 2. A selection of grapes are gathered: With less demand for wine, winemakers may be more selective in choosing which grapes to use for their products. This could result in a higher focus on grape quality to create premium, niche wines that cater to specific market segments, rather than mass-producing lower-quality wines, ultimately reducing the quantity of grapes needed for wine production. 3. Grapes are washed, the stems are removed, and the grapes are crushed: The reduced demand for wine means that wineries will likely process fewer grapes, consequently requiring less labor, equipment, and infrastructure. This can lead to more efficient use of resources, optimization of the production process, and potentially encourage the development of innovative winemaking techniques to differentiate their products in a competitive market. 4. Adding to the fermentation container and adding yeast: In response to decreased wine demand, winemakers might lean towards creating higher-quality wines or producing innovative wine styles with unique characteristics like organic, biodynamic, or natural wines. This could affect the scale and the type of fermentation containers and yeast selection that are required for the specific wine production process. 5. Yeast eats sugar, releasing alcohol: The reduction in wine production will have a proportionate impact on this step of the process. Consequently, the need for yeasts and other fermentation-related resources will also be reduced in direct correlation with the overall wine output. In conclusion, a decrease in wine demand is expected to lead to less wine production, as wineries adapt to new market conditions and focus on improving the quality of their wines. This perturbation could potentially lead to a more competitive market, encouraging innovation and the development of niche products. Although it's crucial to consider that factors such as the region's market dynamics, government policies, geographical factors, and other economic indicators could influence these effects, it is reasonable to assume that the outcome would be a general reduction in wine production across the industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Question: \\"Debutantes are all?\\" Context: \\"Court presentations of aristocratic young ladies to the monarch took place at the palace from the reign of Edward VII. These young women were known as débutantes, and the occasion—termed their \\"coming out\\"—represented their first entrée into society. Débutantes wore full court dress, with three tall ostrich feathers in their hair. They entered, curtsied, and performed a choreographed backwards walk and a further curtsy, while manoeuvring a dress train of prescribed length. (The ceremony, known as an evening court, corresponded to the \\"court drawing rooms\\" of Victoria's reign.) After World War II, the ceremony was replaced by less formal afternoon receptions, usually without choreographed curtsies and court dress.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Debutantes, in the context of court presentations of aristocratic young ladies to the monarch, are young women from upper-class or aristocratic families who are making their formal introduction or \\"coming out\\" into high society. This tradition has deep historical roots and dates back to the reign of Edward VII in the United Kingdom. The debutantes' presentations symbolized their availability for marriage, and thus, it became an essential rite of passage for these young women as they entered the adult world. During court presentations, debutantes were expected to adhere to strict protocols and customs concerning their attire and behavior. They wore full court dress, which was an elaborate and costly affair, often featuring rich fabrics, intricate embroidery, and luxurious accessories. An essential element of their appearance was the inclusion of three tall ostrich feathers in their hair, signifying their high social standing. In addition to their attire, debutantes were required to perform specific actions and behaviors during their presentation to the monarch. They would enter the room, curtsy in a precise manner, and execute a choreographed backward walk while managing the prescribed length of their dress train. They would then perform an additional curtsy before gracefully exiting the scene. The ritual, known as an evening court, was similar to the court drawing rooms held during Queen Victoria's reign. These presentations were held at prestigious venues, such as the royal palace, and were highly anticipated social events attended by the elite of society. Families often invested a significant amount of time and money in preparing their daughters for this crucial moment. Debutantes typically received extensive lessons on etiquette, manners, and social skills so that they could navigate the upper echelons of society with grace and poise. However, following the aftermath of World War II, these court presentations underwent a significant transformation due to shifting social norms and the decline of aristocracy. The formal evening courts were gradually replaced by less ceremonious afternoon receptions with fewer rigid protocols. Elaborate curtsies and court dress became less common, as the focus shifted to a more casual and modern approach towards these social events. In summary, debutantes were aristocratic young ladies who were introduced to high society through formal court presentations during which they adhered to strict dress and behavioral codes. As times and societal norms changed, the debutante tradition evolved into less elaborate events that prioritized social interaction over pomp and ceremony. Nevertheless, debutante culture still endures in certain circles today as a means of continuing age-old traditions and celebrating the entry of young women into upper-class society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Due to the expiration of his contract with Interscope Records, the album's release, marketing, and promotion were completely in Reznor's control. The album features remixes from artists including The Faint, Ladytron, Bill Laswell, Saul Williams, Olof Dreijer of The Knife, and Sam Fogarino of Interpol.

Cyclists were left baffled after they were given an apparent bike path just four inches wide. The bizarre white line was supposed to mark out a 'shared pavement' between walkers and cyclists in Grimsby, Lincolnshire - but it left even councillors scratching their heads. Residents thought they would have to ride along a four-inch gap between the thick white line and the kerb, a daunting task for even the most experienced cyclist. 'Pointless': How 61-year-old Ray Lawrance, pictured, described the new white line which left just a four-inch gap. But North East Lincolnshire Council said it was a normal way of marking out a shared pavement. Baffling: Cyclists complained after it appeared council workers had painted a path for them four inches wide. Cyclist Ray Lawrance, 61, spotted the white line as he walked his two grandchildren to school. He said: 'As a layman looking at this, I am totally confused. Where is the cycle path, where is the pedestrian path? There's no clear definition which is which. Wheely confusing: The start of the bike path in Great Coates, Grimsby. Cyclists should ride on the left. 'It. is pointless. It does not appear to be the best use of public money. It. is probably to tick boxes to get a bit of central government funding. but it has left pedestrians and cyclists confused.' The line was painted last month on a residential street in the village of Great Coates, on the outskirts of Grimsby, as part of resurfacing work at a busy junction. Labour-controlled North East Lincolnshire Council insisted its intention was to mark out a shared space for cyclists and pedestrians, not to divide the path in two. A spokesman said: 'This is a commonly used marking to show where a cycle. path joins a footpath. Cyclists and pedestrians share the length of path. marked by the white line.' But Labour councillor Cliff Barber was forced to hold his hands up after the issue was raised at a community meeting on October 30. The path had been resurfaced following complaints from the public,' he said. 'It. was a very uneven surface with lots of holes in so they have completely. re-tarmacked it and they have done a good job, but I must admit the. newly painted line does look a bit narrow.' The council insisted the repainting was essential for the pavement, but declined to say whether they will change the original markings. Vic Goose, chairman of the North East Lincolnshire Cycle Forum, said: 'The cycle path has been there for some time and has always been a shared path. 'It is quite likely that the white line is to segregate the cycle path from the road.' The bizarre incident is certainly not the first questionable paint job by council workers. Contractors for Cumbria County Council last month painted the words KEEP CEEAR in huge white letters - before having to apologise and correct it for free. And workmen in Thatcham, Berkshire, were a laughing stock when they refused to let parked cars stop them doing their job - and simply painted double yellow lines between each one.

The Enchanted Garden Bistro, nestled in the heart of our beautiful city, truly stands out with its inspiring and warm garden-themed décor. The lush green walls, delicate fairy lights, and aromatic flowers immediately transported me to another world. The enchanting ambience created the perfect backdrop for an evening of exceptional dining. Upon being seated, our attentive server introduced himself and provided us with the evening's specials. I was delighted to find a wide selection of seasonal dishes, showcasing the restaurant's commitment to using only the freshest local ingredients. The wine list was also thoughtfully curated, featuring a mix of both well-known classics and delightful lesser-known gems. For our meal, I ordered the seared scallops with a delicate cauliflower purée to start, while my partner opted for the roasted beet and goat cheese salad. Both appetizers were visually stunning and bursting with flavor. The scallops were cooked to perfection – tender, juicy, and expertly balanced by the creamy cauliflower purée. The beet salad was equally impressive, with the sweetness of the beets and tangy goat cheese marrying together in perfect harmony. Our main courses were equally exquisite. I chose the succulent slow-roasted lamb shank with a side of creamy mashed potatoes and sautéed asparagus, while my partner decided on the pan-seared salmon with vegetable quinoa and a zesty lemon-dill sauce. The love and care poured into crafting these dishes was evident in every bite. The lamb practically fell off the bone and the flavor was enhanced beautifully by a rich, velvety sauce. The salmon was cooked to perfection, moist and flaky, while the lemon-dill sauce provided a refreshing, tangy finish. As if our taste buds hadn't been pampered enough, the dessert menu beckoned us in for one final hurrah. I simply couldn't resist the triple chocolate mousse, and my partner selected the raspberry panna cotta. Heavenly is the only word that comes close to describing the decadence of the chocolate mousse – it was unbelievably smooth, with layers of intense and varied chocolate flavors that danced on my tongue. The raspberry panna cotta was artistically presented and radiated a perfect balance of tart and sweet. Throughout our meal, the service remained impeccable. Our server consistently checked on us without being intrusive, ensuring our wine glasses were filled, and promptly attending to any requests. It is clear that the staff at Enchanted Garden Bistro are well-trained and passionate about providing an exceptional experience for their patrons.

Grape juice is obtained from crushing and blending grapes into a liquid. The juice is often sold in stores or fermented and made into wine, brandy, or vinegar.

Summarize: But few people who work in computer security can stand those programmes or movies because, in their words, they are so technically inept. One TV show that has proved popular with hackers is NBC Universal's Mr Robot which centres around Elliott Alderson - a security pro by day but who is also a member of an anti-establishment hacker group called FSociety that wants to use his technical skills to change the world. Kor Adana, one of Mr Robot's writers who worked in IT security before jumping to TV production, said the decision to make the show as technically accurate as possible was made even before the first episode was shot. \\"I've got nothing but disdain for how Hollywood has portrayed hacking and technology before now,\\" he told a packed session at Def Con that was testament to the huge following Mr Robot has won among hackers. \\"We wanted to do it right,\\" he said, \\"and we thought that doing it in a realistic way would be enticing and compelling.\\" To help get the details correct, Mr Adana has recruited several technical consultants well-known in the Def Con and hacking community to advise on how the hacks Elliott uses can be accomplished. The consultants develop the hacks, prove they work and then pass on information about how they were done to Mr Adana so they can be used on the show. However, he said, drama demands that not every last detail of how Elliot cracks passwords, spoofs text messages, hacks phones or penetrates corporate and civil networks is shown. \\"We have to strike a balance between what's visually compelling and what we have to do to move the story forward,\\" he said. Despite this the show does take care to make sure real and relevant hardware and software is used, he said. This attention to detail extends to the version numbers of software packages being used, command syntax, output format and screen layouts. \\"We want to nail those details,\\" said Mr Adana. \\"It really helps to ground the show in reality if we can use real tools.\\" Mr Adana extended an open invitation to the Def Con audience to contact him and the technical consultants with information about the tools they use so they can be featured on the show and used in its hacks. Beyond the technology and hacks featured in the show, Mr Adana said it was also trying to make an important point about the contemporary role of technology. \\"We live in an age where we are more dependent on devices than ever,\\" he said. \\"And there are a lot of the younger generation that know how to use apps but do not know about the ways in which they are vulnerable and how if they leave their phone unlocked it will not take long for it to be rooted.\\" \\"If Mr Robot increases the level of awareness and paranoia out there then that's a good thing,\\" he said. Veteran hacker Marc Rogers, who develops and proves many of the hacks featured in the show, said he had been encouraged by the care it took to get the tech right. \\"For years and years I have watched TV betray my community,\\" he said, \\"I want to see real stuff on TV that does not make me rage and which is an accurate portrayal of people in my community.\\" \\"It's been a gift to work on this,\\" he said. Andre McGregor, a consultant who formerly worked in the FBI's cyber division, said he too was heartened by the care taken over the technology in the show. \\"I find it refreshing that the accuracy is so important to them,\\" he said, adding that he was approached to help with Series Two of Mr Robot because several episodes feature law enforcement and government responses to cyber attacks. Mr McGregor said his advice extended beyond helping the show's writers understand how the FBI and law enforcement agencies investigate cyber intrusions and conduct interviews. It also involved more subtle elements such as how FBI agents arrange themselves in a room during a meeting or interrogation, he said. \\"An agent would never stand in front of a door,\\" he said. \\"It's what we call the 'fatal funnel', you could be hit by a shotgun blast through that door.\\" But there were some things that the show did gloss over, said consultant Ryan Kazanciyan, a former penetration tester who is now head of forensics at security firm Tanium. \\"It's missing the time, the number of steps you have to go through for a hack, complexity and the amount of research you have to do,\\" he said. \\"When I would do penetration testing I would have one or two weeks to get in from the outside and then one or two weeks to see how much damage I could do from the inside,\\" he said. \\"Sometimes I would go for days just coming up blank,\\" he said. \\"And then you would have that Aha! moment that gets you in.\\" He said one facet of hacking the show did get right was the view of the world that anyone with an understanding of security software swiftly acquires. \\"There's always a way in,\\" he said. Summary:","completion":"Technical consultants and experts in the computer security field are praising NBC Universal's Mr Robot, a TV series about a cybersecurity expert who is part of an anti-establishment hacker group, for its realistic portrayal of hacking and technology. Writer Kor Adana, who previously worked in IT security, said he wanted the show to get the technical details right and has enlisted known consultants in the hacking community.

Write an article based on this summary: – Donald Trump has revisited a conspiracy theory that the Clintons orchestrated a murder, and Sheila Foster Anthony \\"cannot let such craven behavior pass without a response.\\" The Washington Post reports that in an interview last week, Trump was asked about the death of Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster—who committed suicide in 1993—and branded it \\"very fishy. ... He knew everything that was going on [with the Clintons], and then all of a sudden he committed suicide.\\" Conspiracy theories that the Clintons had Foster murdered because he had knowledge specific to the Whitewater scandal surfaced in the months following Foster's death, though five investigations found he took his own life. \\"For Trump to raise these theories again for political advantage is wrong,\\" \\"irresponsible,\\" and \\"cruel,\\" Foster's sister writes at the Post. Foster Anthony has never made public comments on the matter in a bid to protect the tattered remains of her family's privacy, but decided to when the Post asked what she thought. She says she was very close to her brother, who told her he was battling depression before he died; indeed, the names of three psychiatrists she suggested to him were in his wallet when his body was found in a park outside Washington DC. \\"I did not see a suicide coming, yet when I was told that Vince was dead I knew that he had killed himself. Never for a minute have I doubted that,\\" and \\"these outrageous suggestions have caused our family untold pain,\\" she adds. \\"This is scurrilous enough coming from right-wing political operatives who have peddled conspiracy theories about Vince’s death for more than two decades.

Article:","completion":"Cruel, Irresponsible, and Wrong: Examining Trump's Revived Conspiracy Theory Surrounding Vince Foster's Death The shocking and tragic death of Vince Foster, Deputy White House Counsel, in 1993 left a trail of heartache and unanswered questions in its wake. Now, over two decades later, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has reignited the conspiracy theory fire that has long claimed Foster's suicide was actually a murder orchestrated by none other than Bill and Hillary Clinton. This revival of a discredited theory is misleading, dangerous, and in many ways, a tactic that is both cruel and exploitative. Foster, who was closely connected with the Clintons and held substantial knowledge about their workings, was found dead in a park outside Washington DC, with investigations leading to the conclusion that he had taken his own life. In the months that followed, conspiracy theorists were quick to suggest that Foster's untimely death was the result of the Clintons silencing him due to his involvement in their alleged Whitewater scandal. Despite five separate investigations finding that Foster indeed committed suicide, Trump's recent comments continue to cast doubt on the official findings. In a recent interview, Trump was asked about Foster's death and his troubling relationship with the Clintons, to which he replied, \\"He knew everything that was going on [with the Clintons], and then all of a sudden he committed suicide.\\" This response clearly echoes the sentiments of those who still question the truth surrounding Foster's death. Foster's sister, Sheila Foster Anthony, has bravely broken her silence and spoken out against Trump's incendiary comments. In an essay published in The Washington Post, Anthony describes her brother's struggle with depression before his death and her unwavering conviction in the cause of his passing. \\"I did not see a suicide coming, yet when I was told that Vince was dead, I knew that he had killed himself. Never for a minute have I doubted that,\\" she writes. It would be reasonable to assume that Trump, who has no personal ties to the Foster family, may not be fully informed about the case. However, for the presidential hopeful to capitalize on a deeply painful family tragedy for his own political gain is both \\"irresponsible\\" and \\"cruel,\\" as Anthony puts it. As we move closer to the 2016 election, it is vital that we delve into the motivations behind Trump's choice to engage in conspiratorial discussions surrounding Foster's death. By injecting renewed doubt into an already emotional and deeply painful situation, is Trump simply pandering to the beliefs of his audience, or is he wholeheartedly endorsing an unproven theory at the expense of the lives that Foster left behind? Regardless of the motives, one thing is abundantly clear: With each cruel, inflammatory statement, Trump demonstrates an apparent willingness to subordinate the truth in the name of personal gain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: USA Snapshots and other regular graphs abound. This premise tells us that USA Snapshots, as well as other regular graphs, are abundant or are found in copious amounts. Regular graphs refer to those graphs in which each vertex has the same degree (i.e., the same number of edges connected to it). USA Snapshots, though not explicitly defined, can be inferred to be a subset of regular graphs or a type of regular graph related to the USA, since the premise has grouped them together. Hypothesis: USA Snapshots and other regular graphs are plentiful. This hypothesis states that USA Snapshots and other regular graphs are plentiful or easily found. In essence, it suggests that these graphs exist in large quantities or are widespread.

Therefore, it can be deduced that if the premise is true (i.e., if USA Snapshots and other regular graphs abound), then the hypothesis would also be true (i.e., USA Snapshots and other regular graphs are plentiful). In conclusion, it is possible to assert that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis, as they both convey a similar concept.

Twenty years ago, the five years old boy Michael Hawthorne witnessed his father killing his mother with an axe in an empty road and committing suicide later. On the present days, Michael (Gordon Currie) invites his girlfriend Peg (Stacy Grant) and his best friends Chris (Myc Agnew), Jennifer (Emmanuelle Vaugier), Lisa Ann (Kelly Benson), Ned (Brendon Beiser), Mitch Maldive (Phillip Rhys) and Trish (Rachel Hayward) to spend the Halloween in the country with his grandparents in their farm. He asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest innermost fear, and together with his Indian friend Crow (Byron Chief Moon), they would perform an ancient Indian celebration using the carved wooden dummy Morty (Jon Fedele) that would eliminate their fears forever. The greatest fear of Michael is to become a serial killer like his father, but something goes wrong and Morty turns into his father, killing his friends. \\"The Fear: Resurrection\\" is a disappointing and pointless slash movie that uses the interesting concept of eliminating the greatest innermost fear of each friend before it grows, but in a messy screenplay full of clichés. There are some exaggerated performances, like for example Ms. Betsy Palmer; others very weak, but in general the acting is good. Unfortunately there is no explanation why the dummy is brought to live; further, in spite of being surrounded by close friends, the group does not feel pain or sorrow when each one of them dies. The low-pace along more than fifty minutes could have been used to built a better dramatic situation. In the very end, Michael shows a charm that his father was interested that I have not noticed along the story. I do not know whether the previous reference was edited in the DVD released in Brazil with 87 minutes running time. The special effects are very reasonable for a B-movie. My vote is four.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Who is more likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight? Ronaldo and Jeff are two college roommates that have similar body structure and similar physical activity levels. Ronaldo is a nutrition enthusiast and eats a diet with appropriately low amounts of fat and cholesterol. Jeff, on the other hand, doesn't really care about nutrition at all. He eats whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and as a result he consumes a diet with an inappropriately high amount of fat and cholesterol. Hint: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Jeff is more likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight compared to Ronaldo. There are several factors contributing to this likelihood. First, Ronaldo is a nutrition enthusiast and consciously makes an effort to follow a healthy diet with low amounts of fat and cholesterol. This indicates that he is aware of the potential health risks associated with excess dietary lipids and is actively working to minimize them in his daily food choices. His low-fat and low-cholesterol diet is likely to keep his weight within a healthy range and protect him against potential issues associated with a high-fat diet, such as cardiovascular disease or atherosclerosis. On the other hand, Jeff does not pay much attention to his diet and consumes a high amount of fat and cholesterol without restraint. Due to the high caloric content of dietary lipids, Jeff is consistently providing his body with an excess of energy that, if not burned off through physical activity, will be stored as body fat. His high-fat diet can not only cause unhealthy weight gain but also lead to elevated lipid levels in his blood, increasing his risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease or atherosclerosis. Additionally, Jeff's consumption of saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol poses further risks to his health. These dietary lipids are of particular concern due to their potential contribution to the narrowing of arteries (atherosclerosis) and other conditions which increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and other serious health complications. In conclusion, considering their dietary habits and the potential consequences of excess dietary lipids, Jeff is more likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight compared to his roommate Ronaldo. This is primarily due to Jeff's lack of concern for nutrition and his consumption of high amounts of fat and cholesterol, which can lead to an array of health problems such as cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis. In contrast, Ronaldo's conscientious efforts to maintain a low-fat and low-cholesterol diet protect him from these risks and make it less likely that he will experience the same weight gain or health issues as Jeff."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: When you meet someone for the first time, you will get a general idea in your mind of that person in the first moment. Your feelings about other people, however, are really just show the way that you look at yourself. Your reactions to others say more about you than they do about others. You cannot really love or hate about yourself. We are usually drawn to those who are most like us and may dislike those who have the same characters as ourselves that we dislike. Therefore, you can allow others to be the mirror to see more clearly your own feelings of self-worth. And, you can view the people you judge negatively as mirrors to show you what you are not accepting about yourself. To live peacefully with others, you will need to learn patience. A big challenge is to let your judgment of others be a lifelong research of yourself. Your task is to consider all the decisions and judgments you make onto others carefully and to begin to see whether you can use them to help yourself and become whole. Several days ago I had a business lunch with a man who showed _ table manners. My first feeling was to judge him as rude. When I noticed that I was judging him, I stopped and asked myself what I was feeling. I discovered that I was nervous to be seen with someone who was eating with his mouth open and loudly blowing his nose. I was very surprised to find how much I cared about how the other people in the restaurant judged me. Remember that your judgment of someone will not serve as some kind of protective thing against you becoming like him. Just because I judge my lunch partner as rude, it does not prevent me from ever looking or acting like him. In the same way, my patience to him would not cause me to suddenly begin eating my food with my mouth open. When you get close to life in this manner, those with whom you hate very much as well as those whom you admire and love can be seen as mirrors, guiding you to discover parts of yourself that you dislike and to embrace your greatest characters you are proud of.

In other words, one usually acquires German citizenship if a parent is a German citizen, irrespective of place of birth, or by birth in Germany to parents with foreign nationality if certain requirements are fulfilled. Naturalisation is also possible for foreign nationals after six to eight years of legal residence in Germany. However, non-EU and non-Swiss citizens must usually renounce their old citizenship before being naturalised in Germany. Citizens of other EU countries and of Switzerland usually can keep their old citizenship. Some EU countries do not allow dual citizenship even with other EU countries.

Options: + Wrap dog bed with old shower curtain.; + Wrap dog bed with old bed sheet.;","completion":"To determine which of the given options is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning when aiming to increase cushion for a dog bed, we must analyze both options and their implications on the overall comfort and softness of the dog bed. Option 1: Wrap dog bed with an old shower curtain. A shower curtain is typically made of, but not limited to, vinyl, PVC, or polyester materials, which are water-resistant and suitable for moisture-rich environments. However, these materials do not tend to provide additional cushioning or comfort to the dog bed due to their stiffness, thickness, or relatively non-porous nature. Pros: - Easy to clean and maintain - Water-resistant and suitable for outdoor use Cons: - Limited cushioning effect due to the nature of the material - Possible discomfort or irritation for dogs sensitive to synthetic materials - Lack of breathability, which may lead to overheating or a build-up of odor Option 2: Wrap dog bed with an old bed sheet. Bed sheets are generally crafted from cotton, polyester, or a blend of both materials. As these fabrics are soft, lightweight, and breathable, they are more suitable for providing an increase in cushioning and comfort for a dog bed. Pros: - Increased cushioning due to softer materials used - Breathable, allowing for adequate air circulation and reduced odor build-up - Gentle on the dog's skin, reducing the risk of irritation or sensitivity - Easy to wash Cons: - Not as water-resistant as a shower curtain, which may make it less suitable for outdoor use - Requires more frequent laundering to maintain cleanliness and hygiene Based on naive physics reasoning, we can deduce that wrapping the dog bed with an old bed sheet is the more sound option, as it provides better cushioning, comfort, and breathability compared to a shower curtain. Although a shower curtain may offer water resistance, its stiffness and lack of breathability may counteract any potential benefits. In this instance, the softness and added cushioning provided by the bed sheet outweighs its lack of water resistance, making it the more suitable choice for increasing cushioning and enhancing the dog bed's overall comfort."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who was classified legally as a Frenchman? ? Little is known for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is inferential and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin was born in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, \\"des Prez\\" was an alternative name.According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a friend and librarian of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet. All records from Saint-Quentin were destroyed in 1669; however the collegiate chapel there was a center of music-making for the entire area, and in addition was...

Article: When we interviewed what the life was like more than 70 years ago, many old soldiers were full of tears in their eyes. They told us that they never forgot those days when they were in the army, during which they lived hard lives but spared no effort to fight against the enemies. Now in the year 2015 comes the first great parade in the 21stcentury. September 3rdis the 70thanniversary of the victory of the anti-fascist war. This day is considered as an important moment for China, as well as the world. 49 countries from all over the world, including South Korea and some European countries attended this special occasion. In preparation for the parade, the soldiers worked hard every day. In order to walk well in the three hundred meters distance on the Tian'anmen Square, they had to receive extremely strict training. Each day, they got up early in the morning and started the 10 hours' practice. When a reporter arrived, it was raining heavily outside, but none of the soldiers stopped training. Nothing can stop their training, and no one can stop their deep love to their motherland. The reporter asked, \\"The training is so hard but why does nobody give up?\\" \\"It's the first time for me to join in such an important ceremony. I consider it a great honor. I must try my best.\\" One of the participants answered. In fact, everyone takes pride in taking part in this big parade because they want to show the spirit of Chinese army, the power of Chinese army, as well as the determination of keeping the world in peace. From the soldiers, we learned the power of dreams. If one has a dream, he will get over any difficulties that get in the way to make the dream come true.

Please answer the following question: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness. The result of two or three hours of hung-over labour was thinkofthechildren.co.uk, a spoof campaign site which claimed to offer a handy online guide for crazy vigilantes of all stripes to co-ordinate their crazy vigilante efforts. Although there are a few parts of the site I'm still a bit proud of, the majority of it was, I freely admit, satire of the lowest order.

Please answer the following question: Saturated hydrocarbons are given the general name of alkanes . The name of specific alkanes always ends in - ane . The first part of the name indicates how many carbon atoms each molecule of the alkane has. The smallest alkane is methane. It has just one carbon atom. The next largest is ethane, with two carbon atoms. The chemical formulas and properties of methane, ethane, and several other alkanes are listed in Table below . The boiling and melting points of alkanes are determined mainly by the number of carbon atoms they have. Alkanes with more carbon atoms generally have higher boiling and melting points. Two brothers studied chemistry in school. Ted studied alkanes, while Ned studied cycloalkanes. They both received grade A. Which brother learned more about methane? Answer:","completion":"Ted, the brother who studied alkanes, learned more about methane. To understand this answer, we need to delve into the differences between alkanes and cycloalkanes as well as the nature of methane and its relevance in each of these chemical categories. Alkanes, also known as saturated hydrocarbons, are organic compounds consisting of single bonds between carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms. These molecules are made up of a continuous chain of carbon atoms, each bonded to at least two hydrogen atoms. Alkanes can be subdivided into three types: linear (straight-chain) alkanes, branched alkanes, and cycloalkanes. Cycloalkanes, on the other hand, are a specific subset of alkanes, where the carbon atoms form a closed ring or cyclic structure rather than a continuous chain. Cycloalkanes, like alkanes, are also saturated hydrocarbons containing only single covalent bonds. However, due to their ring structure, they have unique chemical and physical properties compared to their straight-chain counterparts. Methane (CH4) is the simplest and smallest alkane, consisting of a single carbon atom bonded to four hydrogen atoms. Since it is an alkane with a single carbon atom and no possibility of forming a cyclic structure, methane cannot be categorized as a cycloalkane. When comparing the two brothers, Ted, who studied alkanes, would have undoubtedly covered the topic of methane, as it is the smallest and simplest member of the alkane family. As alkanes are characterized by their single-bonded carbon-hydrogen structures, the concept of methane would have been fundamental to Ted's studies. Conversely, Ned, who studied cycloalkanes, would have focused on the ring structures formed by the carbon atoms in these molecules. Methane, being a monatomic (single-carbon atom) alkane, does not fit the cycloalkane category, as it is unable to form a closed ring. Consequently, Ned would have been less likely to learn about methane in his studies of cycloalkanes. Therefore, based on the differences in their respective subjects of study, we can conclude that Ted, the brother who studied alkanes, learned more about methane than his brother Ned, who studied cycloalkanes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country., Jordan ('), officially The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan ('), is an Arab kingdom in Western Asia, on the East Bank of the Jordan River. Jordan is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the east and south, Iraq to the north-east, Syria to the north, Israel, Palestine and the Dead Sea to the west and the Red Sea in its extreme south-west. Jordan is strategically located at the crossroads of Asia, Africa and Europe. The capital, Amman, is Jordan's most populous city as well as the country's economic, political and cultural centre., Judaism (from , derived from Greek , originally from Hebrew , \\"Yehudah\\", \\"Judah\\"; in Hebrew: , \\"Yahadut\\", the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos) encompasses the religion, philosophy, culture and way of life of the Jewish people. Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion, with the Torah as its foundational text (part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible), and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud.

Such cities may also contain at least one headquarters complex (often containing a religious edifice, seminary, shrine, residence of the leading cleric of the religion and/or chambers of the religious leadership's offices) which constitutes a major destination of human traffic, or pilgrimage to the city, especially for major ceremonies and observances. A holy city is a symbolic city, representing attributes beyond its natural characteristics. Marketing experts have suggested that holy cities may be the oldest brands, and more specifically, place brands because they have value added via the perception of religious adherents., Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians.

The West Bank also contains a significant section of the western Dead Sea shore., The Judaean Mountains or Judaean Hills (\\"Harei Yehuda\\", \\"Jibal Al Khalil\\"), is a mountain range in Israel and the West Bank where Jerusalem and several other biblical cities are located. The mountains reach a height of . The Judean Mountains can be separated to a number of sub-regions, including the Mount Hebron ridge, the Jerusalem ridge and the Judean slopes. These mountains formed the heartland of the Kingdom of Judah, where the earliest Jewish settlements emerged., Israel , officially known as the State of Israel, is a country in the Middle East, on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea. It has land borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan on the east, the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively, and Egypt to the southwest. The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. Israel's financial and technology center is Tel Aviv, while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is Jerusalem, although the state's sovereignty over the city of Jerusalem is internationally unrecognized., The Gaza Strip (' ), or simply Gaza\\"', is a small self-governing Palestinian territory on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, that borders Egypt on the southwest for and Israel on the east and north along a border. Gaza, together with the West Bank, comprise the Palestinian territories claimed by the Palestinians as the State of Palestine. The territories of Gaza and the West Bank are separated from each other by Israeli territory. Both fall under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, but Gaza has since June 2007 been governed by Hamas, a Palestinian Islamic organization which came to power in free elections in 2006. It has been placed under an Israeli and U.S.-led international economic and political boycott from that time onwards., The Bank of Israel is the central bank of Israel. It is located in Kiryat HaMemshala in Jerusalem, with a branch office in Tel Aviv. The current governor is Karnit Flug, the first female Governor of the Bank of Israel., Hungary is a unitary parliamentary republic in Central Europe. It covers an area of , situated in the Carpathian Basin and bordered by Slovakia to the north, Romania to the east, Serbia to the south, Croatia to the southwest, Slovenia to the west, Austria to the northwest, and Ukraine to the northeast. With about 10 million inhabitants, Hungary is a medium-sized member state of the European Union. The official language is Hungarian, which is the most widely spoken Uralic language in the world. Hungary's capital and largest metropolis is Budapest, a significant economic hub, classified as an Alpha- global city. Major urban areas include Debrecen, Szeged, Miskolc, Pécs and Gyr., The Israel Museum (\\"Muze'on Yisrael\\") was founded in 1965 as Israel's national museum. It is situated on a hill in the Givat Ram neighborhood of Jerusalem, near the Bible Lands Museum, the Knesset, the Israeli Supreme Court, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. , Jerusalem , is a city located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. One of the oldest cities in the world, Jerusalem was named as \\"\\"Urusalima\\"\\" on ancient Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets, probably meaning \\"City of Shalem\\" after a Canaanite deity, during the early Canaanite period (approximately 2400 BCE). During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. It is considered a holy city in the three major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam., The Academy of the Hebrew Language (\\"Ha-Akademya la-Lashon ha-Ivrit\\") was established by the Israeli government in 1953 as the \\"supreme institution for scholarship on the Hebrew language in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem of Givat Ram campus.\\" It is an educational institution with the mission of creating new Hebrew words to ensure that the language does not die out. , Lebanon , officially known as the Lebanese Republic, is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered by Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south, while Cyprus is west across the Mediterranean Sea. Lebanon's location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterland facilitated its rich history and shaped a cultural identity of religious and ethnic diversity. At just 10,452 km (4,036 sq. mi.), it is the smallest recognized country on the entire mainland Asian continent., The Kingdom of Judah (\\"Mamlekhet Yehudh\\") was an Iron Age kingdom of the Southern Levant. The Hebrew Bible depicts it as the successor to a United Monarchy, but historians are divided about the veracity of this account. In the 10th and early 9th centuries BCE the territory of Judah appears to have been sparsely populated, limited to small rural settlements, most of them unfortified. Jerusalem, the kingdom's capital, likely did not emerge as a significant administrative centre until the end of the 8th century, prior to this archaeological evidence suggests its population was too small to sustain a viable kingdom. In the 7th century its population increased greatly, prospering under Assyrian vassalage (despite Hezekiah's revolt against the Assyrian king Sennacherib), but in 605 the Assyrian Empire was defeated, and the ensuing competition between the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt and the Neo-Babylonian Empire for control of the Eastern Mediterranean led to the destruction of the kingdom in a series of campaigns between 597 and 582, the deportation of the elite of the community, and the incorporation of Judah into a province of the Neo-Babylonian Empire., Syria, officially known as the Syrian Arab Republic (\\"\\"), is a country in Western Asia, bordering Lebanon and the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east, Jordan to the south, and Israel to the southwest. Syria's capital and largest city is Damascus., \\"Palestinian territories\\" and \\"occupied Palestinian territories\\" (OPT or oPt) are descriptions often used to describe the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip, which are occupied or otherwise under the control of Israel. Israeli governments have maintained that the area involved is within territorial dispute. The extent of the territories, while subject to future negotiations, have frequently been defined by the Green Line., Canaan (Northwest Semitic: \\"\\"; Phoenician: ; Biblical Hebrew/ Masoretic: [\\"; nan]\\") was a Semitic-speaking region in the Ancient Near East during the late 2nd millennium BC. In the Bible it corresponds to the Levant, in particular to the areas of the Southern Levant that provide the main setting of the narrative of the Hebrew Bible, i.e., the area of Israel, Philistia, Phoenicia, and other nations., The Mediterranean Sea (pronounced ) is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and on the east by the Levant. The sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean, although it is usually identified as a separate body of water., The Dead Sea (lit. Salt Sea), is a salt lake bordered by Jordan to the east and Israel and Palestine to the west. Its surface and shores are below sea level, Earth's lowest elevation on land. The Dead Sea is deep, the deepest hypersaline lake in the world. With 34.2% salinity (in 2011), it is 9.6 times as salty as the ocean, and one of the world's saltiest bodies of water. This salinity makes for a harsh environment in which plants and animals cannot flourish, hence its name. The Dead Sea is long and wide at its widest point. It lies in the Jordan Rift Valley and its main tributary is the Jordan River., West Germany is the common English name for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG (or \\"RFA\\") in the period between its creation on 23 May 1949 to German reunification on 3 October 1990. During this Cold War era, NATO-aligned West Germany and Warsaw Pact-aligned East Germany were divided by the Inner German border. After 1961 West Berlin was physically separated from East Berlin as well as from East Germany by the Berlin Wall.

At one point, word went out that President Obama's transport aboard Marine One was cancelled in lieu of a motorcade due to the weather. We were not privy to the decisions made, but ultimately Marine One complimented by a Chinook haling staff and reporters landed in Elmwood. My producer and I looked at each other under the blue skies and elected to leave our rain coats in the car so we didn't need to haul them the quarter mile to the live location. It wasn't until Marine One landed and the President had already been through a few ceremonial steps that anyone paid any attention to the wall of black clouds massing overhead. There was a brief warning with a trickle of rain and lightening cracking off in the distance. Then the skies opened up. Lots of people headed for the press tent, but the citizens who made the trip to hear the President seemed determined to stick out the weather as long as the commander in chief was still willing to make a go of it. Finally, we saw that the program had been truncated and the President was headed for the podium ahead of a list of speakers. All the media in the press tent huddled around a television monitor in hopes of hearing the speech, however, little could be understood between the sound of the rain and attendees scrambling for a little dry real estate. It seems the President called an audible. With rivers pouring off his black umbrella and thunderclaps drowning him out, President Obama urged all the people who came to hear him speak, to move slowly for their cars. It wasn't safe to be standing outside in a lightning storm. And, he didn't say this but it seemed obvious that we should collectively have enough sense to come in out of the rain.

Article: \\"A photograph that one has taken of oneself, typically with a smart phone or webcam and uploaded to a social media website\\" is the definition of \\"selfie\\" in the Oxford English Dictionary. In fact, it wasn't even in the dictionary until August of last year. It earned its place there because people are now so obsessed with (......) selfies - we take them when we try on a new hat, play with our pets or when we meet a friend whom we haven't seen in a while. But is there any scientific explanation for this obsession? Well, you should probably ask James Kilner, a neuroscientist at University College London. Through our lifetime we become experts at recognizing and interpreting other people's faces and facial expressions. In contrast, according to Kilner, we have a very poor understanding of our own faces since we have little experience of looking at them - we just feel them most of the time. This has been proved in previous studies, according to the BBC. Kilner found that most people chose the more attractive picture. This suggests that we tend to think of ourselves as better-looking than we actually are. To further test how we actually _ our own faces, Kilner carried out another study. He showed people different versions of their own portrait - the original, one that had been edited to look less attractive and one that was made more attractive - and asked them to pick the version which they thought looked most like them. They chose the more attractive version. But what does it say about selfies? Well, isn't that obvious? Selfies give us the power to create a photograph - by taking it from various angles, with different poses, using filters and so on - that better matches our expectations with our actual faces. \\"You suddenly have control in a way that you don't have in non-virtual interactions,\\" Kilner told the Canada-based CTV News. Selfies allow you \\"to keep taking pictures until you manage to take one you're happy with\\", he explained. Question: What is the passage mainly about? - The definition and fun of taking selfies. - A study of why people love taking selfies. - How taking selfies influences people's daily lives. - How to interpret people's facial expressions in their selfies.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Greg Tenorly drove the familiar route from the church to his music studio, studying the homes along the way. He wondered about the families who lived in each one. Like that two-story brick on the corner. What secrets were they hiding? Was the husband abusive? Did a teenager use drugs? Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived. Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost. Greg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance. Greg gladly paid 4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back. He said it was like losing a member of the family. Greg felt bad, but not bad enough to give up the car. How could a 40-year-old car have only 93,000 miles on it? It was dazzling. His little studio was near the town square, nestled between Coreyville Hardware and Susie's Sewing Box. Occasionally he and a student could hear a pipe wrench or hammer hitting the floor on the hardware side. But things were always quiet from Susie's side. At least the soundproofing he had installed kept his neighbors from hearing his students. You can't teach music without hearing both beautiful sounds and sour notes. What is probably true about Greg? - He loves teaching music - He loves horror stories. - not enough information - He's in the Navy. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is reasonable to conclude that Greg Tenorly loves teaching music. There are several elements in the passage that support this conclusion. Firstly, Greg has a music studio where he teaches private lessons, indicating that he is passionate and dedicated to his craft. Moreover, he is concerned about losing money from missed private lessons due to potential jury duty, suggesting that he values his work as a music teacher. Additionally, the passage highlights Greg's appreciation for beautiful sounds, as he is aware that teaching music involves both wonderful melodies and less appealing notes. This appreciation for music further supports the notion that Greg loves teaching music. The other statements listed as potential conclusions cannot be definitively confirmed or refuted based on the information provided: - There is no indication that Greg loves horror stories. The passage does mention him contemplating the secrets and potential issues faced by the families in the homes he passes, but there is no clear connection to a love of horror stories. - Not enough information. While it may be true that there is not enough information to have a complete understanding of Greg, based on the passage, it is evident that he loves teaching music. - Greg is not in the Navy. The mention of a career Navy man is in regard to the person from whom Greg purchased his red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible. There is no mention or indication that Greg himself is in the Navy. In fact, Greg is a part-time employee at a church, which is more information that we have about his background. In conclusion, based on the details provided in the passage, it is most accurate to claim that Greg Tenorly loves teaching music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The program focused on a recent controversial issue, triggered by First Experimental Primary School in Northwestern China's Xi'an that made children whose schoolwork and general behavior were not yet good enough to wear green scarves instead of the red scarf of the Chinese Young Pioneers. \\"The original idea for designing the green scarf was to strengthen education and to encourage the pupils to work harder,\\" said Chen Hong, the school's principal. The practice that divided students into \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" has aroused a lot of discussions on Sina Weibo, a Chinese twitter-like microblogging website. The color1 of green in Chinese culture carries an annoying implication particularly because \\"green hats\\" are the Chinese symbol of a cuckold.

Answer the following question: This article: Tim Warden, a boy with autism, has supposedly witnessed his parents' double murder. Jake Rainer, a former child psychiatrist turned therapist, is called on to probe the child's mind in order to solve the case. The psychological drama is provided by the fact that not even Jake can entice Tim to communicate what he has or has not seen regarding the crime. Tim's sister, Sylvie, is protective of him. She eventually warms to Jake's efforts, but is concerned when she learns he was implicated in the suicide of another young child who was under his care. Jake gradually befriends Tim. At first, Jake thinks that Tim is trying to communicate by cutting up playing cards, but Sylvie reveals that Tim is good at mimicking voices. Jake is able to trigger Tim's memory so that Tim mimics the voices he heard on the night of the murder by using the trigger phrase \\"God Damn,\\" which were the first words Tim heard from the murder. He attempts to piece together the chronology of the murder, suspecting that Tim interrupted a fight between his parents and an intruder. Sheriff Mitch Rivers threatens to use drugs to get Tim to talk about the murder and Dr. Rene Harlinger successfully hypnotizes Tim into breaking down a locked door. The police chief, seeing this as proof of Tim's strength, concludes that Tim was the murderer, after finding photographs showing that Tim's father was molesting him. That night, Sylvie plans to take Tim away and attempts to convince Jake to run away with them. She fails, and instead paralyzes Jake and throws him into an icy lake to drown him.

Add them together to get: (4941 + 2499)*y = 124259 + 128701 Step 2: Perform the arithmetic operations on both sides Adding 4941 and 2499 gives us 7440, so the equation becomes: 7440*y = 124259 + 128701 Now, add 124259 and 128701: 124259 + 128701 = 252960 So the equation is now: 7440*y = 252960 Step 3: Solve for y by dividing both sides of the equation by 7440 To isolate y, divide both sides of the equation by 7440: y = 252960 / 7440 Step 4: Perform the final arithmetic operation to get the value of y 252960 / 7440 = 34 So the solution for y is: y = 34"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Per WTVR, Clayton Litten was perusing his new bathroom floor from his perch on the porcelain throne when he spotted what he says is a \\"one in a trillion\\" sighting—a \\"perfect\\" depiction of the GOP presumptive nominee within the tile's riveting Rorschach, standing with arms folded. \\"This cannot be. There's no way,\\" Litten tells the station he said when his eyes fell upon this lavatory vision, which he confirmed with workers who were still toiling away on his bathroom remodel. Litten, who's said to be suffering from incurable lung cancer, doesn't leave the house except for doctor visits, and he mainly corresponds with people via email, per the Genorosity.com page set up in his name. He tells WTVR he used that email account to shoot off a pic of the tile to Trump's campaign in the hopes that he might snag a meeting with the candidate when he's in nearby Richmond Friday for a rally. He adds he's a Republican who, tile or no tile, intends to vote for Trump in November (Litten says he hasn't heard back yet).

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: The brass instruments were only used for the 1 April 1725 version of what? ? Bach structured the cantata in eight movements: an instrumental sinfonia and seven vocal movements corresponding to the stanzas of the hymn. The duration is given as 22 minutes.The title of the original parts of the first Leipzig performance is (in Johann Christoph Altnickol's handwriting): \\"Feria Paschatos / Christ lag in Todes Banden / a.4. Voc: / Cornetto / 3 Trombon. / 2 Violini / 2 Viole / con / Continuo / Di Sign. Joh.Seb.Bach\\", In this late version, Bach scored the work for four vocal parts (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), and bass (B)), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble consisting of strings, brass and continuo. The brass parts, a choir of cornetto (Ct) and three trombones (Tb) playing colla parte with the voices at times, may have been added in the 1720s. They may also possibly represent the original scoring, in the style of the 17th-century polychoral tradition.The scoring of the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden has been described as \\"archaic\\" and its style \\"medieval\\": The string section consists of two violin parts (Vl) and two viola parts (VA); this indicates an older practice as for instance found in 17th-century church cantatas by Bach's ancestors (see Altbachisches Archiv), and in Jesus Christus ist um unsrer Missetat willen verwundet, a Passion setting from the early 18th century (or older) which Bach had performed a few years after composing the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden. In the first half of the 18th century the standard for a string section soon evolved to two violin parts, one viola part and continuo. The cornett used in the cantata was an instrument that belonged to an earlier age: by the second quarter of the 18th century it had almost entirely disappeared from Bach's compositions. The brass instruments were only used for the 1 April 1725 version of the work. The other performances (24 April 1707, 8 April 1708, and 9 April 1724) were performed without brass instruments (i.e., Cornetto and three Trombones). The first version (1707 and 1708) concluded with the words of...

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Portugal's colonial history has long since been a cornerstone of its national identity, as has its geographic position at the south-western corner of Europe, looking out into the Atlantic Ocean. It was one of the last western colonial European powers to give up its overseas territories (among them Angola and Mozambique in 1975), turning over the administration of Macau to the People's Republic of China at the end of 1999. Consequently, it has both influenced and been influenced by cultures from former colonies or dependencies, resulting in immigration from these former territories for both economic and/or personal reasons. Portugal, long a country of emigration (the vast majority of Brazilians have Portuguese ancestry), has now become a country of net immigration, and not just from the last Indian (Portuguese until 1961), African (Portuguese until 1975), and Far East Asian (Portuguese until 1999) overseas territories. An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country's African possessions gained independence in 1975. By 2007, Portugal had 10,617,575 inhabitants of whom about 332,137 were legal immigrants.\\"? The answer is:","completion":"Based on the passage, \\"Portugal's colonial history has long since been a cornerstone of its national identity,\\" it is clear that colonialism has played a significant role in shaping Portugal's development, culture, and society. Additionally, the country has experienced both emigration and immigration, with individuals of Portuguese ancestry living in countries like Brazil and a large number of people returning to Portugal as its former African territories gained independence in 1975. Furthermore, Portugal has seen immigration not only from its former overseas territories but also from other parts of the world. A good question to test students' ability to read this passage and answer questions about it could be: How has Portugal's colonial history and geographic position impacted its culture, society, and immigration patterns? This question allows students to analyze the passage and draw conclusions about the lasting effects of Portugal's colonial past and its relationships with various countries and regions as both a source of emigration and a destination for immigration. To answer this question, students would need to consider the mentioned aspects of Portugal's colonial history, the return of Portuguese people to the country following the independence of its African territories, as well as the immigration from its former territories in India, Africa, and Far East Asia. Students should discuss the influence of colonialism and Portugal's location at the south-western corner of Europe, which has led to the exchange of cultures between Portugal and its former colonies. Students can also mention that by 2007, about 332,137 legal immigrants lived in Portugal, highlighting the shift from a country of emigration to one of net immigration. They should also acknowledge the impact this immigration has had on the Portuguese society, as people from various backgrounds and experiences contribute to a diverse and evolving culture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His teacher alerts astronomer Dr. Marcus Wolf, who realizes that the object is a comet on a collision course with Earth. Wolf dies in a car accident before he can alert the world. One year later, MSNBC journalist Jenny Lerner investigates the sudden resignation of Secretary of the Treasury Alan Rittenhouse and his connection to \\"Ellie\\", supposedly a mistress.

Summarize this article: Sooner or later, all children will find themselves in a world where they need to obey the rules or suffer harsh consequences. By making your children obey the rules at home, you're actually doing them a favor in the long run. Don't ever punish your children unless they're disrespectful, but when they are, don't hesitate to show them that they've done something wrong. Your rules should be reasonable, simple, and consistent. Be clear with your children about what the rules in your house early on. Don't get upset if your children break a rule that they weren't even aware of. When your child is disrespectful to you, you have two choices: you can lash out in the same way, or you can fight to stay calm. The former option teaches your child that it is acceptable to be rude when someone starts frustrating you. The latter, which is the better choice, teaches that it's important to stay respectful even in the face of people who won't do the same for you. If you can manage to stay respectful, your children will thank you when they eventually have to deal with an annoying boss or an unpleasant teacher. This is vital. Consistent enforcement of your rules shows your children that it's not possible to weasel out of their responsibilities. On the other hand, if you fail to teach your children respect when you're tired or when it's inconvenient, they'll quickly learn that they can get away with bad behavior sometimes. Children are smarter than they're often given credit for. If there's a way for them to get out of learning a valuable lesson, they'll often find it. It's also important to make sure your partner is on the same page as you here. Having one caretaker who is \\"hard\\" and another who is \\"soft\\" will just teach your children to go to the soft one when they've misbehaved. Whenever you can, have the punishment for disrespect be the natural consequences of your child's actions. In other words, if their disrespect causes something bad to happen to them, let this happen (as long as it is not a serious, physical danger, obviously). The earlier children learn that being disrespectful only creates problems for themselves, the better. For example, if your child is repeatedly rude to her friend when they are playing together, a good natural consequence might be to send the friend home, have your child hand-write an apology letter, and hand-deliver it. Summary:","completion":"The article stresses the importance of teaching children about the necessity to follow rules and respect others. It highlights that maintaining consistent, simple and reasonable rules at home will help children understand their responsibilities and expectations. It advises parents to establish clear house rules early on and not to punish children for violating rules they weren't aware of. Aggression should not be used in response to a child's disrespect, instead, remaining calm and respectful serves as a more efficient teaching tool. Consistently reinforcing rules and consequences helps children understand that they can't avoid their responsibilities. It suggests that parents should work together to enforce rules and avoid showing conflicting discipline styles. The best punishment for disrespect is allowing children to face the natural consequences of their actions, teaching them that disrespect brings unfavorable outcomes. For instance, if a child is repeatedly rude to a friend, they should be made to apologize personally."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - A duma () is a Russian assembly with advisory or legislative functions. The term comes from the Russian verb (\\"dumat\\") meaning \\"to think\\" or \\"to consider\\". The first formally constituted duma was the State Duma introduced into the Russian Empire by Tsar Nicholas II in 1906. It was dissolved in 1917 during the Russian Revolution. Since 1993, the State Duma is the lower legislative house of the Russian Federation. - Russia is not proportionately populated between the smaller western portion (almost 25%) of the country that is considered part of Europe, and the larger eastern portion (more than 75%) that is part of Asia. European Russia contains about 77% of the country's population (110,000,000 people out of about 144,000,000) in an area comprising almost 4 million km (1.54 million mi); an average of 27.5 persons per km (70 per mi). This territory makes up 38% of Europe. Its eastern border is defined by the Ural Mountains and in the south, it is defined by the border with Kazakhstan. This area includes Moscow and Saint Petersburg, the two largest cities in Russia. - An upper house, sometimes called a Senate, is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature (or one of three chambers of a tricameral legislature), the other chamber being the lower house. The house formally designated as the upper house is usually smaller, and often has more restricted power, than the lower house. Examples of upper houses in countries include the UK's House of Lords, Canada's Senate, India's Rajya Sabha, Russia's Federation Council, Ireland's Seanad, Germany's Bundesrat and the United States Senate. - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - Russia (from the Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - A legislature is a deliberative assembly with the authority to make laws for a political entity such as a country or city. Legislatures form important parts of most governments; in the separation of powers model, they are often contrasted with the executive and judicial branches of government. - Saint Petersburg is Russia's second-largest city after Moscow, with five million inhabitants in 2012, and an important Russian port on the Baltic Sea. It is politically incorporated as a federal subject (a federal city). Situated on the Neva River, at the head of the Gulf of Finland on the Baltic Sea, it was founded by Tsar Peter the Great on May . In 1914, the name was changed from Saint Petersburg to Petrograd, in 1924 to Leningrad, and in 1991 back to Saint Petersburg. Between 17131728 and 17321918, Saint Petersburg was the imperial capital of Russia. In 1918, the central government bodies moved to Moscow. - Moscow (or ) is the capital and most populous city of Russia, with 12.2 million residents within the city limits and 16.8 million within the urban area. Moscow has the status of a Russian federal city. - Yekaterinburg, alternatively romanised as \\"Ekaterinburg\\", is the fourth-largest city in Russia and the administrative centre of Sverdlovsk Oblast, located in the middle of the Eurasian continent, on the border of Europe and Asia. At the 2010 Census, it had a population of 1,349,772. - Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin (1 February 1931 23 April 2007) was a Soviet and Russian politician and the first President of the Russian Federation, serving from 1991 to 1999. Originally a supporter of Mikhail Gorbachev, Yeltsin emerged under the perestroika reforms as one of Gorbachev's most powerful political opponents. During the late 1980s, Yeltsin had been a member of the Politburo, and in late 1987 tendered a letter of resignation in protest. No one had resigned from the Politburo before. This act branded Yeltsin as a rebel and led to his rise in popularity as an anti-establishment figure. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - Novosibirsk is the third-most populous city in Russia after Moscow and St. Petersburg. It is the most populous city in Asian Russia, with a population of 1,473,754 as of the 2010 Census. It is the administrative center of Novosibirsk Oblast as well as of the Siberian Federal District.

In March 1990 he resigned from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and founded of the Democratic Party of Russia . - Nizhny Novgorod, colloquially shortened to Nizhny, is a city in the administrative center of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast and Volga Federal District in Russia. From 1932 to 1990, it was known as Gorky, after the writer Maxim Gorky, who was born there. The city is an important economic, transportation, scientific, educational and cultural center in Russia and the vast Volga-Vyatka economic region, and is the main center of river tourism in Russia. In the historical part of the city there are a large number of universities, theaters, museums and churches. Nizhny Novgorod is located about 400 km east of Moscow, where the Oka empties into the Volga. Population: - A constitution is a set of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a state or other organization is governed. These rules together make up, i.e. \\"constitute\\", what the entity is. When these principles are written down into a single document or set of legal documents, those documents may be said to embody a \\"written\\" constitution; if they are written down in a single comprehensive document, it is said to embody a \\"codified\\" constitution. Some constitutions (such as the constitution of the United Kingdom) are uncodified, but written in numerous fundamental Acts of a legislature, court cases or treaties. - The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union (\\"Verkhóvnyj Sovét SSSR\\") was the highest legislative body in the Soviet Union and the only one with the power to pass constitutional amendments. It elected the Presidium serving as the collective head of state of the Soviet Union, formed the Council of Ministers and the Supreme Court, and appointed the Procurator General of the Soviet Union. - The State Duma ((Gosudarstvennaya Duma), common abbreviation: (Gosduma)) in the Russian Federation is the lower house of the Federal Assembly of Russia (legislature), the upper house being the Federation Council of Russia. The Duma headquarters are located in central Moscow, a few steps from Manege Square. Its members are referred to as deputies. The State Duma replaced the Supreme Soviet as a result of the new constitution introduced by Boris Yeltsin in the aftermath of the Russian constitutional crisis of 1993, and approved by the Russian public in a referendum.

Let's solve the math problem step by step like we're telling a story. We want to find the number that y stands for. So we start with this problem: 572 * y - 33 + 154 = 693 * y First, let's do the adding part. We have -33 and +154. When we add these two numbers, we get: 121 (Because 154 - 33 = 121) Now our problem looks like this: 572 * y + 121 = 693 * y To find y, we need to get all the \\"y\\" parts on one side. Let's move the 572 * y to the other side by subtracting it from both sides: 693 * y - 572 * y = 121 Now, let's subtract: 121 * y = 121 We're almost there! To find out what y is, we need to divide both numbers by 121: y = 121 / 121 And when we do that, we find that: y = 1 So, in this math problem, y stands for the number 1.

Q: Human protectin (CD59) is a regulator of complement activation that inhibits complement-mediated cell lysis, and thus might confer immune resistance to tumor cells. CD59 expression has been described in a variety of human malignancies, including breast cancer. Since a comprehensive investigation of CD59 expression in prostate cancer has not been conducted yet, we aimed to determine the significance of CD59 expression in prostate cancer.', 'Eighty-six primary adenocarcinomas of the prostate were immunostained using a monoclonal CD59 antibody (clone MEM-43) and a standard detection system. The immunoreactivity of the tumor was evaluated as low versus high for statistical analysis. Additionally, CD59 mRNA levels were determined by real-time PCR in matched (tumor/normal) microdissected tissues from 26 cases.', 'Cytoplasmic CD59 immunoreactivity was found in epithelia of prostate cancer, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, benign hyperplasia, atrophic, and normal glands. High rates of CD59 expression were noted in 36% of prostate cancer cases and were significantly associated with tumor pT stage (P = 0.043), Gleason grade (P = 0.013) and earlier biochemical (PSA) relapse in Kaplan-Meier analysis (P = 0.0013). On RNA level, we found an upregulation in 19.2% (five cases), although the general rate of CD59 transcript was significantly lower in tumor tissue (P = 0.03). A:","completion":"Part 1: Construct a question based on the information in the passage. Usage: What is the main aim of the study conducted on CD59 expression in prostate cancer? The question is based on information provided in the passage and focuses on the main aim of the study. Part 2: Ensure the question is unambiguous. Usage: What is the relationship between CD59 expression levels and Gleason grade? The question is clear and directly asks about the relationship between CD59 expression levels and Gleason grade, as mentioned in the passage. Part 3: Make sure the question can be answered using the passage. Usage: How many primary adenocarcinomas of the prostate were studied for CD59 expression? This question can be answered directly from the passage, which states that 86 primary adenocarcinomas were studied. Part 4: Ensure the answer to the question is unique. Usage: In how many cases was CD59 mRNA upregulated in the microdissected tissue samples? The answer to this question is unique, as it is clearly stated in the passage (five cases). Part 5: The answer should use text phrases from the passage. Usage: What is the relationship between high rates of CD59 expression and tumor pT stage in prostate cancer cases? The answer to this question can be found using the text phrase \\"significantly associated\\" from the passage, as it states that high rates of CD59 expression are significantly associated with tumor pT stage. Part 6: Avoid creating questions that cannot be answered correctly without understanding the passage. Usage: What is the function of human protectin (CD59)? The answer to this question requires understanding the passage, which states that CD59 is a regulator of complement activation that inhibits complement-mediated cell lysis. Part 7: Avoid using the same words or phrases given in the passage. Usage: What is the relationship between CD59 expression and biochemical relapse in prostate cancer cases? This question has been rephrased to avoid the exact same words as the passage but still asks about the connection between CD59 expression and biochemical relapse, as discussed in the passage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A woman is seen speaking to the camera while sitting in a chair and leads to hear sitting in a shower holding a dog. she","completion":"then begins to explain her story, providing the context for the unusual setting and situation we've just witnessed. The woman, named Sarah, is a devoted animal lover and advocate who dedicates her life to rescuing and rehabilitating animals in need. The dog she's holding in the shower, whom she has named Oscar, is her latest rescue. This particular scene captures her ongoing efforts to support Oscar's physical and emotional recovery. Sarah starts by detailing how she came across Oscar, who was found abandoned and in poor health near a local park. Someone had left him without food or water, and suffering from multiple injuries, most likely inflicted by a previous owner. Oscar was in a severe state of shock and fear, barely responsive to human touch. Sarah's mission was to give him a second chance at life by giving him the care, love, and affection he desperately required. In the video, Sarah discusses the importance of patience and understanding when dealing with traumatized animals. She emphasizes that the first step in rehabilitating any rescued animal is to create a sense of safety and trust. In Oscar's case, this involved introducing him to her home, her other rescued pets, and allowing him to gradually familiarize himself with his new surroundings. The video then transitions to the scene in the shower, where Sarah explains that she's using this space to help Oscar overcome his fear of water. Abused animals often associate water with negative experiences or punishment, so it's crucial for Sarah to gently encourage Oscar to view water as a source of comfort and cleanliness. By sitting alongside him in the shower and calmly talking to him as she cradles him in her arms, she's providing a nurturing environment in which Oscar can slowly learn to let go of his fears and anxieties. Throughout the video, Sarah intersperses her own experiences and tips with expert advice from veterinarians and animal behaviorists. This balanced approach highlights the importance of a well-rounded strategy when it comes to the care and rehabilitation of rescued animals like Oscar. Sarah also emphasizes the value of networking and collaborating with local animal shelters, rescue organizations, and other animal lovers in the community. By working together, these individuals and groups can raise awareness, provide valuable resources, and ultimately create a supportive network to help save the lives of countless animals in need. Towards the end of the video, Sarah shares updates on Oscar's progress. With time, love, patience, and proper care, he has slowly started to trust humans again and is beginning to play with Sarah's other pets. His physical wounds are healing, and he's becoming more comfortable and at ease in his environment. By sharing her experiences and providing helpful advice on how to care for and rehabilitate rescued animals, Sarah aims to inspire others to take action, get involved and make a difference in the lives of abandoned, abused, or neglected animals. Through her video and ongoing advocacy efforts, she hopes to create a more compassionate world where animals like Oscar can find a safe haven and a loving home. In conclusion, the story that most naturally follows the initial scene of a woman sitting in a chair leading to her sitting in a shower holding a dog is one of hope, love, and transformation. It is a journey in which Sarah helps Oscar overcome his past traumas and rediscover the joy and beauty of life with the support of a caring human companion and a nurturing environment."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

In \`\` The Guardian '' in 2006 , George Monbiot argued in opposition to Stanage , who had written that the Iraqi insurgency was comparable to the IRA .","completion":"Yes, the two sentences essentially convey the same meaning, but with slight differences in their grammatical structures and choice of words. Let's examine each sentence to identify the similarities and differences. In the first sentence: 1. \\"George Monbiot argued in contrast to Stanage\\" - The phrase \\"in contrast to\\" indicates that Monbiot's argument goes against or has opposite viewpoints from Stanage's argument. 2. \\"who had written that the Iraqi insurgency is comparable to the IRA\\" - The use of the simple present \\"is\\" suggests that the written idea is still relevant and applicable today. In the second sentence: 1. \\"George Monbiot argued in opposition to Stanage\\" - The phrase \\"in opposition to\\" similarly implies that Monbiot's argument is in contrast or disagreement with Stanage. Though the use of \\"opposition\\" is slightly stronger than \\"contrast,\\" both expressions underline this disagreement. 2. \\"who had written that the Iraqi insurgency was comparable to the IRA\\" - Here, the past tense \\"was\\" is employed, indicating that the written idea was relevant at the time of writing but may not necessarily remain true or applicable today. While these distinctions between the two sentences are subtle, they do not change the core meaning of the sentences, which is that in 2006, George Monbiot, writing in \\"The Guardian,\\" disagreed with Stanage's comparison of the Iraqi insurgency to the IRA."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

That question is not difficult to answer if we change the word poetry to songs. I sing when I feel good. When I sing my favorite songs, I feel even better. Sometimes when I am listening to music and to the song words, I feel that it was written for me. A good song always makes me feel something. There are songs that I sing in my head between classes and songs that I want to sing when the school bell rings by the end of the day. They help me get through the day. _ I like songs about love and friendship. The extraordinary thing is that my feelings are more special when I sing my favorite songs in English. I also like reading. I used to avoid poetry until an e-friend told me I should recite poems and not look up the meaning of the words. Poetry uses many difficult words and idioms, but the best thing is to just forget about them. In the beginning I felt quite strange. Now I always lock the door. Reading aloud gives you a strange feeling, but when you have some practice and fall into the rhythm, and the sounds of the words, it is really a special experience. I started with small poems, but now I think I most like long poems. I have different feelings with different poems. When I have had a bad day at school, I read Keats and forget everything. When I am sad I read Wordsworth by the light of a candle. When the poem is finished, I close the book and my sadness is gone. Question: According to the writer, _ .

Options: - fast food restaurant - mall - high school - job - nightclub Explain why a human would choose \\"high school\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would likely choose \\"high school\\" as the place that teenagers hate to go to the most but have the most incentive to attend because of the various factors that contribute to teenagers' feelings about high school and the importance society places on education. 1. Peer pressure and social anxiety: High schools are often places where teenagers experience various social pressures, anxiety, and bullying, as they navigate the complex process of building friendships, fitting in, or dealing with social hierarchies. Consequently, students might not enjoy the experience and dread attending school. 2. Academic pressure: Teenagers are often expected to perform well academically to ensure a successful future, sometimes leading to a considerable amount of stress and anxiety. They may have to tackle numerous assignments, prepare for examinations, or maintain good grades, which might contribute to their dislike of high school. 3. Early start times and lack of sleep: High schools typically have early start times, which can be challenging for teenagers, who may biologically be better predisposed to stay up late and sleep in. 4. Rules and discipline: High school is a structured environment with rules, dress codes, and schedules, which might not sit well with some teenagers, especially as they prefer to assert their independence and autonomy. 5. Boredom or disinterest: Teenagers might not enjoy all subjects taught in high school or find the traditional classroom setting unengaging, leading to boredom or lack of motivation. Despite these factors, high school provides significant incentives for teenagers: 1. Education and personal growth: Attending high school is essential for teenagers to acquire knowledge, learn new subjects, and gain essential life skills, all of which contribute to their personal development and growth. 2. Social interactions: High school provides opportunities to build and maintain friendships, engage in extracurricular activities, and gain exposure to diverse perspectives, which can be beneficial for personal and social development. 3. College and career preparation: High school education is typically mandatory for pursuing college education or professional opportunities in most fields. A high school diploma demonstrates a minimum level of academic accomplishment and is usually a prerequisite for further education and many job opportunities. 4. Scholarships and financial aid: Performing well in high school can potentially lead to scholarships and financial aid for college, providing motivation for students to take their academic pursuit seriously. In conclusion, high school is often the place where teenagers may feel the most pressure and dislike attending, but it holds the most incentive due to its crucial role in shaping their future education and career prospects. The other options in the list may not come with as much stress or impact on their future, making \\"high school\\" the most likely answer to the question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does it follow that \\"Those crafty Chinese. \\"?","completion":"While it is possible that the original statement, \\"Ah, yes, those wily Asians,\\" might be an attempt to refer to a stereotype or commonly held belief, it's important to note that making sweeping generalizations about any racial, ethnic, or national group is both inaccurate and unfair. In the case of the question \\"Does it follow that 'Those crafty Chinese'?\\", it’s essential to examine the context and implications of such a statement and evaluate it based on the facts. The perception of people from China or any other Asian country as being \\"wily\\" or \\"crafty\\" can stem from a variety of historical, cultural, and socio-political factors. Historically, several Asian countries have been known for their diplomacy and strategic thinking in matters of war, trade, and politics. This historical legacy may contribute to the stereotype that is often associated with them. However, it's important to recognize that individuals from any country, including China, should not be judged or stereotyped based on the actions or beliefs of their fellow citizens, historic events, or governments. There is an enormous amount of diversity in cultures, beliefs, values, and personalities within any given population. In that regard, it is crucial to avoid making any sweeping generalizations or perpetuating stereotypes about any ethnic or cultural group, including Chinese people. Adopting such attitudes can lead to racial and cultural biases, discrimination, and misunderstanding. Moreover, it oversimplifies an entire group of people and disregards the uniqueness and complexity of their individual experiences. Instead of relying on stereotypes to describe or understand others, it is more constructive to evaluate individuals on a case-by-case basis, focusing on their personal qualities and characteristics. By doing so, we can foster greater understanding, compassion, and respect for people from different backgrounds and contribute to a more open and inclusive society. In summary, while it is possible that the statement \\"Those crafty Chinese\\" is using a stereotype based on historical and cultural factors, it is crucial to avoid perpetuating these generalizations. Embracing diversity and evaluating individuals based on their unique qualities fosters understanding and inclusion, leading to a more harmonious and respectful society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Inzamam-ul-Haq ( pronunciation ;Punjabi, Urdu: nDmm lHq; born 3 March 1970), also known as Inzy, is a former Pakistani cricketer, and former captain. He is the leading run scorer for Pakistan in one-day internationals, and the third-highest run scorer for Pakistan in Test cricket. He was the captain of the Pakistan national cricket team from 2003-07 and is considered to be one of the best leaders in Pakistan Cricket history. Inzamam rose to fame in the semi-final of the 1992 Cricket World Cup. Inzamam captained Pakistan in thirty Tests, winning eleven, drawing nine and losing ten. Only three players have captained Pakistan in more Test matches, but all have better win-loss records and only Imran Khan has a lower win percentage than Inzamam. Although the Oval Test match in 2006 was poised as a victory for Pakistan before the controversy took place and had it not occurred, Inzamam's record would have had a win more and a loss less. However, Inzamam held the captaincy until March 2007, the longest captaincy tenure since 1992, when Imran Khan retired. Captaincy had a positive effect on Inzamam's batting, often leading by example in pressure situations, averaging greater as a captain (52) than without (50). In ODI's Inzamam also held the highest average as captain in ODI's and is currently third on that list behind the former Australian skipper Ricky Ponting and the Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni. After early failures in Australia, he took a depleted Pakistan side to India in 2005 and played an important role in securing a draw by winning the final test match from an unlikely position with an innings of 184 runs. He subsequently led his side to an ODI success against West Indies (away), England (home) and Sri Lanka (away) as well as Test Series victories against England (home), India (home), Sri Lanka (away). Inzamam had seemed to have united the Pakistan side and victories led them to 2nd place in the ICC Test Rankings and 3rd place in the ICC ODI Ranking. The latter part of Inzamam's tenure as Pakistan captain was less successful and the team was embroiled in many controversies culminating in a disappointingly early exit from the 2007 Cricket World Cup at the hands of lowly ranked Ireland. In the 2007 Cricket World Cup, Inzamam captained the Pakistani team to its first loss to associate ICC member Ireland (on St Patrick's Day). This result and their previous loss to West Indies, led to them being knocked out of the tournament. A day later he announced his retirement from One Day International Cricket and resignation as Test captain. The announcement was made the same day that Bob Woolmer, Pakistan's coach, died in his hotel room in Kingston, Jamaica. He dedicated his final ODI to Woolmer to whom he shared a good relationship with for three years and affectionately called him 'The Bob'.

I promise, it’s the kindest way I could describe him. “The jacket means I know things.” He came up with wilder and wilder theories as to why I was sick, and kept getting sicker. It should be said beforehand that few of these theories were embodied. He was sure it was something in my ladybrains that was preventing proper function of the rest of me. Dr Douche said so much weird, wild, and just-plain-unbelievable crap over the course of my diagnosis that someday I may create a novel that incorporates it all. But this here has to be the blue ribbon winner. I was describing a symptom to him: every time I got up in the morning, when I first stood, my heart would pound, my heart rate would accelerate, and I’d feel dizzy. After a few probing questions — (only in the morning? — no, but it’s worst in the morning)… “Maybe,” he said sensitively, “you’re afraid.” “Of standing?” I asked, just to be sure. “You think I’m afraid of… standing up.” Maybe he meant there was some kind of existential fear, like, we’re all afraid, it’s a big old universe out there, and he wanted some comfort and reassurance. Nope. The man genuinely thought I had such a profound fear of verticality, that I was having a near-panic in response to being upright. POTS, folks. It was POTS.

As always, lighting was minimal (as opposed to Bee's workshop out behind the house, which was flooded with fluorescents). A bank of TV sets and computer monitors covered one whole wall, arranged on a precarious system of metal shelves that Bee had installed herself. A low, flat coffee table squatted below the glowing displays, supporting three keyboards, a bank of video editing tools and four different phone carriages. Bee sat in her accustomed place - in the midst of a pile of cushions on the floor, fiddling with a mouse in one hand and typing on one of the keyboards while she talked quietly into her headset. Paul and Chloe didn't bother to knock as they came in - Bee already knew they were there. Paul glanced at one of the screens mounted on the wall. Its display, divided into four quadrants, showed various images from inside the house, including the front door they'd just come through and the stairs they'd just climbed. The screen next to it - which Paul himself had salvaged from a bar on Duval that'd recently renovated into a finedining restaurant - showed images from four other cameras that covered the house's exterior.

This was about a month ago. It was the last day I worked. Memorial Day at the city rec center is SLOW, especially when it's beautiful outside, but for some reason, we had two front desk attendants: me, and “bully #1”. Bully #1 clearly had a major distaste for me. She hated my tattoos, the way I would get into a heated debate one day with a police officer patron, then have a fantastic conversation with him days later about legalizing marijuana. She hated that I was liked, but still could give fuck-all about what others thought of me. Bully #2 was our financial director, who got stuck as the manager on duty that day. I honestly never had a clue she didn't like me. She was intense and sarcastic with everyone. I liked her style. On this day, I really got the feeling they were trash talking me pretty hard, the way they kept disappearing, talking over me, laughing like mean girls. I blew it off, because I was down an internet rabbit hole, trying to wrap my brain around some concepts.

Given the question: I can use this background: At the mid-oceanic ridges, two tectonic plates diverge from one another as new oceanic crust is formed by the cooling and solidifying of hot molten rock. Because the crust is very thin at these ridges due to the pull of the tectonic plates, the release of pressure leads to adiabatic expansion (without transfer of heat or matter) and the partial melting of the mantle, causing volcanism and creating new oceanic crust. Most divergent plate boundaries are at the bottom of the oceans; therefore, most volcanic activity on the Earth is submarine, forming new seafloor. Black smokers (also known as deep sea vents) are evidence of this kind of volcanic activity. Where the mid-oceanic ridge is above sea-level, volcanic islands are formed; for example, Iceland. Now, I have a new situation: Two oceans have divergent plate boundaries at the bottom of their floor. The Arctic ocean has a single dormant divergent plate, while the Pacific ocean has seven diverging tectonic plates under its waters. Answer this question please: Which ocean experiences less cooling of hot molten rock? The answer is:","completion":"The Arctic Ocean experiences less cooling of hot molten rock. In this situation, we have two oceans with divergent plate boundaries at the bottom of their floors. The Arctic Ocean has a single dormant divergent plate, while the Pacific Ocean has seven diverging tectonic plates under its waters. The cooling of hot molten rock is related to the formation of new oceanic crust at mid-oceanic ridges, where two tectonic plates move away from one another. This process occurs when the mantle beneath the ridge partially melts due to adiabatic expansion, and the molten rock rises, cools, and solidifies, forming new crust. The overall cooling effect will be greater in regions with more active divergent plate boundaries, as there will be more new crust generated. Since the Arctic Ocean has only a single dormant divergent plate, the amount of new ocean crust formation and associated cooling of hot molten rock will be less than in the Pacific Ocean, which has seven diverging tectonic plates. The higher number of diverging plates in the Pacific Ocean indicates a higher level of tectonic activity, and hence, more substantial cooling of hot molten rock as new oceanic crust is formed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These feasts were conducted in sacred places such as temples, groves, or even individual homes. The primary goal of Blót feasts was to maintain a favorable relationship with these deities and ancestral spirits, as well as to seek guidance, protection, and blessings for various aspects of life, such as fertility, successful harvests, and victory in battles. When Christianity began to spread within these societies, religious power was no longer solely vested in the pagan priests or priestesses but instead, it was handed over to the Church. Consequently, the Church became the central authority on religion and spirituality, with its teachings and rituals slowly replacing the traditional practices. As a part of this process, the Church actively discouraged the continued practice of Blót feasts in favor of Christian rites and ceremonies. It is crucial to note that the conversion to Christianity did not happen overnight; it was a gradual process, and sometimes there was a period where both pagan and Christian practices coexisted in these societies. The consequences of transferring religious power to the Church included the decline of the cultural importance and religious significance of Blót feasts. As Christianity became more deeply rooted within these societies, the Church expanded its influence, and the importance of maintaining a relationship with the pagan gods and goddesses began to wane. In turn, this resulted in a diminished emphasis on the power and relevance of the Blót feasts. Over time, the observance of these rituals faded away, and their practice was eventually completely supplanted by Christian ceremonies and rituals. It is essential to acknowledge the broader sociopolitical implications of this transfer of religious power. The Church's growing authority in these societies led to a centralization of power and allowed rulers who adopted Christianity to consolidate their control over others, often using this newfound religious authority as a means of legitimizing their rule. In conclusion, the introduction of Christianity and the subsequent transfer of religious power to the Church marked a pivotal shift in the cultural and religious practices of Germanic and Norse societies. With the decline of traditional pagan practices, Blót feasts lost their significance as they were supplanted by Christian rituals and teachings. The repercussions of this transformation extended beyond the realm of religion, as the emerging role of the Church in society led to broader sociopolitical changes as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

But the director just didn't know how to stage or pace a dramatic scene; the special effects simply didn't work; the screenplay telegraphed its threadbare plot points so plainly that a bivalve could have seen them coming; and the soundtrack kept playing German \\"oompah band\\" music when it was supposed to be trying to scare the audience.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In this Aug. 30, 2012, file photo, a tour group walks through the campus of Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass. (Elise Amendola/AP) The Korean math prodigy at one of the nation’s top high schools had Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg on the phone, personally encouraging the teenager to attend Harvard University. She received letters from Harvard professors, encouraging her to bring her brilliant abilities to Cambridge next fall instead of accepting her admission to Stanford University on the opposite coast. As the student struggled to decide between five-figure scholarship promises from both schools, she received a novel offer: She could spend two years at each elite school as part of an arrangement just for her. The exciting dual-enrollment opportunity garnered star-struck coverage from Korean media outlets, which dubbed her the “Genius Girl.” But none of it was true. The baffling hoax has stunned Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Fairfax County, the top-ranked magnet program known as an intellectual proving ground for science wunderkinder, technology gurus, engineering buffs and math wizards — many of whom earn their way to the nation’s most prestigious colleges. The senior’s tale of academic conquest of admission into what turned out to be a bogus program apparently was designed to impress her parents, peers and teachers as part of the annual cutthroat competition for the relatively tiny number of spots at the nation’s top schools. The faked admission story went much further than most teen fantasies: It made its way to the international media, where the student’s parents admitted the truth and publicly shamed themselves before the Korean community. Many graduates of TJ, as the school is known, go on to illustrious academic careers. Just recently, a senior who had a 4.57 grade-point average, aced 13 Advanced Placement tests and founded a national nonprofit organization before her 18th birthday earned admission to all eight Ivy League schools, which made national headlines. Another senior, who designed the electronics system for a 6-foot, 120-pound robot capable of lifting crates, received a scholarship from the SpaceX aerospace corporation, founded by Internet billionaire Elon Musk. [The real deal: Virginia student earns admission to all eight Ivy League schools, and others] The question now at the school is what caused the student to concoct the elaborate college admissions scheme. The answer seems obvious to students and teachers there: overwhelming pressure to succeed from parents and unrealistic expectations from the teens themselves. “We celebrate the accomplishment of students who get into all eight Ivies,” said Brandon Kosatka, TJ’s director of student services. “That’s the bar, and our kids are shooting for that. They don’t like to be the second-best. If that’s the bar, then, yes, that creates anxiety for them.” One student, who spoke anonymously to offer a candid view of the school’s climate, said teenagers are expected to boast impressive extracurricular activities on top of stellar grades. “You’re going to have pressure to do well,” the student said. “But you also need to play 17 different sports and instruments.” Fairfax County schools spokesman John Torre declined to comment. School Board member Ilryong Moon, whose two sons graduated from TJ and attended Harvard and Brown, said the school is very popular in Northern Virginia’s Korean community. Admission is highly selective, and Asians are accepted at a higher rate than their peers; next year’s freshman class is 70 percent Asian. “In general, I feel that it’s not just TJ, but all of our students are feeling more and more pressure to do well,” Moon said. “The competition is becoming stiffer.” Jung Jong-chul, education attache at the Korean Embassy in Washington, said TJ is known as one of the top high schools in the area and well known “for some Korean people who know or live around the D.C. area.” That might explain why the story exploded overseas. The college admissions process can be perplexing for students who are used to solving math equations with definitive answers, Kosatka said. Some students measure their academic success based on college admissions, he said, which can lead to devastating moments of realization when rejection letters arrive in mailboxes. “They are big fish in a small pond,” Kosatka said. “It’s a big self-esteem blow when you learn there are other big fish out there, that you’re just another star among stars. . . . Sometimes it’s not in the cards, and that’s difficult for students who are accustomed to being successful to swallow.” A lot of the pressure that students feel comes from parents and teachers, he added: “They don’t want to let down the adults in their lives.” That stress appeared to be too much for at least one young woman at TJ, who goes by her nickname, Sara. In breathless coverage in the Korean media, the student was hailed as the “Genius Girl,” who made her parents immensely proud by gaining acceptance and scholarships at two of the best schools in the country. According to Korean reports, she had Harvard and Stanford professors fighting for her to enroll. Several news outlets reported that Zuckerberg called her to persuade her to choose Harvard, which he attended for two years. A spokesman for Zuckerberg declined to comment. The student and her family granted interviews, which appeared in overseas coverage and in Korean American news. The Washington Post is not identifying the student, because she is a minor who has not been accused of a crime. Attempts to reach the student’s family were unsuccessful, and her father did not respond to an e-mailed request for comment. The student “answered the phone one day, and it was Zuckerberg, so she was surprised,” her mother told the Korean publication Newsis. “He said he was in Panama and that he had called her because it was easier to talk by phone than by e-mail.” But students at TJ grew suspicious and began questioning the story. That skepticism made its way to online e-mail discussion groups in the Washington region. Then, earlier this month, the entire senior class at TJ received an e-mail from a person claiming to be Harvard mathematics professor Joseph Daniel Harris. “We’ve heard various rumors related to Sara, and I am here to put it to an end,” the e-mail read. “In addition, we’ve heard numerous comments related to her research and achievements, but we know much more than all of you guys know, so it needs to stop.” Harvard officials told The Post that the e-mail from Harris was a forgery. The ruse unraveled when Sara’s father wrote an apology to Korean news publications. “I am sincerely sorry for causing trouble with what is not true,” he wrote, according to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency. “I am deeply repentant that I failed to watch properly over how painful and difficult a situation the child has been in so far and that I even aggravated and enlarged her suffering. . . . From now on, the whole family will live a quiet life, devoting ourselves to getting the child cured well and taking good care of her. Please forgive me for being unable to offer detailed explanations as the situation has not been completely figured out yet.” Officials at Harvard and Stanford declined to say whether the student was accepted to either school. In a statement to The Post, Harvard spokeswoman Anna Cowenhoven wrote that the university was made aware of claims that the student received “three admissions letters and multiple e-mail communications.” “None of these communications were sent by Harvard, and we can confirm that they are all forgeries,” Cowenhoven wrote. “There is no program in existence through which a student is admitted to spend two years at Harvard College and two years at Stanford University.” Stanford spokeswoman Lisa Lapin wrote in a statement to The Post that admissions letters Sara provided to Korean media organizations “were not authentic and were not issued by Stanford University.” Lapin also said that a Stanford professor who was quoted in Korean media about Sara had never spoken to the media about her and neither met nor communicated with her. “Stanford also does not have any type of program that would allow an undergraduate student to be admitted to two universities,” Lapin said. TJ’s Kosatka said that instead of emphasizing students’ admission to selective colleges, parents and teachers should focus on ensuring that the teenagers are getting into schools that are the right fit for their talents and interests. “There’s a disconnect,” Kosatka said. “We spend a lot of time socially saying, ‘Oh, who got into Harvard, Princeton, Brown and Yale?’ We send a mixed message.” Michelle Lee contributed to this report. ||||| Two weeks ago, a South Korean \\"math prodigy\\" made headlines across the country after claiming that she had been accepted into two prestigious American universities, Stanford and Harvard. Kim Jung-yoon, a senior at Thomas Jefferson high School for Science and Technology in Virginia, rose to fame after media reported that the top-tier universities had competed to recruit her to their undergraduate programs and ended up creating a special shared programme only for her to study at both schools. According to the reports, the 18-year-old girl secured a rare chance to study at both schools and choose where to graduate from. Kim showed acceptance letters from the schools to back her claims. Kim was featured on radio talk shows while her father contributed to the hype by conducting interviews with local news outlets. The reports on Kim's achievement sparked envy among Koreans who have been living in a climate where admission into top universities is seen as key to elevating their social status. But about a week later, her whole story was unraveled, with both Harvard and Stanford universities denying the acceptance of the Korean student. The universities confirmed that there was no such joint programme allowing a student to study at both schools, calling the acceptance letters provided by Kim forgeries. Kim, who appears to have masterminded the whole furor herself, immediately went from being idolized to ridiculed, with her father apologising last week for causing a stir and promising to take care of her mental health. Putting aside the reason behind her scam, the scandal appeared to leave a bitter aftertaste here, as it bluntly illustrated the country's avid obsession with academic elitism and a competitive media industry prone to lapses of judgment. A 28-year-old student said he could sympathize with her as he understands what it feels like to fail to enter top-tier universities and to be treated like a \\"loser\\" in Korean society. \\"I have felt that entering a renowned university is a way to have my voice heard in Korean society,\\" Lee, who wanted to be identified only by his surname, told The Korea Herald. Lee is studying for a master's at a Seoul-based university after receiving a diploma from a lesser-known college. \\"When I criticise the social structure, people think that I am complaining due to my poor educational background,\\" he said. \\"Then, I become a loser again.\\" In Korea, it has been considered a norm that one's diploma defines the rest of his or her life, from career to even marriage prospects. Cliques are formed based on educational backgrounds, with graduates from the nation's top universities taking up high positions on the social ladder and dominating academia, business and politics. The infamous Korean helicopter moms enroll their toddlers in English-language kindergartens, in desperate hopes that the child will not be left behind in the fierce competition to enter the country's best universities, or if not, prestigious ones abroad. Kim is one of the kids who might have felt pressured to impress her parents, said Seol Dong-hoon, a sociology professor from Chonbuk National University. \\"The whole hullaballoo could have only been a family issue, but Kim's father made her lie public by showing off his daughter's achievement through the media,\\" Seol said. Indeed, Kim's case was only the latest in a long list of academic fabrication cases in Korea. One of the most high-profile scandals came in 2007 when Shin Jeong-ah, an art history professor at Dongguk University, faked her academic record. On the back of her distinguished degrees from Yale and University of Kansas, Shin rapidly shot to prominence in the local art world. She was appointed codirector of the Gwangju Biennale, one of the biggest art events in East Asia, at the age of 35. But Shin fell from grace when her academic accomplishments turned out to be forged. She resigned from all her posts and was eventually convicted of falsifying records and embezzlement. The Shin case triggered a wave of similar allegations and confessions across the nation involving a professor, movie director, renowned architect, leading actors and actresses and even a respected monk. Behind the academic fraud cases is Koreans' belief that educational backgrounds indicate \\"status\\" in society, experts said. \\"Koreans have viewed an academic degree as a prerequisite to success and climbing up the social ladder, which has intensified competition for admission to prestigious universities,\\" Shin Kwang-yeong, a sociology professor from Chung-Ang University, told The Korea Herald. And the belief has more than 1,000 years of history to it. \\"Back in history, only aristocrats had a chance to take a state-administered exam to rise in social status,\\" Shin said, referring to the Goryeo (918-1392) and Joseon (1392-1895) dynasties under which people took the Gwageo, the national civil service exam to advance into society. \\"But now, exams are standardized and institutionalized so that anyone in any class can take an exam, get respectable degrees and enter the upper tier of society,\\" he added. With the country's leading businesses and key national exams still favouring those with prestigious diplomas, the obsession to embellish one's academic record persists, experts said. A recent survey suggested that university degrees still have a huge impact on new graduates' job prospects. According to a survey of 418 firms by recruitment site Saramin, 88.5 per cent of the surveyed companies said that they have given an advantage to those holding a degree from renowned universities in the resume screening process. Asked about the reason behind the practice, the companies said that they saw prestigious degrees as a result of one's efforts and a means of objectively measuring job seekers' abilities. Other experts pointed out the Kim's scandal was also a result of poor quality journalism. After it was found to be fabricated, a mainstream media outlet published a lengthy correction after having covered the teenage girl's story. \\"Kim's story had every element that can excite Koreans ― the success of a Korean abroad and acceptance into prestigious universities,\\" said Choi Jin-bong, who teaches mass communications at Sungkonghoe University. \\"That's perhaps why Korean media hastily picked up the story.\\" With the news about Kim going viral in Korea after first being covered by a Korean newspaper in the US, the local media continued to reproduce the story until parents and students at Kim's school raised questions about her credentials, which later prompted a local daily to check the supposed facts. \\"Amid fierce competition to attract readers and generate traffic online, local news outlets lack a system to check facts before reporting,\\" Choi said, pinpointing a structural problem of online journalism driven by \\"stimulating\\" stories. \\"Such diminishing media ethics can strike us all in the long run,\\" Choi added. Above all, the Kim case sounds the alarm to a society that has been pushing its youth to \\"risk their lives\\" to get into top-tier universities, said Kim Ji-ae, an activist campaigning to break academic cliques in society. \\"The 18-year-old girl is not the only one to blame. Korean society that has made a university degree a source of pride or inferiority should take the blame,\\" Kim said. \\"Kim's behaviour might be a self-portrait of us all.\\" ||||| 2015/06/10 12:09 WASHINGTON, June 9 (Yonhap) -- Harvard and Stanford universities denied Tuesday that a South Korean high school student can attend both schools as part of a special joint program for her, debunking the story of a \\"math prodigy.\\" Kim Jung-yoon, a senior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Virginia, has become famous after reports that she was accepted to the two prestigious universities and has even been allowed to attend both schools without having to choose one. Her family has said the two universities had tried to convince Kim to choose their schools because she was such a brilliant student, especially at mathematics, and they later agreed on a special plan to allow her to study at Stanford for the first two years and then at Harvard for another two years. Questions have since arisen about her admission, and the two universities have denied the reports. \\"Despite recent media reports, there is no program in existence through which a student is admitted to spend two years at Harvard College and two years at Stanford University,\\" Anna Cowenhoven, a Harvard Public Affairs and Communications official, said in an email to Yonhap News Agency. \\"We have been made aware of an alleged admissions letter sent to Ms. Jung Yoon (Sara) Kim by Harvard University. We can confirm that this letter is a forgery,\\" she said. Lisa Lapin, a senior communications official at Stanford University, also denied that the school gave admission to Kim. \\"I am confirming that the letter you received was NOT issued by Richard Shaw or Stanford University,\\" she said in response to Yonhap's request for confirmation of an alleged admission letter signed by the dean of admissions and financial aid. Kim's family provided the letter to reporters as evidence of her admission. Her father, Kim Jung-wook, said that he will deal with the case through his lawyer. In response to the allegations of fake admissions, he has said that there could be some misunderstanding because her admission is a very special case that has been discussed only between professors of the two universities. jschang@yna.co.kr (END) ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"In 2012, a Korean high school student, known as \\"Genius Girl\\", claimed she was accepted into both Harvard and Stanford University with a unique dual-enrollment opportunity, which would allow her to study two years at each school.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: In June 1911 Holst and his Morley College students gave the first performance since the seventeenth century of Purcell's The Fairy-Queen. The full score had been lost soon after Purcell's death in 1695, and had only recently been found. Twenty-eight Morley students copied out the complete vocal and orchestral parts. There were 1,500 pages of music and it took the students almost eighteen months to copy them out in their spare time. A concert performance of the work was given at The Old Vic, preceded by an introductory talk by Vaughan Williams. The Times praised Holst and his forces for \\"a most interesting and artistic performance of this very important work\\".After this success, Holst was disappointed the following year by the lukewarm reception of his choral work The Cloud Messenger. He again went travelling, accepting an invitation from H. Balfour Gardiner to join him and the brothers Clifford and Arnold Bax in Spain. During this holiday Clifford Bax introduced Holst to astrology, an interest that later inspired his suite The Planets. Holst cast his friends' horoscopes for the rest of his life and referred to astrology as his \\"pet vice\\".In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School opened a new music wing, and Holst composed St Paul's Suite for the occasion. The new building contained a sound-proof room, handsomely equipped, where he could work undisturbed. Holst and his family moved to a house in Brook Green, very close to the school. For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities. In 1917 they moved to a house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925. answer the following question: Vaughan Williams gave an introductory talk before the performance of what work at The Old Vic?

Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: You don't usually find a mall in what areas outside big groups of people? Possible A: downtown, large city, montana, urban area, suburbs Why is \\"suburbs\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?","completion":"To determine why \\"suburbs\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense, let's analyze the question and other possible answers step by step: 1. Understand the question The question asks about areas where malls are less likely to be found outside of large gatherings of people. 2. Evaluate the other possible answers: - Downtown: Downtown areas usually have larger concentrations of people and frequently have malls or shopping centers. - Large city: Large cities typically have more people and a greater demand for commercial areas like malls. - Montana: Although it's true that malls are less likely to be found in sparsely populated rural areas like Montana, this answer is specific to a location rather than a general concept or region type. It doesn't reflect human common sense as effectively as a more general answer. - Urban area: Urban areas tend to attract significant populations and commercial development, including malls. 3. Consider the context of \\"suburbs\\" Suburbs are residential areas located on the outskirts of cities. They often have smaller populations and lesser commercial density compared to downtown or urban areas. However, they still possess some commercial activity, but it's more spread out than in city centers. 4. Justify the choice of \\"suburbs\\" as an answer aligned with human common sense It is more reasonable to assume that malls are less likely to be found in suburbs, compared to other potential answers like downtown or urban areas. Suburbs often have fewer people and less demand for large-scale commercial establishments. They may have smaller shopping centers or retail outlets, but it's less common to have a full-blown mall. This makes \\"suburbs\\" an answer that aligns well with human common sense in the given context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Tragic: Christian Smith, 38, was killed instantly when he was hit by a suspected drink-driver hours into a 248-mile charity cycle ride. Donations were flooding in last night for a cyclist who was killed by a suspected drink driver during a 24-hour charity ride. Christian Smith, 38, had almost completed the 248-mile trip through Kent and Sussex when he was hit by the car. The married father of three was declared dead at the scene by paramedics early on Saturday. Mr Smith was aiming to raise £1,000 for mental health charity Mind. But by 1.30pm yesterday £1,455 had been donated by 50 people. And as news of the tragedy spread, hundreds more visited his JustGiving donations website. Just two hours later the total had soared to £13,533 from 860 people. Further gifts continued to roll in from generous members of the public, with the total reaching £20,000 before 6pm and £30,000 by 8.30pm. One £1,000 donation came from a stranger who gave his name as James. He wrote: ‘We haven’t met. Like many others, I was very moved by your story. May you rest in peace brother. My deepest sympathies go out to your family, loved ones and friends.’ Mr Smith set off on his ‘Kent Epic’ challenge on Friday and was hit by a blue Peugeot 206 near Chestfield, Whitstable, at 4am the following morning. He is understood to have been less than two hours from home. An 18-year-old woman from Herne Bay was arrested on suspicion of drink driving and causing death by dangerous driving. She has been bailed until July 26. On his JustGiving page, Mr Smith, who was married to Katie, 40, said he wanted to support Mind to help end the stigma attached to mental health problems. Donations: Friends have given thousands of pounds to charity in Mr Smith's memory. He wrote: ‘I have had my own. misfortune to suffer from a spate of poor mental health which was. unexpected and has been a real “game changer” in how I now view the. future. It has been a tough road to get to this point but I have been. fortunate enough to have the support of my family and friends. ‘There. are those who are not so fortunate to have the same level of support. and understanding. They suffer in silence and are alone.’ Mr. Smith, from Boughton Aluph, Kent, planned to celebrate completing the. challenge by having drinks with friends next Saturday. He would have. turned 39 tomorrow. On his. online LinkedIn business profile he said he had worked as an operations. manager for a funeral director until December and was now ‘looking for a. new challenge’. His family. said in a statement: ‘Christian Smith was killed in the early hours of. Saturday morning while cycling to raise money for Mind. Christian leaves. a loving wife and three children.’ Mind chief executive Paul Farmer said: ‘We were shocked and saddened to hear of the tragic death of Christian Smith. ‘Our thoughts go out to his family and friends at this extremely difficult time.’ PC. Jamie Woodhams, of the Kent Police Serious Collision Investigation. Unit, said: ‘We are continuing to appeal for witnesses to come forward. In particular we would like to speak to anybody who saw the Peugeot. travelling along the road prior to the collision.’ The. public response is similar to when 30-year-old hairdresser Claire. Squires died during the London Marathon in 2012. She had hoped to raise. £500 for Samaritans, but news of her death sent the total soaring to. £1.2million.

The brownstone is also home to Archie, Wolfe's confidential assistant and legman, whose responsibilities include goading his sedentary boss into working occasionally to replenish the coffers. When Archie joins him in the dining room, Wolfe is unfazed by the news that he is overdrawn at the bank â but he is taken aback at the discovery that Fritz has altered one of his favorite dishes without consulting him. The resulting tantrum prompts Archie to do something uncharacteristic when the doorbell rings: admit one of the neighborhood kids, Pete Drossos (Robert Clark), who says he has to see Nero Wolfe. Pete has a case. He tells Wolfe he works the wipe racket â cleaning the windshields of cars stopped at intersections, for the occasional tip. About an hour before, Pete saw a good-looking woman wearing large gold earrings shaped like spiders, at the wheel of a 1952 Cadillac. As Pete wiped her windshield the woman mouthed the words, \\"Help. Get a cop.\\" A male passenger stuck a gun in her ribs and the car drove off. Pete wrote down the license number. If the woman is found dead, Pete believes he can claim a reward by identifying the man who was with her. Since the case is too big for him to handle alone, Pete asks Nero Wolfe to go 50-50. Wolfe instructs Archie to call the police, to suggest they do a routine check on the license plate number, and Pete hurries home to his mother. The next evening Sergeant Purley Stebbins (R. D. Reid) of Manhattan Homicide visits Wolfe's office. The car Archie had called the police about the previous evening has just been seen to run down and kill a boy â a boy named Peter...

Its capital, Luxembourg City, is, together with Brussels and Strasbourg, one of the three official capitals of the European Union and the seat of the European Court of Justice, the highest juridical authority in the EU. Its culture, people and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbors, making it essentially a mixture of French and Germanic cultures. The repeated invasions by its neighbor countries, especially in World War II, resulted in the country's strong will for mediation between France and Germany and led to the foundation of the European Union. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages.

One particular time I was refinishing a section of ceiling. I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\" I learned a lot from that.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Heisman Is Awarded to a Sophomore “There are a lot of great freshmen and sophomores out there,” Tebow said. “And I’m just glad that I get to be the first one to win this.” In each of his 12 games this season, Tebow had at least one rushing touchdown. He amassed 838 yards on 194 carries and scored 22 times. But that was only half his game. He also passed for 3,132 yards with 29 touchdowns and completed 68.5 percent of his throws. Earlier in the week, Tebow won the Davey O’Brien award as the best quarterback in the country and the Maxwell Award, a prize separate from the Heisman for the nation’s best player. In recent years, however, the Maxwell has seemed somewhat ominous for Heisman hopefuls; no player has won both awards in the same season since Ron Dayne in 1999. Instead, Tebow became the second Florida quarterback in the last 11 years to win the Heisman, following Danny Wuerffel, one of Tebow’s childhood heroes. But Wuerffel did not play in the kind of spread offense that has made 2007 the highest-scoring season in college football history. The moment that stood out for many voters was Tebow’s 23-yard touchdown run against Florida State when he ducked out of a crunching tackle from a lineman and eluded two more defensive backs as he sprinted to the goal line. That was after he had avoided a sack and rushed for 16 yards on third-and-14 to keep the drive rolling. Using his legs under pressure might have helped carry him to the Heisman, and it is also what first put him in the spotlight as a freshman. Playing behind Chris Leak, the 6-foot-3, 235-pound Tebow was Florida Coach Urban Meyer’s choice in short-yardage situations. In his first Southeastern Conference game, against Tennessee, Tebow came in on a fourth-and-1 in the fourth quarter and pounded his way to a critical first down to set up the go-ahead touchdown in a 21-20 victory. He finished his freshman season with 469 yards rushing and a team-high 8 touchdown runs on 89 carries. He threw for only 358 yards, but none meant more than the 358th — a 1-yard touchdown pass on third-and-goal in the national championship game victory against Ohio State. For McFadden, sitting at the ceremony only to hear someone else’s name called was an all-too familiar experience. Last year, he made the trip to New York only to watch Ohio State quarterback Troy Smith claim the trophy by the second-largest margin in history. McFadden, a two-time SEC offensive player of the year and the Walter Camp Player of the Year, made his strongest case for the Heisman with his performance in Arkansas’s 50-48 triple-overtime victory at Louisiana State. He rushed for 206 yards, including a 73-yard touchdown sprint in the third quarter, and threw a 24-yard pass for a touchdown in the fourth. The final Heisman picture did not come into focus until the last month or so, with several other names being mentioned throughout the season. After rushing for a touchdown in each of his first eight games, Oregon quarterback Dennis Dixon seemed like a top candidate. But after a knee injury in a loss to Arizona cut his season short, his 20 touchdowns and 2,106 passing yards were not enough to earn him an invitation to New York. West Virginia quarterback Pat White, who threw for 12 touchdowns and rushed for 14, might have also been considered as he led the Mountaineers to the brink of the national title game before the Mountaineers lost to Pittsburgh. It was that same weekend that Brennan played his way into contention. With Hawaii putting the only perfect Football Bowl Subdivision record on the line against Washington last Saturday, he completed 42 of 50 passes to close a 21-point deficit and win the game with a 5-yard slant pass with 44 seconds to play. But Brennan’s critics are quick to point out that he faced a weak schedule — Hawaii did not play a team in the top 25 until November. Two nationally televised games seemed to make and break Daniel’s chances. On Nov. 24, he led Missouri to a memorable 36-28 victory against Kansas, going 40 of 49 with no interceptions. A week later, he failed to throw a touchdown pass as Oklahoma trounced Missouri, 38-17. But Daniel said he was under no illusions. “I’m just glad to be here; everyone knew it was going to Tim,” he said.

Please answer this question: Before moving to the city of Metropolis in which American town did Superman grow up","completion":"Superman, also known as Kal-El, was born on the planet Krypton but was sent to Earth as an infant by his father, Jor-El, to escape Krypton's impending doom. Upon arriving on Earth, baby Kal-El was discovered by a kind farming couple, Jonathan and Martha Kent, who took him in as their own child and named him Clark Kent. Clark grew up in the small, idyllic American town of Smallville, which is situated in the state of Kansas. Smallville was an ideal environment for Clark to grow up in and discover his extraordinary abilities as it provided the perfect balance of safety, community, and opportunities for self-discovery. The Kents instilled strong moral values in Clark, teaching him to use his powers responsibly and emphasizing the importance of helping others. Smallville was also the backdrop for some of Clark's most formative experiences, such as making lifelong friendships and first loves. The town served as a foundation for Superman's steadfast personality and commitment to protecting the innocent. The intimate connection Clark shares with Smallville – the place where his life on Earth began – is integral to the Superman story. As Clark grew older and sought to understand his origins and true purpose, he was inevitably drawn to Metropolis, a bustling and cosmopolitan city that presented him with ample opportunities to use his abilities for the betterment of humankind. Metropolis is where Clark fully embraces his role as Superman, acting as a beacon of hope and symbol of truth, justice, and the American way. Equipped with the strong moral compass instilled in him by his Smallville upbringing, Superman takes it upon himself to keep the citizens of Metropolis safe from harm and to be a shining role model for millions around the world. In essence, Superman grows up in Smallville, Kansas, a small rural town filled with love, support, and a sense of community. This upbringing is the foundation of the superhero he would eventually become, and it shapes his values and commitment to protecting those in need as he transitions to the larger scale of the city of Metropolis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(Photo: KRISTA NILES, AP) Amazon, Walmart and other retailers are being sued for 50 million for allegedly infringing on the trademark of iconic rap and hip-hop group RUN-DMC. The stores \\"are trading on the goodwill\\" of the band and confusing consumers by \\"advertising, manufacturing, selling and distributing multiple products\\" that erroneously imply the group endorsed the merchandise, according to the lawsuit filed Thursday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Examples include old-school black-frame glasses often sported by Darryl McDaniels — best known to fans and music lovers as DMC — one of the band's founders and the trademark's owner, the lawsuit charged. He owns 200 pairs of similar glasses, \\"the better to see what's going on in the world,\\" according to an entry on the band's official website. An exhibit filed with the court complaint also showed shirts, hats and other merchandise like some worn by McDaniels, Joseph \\"Reverend Run\\" Simmons, and Jason \\"Jam Master J\\" Mizell when the trio shot to music and cultural stardom from their 1980s start in the Hollis, Queens neighborhood of New York City. The band members, inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2009 for a string of hits that include \\"It's Like That,\\" \\"My Adidas,\\" and \\"You Be Illin,\\" no longer perform together but are widely considered as rap elder statesmen. Mizell died in an unsolved 2002 shooting. \\"The number of infringing materials\\" allegedly marketed and sold by the companies \\"are too numerous to properly list,\\" according to the lawsuit, which alleged the retailers' actions have \\"harmed RUN-DMC in its business.\\" Along with Amazon and Walmart, the court complaint targets retailers Jet.com, Vision World, Infinity Fashion and SW Global. All are Amazon business partners, the lawsuit alleges. The companies either could not be reached or did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment on the lawsuit.

File Photo: Darryl McDaniels of the rap group Run DMC takes part in a panel discussion of National Geographic Channel's \\"The 80s\\" during the 2013 Winter Press Tour for the Television Critics Association in Pasadena, California January 4, 2013. REUTERS/Gus Ruelas/File Photo Darryl McDaniels, the owner of Run-DMC Brand LLC, the plaintiff in the lawsuit, is seeking at least 50 million of damages from the retailers and other defendants over their alleged sale of glasses, hats, patches, T-shirts, wallets and other products that infringe the Run-DMC trademark registered in 2007. McDaniels called the Run-DMC brand “extremely valuable,” and said it is the subject of several licensing agreements, including to endorse sneakers from Adidas AG. He said the defendants are confusing consumers into believing that Run-DMC endorsed their products and are trading on the goodwill associated with the name, in violation of federal trademark and New York unfair competition laws. “Plaintiff will suffer immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage” unless the infringements are stopped, according to the complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan. Other defendants include Jet.com, an online retailer that Wal-Mart bought, and a variety of companies that do business with Amazon or sell products through Amazon. Amazon, Wal-Mart and Jet.com did not immediately respond to requests for comment. McDaniels’ lawyer did not immediately respond to similar requests. Run-DMC was founded in the New York City borough of Queens in 1981 by McDaniels, Joseph “Run” Simmons and Jason “Jam Master Jay” Mizell. It became one of the best-known rap acts of the 1980s, including for the album “Raising Hell” and such songs as the Aerosmith cover “Walk This Way” and “My Adidas.” In 2009, Run-DMC became the second rap act inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The case is Run-DMC Brand LLC v Amazon.com Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-10011.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How much does it take to start a business? How much money do you need to start a business? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Select from the following. a). no b). yes","completion":"b). yes The two questions are paraphrases of each other as they both inquire about the amount of money required to initiate a business venture. Starting a business can be both an exciting and challenging endeavor, and one of the critical aspects of ensuring its success is having a clear understanding of the expenses involved in setting up the venture. The amount of money required will depend on various factors, such as the type and scale of the business, location, legal structure, and the overall financial plan. Here is a detailed breakdown of considerations and expenses an entrepreneur might encounter: 1. Type and scale of business: The cost of starting a business can vary significantly based on the industry, as well as whether it will be a small, medium, or large-scale venture. For example, starting a web-based or home-based business may require less capital than a brick-and-mortar retail store or a restaurant. Estimating costs for the specific industry and scale can help determine the necessary initial investment. 2. Startup assets: These include the essential resources needed to kick-start a business, such as machinery, equipment, inventory, office furniture, and computer hardware and software. The cost of these assets will vary depending on the type of business and desired level of quality or capacity. 3. Location: The cost of renting or purchasing a space for business operations is another area to consider. It will depend on factors like geographic location, size, and the type of property. Additionally, the costs associated with utilities, renovations, maintenance, and insurance should be taken into account. 4. Legal structure: Whether starting a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or limited liability company, each legal structure comes with distinct setup costs. These may include business registration fees, legal consultation, licenses, and permits needed for specific industries. 5. Marketing and branding: Building a brand and reaching out to potential customers entails expenses like creating a logo and marketing materials, website development and domain hosting, and advertising through various channels such as social media and print media. 6. Professional services: The cost of professional services, such as an accountant, lawyer, consultant, or insurance provider, should be considered before starting a business. These professionals can help manage financial, legal, and regulatory aspects of the business. 7. Payroll and staffing expenses: A business will need to account for the cost of hiring and training employees (if applicable), including the salaries, benefits, and taxes associated with payroll. 8. Emergency fund: Maintaining a buffer or emergency fund is vital for unexpected situations that may arise. It ensures that the business can continue operating during unforeseen challenges, such as equipment breakdowns, a natural disaster, or a sudden decline in sales. 9. Ongoing and working capital expenses: In addition to initial investments, a business must also account for ongoing operational expenses like rent, utilities, inventory replenishment, marketing, and employee salaries. These ongoing costs require working capital. It's worth estimating these expenses for the first few months (or even years) of operation to ensure the business has enough cash flow to cover them. In summary, the amount of money needed to start a business is contingent on the type and scale of the venture, as well as a variety of other factors involving location, startup assets, legal structure, and costs related to marketing, professional services, payroll, and working capital. Estimating these expenses accurately is crucial for a successful and sustainable business venture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Paul wanted to cook the steak on the grill instead of the stovetop because the Options: (A). grill was hot.. (B). stovetop was hot..","completion":"Paul wanted to cook the steak on the grill instead of the stovetop because the grill was hot. By using the grill, he could take advantage of the high, direct heat source to properly sear the steak and create a delicious, caramelized crust. Additionally, cooking on a grill would allow for the excess fat to drip away from the meat, creating a leaner and healthier meal. Moreover, the grilling process would impart a unique, smoky flavor into the steak, which is absent when cooking on a stovetop. While the stovetop was also hot, Paul preferred the grill due to its open flame and practicality when cooking larger cuts of meat. A stovetop requires the use of pans, and the uneven heat distribution often leads to inconsistent and less desirable results compared to a grill. Furthermore, cooking on a stovetop can result in a greasier end product, as the fat doesn't have a chance to escape from the pan, and the steak ends up effectively cooking in its own juice and fat. Grilling also offers the opportunity to cook different sides simultaneously, allowing for a more efficient and convenient cooking process. While the steak is grilled, vegetables like corn and asparagus can also be prepared on the grill, creating a more cohesive and complete meal. This is especially important during a gathering or a barbecue party, where multiple dishes need to be prepared and served at the same time. In summary, Paul wanted to cook the steak on the grill instead of the stovetop because the grill was hot, providing a superior cooking method for searing, flavor enhancement, and health benefits. The grill also offers versatility in cooking multiple dishes simultaneously, adding practicality and efficiency to the meal preparation process. The stovetop, although hot and suitable for cooking various dishes, does not impart the same benefits, particularly when it comes to grilling thick cuts of meat like steak."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). Two brothers loved geology.

In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \\"He likes you a lot.\\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \\"lost weekend\\". In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.In June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them. Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends. By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang that his separation from Ono was now over, although Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress. Answer:","completion":"Harry"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- \\"Easy money, fast and effective.\\" Investors protest outside the headquarters of DMG, one of many companies accused of defrauding the public. That was the name of one of the businesses in which millions of Colombians deposited their life savings after being promised short-term returns of as much as 150 percent. But government officials say the businesses were pyramid schemes that raked in at least 200 million from 3 million people. The government has said it knows who most of those responsible are, but they have escaped. The government is tracking them down. Sergio Munoz is among those who lost their savings. \\"That was for my children,\\" he said. \\"Now, it comes to light that they have robbed us. It was with complicity of the authorities who permit this -- knowing that it is illegal for it to be permitted.\\" The government says the businesses defrauded the public by offering false promises of a sure investment. Wilson Rodriguez handed over the equivalent of 80,000 to a money man who offered him what he thought were assets in hotels and property in exchange. Now, he doesn't know whom to approach. \\"I don't even have enough to care for my family,\\" he said. \\"I lent money and what I make from my salary goes to pay off debts. I have nothing.

Write a title for this article: Racks on racks: Rapper Yung Chris (aka Christopher Miller) says his single Racks— a \\"rack\\" being a slang term for 1,000 — is gaining momentum for two simple reasons: \\"It's just a club song that everybody vibes to, moves around to,\\" he says. \\"And racks, of course, is the money, so you know everybody wants money.\\" With a chorus like \\"Got racks on racks on racks/racks on racks on racks/racks on racks on racks\\" on top of a club-approved beat, the description is spot-on — this is pure party music. The song hovered just under the top 40 on Billboard's Hot 100 and hit No. 2 (rhythmic) and No. 4 (urban) on USA TODAY's airplay charts. Yung Chris has a hit single out called 'Racks.' Yung Chris has a hit single out called 'Racks.' The payoff: Rapping has been the 26-year-old Decatur, Ga., native's hobby since childhood, but as he grew up and experienced street life, \\"I started taking it a little more serious (and) started recording.\\" Persistence with a healthy dose of confidence eventually led Yung Chris, who usually goes by YC Worldwide, to a record deal. \\"Anything I'm gonna try, I'm gonna succeed in, you know? I kept trying, kept working and it finally started to pay off,\\" he says. Sign him up: After being courted by a number of major labels because of the underground success of Racks, \\"I (was) just looking for somebody to believe in me as much as I believe in myself.\\" He found that with Universal Republic, and signed with the label in March. YC subsequently released his Got Racks mixtape in early April. The 17-song collection includes the rapper's next single, I Know. \\"We've been getting a crazy response off (the track),\\" YC says. \\"A lot of people have been hitting me up about it.\\" He's currently recording his full-length debut in Atlanta in between dates of a solo club tour, which stops next in Las Vegas on July 2. New at the game: The rapper performed Racks at the BET Awards pre-show last weekend, where he met some of the hip-hop scene's biggest names, \\"rappers that have been in the game a little longer (than me). That was a great experience, being very new at this game.\\" Walking the red carpet with industry leaders such as Jay-Z is inspirational, he says. \\"I look up to (them), to try to accomplish some of the goals, or even more goals, than they have accomplished.\\" The highlight of his night? \\"I met the Five Heartbeats,\\" he says, referring to the fictional group from the 1991 film of the same name, which performed at the awards show to celebrate the movie's 20th anniversary. \\"To see them all dressed up — remember the movie?\\" he says with a laugh. As for his own performance, YC couldn't wait to hit BET's stage. When approached by the network to perform, \\"I was like, 'For real, BET? Oh, man, all right, let's go! What? I need to be there now? I'm on my way, I'm ready to go perform for BET,'\\" he says, recalling his enthusiasm. Remix it up: \\"I think I have the world's longest remix,\\" says YC, laughing. \\"It's like 22 minutes.\\" The official remix of Racks is actually more like 13 minutes, but with 15 rappers including Nelly, B.o.B., Wale, Wiz Khalifa and Waka Flocka, the higher estimate isn't too far-fetched. \\"It's crazy. We shot (the video) in Atlanta. I mean, Nelly came down to be in the video — that shocked me.\\" The veteran hip-hop artist approached YC to get in on the remix, rathern than the other way around. \\"For Nelly to do it, that was kind of exciting. He's accomplished a lot, he's sold a lot of records.\\" Identity crisis or not: Yung Chris is one vowel away from Young Chris, another rapper and one half of the duo Young Gunz. YC Worldwide, who uses the initials to help avoid confusion, says the similarity of the monikers actually hasn't caused much of a problem. \\"The only problem I ran into is Twitter.

Answer the following question. The chemical element 'Lutetium' is named after which city?","completion":"The chemical element Lutetium, with the atomic number 71 and symbol Lu, is named after the city of Paris. The name Lutetium is derived from \\"Lutetia,\\" which is the Latin name for Paris. Lutetium is a rare earth element and falls under the Lanthanide series of the periodic table. It was discovered independently by Austrian scientist Carl Auer von Welsbach and French scientist Georges Urbain in 1907. Georges Urbain initially had the honor of identifying a new element (element 71) while analyzing the impurities of a mineral called \\"Ytterbia.\\" He separated the novel element in the form of an oxide and named it \\"neoytterbia.\\" Later, he renamed the element to Lutetium in honor of the ancient name of Paris, where the discovery was made. Carl Auer von Welsbach, on the other hand, isolated the same element from a different mineral called \\"Ytterbia\\" around the same time and named it \\"cassiopeium\\" after the constellation Cassiopeia. However, priority was ultimately given to Urbain's discovery and naming since he published the findings first. Lutetium has several applications, both scientific and commercial. It is used as a catalyst in petroleum refining, in the production of phosphors for lighting, and in the detection of ions in mass spectrometry. Additionally, stable isotopes of Lutetium, particularly Lutetium-176, are used in geological dating of rocks and minerals. Despite its significance and interesting history, Lutetium remains a relatively obscure and less-known element mainly due to its rarity in nature and limited applications when compared to other elements. Nonetheless, the story of its discovery and naming after the ancient city of Paris highlights the connection between science and history, as well as the global collaboration in the advancement of scientific knowledge."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Learn more ||||| The two posts struck a more combative tone for President Donald Trump, who was decidedly more conciliatory in a statement released by the White House Wednesday night. | AP Photo Trump calls appointment of special prosecutor 'the single greatest witch hunt' The president's tweets are a stark contrast from his more restrained tone on Wednesday night. President Donald Trump on Thursday blasted the appointment of Robert Mueller to be the special prosecutor overseeing the investigation into Russia’s meddling into the 2016 election, calling the probe “the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history.” He also accused former President Barack Obama’s administration and the campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton of committing “illegal acts,” complaining that his campaign will now face the scrutiny of a special prosecutor while neither his predecessor nor 2016 opponent ever have. Story Continued Below “With all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign & Obama Administration, there was never a special councel [sic] appointed!” the president wrote on Twitter on Thursday morning, without elaborating further on the illegal acts he accused the Clinton campaign and Obama administration of committing. (He later fixed the spelling error.) The flurry of posts comes as Trump's White House is mired in controversy, most of it self-created, stemming from the president's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey last week, a decision he said he made based in part on the bureau's Russia investigation, whichwill now be taken over by Mueller.

Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. The Trump administration was also left reeling earlier this week in the wake of a Washington Post report alleging that the president divulged highly sensitive intelligence in a meeting with top Russian diplomats last week, a story that the White House has disputed without outright denying that classified information was shared. The whiff of scandal intensified when allegations surfaced that Trump had pressured Comey to drop a probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn — a charge the White House denies. All of it has taken the focus away from what was to have been the week's focus , Trump's first international trip as president, an eight-day, five-nation journey that will include stops in Saudi Arabia, at Israel's Western Wall and at the Vatican. The two Thursday morning posts struck a combative tone for Trump, who was more conciliatory in a statement released by the White House on Wednesday night. “As I have stated many times, a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know — there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity,” said the Wednesday-night statement, credited to Trump. “I look forward to this matter concluding quickly. In the meantime, I will never stop fighting for the people and the issues that matter most to the future of our country.” The Department of Justice announced Wednesday night that former FBI Director Mueller will lead an independent investigation into Russian efforts to interfere in last year’s presidential campaign as well as into the possibility of collusion between the Kremlin and Trump associates. The White House had regularly objected to the idea of a special prosecutor, characterizing such an appointment as unnecessary. With the White House battling multiple scandals, Trump and his allies have adopted a posture of being unfairly under siege. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, appearing Thursday morning on CNBC, said “we have to just get on with it, get this over. It's a sideshow. But what the media forgets in the midst of this sideshow of media frenzy, the president is running the country.” Trump’s aides, both current and former, have come to the president’s defense, as have family members working outside the White House. Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s combative first campaign manager, who maintains close ties to the White House and recently left the lobbying firm he helped found shortly after last year’s election, said Wednesday on Fox News that “I can tell you firsthand because I was on the campaign for a long time: Never, ever, ever did I ever see anybody have contact with any agent of any foreign government, Russia or anybody else.” White House social media director Dan Scavino chimed in, citing Lewandowski’s remarks in a post to Twitter, adding that he, too, “was there from the very beginning, and never, ever, ever....did I see either!” Eric Trump, the president’s son who, along with his brother, took over leadership of the family business when their father took office, tacked on his own tweet, linking back to Scavino’s and writing that “I was too! This entire thing is a witch hunt propagated by a failed political campaign.” House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, who wrote Wednesday evening on Twitter that Mueller was a \\"great selection\\" with \\"impeccable credentials,\\" said Thursday on ABC's \\"Good Morning America\\" that despite his approval of the former FBI director as a special prosecutor, he remained unconvinced that one was necessary in the first place. Chaffetz also said that congressional inquiries into Russian meddling should continue, even though the possibility exists that the separate probes might interfere with one another. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) took a similar tack, telling MSNBC's \\"Morning Joe\\" that Comey should still testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Even before Mueller’s appointment, Trump was griping about his perceived unfair treatment, telling graduates of the Coast Guard Academy at their commencement ceremony on Wednesday that “no politician in history — and I say this with great surety — has been treated worse or more unfairly.” He implored the new graduates to take a lesson from his fledgling presidency. “Over the course of your life, you will find that things are not always fair. You will find that things happen to you that you do not deserve and that are not always warranted,” Trump said. “You have to put your head down and fight, fight, fight. Never ever, ever give up.” ||||| With all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign & Obama Administration, there was never a special counsel appointed! ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"This article talks about how President Donald Trump is not happy about the appointment of a special prosecutor to look into possible connections between his election campaign and Russia.

But whether potassium intake could prevent stroke or death wasn't clear,\\" said Smoller, professor of the department of population health at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY. Researchers studied 90,137 women, aged from 50 to 79 for an average 11 years. They looked at how much potassium the women consumed, as well as if they had strokes, including ischemic strokes , or died during the study period. Women in the study were stroke-free at the start and their average dietary potassium intake was 2,611 mg/day. Results of this study are based on potassium from food, not supplements. The researchers found: Women who ate the most potassium were 12 percent less likely to suffer stroke in general and 16 percent less likely to suffer an ischemic stroke than women who ate the least. Women who ate the most potassium were 10 percent less likely to die than those who ate the least. Among women who did not have high blood pressure, those who ate the most potassium had a 27 percent lower ischemic stroke risk and 21 perc ent reduced risk for all stroke types, compared to women who ate the least potassium in their daily diets. Among women with high blood pressure, those who ate the most potassium had a lower risk of death, but potassium intake did not lower their stroke risk. \\"Our findings suggest that women need to eat more p otassium-rich foods.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Economist Debates: Fracking Amy Myers Jaffe is an expert on global energy policy, geopolitical risk, and energy and sustainability. She joined the University of California, Davis, in October 2012 as executive director for energy and sustainability and also heads the fossil-fuel component of Next STEPS (Sustainable Transportation Energy Pathways) at the Graduate School of Management and Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS). Before that she was director of the Energy Forum and Wallace S. Wilson Fellow in Energy Studies at Rice University’s James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy. She was also senior editor and Middle East analyst at Petroleum Intelligence Weekly. Publications include “Oil, Dollars, Debt and Crises” (co-author with Mahmoud El-Gamal, CUP, 2010), “Energy in the Caspian Region” (co-editor, Palgrave, 2002) and “Natural Gas and Geopolitics” (co-editor, CUP, 2006). She is a frequent speaker at energy industry conferences and has provided testimony on energy matters to governments throughout the world. Energy is a fundamental service needed for daily living. Lack of access to fuel is a key driver of poverty and premature mortality. But as essential as energy is to human development, the reality is that all forms of energy production have environmental consequences. Michael Brune has been executive director of the Sierra Club for nearly three years. During that time the number of supporters has grown to more than 2m and its \\"Beyond Coal\\" campaign has been recognised as one of the most effective in environmental history. He was previously executive director of the Rainforest Action Network, where he served for seven years. Under his leadership, the organisation won more than a dozen important environmental commitments from America's largest corporations, including Bank of America, Boise, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Home Depot, Kinko's and Lowe's. His book, \\"Coming Clean: Breaking America's Addiction to Oil and Coal\\" (2010), details a plan for a new green economy that will create well-paying jobs, promote environmental justice and bolster national security. Fracking currently enjoys exemptions from parts of at least seven major national statutes, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. If fracking is so safe, why can't the industry be held to the same standards as everyone else? Shale gas, extracted by hydraulic fracturing (\\"fracking\\") of rock formations, has transformed America's energy outlook. The country is set to become self-sufficient in natural gas and could become a big exporter, boosting its economy, while gas substituting for coal in electricity generation has sent carbon emissions plunging. But extracting shale gas is controversial. Opponents claim that fracking and other consequences of extracting shale gas harm the environment through poor practices, leading to water pollution, methane leakage and seismic activity, as well as the industrialisation of the countryside—and big investments are being made in a fossil fuel rather than renewable energy. The gas industry and those in favour of shale gas dismiss most of these assertions as either vastly trumped up or plain wrong. Which side is right?","completion":"This news article presents a debate on hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and its environmental consequences among two experts—Amy Myers Jaffe, an expert on global energy policy, and Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. Fracking, which extracts shale gas from rock formations, has revolutionized America's energy landscape by promoting self-sufficiency in natural gas, potentially enabling exportation and reducing carbon emissions from electricity generation. Despite these benefits, fracking also faces controversy due to allegations of harmful environmental effects, such as water pollution, methane leakage, seismic activity, and industrialization of rural areas, as well as promoting investments in fossil fuels rather than renewable energy. The gas industry and fracking supporters refute these claims as exaggerated or false. The debate examines whether the industry should be held to the same environmental standards as other sectors and weighs the economic impact of fracking against its potential ecological consequences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: County Cork, Ireland, 1920. Dr. Damien O'Donovan is about to leave his native village to practise medicine in a London hospital. Meanwhile, his brother Teddy commands the local flying column of the Irish Republican Army. After a hurling match, Damien witnesses the summary execution of his friend, Micheál Ó Súilleabháin, by British Black and Tans. Although shaken, Damien rebuffs his friends' entreaties to stay in Ireland and join the IRA, saying that the war is unwinnable. As he is leaving town, Damien witnesses the British Army vainly trying to intimidate a railway personnel for refusing to permit the troops to board. In response, Damien decides to stay and is sworn into Teddy's IRA brigade. After drilling in the mountains, the column raids the village's Royal Irish Constabulary barracks to acquire revolvers, then uses them to assassinate four Auxiliaries. In the aftermath, Anglo-Irish landowner Sir John Hamilton coerces one of his servants, IRA member Chris Reilly, into passing information to the British Army's Intelligence Corps. As a result, the entire brigade is arrested. In their cell, Damien meets the train driver, Dan, a union official who shares Damien's socialist views.

He had German, Scots-Irish, and English ancestry, and was the seventh of nine children of Cynthia Ann (nee Stanton) and Benjamin Ward Baum, only five of whom survived into adulthood. \\"Lyman\\" was the name of his father's brother, but he always disliked it and preferred his middle name \\"Frank\\". His father succeeded in many businesses, including barrel-making, oil drilling in Pennsylvania, and real estate. Baum grew up on his parents' expansive estate called Rose Lawn, which he fondly recalled as a sort of paradise. Rose Lawn was located in Mattydale, New York. Frank was a sickly, dreamy child, tutored at home with his siblings. From the age of 12, he spent two miserable years at Peekskill Military Academy but, after being severely disciplined for daydreaming, he had a possibly psychogenic heart attack and was allowed to return home. Baum started writing early in life, possibly prompted by his father buying him a cheap printing press. He had always been close to his younger brother Henry (Harry) Clay Baum, who helped in the production of The Rose Lawn Home Journal. The brothers published several issues of the journal, including advertisements from local businesses, which they would give to family and friends for free. By the age of 17, Baum established a second amateur journal called The Stamp Collector, printed an 11-page pamphlet called Baum's Complete Stamp Dealers' Directory, and started a stamp dealership with friends. At 20, Baum took on the national craze of breeding fancy poultry. He specialized in raising the Hamburg. In March 1880, he established a monthly trade journal, The Poultry Record, and in 1886, when Baum was 30 years old, his first book was published: The Book of the Hamburgs: A Brief Treatise upon the Mating, Rearing, and Management of the Different Varieties of Hamburgs. Baum had a flair for being the spotlight of fun in the household, including during times of financial difficulties. His selling of fireworks made the Fourth of July memorable. His skyrockets, Roman candles, and fireworks filled the sky, while many people around the neighborhood would gather in front of the house to watch the displays. Christmas was even more festive. Baum dressed as Santa Claus for the family. His father would place the Christmas tree behind a curtain in the front parlor so that Baum could talk to everyone while he decorated the tree without people managing to see him. He maintained this tradition all his life.

If your tree is unhealthy, it's more likely to die from shock while being replanted. If your tree is dehydrated or diseased, try to treat its ailment as much as possible before moving it. Available options: -- Trees older than 3 years are more likely to suffer damage while being transplanted. Amateur gardeners should not attempt to transplant trees with a trunk diameter larger than 2 inches (5.1 cm). -- Your tree's core moisture will also help keep it healthy. If your tree is severely undernourished, reduce the amount of water it gets daily. -- If possible, put it in a new location for replanting. If your tree is dead, it won't recover until you plan to replant it. -- Use a pesticide to try to halt the tree from becoming fertilized. Keeping your tree well hydrated and shiny will improve their natural nutrients. Answer:","completion":"Trees older than 3 years are more likely to suffer damage while being transplanted. Amateur gardeners should not attempt to transplant trees with a trunk diameter larger than 2 inches (5.1 cm). If you are unsure about the age or size of your tree, consulting a professional arborist or horticulturist can help guide you in making an informed decision. Before you decide to proceed with replanting a tree, you must first assess its overall health, root system, and size to ensure it thrives in its new location. Soil preparation is another critical factor that can influence success. Here are the steps you should follow to replant a tree: 1. Choose the appropriate time: The best time to replant a tree is during its dormant season. For deciduous trees, this means early spring or late fall, while for evergreens, aim for late summer or early fall. Cool temperatures and sufficient rainfall will help the tree establish roots in its new location. 2. Inspect the root system: A healthy root system is crucial for the tree's survival during transplantation. Gently dig around the tree to expose its root ball, which is the mass of roots just below the trunk. Ensure the roots are not circling, girdling, or diseased, as these issues may prevent the tree from thriving in its new location. 3. Dig the new hole: Measure the width and depth of the exposed root ball, and dig a hole in the new location that is about twice as wide as the root ball and as deep as its height. It's essential to loosen the soil at the sides and bottom of the hole, so the roots can easily spread and grow. 4. Carefully remove the tree: Carefully lift the tree out of the hole by its root ball, ensuring that you do not damage its roots or trunk. If the tree is too large or heavy to handle, you may need to use a tree spade or enlist professional help. 5. Transport the tree: While moving the tree to its new location, protect its root ball by wrapping it in a burlap sack or keeping it moist using a tarp. Avoid direct sunlight and excessive wind during transportation. 6. Replant the tree: Place the tree into the prepared hole, ensuring that the top of the root ball is level with the surrounding soil. Fill the hole with soil, gently packing it around the root ball to eliminate air pockets. Be sure not to bury the exposed root flare, as this can lead to root rot and other health issues. 7. Water and mulch: After planting the tree, water it generously to help settle the soil. Apply a layer of organic mulch, like wood chips or shredded bark, around the tree to help retain moisture and maintain a consistent soil temperature. Keep in mind to avoid piling the mulch against the trunk, as this may cause disease and rot. 8. Stake if necessary: If the tree is unable to stand upright on its own, you may need to stake it temporarily. Utilize soft, flexible materials, such as straps or tree ties, to avoid damaging the trunk. Generally, remove the stakes within a year to allow the tree to grow strong and stable. 9. Monitor and care: Keep a close eye on your replanted tree for several weeks, ensuring it receives adequate water, sunlight, and nutrients. Watch for potential signs of stress, such as leaf drop, wilting, or dieback. Consult an arborist or horticulturist for advice if you notice any issues, as they may be able to suggest appropriate treatments. By following these steps, you can help improve the chances of a successful transplantation and ensure your tree thrives in its new home. Remember, replanting a tree is a delicate process that requires patience, care, and attention to detail. If you are unsure about any aspect of the procedure, seeking professional help is always a wise option."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Barry Redden (born July 21, 1960) is a former American football running back who played for the Los Angeles Rams, the San Diego Chargers, and the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL). He spent much of his career playing in the shadow of Pro Football Hall of Fame running back Eric Dickerson. Hypothesis: Barry Redden is a very unfortunate man","completion":"Based on the provided information, it is not accurate to definitively conclude that Barry Redden is a very unfortunate man. While the paragraph informs us about his professional career and mentions that he played in the shadow of Pro Football Hall of Fame running back Eric Dickerson, this is not enough to determine his overall fortune. It is important to consider that just because Redden might have been overshadowed by Eric Dickerson in his professional football career, it does not automatically make him very unfortunate. There are several factors to take into account before making a judgment on Redden's level of fortune, such as: 1. Personal life: We must assess Redden's personal happiness, relationships, well-being, and fulfillment in life beyond his football career. We do not have any details available regarding his family, friends, or pursuits outside the realm of football to label him as unfortunate. 2. Career achievements: Despite being overshadowed by Dickerson, Redden still had a career as a professional football player in the NFL, which is a remarkable achievement in itself. He played for several teams, including the Los Angeles Rams, the San Diego Chargers, and the Cleveland Browns. This fact suggests that he was talented and skilled enough to be a part of such successful professional sports organizations. 3. Finances: While we don't have any specific details, it is reasonable to assume that Redden was earning money throughout his NFL career. This would suggest that he might have been fortunate in a financial aspect, at least during his playing days. 4. Opportunities post-football: There's no information available to determine if Redden has faced challenges or pursued opportunities beyond his football career. However, playing professional football often opens doors for various ventures, like coaching, sports broadcasting, or entrepreneurship. It would be crucial to evaluate this aspect to determine if Redden is indeed \\"very unfortunate.\\" 5. Health: Information about Redden's physical, emotional, and mental health is essential to understand his level of fortune. Football careers can expose individuals to injuries and long-term health issues. However, we do not have any concrete information to consider in this case. In conclusion, without a comprehensive understanding of Barry Redden's personal life, career achievements, finances, opportunities post-football, and health, it is insufficient to conclude that he is a very unfortunate man based solely on the provided information. Playing in the shadow of a highly talented and successful football player like Eric Dickerson might be one of the challenges Redden faced, but it does not paint the entire picture of his fortune."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Family left homeless after Brooklyn blaze trying its best to endure new hardships BY Joe Jackson and Larry Mcshane DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITERS Sunday, February 27th 2011, 4:00 AM One week afterÂ his family's Brooklyn apartment was gutted in a fire, Patrick Louis wonders when - or even if - life will return to normal. His children, after losing their home, lost their appetites and their smiles. His wife put her career on hold. The present is unpleasant, and the future remains uncertain. \\"We don't know what's going to happen,\\" the family patriarch said Saturday. \\"We're just waiting to see. At least we have a roof over our heads and a place to sleep.\\" His wife, Myralda, tending to four children in a cramped motel room, said the Feb. 19 fire instantaneously turned their lives topsy-turvy. \\"It's changed everything,\\" the 25-year-old said. \\"I was really excited to go to [nursing] school, but there's nothing I can do.\\" She's postponed taking classes at Kingsborough Community College until life is back on track. For now, home is the Gowanus Super 8 motel - where the family of six is enjoying clothes, gifts and other donations from generous Daily News readers. \\"We're so grateful,\\" said Patrick Louis, a 38-year-old Haitian immigrant. \\"New York City has the most caring people.\\" Four-year-old Khealy, who lost all her Valentine's Day birthday gifts in the blaze, was thrilled to receive a pink dollhouse from a Westchester County couple. The family even shared some of its charitable windfall with neighbors displaced by the fire. The devastating blaze was ignited by candles used in a steamy voodoo sex ritual inside the seven-story apartment building. Tenant Nelson (Pepe) Pierre, known as a voodoo priest, is accused of taking 300 from a woman to provide a life-changing experience - starting with a carnal romp in his fourth-floor bedroom. The tryst became so heated that the pair failed to notice that the ritual candles surrounding the bed had ignited the apartment. One woman was killed and dozens left homeless by the raging, five-alarm blaze. The Louis family met yesterday with Housing Preservation and Development officials, who already said the family will stay at the motel for another week before it is permanently relocated. Patrick Louis, a limousine driver, said the family doesn't want to move to one of the other four boroughs. \\"We want to stay in Brooklyn - for the kids,\\" he said. \\"We don't want anywhere that's not safe for them. And they have to go to school.\\" This is the second narrow escape for the oldest kids, 12-year-old Kindersley and 11-year-old Kristelle. Both were living in their native Haiti when last year's devastating earthquake hit. \\"They're survivors,\\" said stepmom Myralda. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text center on the plight of the Louis family, who were left homeless after their Brooklyn apartment was gutted in a fire. Patrick Louis, the family patriarch, and his wife, Myralda, along with their four children, are currently living in a cramped motel room, but are uncertain of their future. The fire, oddly ignited by candles used in a voodoo sex ritual by another tenant, has altered the course of this family's life significantly. Myralda, once excited to attend nursing school, had to postpone her education, while the children dealt with loss of their home and normal routines. Despite their personal losses, the family remains grateful, particularly for the support from generous Daily News readers who donated clothes, gifts, and other items. One significant moment came when their four-year-old daughter, who lost her birthday gifts in the blaze, received a pink dollhouse from a couple in Westchester County. The family is currently in talks with Housing Preservation and Development officials about a permanent relocation plan. However, they wish to stay in Brooklyn considering their children's safety and schooling. A rather striking part of the text highlights their older children's resilience, mentioning how they endured hardships earlier as well, having survived last year's devastating earthquake in their native Haiti. This event not only portrays the Louis family's immediate struggles and efforts to find stability, but also underscores the broader issue of disaster recovery for families forced into sudden homelessness due to unforeseen circumstances. It also signals the spirit of human resilience and the impact of community support in overcoming such adversities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"How to call the first emperor in Han Dynasty?\\" Context: \\"China's first imperial dynasty was the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC). The Qin unified the Chinese Warring States by conquest, but their empire became unstable after the death of the first emperor Qin Shi Huangdi. Within four years, the dynasty's authority had collapsed in the face of rebellion. Two former rebel leaders, Xiang Yu (d. 202 BC) of Chu and Liu Bang (d. 195 BC) of Han, engaged in a war to decide who would become hegemon of China, which had fissured into 18 kingdoms, each claiming allegiance to either Xiang Yu or Liu Bang. Although Xiang Yu proved to be a capable commander, Liu Bang defeated him at Battle of Gaixia (202 BC), in modern-day Anhui.

While it's mentioned that the donut place was initially the reviewer's favorite, the actions of the owner have led to disappointment and discomfort. There are a few key points in the review that provide evidence for considering it negative: 1. Observation of unsanitary conditions and behavior: When the reviewer saw the owner kill a cockroach on the donut tray, it raised hygiene concerns. This incident is a primary reason for the reviewer's negative sentiment, as it implies that the food might be contaminated. 2. Inadequate cleaning measures: The owner only washing off the part of the tray where the cockroach was killed and acting as if nothing happened further contributes to the negative sentiment. This portrays that the owner may not adhere to proper cleaning and sanitizing standards in the establishment. 3. Discomfort with the purchased product: The reviewer's inability to eat the donuts they bought signifies disapproval and discontent with the situation. 4. Returning and reselling of the donut: The fact that the owner allowed the reviewer to return the donuts is a positive aspect. However, the final decision of the owner to put the returned donuts back out to sell on the same tray outweighs the positive sentiment, as it indicates a possible lack of concern for the customers' well-being. Nevertheless, the reviewer does mention that the owner is a very kind man, which is a positive point. However, the kindness of the owner does not outweigh the cumulative negative factors that are related to health and hygiene concerns.

(B). motorcycle was new..","completion":"Bob went to the vehicle dealer to trade his truck for a motorcycle, because the motorcycle was new. Ever since he was a young boy, Bob had always dreamed of owning a brand-new motorcycle. The freedom of the open road and the adrenaline rush he felt every time he climbed onto the saddle were simply unparalleled. Bob had owned a few used bikes over the years, but it was time for him to treat himself and indulge in the motorcycle of his dreams - something shiny, powerful, and with that intoxicating new-bike smell. Having driven a reliable truck for a few years, Bob appreciated its utility and durability, but the sheer bulkiness of the vehicle was becoming a burden, both physically and mentally. The crowded streets and the never-ending search for parking spots had started to wear on him. Not to mention, the environmental impact of driving a gas-guzzling truck was becoming more and more apparent in the world, and Bob wanted to do his part to reduce his carbon footprint. It was time for a change, and a new motorcycle would help him achieve that goal. Upon arrival at the dealer, Bob couldn't help but feel a thrill of excitement as he caught sight of the gleaming motorcycles lined up in the showroom. He greeted the salesperson with enthusiasm and shared his goal of trading his truck for one of the magnificent machines before him. After evaluating the condition of his truck, the salesperson guided him through the extensive range of motorcycles available, and Bob appreciated the expertise and experience offered by the staff. Bob's eyes were immediately drawn to a sleek, black motorcycle with an air of power and sophistication. He couldn't help but run his hands over the smooth curves of the bike, envisioning himself conquering the highways with precision and style. He asked the salesperson about its features, and the conversation that followed served to fuel his excitement even further. With a fuel-efficient modern engine, high-tech performance features, and cutting-edge safety systems, this motorcycle appeared to have it all. But it wasn't just about the bike's impressive specifications. Bob couldn't help but feel a deep sense of connection with the motorcycle, as though it was calling out to him specifically. This wasn't just a random purchase. This motorcycle truly felt like a manifestation of his dreams, and he knew that owning it would signify a new, exciting chapter in his life. Concluding the tour, the salesperson went over the trade-in value for Bob's truck and provided him with financing options to allow him to take his dream motorcycle home. After careful consideration, Bob signed on the dotted line, feeling certain that he was making the right decision. As he pulled away from the dealership on his brand-new motorcycle, Bob felt a combination of exhilaration and pride. The rumble of the engine beneath him and the wind against his face were exhilarating, and he knew that this was just the beginning of many wonderful adventures on the open road. Bob had successfully traded in his old truck for a new, state-of-the-art motorcycle, and he couldn't help but smile wide as he rode towards the horizon, his spirit soaring with every mile."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

It refers to the practical application of an item in question, which is the \\"old chest.\\" \\"Use\\" tells us that the old chest serves a specific purpose or has been repurposed. 3. \\"old chest\\": This term signifies the object being discussed, which contributes significantly to the context of the sentence. An \\"old chest\\" typically refers to a piece of antique furniture used for storage, often adorned with intricate designs and woodwork. In this case, the chest is being utilized in a unique way, as its traditional application is being altered. 4. \\"end table\\": This term is another crucial element in understanding the sentence as it specifies the new role or purpose of the \\"old chest.\\" An end table is a piece of furniture placed at the side or end of a sofa, bed, or chair, offering a surface for various uses, such as placing decorative items or day-to-day objects like drinks, books, or lamps.

A babysitter has been arrested after a 4-year-old girl she was meant to be watching died when left unattended in the sitter's apartment. Naira Bennett was found trapped in a folding futon and rushed to a Newark, New Jersey hospital but pronounced dead hours later after doctors were unable to revive her. The babysitter, Sakita Covington, has been taken into police custody and charged with child endangerment and aggravated assault. Naira was one of four children that Covington, 38, left alone in her apartment in a housing complex on Wednesday morning. All of the children were under the age of four. The Star-Ledger reports that Covington asked a friend who lived in the same complex to watch the children while she rushed out to pick up one of her sons from school but the neighbor told her that she would not be able to until later. 'When I got upstairs the baby was in the futon,' the friend told ABC7 without revealing her name. 'I don't know what happened. I wasn't there.' One of the other children was another one of Covington's sons. The three children who were with Naira at the time were unharmed. An autopsy is being performed which will determine the official cause of death and give more clues as to what happened.

Police were called to the apartment at 10.45am on Wednesday and shew as transported to University Hospital. Naira was not officially declared dead until 7pm that evening.

He was named after Ray Charles, his mother's favorite singer. The family moved to Washington, D.C., when he was three, and they settled permanently in Palmer Park, Maryland when he was ten. His father worked as a supermarket night manager and his mother was a nurse. On December 7, 1989, Leonard defended the title against Roberto Duran, who was the reigning WBC Middleweight Champion. Duran was guaranteed 7.6 million and Leonard's arrangement guaranteed him over 13 million. For the Duran fight, Leonard cut his entourage from twenty-one to six. Dave Jacobs was one of the people let go, leaving Correa as the sole trainer. Correa was instructed not to spare the whip. \\"For the first time in a long time, I allowed someone to push me\\", Leonard said. The fight took place at the new Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas. Leonard used constant lateral movement and won by a lopsided twelve-round unanimous decision over a listless Duran. The scores were 120-110, 119-109, and 116-111. In a fight that many considered to be very boring, both fighters were booed often by the fans and many left the arena before the decision was announced. Pat Putnam of Sports Illustrated wrote, \\"Leonard gave them artistic perfection when they wanted heated battle, and they booed lustily. Most fight fans would not spend a dime to watch Van Gogh paint Sunflowers, but they would fill Yankee Stadium to see him cut off his ear.\\" Although Leonard dominated the fight, he suffered several cuts. His lower lip was cut from a headbutt in the fourth round, his left eye was cut in the eleventh round, and his right eye was cut in the twelfth round. The cuts required a total of 60 stitches. In January 1990, Leonard relinquished the WBC Super Middleweight Championship, saying that he was unsure whether he would fight again. When Leonard decided to continue his career, he offered Hagler a rematch, but Hagler decided to stay retired. He then offered Hearns a third fight, but Hearns said he could no longer make the weight and moved up to the light heavyweight division. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What else happened to Leonard in this fight?","completion":"In the fight against Roberto Duran on December 7, 1989, besides dominating and winning by a lopsided twelve-round unanimous decision, Leonard suffered several cuts during the fight.

Service: Good. No attitude and provided everything I needed. Sadly, this is one of the few places that I have nothing good to really say about them. Their pricing was not comparable to anything I have had before and bordered on being way too expensive for a simple meal. Why would anyone pay 3 for a measly side of fries? The worst was the food. I never knew beef mixed with onions and peppers can be so devoid of flavors like this sandwich was. I am actually amazed, but since I had paid for this meal, I feel cheated instead. The meat, although tender, had no taste to them and I would have doubt I was even eating beef if I had not known I ordered a Philly cheesesteak. Moreover, the sandwich was dry, even with all the onions and peppers that would normally be oozing juices. The cheese was also strangely nonexistent so the sandwich was really just a bunch of beef sitting around doing nothing. The turnaround was also pretty sad.

High lake had a lot of fresh and salt water mixing, therefore presented layers of stratified water.The water was poor in nutrients.Low lake had no such problems and it was a very abundant and prolific fishing spot. Hint: Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers. Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2] A:","completion":"Based on the information presented, High lake had fewer dissolved nutrients. The description indicates that this lake showed signs of water stratification, with its separate layers of fresh and salt water. Water stratification occurs when water masses with different properties like salinity, oxygenation, density, temperature, etc., form layers that create barriers to water mixing. This phenomenon can potentially lead to conditions of low oxygen (anoxia) or hydrogen sulfide saturation (euxinia). This stratification of High lake, especially, has important implications for nutrient availability in the water. The layers formed by stratification can act as impediments to nutrient mixing between different levels of the water body. Consequently, essential nutrients from the benthos (the bottom of a water body) are unable to reach the photic zone (the upper layer of a water body that receives light), which can limit the growth and availability of phytoplankton. Phytoplanktons are primary producers in a water ecosystem, thus requiring available nutrients to perform photosynthesis. When nutrient restriction occurs because of the barriers created by water stratification, the primary production decreases. This, in turn, also reduces the overall net productivity of aquatic life, making the ecosystem less nourishing for the organisms living within it. On the other hand, Low Lake was described as 'very abundant and prolific fishing spot', indicating that it likely had higher nutrient levels. The absence of water stratification in Low lake would allow the free movement of nutrients across all layers of the water body. This would ensure a higher nutrient availability and therefore, a more productive ecosystem conducive for the boom in fishing. Thus, compared to the High lake, Low lake is indicated to have more dissolved nutrients, making the former the lake with fewer dissolved nutrients as described in the source text."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: Call emergency services if an emotionally abusive person is physically violent or threatens to hurt you or your loved ones. Take their threats seriously, even if an emotional abusive partner or friend hasn’t been violent in the past. Describe the person's abusive behavior and threatening language to the emergency services operator. When authorities arrive, they'll question the person and, depending on your local laws and the nature of your complaint, take them into custody. Ask officers for a copy of the police report. After the crisis, file a restraining order against the abusive person if you're concerned about your safety. An emotionally abusive person might threaten to hurt themselves or commit suicide in order to control you. Get emergency help if you believe they will truly attempt to harm themselves, have a plan of doing so, or have immediate access to a weapon or other means of committing suicide. Tell the emergency services operator if the abusive person has a history of mental illness, and ask for responders trained in diffusing emergencies related to mental illness. If they regularly threaten suicide to control you, don't give in to their threats. Tell them that you are not responsible for their choices and that you will not give in to their demands. Maintaining your boundaries and leaving someone who repeatedly threatens suicide aren't easy. Remind yourself that these patterns are unhealthy, that your partner's intention is to control and intimidate you, and that they are responsible for their own actions. Make sure it’s physically and financially safe to leave an abusive situation before you act. Make arrangements with a friend or relative so you (and your children, if you have any) will have somewhere safe to go. If you live an emotional abusive romantic partner, try to pack essential documents, such your driver's license, passport, social security card, and birth certificate. Try to pack medications, valuables, and any other essential valuables. If possible, open a new bank account that your abusive partner can’t access. Make a copy of your car keys and hide them in case you need your partner takes away your keys. Memorize the phone numbers of trusted loved ones in case your partner takes away your phone. You could also get an emergency cell phone just in case. Many shelters offer free emergency prepaid phones. Head to your local courthouse to get a protective order. Call ahead to see if you need an appointment. Ask the court clerk for the required forms and ask for instructions about filing them. It’s helpful to bring a picture of the abuser, their home and work addresses, a written description of their abusive actions, and any photographs, medical records, or police reports related to the abuse. Ask a trusted friend or relative to go to the courthouse with you to provide moral support. There are no fees for requesting a domestic violence protective order, and you do not need a lawyer to file one.

Q:Given the following context: Now settled into Warner Bros. Records, the Chili Peppers began looking for a suitable producer. One in particular, Rick Rubin, stood out, as he was more broadminded than people the band had worked with in the past, even though Rubin had turned down the chance to produce their 1987 album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan due to the drug problems of Kiedis and guitarist Hillel Slovak (who would die of a heroin overdose a year later). Unlike the Peppers' previous producers, Rubin was someone the band felt confident in to ask for guidance and input during times of difficulty. He would often help arrange drum beats, guitar melodies and lyrics.The band sought to record the album in an unconventional setting, believing it would enhance their creative output. Rubin suggested the mansion magician Harry Houdini once lived in, to which they agreed. A crew was hired to set up a recording studio and other equipment required for production in the house in Los Angeles. The Peppers decided they would remain inside the mansion for the duration of recording, though according to Kiedis, Smith was convinced the location was haunted, and refused to stay. He would, instead, come each day by motorcycle. Smith himself disputes this account, and instead claims the real reason he did not stay at The Mansion was because he wanted to be with his wife. Frusciante, however, disagreed with Smith, and said \\"There are definitely ghosts in the house,\\" and Frusciante felt they were \\"very friendly. We [the band] have nothing but warm vibes and happiness everywhere we go in this house.\\"Frusciante, Kiedis, and Flea each had their own rooms in the house. When not recording with the band, Frusciante would spend his time painting, listening to music, reading and recording songs he'd written. Due to the seclusion, Kiedis ended up recording all his vocals in his room, as it was large enough to accommodate the recording equipment. For more than 30 days, the Chili Peppers worked inside the house; Kiedis felt it was an accommodating and resourceful environment... answer the following question: What's the full name of the man who suggested the Chili Peppers record in Houdini's former mansion?

[II] We make our guitars to your specifications.. [III] We produce and sell thousands of guitars each year.. [IV] Our guitars are the best quality your money can buy..","completion":"Statement [II] \\"We make our guitars to your specifications\\" should be in the advertisement to best emphasize the company's custom production processes. A detailed explanation of why other statements don't fit well and statement [II] is the best choice: [I] \\"Our guitars are made using hand tools\\" While this statement indicates a degree of craftsmanship and attention to detail, it does not specifically emphasize that the company produces custom guitars tailored to the customer's preferences. Additionally, using hand tools doesn't necessarily imply customization, so while it can be a part of the advertisement, it doesn't capture the custom production process as effectively as statement [II]. [II] \\"We make our guitars to your specifications\\" This statement directly addresses the company's custom production processes, emphasizing that the guitars are made to suit the individual customer's needs and preferences. It highlights the flexibility, personalized attention, and dedication to meeting the customer's unique desires, which are core values of a custom-made product. This is the most appropriate statement to focus on the company's custom production processes in the advertisement. [III] \\"We produce and sell thousands of guitars each year\\" This statement highlights the company's output capacity and popularity, but it does not emphasize the custom production processes employed by the company. In fact, mentioning the production of thousands of guitars may suggest a mass production approach rather than a custom, personalized one. This statement could inadvertently downplay the customization aspect the company wants to emphasize in its advertisement. [IV] \\"Our guitars are the best quality your money can buy\\" Although this statement highlights the high-quality nature of the company's guitars, it does not specifically mention or emphasize the custom production processes. It is possible to have high-quality products without custom production; therefore, this statement may not convey the unique value proposition the company is aiming for. It can be included in the advertisement in addition to statement [II], but it doesn't directly address the custom production process. In conclusion, statement [II] \\"We make our guitars to your specifications\\" is the most effective statement to emphasize the company's custom production processes in the advertisement. It clearly demonstrates the commitment to meeting customer requirements and highlights the primary differentiation factor for custom-made guitars. Other statements could be used to expand or support the overall message of the advertisement but don't specifically focus on the custom production aspect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Passenger pigeons once flew over much of the United States in unbelievable numbers. Written accounts from the 18th and 19th centuries described flocks so large that they darkened the sky for hours. It was calculated that when its population reached its highest point, there were more than 3 billion passenger pigeons--a number equal to 24 to 40 percent of the total bird population in the United States, making it perhaps the most abundant bird in the world. Even as late as 1870 when their numbers had already become smaller, a flock believed to be 1 mile wide and 320 miles (about 515 kilometers) long was seen near Cincinnati. Sadly, the abundance of passenger pigeons may have been their _ . Where the birds were most abundant, people believed there was an ever-lasting supply and killed them by the thousands. Commercial hunters attracted them to small clearings with grain, waited until pigeons had settled to feed, then threw large nets over them, taking hundreds at a time. The birds were shipped to large cities and sold in restaurants. By the closing decades of the 19th century, the hardwood forests where passenger pigeons nested had been damaged by Americans' need for wood, which scattered the flocks and forced the birds to go farther north, where cold temperatures and spring storms contributed to their decline. Soon the great flocks were gone, never to be seen again. In 1897, the state of Michigan passed a law prohibiting the killing of passenger pigeons, but by then, no sizable flocks had been seen in the state for 10 years. The last confirmed wild pigeon in the United States was shot by a boy in Pike County, Ohio, in 1900. For a time, a few birds survived under human care. The last of them, known affectionately as Martha, died at the Cincinnati Zoological Garden on September 1, 1914. Question: What can we infer about the law passed in Michigan? Options: A: It was ignored by the public. B: It was declared too late. C: It was unfair. D: It was strict. Answer:","completion":"B: It was declared too late. Justification: The article states that by the time the law was passed in Michigan in 1897, no sizable flocks of passenger pigeons had been seen in the state for 10 years. This implies that the law was passed after the passenger pigeons' population had significantly declined, suggesting it was too late to have a meaningful impact on their survival."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While Kyle owned snow tires, Joel owned standard tires because it often snowed where","completion":"While Kyle owned snow tires, Joel owned standard tires because it often snowed where Kyle lived while Joel lived in a region with a milder climate, which did not experience such harsh winters. Kyle lived in the hilly and snow-laden region where winters were long, harsh, and often came with heavy snowfall. He needed snow tires on his vehicle to be able to commute safely and easily during the winter months. Snow tires provided an extra layer of traction, grip, and adaptability to the snowy and slippery conditions that plagued the roads. This was particularly important because, in his rural community, roadways were regularly covered with ice, and snowplows could take several hours or even days to clear the roads. Kyle knew that having these snow tires would not only significantly increase the safety of his daily commutes but also allow him to drive without any major concerns of getting stuck or needing to wait for the roads to be cleared. On the other hand, Joel lived in a region that experienced a mild, almost Mediterranean climate with very little chance of snow. In this temperate climate, the winters were mild, roads didn't freeze over, and the temperature rarely dropped below freezing. Consequently, for Joel, snow tires would have been unnecessary, and he could well manage with the standard, all-season tires that his car came equipped with when he bought it. Joel's standard tires were designed to provide adequate performance in most driving conditions, including wet and dry roads, and they worked reasonably well for him all year round. The milder winters in his region meant that snow and ice coverage on the roads was a rare event, and any rare occurrences of snow accumulation were usually dealt with promptly by the local authorities. Additionally, investing in snow tires would have been financially impractical for Joel. Snow tires are more expensive than standard tires, and typically, they require the additional cost of separate rims. Storing the unused set of tires would also have taken up more of Joel's limited storage space, which he needed for other equipment and belongings. Finally, the choice of owning standard tires was environmentally conscious for Joel as well. Snow tires were made from a softer rubber compound, specifically designed to stay flexible and maintain grip in cold temperatures. While this made them ideal for winter driving in Kyle's area, using them in the warmer climates where Joel lived would have resulted in shorter tire life and increased wear, leading to more frequent replacements and greater adverse environmental impact due to tire waste. In conclusion, while Kyle owned snow tires as a result of the snowy and harsh winters in his region, Joel owned standard tires due to the milder climate in which he lived. This difference in tire ownership was not only practical but also financially sensible and environmentally responsible for both individuals, given the specific weather conditions in their locations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: In October, news broke that the CIA was preparing options to launch a cyberattack against Russia following revelations that the country was likely behind hacks at the Democratic National Committee earlier this summer. Now, a source has told NBC News that the US has penetrated key Russian systems, and will be ready to take action in case the country decides to interfere with next week’s elections. The US is preparing in case it is \\"attacked in a significant way\\" The systems allegedly include some of Russia’s telecommunications networks, its electrical power grid, and command systems at the Kremlin. NBC reported that the preparations are being made in the event that the US is \\"attacked in a significant way,\\" according to an anonymous intelligence official and top secret documents that the network had reviewed. While US election infrastructure has significant flaws with outdated voting machines and voter data, the decentralized nature of the election makes it much harder for attackers to outright change the final outcome. Digital security has become a concern during this election cycle, although NBC notes that the officials it spoke with \\"do not expect Russia to attack critical infrastructure,\\" although they do expect some \\"cyber mischief,\\" such as releases of fake documents and digital misinformation campaigns. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated By Ken Dilanian, William M. Arkin, Cynthia McFadden and Robert Windrem U.S. military hackers have penetrated Russia’s electric grid, telecommunications networks and the Kremlin’s command systems, making them vulnerable to attack by secret American cyber weapons should the U.S. deem it necessary, according to a senior intelligence official and top-secret documents reviewed by NBC News. American officials have long said publicly that Russia, China and other nations have probed and left hidden malware on parts of U.S critical infrastructure, \\"preparing the battlefield,\\" in military parlance, for cyber attacks that could turn out the lights or turn off the internet across major cities. It’s been widely assumed that the U.S. has done the same thing to its adversaries. The documents reviewed by NBC News — along with remarks by a senior U.S. intelligence official — confirm that, in the case of Russia. U.S. officials continue to express concern that Russia will use its cyber capabilities to try to disrupt next week’s presidential election. U.S. intelligence officials do not expect Russia to attack critical infrastructure — which many believe would be an act of war — but they do anticipate so-called cyber mischief, including the possible release of fake documents and the proliferation of bogus social media accounts designed to spread misinformation. On Friday the hacker known as \\"Guccifer 2.0\\" — which U.S. officials say is a front for Russian intelligence — tweeted a threat to monitor the U.S. elections \\"from inside the system.\\" Related: Exclusive: White House Readies to Fight Election Day Cyber Mayhem As NBC News reported Thursday, the U.S. government is marshaling resources to combat the threat in a way that is without precedent for a presidential election. The cyber weapons would only be deployed in the unlikely event the U.S. was attacked in a significant way, officials say. U.S. military officials often say in general terms that the U.S. possesses the world’s most advanced cyber capabilities, but they will not discuss details of highly classified cyber weapons. James Lewis, a cyber expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says that U.S. hacks into the computer infrastructure of adversary nations such as China, Russia, Iran and North Korea — something he says he presumes has gone on for years — is akin to the kind of military scouting that is as old as human conflict. \\"This is just the cyber version of that,\\" he said. In 2014, National Security Agency chief Adm. Mike Rogers told Congress that U.S. adversaries are performing electronic \\"reconnaissance\\" on a regular basis so that they can be in a position to disrupt the industrial control systems that run everything from chemical facilities to water treatment plants. \\"All of that leads me to believe it is only a matter of when, not if, we are going to see something dramatic,\\" he said at the time. Rogers didn't discuss the U.S.’s own penetration of adversary networks. But the hacking undertaken by the NSA, which regularly penetrates foreign networks to gather intelligence, is very similar to the hacking needed to plant precursors for cyber weapons, said Gary Brown, a retired colonel and former legal adviser to U.S. Cyber Command, the military's digital war fighting arm. \\"You'd gain access to a network, you'd establish your presence on the network and then you’re poised to do what you would like to do with the network,\\" he told NBC News. \\"Most of the time you might use that to collect information, but that same access could be used for more aggressive activities too.\\" Brown and others have noted that the Obama administration has been extremely reluctant to take action in cyberspace, even in the face of what it says is a series of Russian hacks and leaks designed to manipulate the U.S. presidential election. Administration officials did, however, deliver a back channel warning to Russian against any attempt to influence next week’s vote, officials told NBC News. The senior U.S. intelligence official said that, if Russia initiated a significant cyber attack against critical infrastructure, the U.S. could take action to shut down some Russian systems — a sort of active defense. Retired Adm. James Stavridis, who served as NATO commander of Europe, told NBC News’ Cynthia McFadden that the U.S. is well equipped to respond to any cyber attack. \\"I think there's three things we should do if we see a significant cyber-attack,\\" he said. \\"The first obviously is defending against it. The second is reveal: We should be publicizing what has happened so that any of this kind of cyber trickery can be unmasked. And thirdly, we should respond. Our response should be proportional.\\" The U.S. use of cyber attacks in the military context — or for covert action — is not without precedent. During the 2003 Iraq invasion, U.S spies penetrated Iraqi networks and sent tailored messages to Iraqi generals, urging them to surrender, and temporarily cut electronic power in Baghdad. In 2009 and 2010, the U.S., working with Israel, is believed to have helped deploy what became known as Stuxnet, a cyber weapon designed to destroy Iranian nuclear centrifuges. Today, U.S. Cyber Command is engaged in cyber operations against the Islamic State, including using social media to expose the location of militants and sending spoof orders to sow confusion, current and former officials tell NBC News. One problem, officials say, is that the doctrine around cyber conflict — what is espionage, what is theft, what is war — is not well developed. \\"Cyber war is undefined,\\" Brown said. \\"There are norms of behavior that we try to encourage, but people violate those.\\" ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a short explanation of the main points or ideas of a longer piece of writing or story.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Windows is worse than Linux because it is open source. Available choices: (A). Windows. (B). Linux. Who is it referring to?","completion":"The statement \\"Windows is worse than Linux because it is open source,\\" is referring to the comparison between two operating systems: (A) Windows and (B) Linux. Windows is a proprietary operating system developed by Microsoft, while Linux is an open-source operating system that is based on the Unix operating system. It is important to note that the statement appears to have an error because it should say that \\"Linux is better than Windows because it is open source.\\" The comparison between these two operating systems can be assessed from various aspects, such as security, cost, customizability, performance, compatibility, and user experience. 1. Open source: Because Linux is open-source, it allows users and developers to access, modify, and distribute its source code freely. This leads to an active community of developers who continuously work on improvements, making the system more stable and secure. On the other hand, Windows is a proprietary operating system, with its source code restricted to Microsoft. This limits users' ability to tailor the system to their needs. 2. Security: The open-source nature of Linux allows for regular updates and vulnerability patches, making it generally more secure than Windows. Windows, being a more widespread operating system, is more frequently targeted by hackers and malware. This means that Windows users may have to deal with more security issues than Linux users. 3. Cost: Linux is typically free, and many distributions can be downloaded and installed without any cost. Companies that choose Linux as their operating system save on licensing fees. In contrast, most Windows versions require purchasing a license, which can increase costs for both individuals and businesses. 4. Customizability: Linux offers unlimited customization possibilities due to its open-source nature. Users can choose from multiple distributions, each with its specific features and design. As a result, Linux can be tailored to meet the exact needs of the user, while Windows has a more rigid design with fewer customization options. 5. Performance: Linux is known for its performance and stability. It can be run on lower-end hardware without experiencing slowdowns, making it an excellent choice for servers and older machines. Windows, on the other hand, tends to have higher system requirements and may not perform as well on lower-end hardware. 6. Compatibility: Windows has better compatibility with various software applications and hardware devices. As most commercial software is developed for Windows, users might find it easier to find the required programs. However, Linux supports a wide range of open-source software, and many popular applications have Linux versions available. 7. User experience: For users accustomed to the Windows environment, Linux may have a steeper learning curve due to differences in user interfaces and the need to familiarize themselves with the terminal. However, many Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu or Fedora, have made significant efforts to provide user-friendly interfaces and simplify the transition for Windows users. In conclusion, the statement in question refers to a comparison between Windows (A) and Linux (B). Despite the error in phrasing, it addresses the fact that Linux has numerous advantages due to its open-source nature, including customizability, security, cost-effectiveness, and performance, when compared to Windows. However, factors such as compatibility and the overall user experience might slightly favor Windows for some users. Ultimately, the choice of an operating system depends on a user's requirements and preferences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Conclusion: Based on the analysis, the sentence \\"A trainer works with his dog.\\" could be considered true in relation to the original sentence, even though it omits the specific activity they are engaged in."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:Y},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],j={key:0},R={key:1};function E(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",H,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",P,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
