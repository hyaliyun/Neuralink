Information: - The Jurassic (from Jura Mountains) is a geologic period and system that spans 56.3 million years from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions. - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk). - Andinichthyidae is a prehistoric family of catfishes from the Cretaceous of South America . - Catfish (or catfishes; order Siluriformes or Nematognathi) are a diverse group of ray-finned fish. Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the three largest species, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia and the Piraíba of South America, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\". There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus \\"Corydoras\\", are important in the aquarium hobby. Many catfish are nocturnal, but others (many \\"Auchenipteridae\\") are \\"crepuscular\\" or \\"diurnal\\" (most \\"Loricariidae or\\" \\"Callichthyidae\\" for example). - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Hospital emergency rooms treat injured fingers all the time. Without treatment, a bad cut can lead to permanent damage. But how should a person know when a bleeding cut is serious enough to require medical attention? We asked Dr Martin Brown, chairman of the department of emergency medicine at Inova Alexandria Hospital in Virginia. First, the medical term for a cut or tear in the skin is a laceration(,). Dr Brown says the length is usually not as important as the depth. He says a long cut on a finger can likely be treated without a visit to a doctor if the wound is not very deep. \\"If you have a short but deep laceration where there's been a structure underneath that's been damaged - a tendon, a nerve, a blood vessel,\\" says Martin, \\"it may, in fact, need professional attention.\\" Some injuries - like a fingertip that gets cut off - might even require surgery to repair. That requires a specialist to either file down the bone or _ the fingertip. More often, filing down the bone is what is done because reattaching a fingertip is often not successful. How a wound bleeds can be a sign of how serious it is. Minor cuts usually produce what is known as venous bleeding. This means the blood flows steadily from the injury. The bleeding will often stop when pressure is put on the wound. Dr Brown says in most cases holding direct pressure with clean gauze or a cloth for four to five minutes should stop the bleeding. With a cut finger, holding the hand above the heart can reduce the loss of blood. But if a cut appears to be pumping blood out with some force, this may be a sign of arterial bleeding. This kind of injury should be treated by a medical professional as soon as possible. Even a cut that does not require medical attention must be kept clean to prevent infection. Small cuts should be cleaned gently with clean water. Use a washcloth to clean the area if the wound is dirty. Dr Brown says cuts should be covered with a clean, dry bandage. Options: A a finger cut without treatment can lead to permanent damage B the length of a cut on a finger is more important than the depth C a long but not very deep cut often doesn't need professional attention D a short but deep laceration that has been damaged need professional attention. Answer: C a long but not very deep cut often doesn't need professional attention Question: The answer to this question is:","completion":"According to Dr. Martin Brown, when might a finger cut not require professional medical attention?

Unbeknownst to the town, Pender possesses a hidden talent - he can communicate with the spirits of the deceased. Pender has grown disillusioned with the world and often turns to these spirits for solace, wisdom, and friendship. One fateful day, Pender unwittingly uncovers a dark secret while restoring a 19th-century dresser. Hidden within the dresser, he discovers a letter that reveals a murder in the town's past that remains unsolved. The revelation consumes Pender, who embarks on a journey to uncover the truth behind the crime. Complicating matters further, the spirit of the murder victim begins to communicate with Pender. Desperate for closure, the spirit shares clues but reveals that the murderer will not be found unless Pender overcomes his fear of interacting with the living members of the community. It's a race against time; as the spirit grows weaker, so does the possibility of solving the mystery. As Pender delves deeper into the past murder case, he forms unlikely friendships with three of the town's misfits: Claire, a rebellious, down-to-earth photographer working to restore her family's reputation, Alejandro, a laid-back surf instructor haunted by a traumatic past, and Janet, a witty and sarcastic diner waitress who enjoys studying Seaview's convoluted history in her spare time. Together, the unlikely foursome uncovers a conspiracy involving three prominent families in the town, revealing that the murder was not an isolated event but part of a dark web of interconnected crimes and deceit. With each piece of evidence they uncover, a dangerous game of cat and mouse ensues as the murderers become more desperate to silence Pender and his new friends. In a thrilling climax, the group finds themselves cornered by the conspirators, facing threats of violence and blackmail to keep their silence.

Background: A Night at the Opera is the fourth studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 21 November 1975 by EMI Records in the United Kingdom and by Elektra Records in the United States. Produced by Roy Thomas Baker and Queen, it was the most expensive album ever recorded at the time of its release. The album takes its name from the Marx Brothers film of the same name, which the band watched one night at the studio complex when recording. A Night at the Opera incorporates a wide range of styles, including ballads, songs in a music hall style, hard rock tracks and progressive rock influences. Context: \\"Death on Two Legs\\" can be referred to as Freddie Mercury's hate letter to Queen's first manager, Norman Sheffield, who for some years was reputed to have mistreated the band and abused his role as their manager from 1972 to 1975. Sheffield denied the allegations in his 2013 autobiography entitled \\"Life on Two Legs: Set The Record Straight\\", and referred to copies of the original 1972 management contracts between Sheffield and Queen, which were included in the book as proof of his defence. Though the song never makes direct reference to him, after listening to a playback of the song at Trident Studios during the time of album release, Sheffield was appalled, and sued the band and the record label for defamation, which resulted in an out-of-court settlement, but also confirmed his connection to the song. During live performances, Mercury would usually rededicate the song to \\"a real motherfucker of a gentleman\\", although this line was censored on the version that appeared on their Live Killers album in 1979. Other than on the live album, he said it was dedicated to a \\"motherfucker I used to know\\". In the Classic Albums documentary about the making of A Night at the Opera, Brian May stated that the band was somewhat taken aback at first by the bitterness of Mercury's lyrics, and described by Mercury as being \\"so vindictive that he [May] felt bad singing it\\". After the song came together, it was agreed that the \\"author should have his way\\", and the song was recorded as written. As with \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", most of the guitar parts on this song were initially played on piano by Mercury, to demonstrate to May how they needed to be played on guitar. \\"Death on Two Legs\\" remained on the setlist until, and well into, The Game Tour in 1980, and was then dropped. However, the piano introduction was played during the Hot Space and Works tours. \\"I'm in Love with My Car\\" is amongst Roger Taylor's most famous songs in the Queen catalogue. The song was initially taken as a joke by May, who thought that Taylor was not serious when he heard a demo recording. Taylor played the guitars in the original demo, but they were later re-recorded by May on his Red Special. The lead vocals were performed by Taylor on the studio version, and all released live versions. The revving sounds at the conclusion of the song were recorded by Taylor's then current car, an Alfa Romeo. The lyrics were inspired by one of the band's roadies, Johnathan Harris, whose Triumph TR4 was evidently the \\"love of his life\\". The song is dedicated to him, the album says: \\"Dedicated to Johnathan Harris, boy racer to the end\\". When it came down to releasing the album's first single, Taylor was so fond of his song that he urged Mercury (author of the first single, \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\") to allow it to be the B-side and reportedly locked himself in a cupboard until Mercury agreed. This decision would later become the cause of much internal friction in the band, in that while it was only the B-side, it generated an equal amount of publishing royalties for Taylor as the main single did for Mercury. The song was often played live during the 1977-81 period. Taylor sang it from the drums while Mercury played piano and provided backing vocals. It was played in the Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour in 2005 and the Rock the Cosmos Tour in 2008. Taylor would again play the song for his concerts with The Cross and solo tours, where instead of drums he played rhythm guitar. \\"'39\\" was May's attempt to do \\"sci-fi skiffle\\". \\"'39\\" relates the tale of a group of space explorers who embark on what is, from their perspective, a year-long voyage. Upon their return, however, they realise that a hundred years have passed, because of the time dilation effect in Einstein's special theory of relativity, and the loved ones they left behind are now all dead or aged. May sings the song on the album, with backing vocals by Mercury and Taylor. During live performances, Mercury sang the lead vocal. May had asked bassist John Deacon to play double bass as a joke but a couple of days later he found Deacon in the studio with the instrument, and he had already learned to play it. Since Queen had named their albums A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races after two of the Marx Brothers' most popular films, surviving brother Groucho Marx invited Queen to visit him at his Los Angeles home in March 1977 (five months before he died). The band thanked him, and performed \\"'39\\" a cappella. George Michael performed \\"'39\\" at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert on 20 April 1992. Michael cited this song as his favourite Queen song, claiming he used to busk it on the London Underground. Recently, Queen have included the song on the setlists of their recent tours with Adam Lambert and before Adam with Paul Rodgers; for all these tours since 2005 it is sung as it is on the album by May.

Given the question: Information: - John W. Rosa Jr. ( born September 28 , 1951 ) is a retired United States Air Force Lieutenant General currently serving as President of The Citadel in Charleston , South Carolina . While on active duty , Rosa also served as the sixteenth Superintendent of the United States Air Force Academy . - A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish. The term is used in the United States, Canada, Romania, China and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, county towns have a similar function. - The United States Army (USA) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces and performs land-based military operations. It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001. As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775. - Charleston is the oldest and second-largest city in the U.S. state of South Carolina, the county seat of Charleston County, and the principal city in the CharlestonNorth CharlestonSummerville Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city lies just south of the geographical midpoint of South Carolina's coastline and is located on Charleston Harbor, an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean formed by the confluence of the Ashley and Cooper Rivers. Charleston had an estimated population of 132,609 in 2015. The population of the Charleston metropolitan area, comprising Berkeley, Charleston, and Dorchester Counties, was counted by the 2015 estimate at 727,689the third-largest in the stateand the 78th-largest metropolitan statistical area in the United States. - The National Security Act of 1947 was a major restructuring of the United States government's military and intelligence agencies following World War II. The majority of the provisions of the Act took effect on September 18, 1947, the day after the Senate confirmed James Forrestal as the first Secretary of Defense. - The United States Air Force Academy (also known as USAFA or the Air Force Academy), is a military academy for officer cadets of the United States Air Force. Its campus is located in the western United States in Colorado, immediately north of Colorado Springs in El Paso County. - Colorado is a state in the United States encompassing most of the Southern Rocky Mountains as well as the northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau and the western edge of the Great Plains. Colorado is part of the Western United States, the Southwestern United States, and the Mountain States. Colorado is the 8th most extensive and the 22nd most populous of the 50 United States. The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Colorado was 5,456,574 on July 1, 2015, an increase of 8.50% since the 2010 United States Census. - A military academy or service academy (in \\"American English\\") is an educational institution which prepares candidates for service in the officer corps of the army, the navy, marine corps, air force or coast guard. It normally provides education in a military environment, the exact definition depending on the country concerned. - The United States Air Force (USAF) is the aerial warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven American uniformed services. Initially part of the United States Army, the USAF was formed as a separate branch of the military on 18 September 1947 under the National Security Act of 1947. It is the most recent branch of the U.S. military to be formed, and is the largest and one of the world's most technologically advanced air forces. The USAF articulates its core functions as Nuclear Deterrence Operations, Special Operations, Air Superiority, Global Integrated ISR, Space Superiority, Command and Control, Cyberspace Superiority, Personnel Recovery, Global Precision Attack, Building Partnerships, Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - Aerial warfare is the use of military aircraft and other flying machines in warfare. Aerial warfare includes bombers attacking enemy concentrations or strategic targets; fighter aircraft battling for control of airspace; attack aircraft engaging in close air support against ground targets; naval aviation flying against sea and nearby land targets; gliders, helicopters and other aircraft to carry airborne forces such as paratroopers; aerial refueling tankers to extend operation time or range; and military transport aircraft to move cargo and personnel. Historically, military aircraft have included lighter-than-air balloons carrying artillery observers; lighter-than-air airships for bombing cities; various sorts of reconnaissance, surveillance and early warning aircraft carrying observers, cameras and radar equipment; torpedo bombers to attack enemy shipping; and military air-sea rescue aircraft for saving downed airmen. Modern aerial warfare includes missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles. Surface forces are likely to respond to enemy air activity with anti-aircraft warfare. - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - The Charleston Harbor is an inlet (8 sq mi/20.7 km²) of the Atlantic Ocean at Charleston, South Carolina.

Charleston Harbor is part of the Intracoastal Waterway. - A cadet is a trainee. The term is frequently used to refer to those training to become an officer in the military, often a person who is a junior trainee. Its meaning may vary between countries.

But, not for very long! My apologies as I need to give a little back story first. Please bear with. I first came to the DC/NOVA area via the US Army. It had a very small town feel. I was amazed no traffic, extremely affordable housing market, friendly, helpful and caring people and trees as far as the eyes could see. It was top 3 places I had lived in this country. After the Tech boom peaked near 2000 and after 9/11 the flood gates opened and people spilled in from all over the Earth for the bountiful opportunities. The housing market skyrocketed and people were tripling++ the values of their homes. It is now home to some of the wealthiest counties in the US. Why is this all relevant? All the prosperity brought greed, selfishness and gluttony to a whole new level. People had massive disposable income they had never had before. Nothing is too grossly indulgent anymore and they throw away vast amounts of money trying to one up the last kids party without giving a thought to what a kid needs or the fact they are teaching kids that over indulgence is okay. Now, my son and I were invited to a birthday party for this FIVE year old. The sole Parent had rented the club house, surrounding grounds and pool area of a local country club. I would estimate around 30 kids x 1.5 adults. It was catered with both adult and children's foods and beverages, including Wine and Champagne (few here seem able or willing to parent without it). A company was hired to bring in 6 industrial fair/carnival type rides. A mini Ferris Wheel and a mini Roller Coaster included. She even had hired help that distributed Party Bags/Swag Bags that included cologne/perfume for the kids. I don't think my jaw closed the entire time we were there. This was for a FIVE year old!

Biographers Morecambe and Stirling believe that Cary Grant was the \\"greatest leading man Hollywood had ever known\\". Schickel stated that there are \\"very few stars who achieve the magnitude of Cary Grant, art of a very high and subtle order\\", and thought that he was the \\"best star actor there ever was in the movies\\". David Thomson and directors Stanley Donen and Howard Hawks concurred that Grant was the greatest and most important actor in the history of the cinema. He was a favorite of Hitchcock, who admired him and called him \\"the only actor I ever loved in my whole life\\", and remained one of Hollywood's top box-office attractions for almost 30 years. Wansell wrote: \\"To millions of movie-goers around the world, Cary Grant will forever epitomize the glamour, and the style, of Hollywood in its golden years. With his dark hair, and even darker eyes, mischievous smile and effortless elegance, he was, is, and always will be indelibly one of the great movie stars. Since his death in 1986, the incandescence of his screen image has not dimmed for a single moment\\". Kael stated that the world still thinks of him affectionately, because he \\"embodies what seems a happier time-a time when we had a simpler relationship to a performer.\\" Grant was nominated for two Academy Awards, for Penny Serenade (1941) and None But the Lonely Heart (1944), but never won a competitive Oscar; he received a special Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1970. The inscription on his statuette read \\"To Cary Grant, for his unique mastery of the art of screen acting with respect and affection of his colleagues\\". On being presented with the award, his friend Frank Sinatra announced: \\"It was made for the sheer brilliance of acting ... No one has brought more pleasure to more people for so many years than Cary has, and nobody has done so many things so well\\". At the Straw Hat Awards in New York in May 1975, Grant was awarded a special plaque which recognized the city's appreciation of him as a \\"star and superstar in entertainment\\". The following August, he was invited by Betty Ford to give a speech at the Republican National Convention in Kansas City and to attend the Bicentenary dinner for Queen Elizabeth II at the White House that same year. He was later invited in 1978 to attend a royal charity gala at the London Palladium. In 1979, Grant hosted the American Film Institute's tribute to Alfred Hitchcock, and presented Laurence Olivier with his honorary Oscar. In 1981, Grant was accorded the Kennedy Center Honors. Three years later, a theatre on the MGM lot was renamed the \\"Cary Grant Theatre\\". In 1995, when over a hundred leading film directors were asked to reveal their favorite actor of all time in a Time Out poll, Grant came second only to Marlon Brando. On December 7, 2001, a statue of Grant was unveiled in Millennium Square, a regenerated area next to Bristol Harbour, Bristol, in the city where he was born. In November 2005, Grant again came first in Premiere magazine's list of \\"The 50 Greatest Movie Stars of All Time\\".

A war hero praised for his bravery in Iraq died after being buried under an avalanche while on a skiing training exercise. Senior Aircraftman Paul Mahoney, 26, who had been one of the last British servicemen to leave Iraq, was taking part in a training trip in the German Alps in preparation for deployment in Afghanistan with 15 Squadron of the RAF Regiment. The exercise, named 'Snow Eagle' was designed to expose servicemen to hostile terrains and during one descent, SAC Mahoney and two of his comrades were engulfed by a snow slide. While the other two were rescued, SAC Mahoney was buried and, by the time he was dragged clear nine minutes later, was dead. Senior Aircraftman Paul Mahoney was praised for his service as a gunner in Basra during his six month tour in Iraq. After the incident, on February 4, 2010, a major investigation was launched and the leader of the expedition, Flight Sgt Stephen Henderson, was charged with manslaugher - although later cleared at a court martial. It was alleged Flt Sgt Henderson failed to comply with safety regulations and ignored avalanche warnings when he led the 23 serviceman down a slope. However, an inquest into SAC Mahoney's death, held at Warrington Coroners' Court yesterday, recorded a verdict of accidental death. On the morning of the tragedy, the inquest heard Flt Sgt Henderson, who was leading the trip along with four other qualified instructors, was warned about poor weather conditions and that a level three avalanche warning - out of a possible five levels - had been issued for the area. However, he evaluated the slopes and decided the expedition should go ahead. The group left the Grasgehren ski resort in Bavaria, Germany, with the plan of climbing the Reidberger Horn mountain and then skiing down to a hut where they would spend the night. SAC Mahoney had been in the RAF for two years at the time of his death. It was on the descent that the group heard a 'woomph' sound, indicating that a weak layer of snow had collapsed beneath the surface. However, while Flt Sgt Henderson sent some students back to the ridge, he concluded the snowpack was stable and the group could continue. Two instructors stayed at the top and the students descended at 20 metre intervals with everyone intending to meet at the bottom. The avalanche struck while the group was halfway down the slope. The inquest heard that the slide was caused by sun and wind conditions, although the earlier court martial was told that it could have been triggered by the serviceman skiing over the unstable service in too large groups. Many. of the 23 servicemen were either at the bottom or within their final. stages of descent when the 400 metres wide and 200 metres long. avalanche hit. Along with SAC Mahoney, SAC Shepherd and Cpl Murray were also caught up in the collapse. SAC. Shepherd was only buried up to his waist and managed for free himself and while Cpl Murray was completely covered apart from his hand, he was quickly pulled free. SAC Mahoney was 'completely buried' and it took nine minutes later to find him, by which point he was not breathing. His comrades tried to revive him and rescue helicopters were sent to the scene but SAC Mahoney was declared dead on the mountainside. Paul Mahoney's, centre, family said they knew 'how proud he was about being in the RAF regiment' SAC Mahoney was only 26 when he died in 2010, shortly before he was due to be deployed in Afghanistan. During Flt Sgt Henderson’s court martial his legal team said that 'backcountry skiing' involved an element of risk-taking and that the he had viewed the slope as shallow and not avalanche prone. Chris. Hill, defence counsel, said: 'This is adventurous training and not a. leisure facility. The purpose was to make a journey and hopefully get to. the next hut,' he said, adding that 'rules are not to be adhered to. slavishly.' At. the end of the four-week court martial in July 2012, the six-member. board acquitted Flt Sgt Henderson. Two other servicemen were caught in the avalanche, but were pulled out in time. It was nine minutes before SAC Mahoney was dragged clear of the snow, by which point he had died. SAC Mahoney had driven armoured vehicles in Basra and was one of the last British servicemen to leave Iraq. At the time of his death, SAC Mahoney - who had joined the armed forces in 2008 - was praised as a 'brave and determined' gunner who had been one of the last British servicemen to leave Iraq. He had been driving Bulldog armoured vehicles on patrols in Basra. The RAF Regiment is the ground fighting force of the RAF, providing security for bases and carrying out patrol functions. In a statement released by his family at the time of his death they said: 'We wish to convey how proud we were of him and we knew how proud he was about being in the RAF Regiment. He was \\"one of the lads\\" who was always there for his mates.' Paying tribute to SAC Mahoney the RAF said: 'He kept us safe as he steered his armoured vehicle through the outskirts of Basrah. 'He lived life to the full and has been taken from us unexpectedly and far too early. 'Our thoughts are with his family and close friends at this difficult time. 'He will not be forgotten and his memory will live on in the hearts and minds of 15 Squadron RAF Regiment.' A full. service inquiry was also carried out in the aftermath of SAC Mahoney’s. death by the Ministry of Defence which has since made eight. recommendations in relation to the Snow Eagle exercise and seven. recommendations in relation to the wider conduct of service training. The inquest was told that 11 of the recommendations had been fully implemented and a further four were underway. A Ministry of Defence spokesman told MailOnline: 'Our thoughts remain with SAC Mahoney’s family and friends at this difficult time. 'A full Service Inquiry has been conducted, and all the recommendations from this have been or are in the process of being implemented, so that we can prevent something like this from ever happening again.'

Article: After months of promo and buzz, we finally get to see the fruits of Caitlyn Jenner’s work as executive producer on I Am Cait, the docu-series telling her story. Here’s more Caitlyn: teal hair extensions, (sometimes) makeup-free and emotionally raw. It opens with a very candid Caitlyn. It’s 4:30 a.m., she’s not wearing makeup and she’s feeling a little stressed. “What a responsibility I have to this community,” she sighs with a bit of fear in her voice. “I just hope I get it right” She’s very clear about her role: an educator and an advocate. She turns the mirror a bit away from her and showcases the issues: More murders, exponentially higher rates of suicide, throes of misunderstanding … and no contract with E! to publicly share their stories. Not everyone has that type of platform or the money for new clothes or cosmetic surgeries and she gets that. She just wants help in whatever way she can – for now, that means becoming comfortable with herself. A nervous Caitlyn still needs to meet some of her family: “A very good looking woman” We’ve seen and heard a lot from Caitlyn’s mother, Esther, over the past few months. She was part of that Diane Sawyer interview and she moved everyone to tears at the ESPYs. But here we see her off guard. It was the first time she’s seen her child since Bruce became Caitlyn and the tension was a bit thick. She was coming over, with daughters Lisa and Pam by her side, for her birthday. Hands twitching nervously, Caitlyn greets everyone with a big hello. “I thought you were going to look more like me,” Pam says. Oh Pam, you slay us. Long, flowing locks of teal Daughter Kylie, hoping to surprise Caitlyn, shows up at her house unannounced with a special surprise: teal hair extensions. This is the first time they’re meeting in person and Caitlyn, clad in a fluffy white robe, is shocked to see her. Immediately, she goes in for the sweetest hug. They both go over to see Esther, who’s getting her makeup done. Three generations of women together. Such a small moment, sure, but a very beautiful one. (And, yes, the teal works.) A photo posted by King Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Jun 30, 2015 at 2:54pm PDT A mother’s confessions In a sit down between just Esther and Caitlyn, things are little more somber. “It’s not easy,” Esther repeats a few times. She’s having a bit more of a difficult time switching from “he” to “she” when she refers to her child. Admittedly, that seems like a tough mental hurdle. The biggest thing Esther has noticed, however, is how much freer Caitlyn is than Bruce. Their relationship was lacking before because “he wasn’t comfortable” as he was. That’s changed — while Caitlyn’s “soul and values” have not. \\"I loved him with all my heart and I certainly love her with all my heart.” – Esther Jenner #IAmCait https://t.co/BJ5uW4NWtH — I Am Cait (@IAmCait) July 27, 2015 Yeezy’s in the house Spotted: The series’ first Kardashian. Kim and husband Kanye stop by to see Caitlyn and almost immediately Kanye showers on the applause. “This is one of the strongest things that have happened in our existence as human beings.” It’s the first time we hear the rapper comment on his step-father-in-law’s transition after hearing just how much he helped Kim understand it. Now, it’s off to the closet (sans Kanye) where Kim goes all fashion diva and pokes through the wardrobe. What does she find? Nothing, just a dress that both Caitlyn and her mom Kris Jenner own. Remembering Kyler Prescott To close the episode, Caitlyn remembers Kyler Prescott, a trans teen who killed himself at just 14. She pays a visit, with an offer of friendship, to Prescott’s family and the two speak about Kyler’s journey. His mom reveals just how devastating her son’s loss is — his new birth certificate with the corrected gender came just days after his death.

I know the songs, I love the characters and I love the story. I can't say anything like that about The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea. It was terrible. Let's start with the story. The plot was a reversed copy of the first movie. Same situations, except in reverse! Ariel wanted to live on land, her daughter Melody (creative name) wants to live in the sea. Ariel was tricked by Ursula, Melody is tricked by Ursula's sister, Morgana. Ursula had a sister?? Not sure where that came from. Besides being a strange copy of the first movie, this movies plot seemed tired and was uninteresting compared to the first movie. Now the characters: 1. Ariel- What happened to her??!! No longer the spunky, headstrong teenager we all knew and loved from the first movie, she has now \\"grown up\\" and her personality went down the drain. Her singing voice wasn't as strong either, due to either Jodi Benson being a lot older, or the songs being so terrible that her talent was wasted. 2. Prince Eric- While he didn't have a lot of personality in the first movie, like all Disney princes, somehow his new voice and his very few lines made him even more robotic. To top it off, he just can't seem to defend himself, and Ariel becomes the tough one of the two. 3. Sebastian- Say goodbye to the lovable crustacean from the first movie, because a whiny, aggravating little crab just took his place. He also had no good songs in this movie. You can almost forget the glory he earned from singing the incredible \\"Under the Sea\\" and \\"Kiss the Girl\\" from the first movie, and it is very sad. 4. Flounder- They destroyed him!! He is not cute anymore, his voice is terrible, and he has kids now?? Who's the mother??? 5. Morgana- She appears to be Ursula's sister out for revenge against her mother, who always picked Ursula over her. So she plans to get King Triton's trident to become the new ruler of the sea. Sound familiar? Anyway, she's a very cliché villain and falls short of Ursula's greatness as a villain. She epically fails at witchcraft, she's not very tough, and not threatening at all. 6.Melody- Ariel and Eric's daughter. Ironic name because she, unlike Ariel, can't sing. Her voice is annoying, her friends (a walrus and a penguin?? Really?!) are not funny or likable, and she's exactly the same as Ariel, in reverse and not as likable. Skip this one.

Washington (CNN) -- They are the nation's first African-American President and attorney general, so Barack Obama and Eric Holder always were going to face extra scrutiny over their approach to racially charged issues. Conservative critics howled when Obama said in 2009 that police acted \\"stupidly\\" in arresting black Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates outside his home. Holder prompted a similar outcry earlier that year when he called America a \\"nation of cowards\\" about racial issues. Now past the two-thirds mark of the Obama presidency, the pair have avoided such loaded language in response to the August 9 shooting death of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown by a white police officer in suburban St. Louis. \\"But in terms of what he is actually saying to the","completion":"American public, Obama and Holder have not shied away from addressing the racial tensions and issues surrounding Brown's death and its aftermath. They have called for a thorough and transparent investigation, stressing the importance of not jumping to conclusions and allowing the legal process to take its course. As protests and unrest continued in the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, the President and Holder focused on encouraging open dialogue between law enforcement and the community to foster understanding and help rebuild trust. Holder even personally visited Ferguson, meeting with local leaders, law enforcement, and residents to listen to their concerns and reassure them of the federal government's commitment to ensuring justice. In the months that followed, the grand jury's decision not to indict the white police officer Darren Wilson sparked further protests and reignited the national debate on race and policing. The Department of Justice conducted its own investigation into the Ferguson Police Department, uncovering patterns of racial bias and discriminatory practices. With the support of the Obama administration, Holder announced a series of reforms aimed at addressing these issues, including increased federal oversight of local law enforcement, improved police training, and a renewed focus on community policing. These measures were intended to promote accountability, bridge the gap between the police and the communities they serve, and ultimately create a more just and equitable society. The legacy of Obama and Holder's approach to racial issues would continue to be debated long after they left office. Some critics argued that they had inflamed racial tensions and failed to adequately support law enforcement, while others praised them for initiating much-needed conversations and reforms. Regardless of the different opinions, it was undeniable that their time in office had brought the long-standing issue of racial disparities in the American justice system to the forefront of public consciousness, setting the stage for further discussions and potential future changes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Rick Santorum has raised just over 1 million since his eight-vote loss in Iowa last night, his top strategist tells POLITICO. John Brabender, who revealed that their server briefly went down under the crush last night, said almost all of the cash came online. This is the kind of fund-raising, coming less than 24 hours since the caucuses began, that Santorum will need to ramp up his TV presence and organization. Read more about: Rick Santorum, 2012 Eelctions ||||| Rick Santorum's powerful finish in the Iowa caucus is bringing fresh attention to his tenure in Congress, including ethics questions that dogged him about a preferred mortgage he received from a bank run by campaign donors, and federal funds that went to a real estate developer who backed his charity. One of the top donors to Santorum's charity was also the beneficiary of an 8 million Santorum-sponsored federal earmark, according to published reports. Melanie Sloan, a former federal prosecutor who filed an ethics complaint against Santorum in 2006 on behalf of a watchdog group, said her organization's website received a tidal wave of visitors in the past 24 hours, and in an interview she said she believes people will discover that the GOP presidential contender is \\"hardly the moral paragon he purports to be.\\" \\"There were several instances in which Santorum appeared to have taken campaign contributions in direct exchange for legislative assistance,\\" said Sloan, whose organization, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), spent months investigating Santorum's activities while he was in office. \\"He violated Senate gift rules by accepting a mortgage from a bank in which he had no interest and which otherwise made loans only to its own investors.\\" Santorum has rarely responded to such attacks, but at one point he wrote a letter to a Philadelphia newspaper criticizing the ethics complaints as a series of \\"disingenuous innuendo and half-truths.\\" The Senate Committee on Ethics never responded to CREW's complaint, and the two-term senator left Congress in 2007 after losing a reelection bid. A Santorum campaign spokesman has not yet responded to phone messages and email requests for comment. For months, Santorum's record and background have escaped presidential-caliber scrutiny from rivals and reporters because he never appeared to have traction with voters in the early Republican contests. But as Santorum's GOP rivals have learned, the national spotlight can be searing. Questions about Newt Gingrich's consulting work for Fannie Mae surfaced in attack ads against him. Herman Cain bowed out of the race after reports of sexual harassment complaints dogged him for weeks. If the pattern holds true as the winnowed GOP field heads from Iowa down the rural roads of New Hampshire, Santorum will be the latest to undergo intensified scrutiny from rival campaigns and from the national media. Perhaps the most jarring detail from his tenure in office is the unorthodox 500,000 mortgage that Santorum and his wife secured on the home in rural Virginia they had purchased for 643,361. According to a series of reports in the Philadelphia Daily News, the mortgage came from Philadelphia Trust Company, a fledgling private bank catering to \\"affluent investors and institutions\\" whose officers had contributed 24,000 to Santorum's political action committees and re-election campaign. In advertising, the lender said it only offered its preferred rates to well-heeled borrowers who also used their investment services. But Santorum's public disclosure forms showed he did not have the required minimum 250,000 in liquid assets and was not an investor with Philadelphia Trust. His ability to secure the five-year loan led Sloan to file a complaint under a Senate ethics rule that specifically prohibits members from accepting a loan on terms not available to members of the general public. At the time, a Santorum spokeswoman told the Daily News that the mortgage terms were set at \\"market rates,\\" but did not provide further comment. After leaving Congress in 2007, Santorum sold the house for 850,000. Santorum Charity Backer Got Federal Earmark The other issue that captivated Santorum critics involved a non-profit charity called Operation Good Neighbor. Santorum founded the organization to \\"illustrate compassionate conservatism\\" but did not take a formal role in its day-to-day operations. The charity was run by his campaign staffers. It operated out of the same building as his campaign headquarters. And its board included several top Washington, D.C. lobbyists who had clients with millions of dollars in business before the U.S. Senate, according to a 2006 report by WTAE, the ABC News affiliate in Pittsburgh. The chairman of Operation Good Neighbor was Michael O'Neill, CEO of Preferred Real Estate. The company was involved in a waterfront development in Chester, Pa., that, with Santorum's help, benefitted from more than 8 million in federal grants, according to local reports. O'Neill told ABC News that accusations suggesting the charity work and his development were connected were \\"crazy.\\" \\"My answer is absolutely not,\\" said O'Neill, who is now out of the real estate business. \\"I was never told, 'If you do this, we'll help with that.' They were completely unrelated.\\" O'Neill said Santorum was a figurehead with the charity and that the senator derived no benefit from the work the charity performed -- doling out contributions to small groups around the state. \\"He was proud of the work of the charity,\\" O'Neill said. \\"Rick helped bring exposure, but other than that, he didn't get anything out of it.\\" O'Neill also said the former senator should be proud of the waterfront development, which he says has helped deliver 2,000 jobs to downtown Chester, where there is now a soccer stadium, an office building, and a casino. Santorum also defended the federal grants in a letter to the Philadelphia Daily News, saying his efforts to win federal money for O'Neill's waterfront development represented \\"a prime example of how, when used appropriately, earmarks can be beneficial.\\" \\"When Preferred Real Estate became interested in investing in the region, specifically in the revitalization of a blighted former generating plant, I was ecstatic -- this was exactly the type of project that could kick off a full-scale economic rebirth and help combat poverty,\\" he wrote. \\"So, working with the city, I helped bring federal money to improve access to the riverfront, renovating roads like Route 291 and Highland Avenue, as well as to better the environment of the riverfront, making it a more attractive place for Pennsylvanians to work and live.\\" Click Here to Sign Up for Breaking News and Investigation Alerts From The Brian Ross Investigative Unit O'Neill has not committed to supporting Santorum's presidential bid, saying he is waiting to see if Santorum can focus on more mainstream economic issues, rather than social issues. \\"If he doesn't win it won't be because of his ethics,\\" O'Neill told ABC News. \\"What's going to kill him is, this country wants someone down the middle.\\" Click Here for the Blotter Homepage. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Rick Santorum, following his narrow loss in the Iowa caucus, has raised just over 1 million, mostly through online donations, according to his top strategist John Brabender.

A tractor trailer smashes into Ben's Porsche. Answer:","completion":"Title: Fate's Intersection Genre: Drama, Thriller Plot: Act 1: Introducing the Characters Ben, a successful and arrogant stockbroker in his mid-30s, is living the high life – working at Wall Street, living in a luxurious penthouse, and driving his prized possession, a stunning electric-blue Porsche 911. Throughout his life, Ben only cared about wealth and success, often neglecting his friends and family. Meanwhile, Tom, a hardworking and reliable mid-40s truck driver, struggles to make ends meet as he provides for his sick wife, Jane, and their teenage daughter. Tom is loved by his community and is often seen as everyone's go-to person when they need help. Act 2: The Main Conflict On a fateful foggy morning, as Ben speeds down a winding country road in his Porsche on the way to close an important deal, Tom, the tractor-trailer driver, is en route to deliver essential goods to a nearby town. Unbeknownst to Ben, the country road they are both on has one of the most dangerous intersections in the county. As the morning fog thickens and obscures visibility, their paths inevitably cross. Suddenly, Tom's tractor-trailer smashes into Ben's Porsche, crushing the luxury car. Hearing the violent collision, nearby locals rush to the scene. Miraculously, both drivers survive, but Ben is left with serious, life-changing injuries. Act 3: Redemption and New Beginnings During their lengthy recovery, Ben and Tom realize that they are staying in adjacent hospital rooms. While Tom comes to terms with his involvement in the accident and heals, Ben grapples with anger and denial. Over time, the two form an unlikely bond with each other. As they share their stories and discuss their respective journeys, Ben discovers that his life of luxury was unfulfilling, and he learns the true meaning of friendship, family, and empathy from Tom. On the other hand, Tom gains the strength to move past his guilt over the accident and finds solace with Ben's support. Act 4: A Second Chance Once they are fully recovered, Ben decides to turn his life around, leaving his cutthroat job and dedicating his time to helping Tom and his family. With Ben's financial acumen, the two start a successful transportation business that benefits the whole community. As the business grows, Ben becomes a valued member of the community and finally achieves fulfillment. In the end, both characters find redemption and meaning. At the same spot where the accident occurred, now marked as \\"Fate's Intersection,\\" the two men erect a memorial to remind others of the fragility of life and the importance of second chances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: When 74-year-old Penny Sweat was evicted from the HUD-subsidized Glendale Senior Housing in Salt Lake City last month, she moved to a nonsubsidized apartment at five times her previous rent because she was unaware of her rights. It turns out the manager of the seniors complex, its attorneys and government overseers were unaware, too. Lee Kemp, a hearing-impaired World War II disabled vet, also was evicted, but he contacted Utah Legal Services and was told to stay put. Attorney Marty Blaustein then notified Utah Nonprofit Housing Corp., the building's owner, that Kemp's eviction was not legal and that he had a right to a hearing. That didn't stop Utah Nonprofit Housing's attorneys from then sending Kemp a summons to show cause why he had not moved out. Meanwhile, Sweat's granddaughter called Salt Lake City housing officials, federal housing officials, state officials and several agents of Utah Nonprofit Housing to find out about her grandmother's rights. Nobody knew. Blaustein then took Sweat's case along with Kemp's and demanded her ousting be rectified. Utah Nonprofit Housing President Marion Willey returned from an out-of-town trip and learned HUD procedures were not followed. The eviction was activated because of ongoing personality conflicts among seniors in the complex, he said, and the new building manager decided the problems were with Sweat and Kemp. Several tenants blame other neighbors as perpetrators of the rift, however. Willey said when his building manager called attorneys retained by the company, they erroneously told her she could go ahead and kick out the tenants. When she called HUD to make sure, the inquiry got bogged down in bureaucracy and nobody called her back. Willey says he has offered Sweat and Kemp apartments in another complex operated by his company at their old rates. He also is retaining new attorneys. Question: \\"Who called HUD to make sure she was allowed to kick out the tenants?\\" Answer: \\"Marty\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"No, sweetie, that answer is not correct.

Although the movie seemed promising, with the alluring backdrop of two young lovers reuniting after several years apart, it ultimately fizzles out, offering only a superficial portrayal of love, sorrow, and eventual reconciliation. This leaves a bitter taste and an overwhelming feeling of disappointment as the credits roll. From the outset, the lack of exceptional dialogue and the insufferable pace at which the storyline unfurls is quite noticeable. The choppy script fails to portray the depth and complexity that the subject matter demands. Expectedly, Anderson fails to capitalize on the talented cast featuring Rebecca Lawrence and John Danielson. Both these fine actors seem to struggle with content that is devoid of emotional intelligence, beguiling viewers as they meander through scenes filled with forced banter and awkward silences. Strong and well-defined characters are an essential element in any successful romantic drama, but alas, Sunset Dreams lacks this crucial component. The underdeveloped protagonists, Mary and Alex, present with the emotional range of cardboard cut-outs rather than fleshed-out personalities, making it practically impossible for the audience to connect deeply with their love story or feel any empathy for their struggles. Visually, the film leaves a lot to be desired. Anderson's inability to bring the stunning locale to life accentuates the flaws in the movie's production. The dull color palette and unimaginative cinematography do little to evoke any sense of magic or wonder, and indeed it feels as if the picturesque scenery was criminally underutilized. Furthermore, the film's original score, composed by Hans Fordman, appears to lose its way more often than not, never quite complementing the plot or enhancing the plights of the main characters. Often distracting and at times overpowering, the music acts as a stumbling block to the flow of the film, rather than an integral aspect that drives the story forward. In conclusion, Sunset Dreams leaves the viewer with an overwhelming feeling of unfulfilled desires and unrealized potential. With its poorly crafted dialogue, one-dimensional characters, uninspiring visuals, and lackluster score, one cannot shy away from the urge to dismiss this film as a textbook example of how not to approach the genre of romantic drama. While die-hard fans of the lead actors may look to salvage some enjoyment, others will find their time better spent elsewhere, leaving Sunset Dreams to fade quietly away like a dream that was never meant to come true."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information: - Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes that can be distinguished from legless lizards by their lack of eyelids and external ears. Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. - Lepidosauromorpha is a group of reptiles comprising all diapsids closer to lizards than to archosaurs (which include crocodiles and birds). The only living sub-group is the Lepidosauria: extant lizards, snakes, amphisbaenians and tuataras. - In Greek mythology, Daedalus (\\"Daidalos\\", perhaps related to \\"to work artfully\\" Etruscan: \\"Taitale\\") was a skillful craftsman and artist. He is the father of Icarus, the uncle of Perdix and possibly also the father of Iapyx, although this is unclear. - Philadelphia is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the fifth-most populous city in the United States, with an estimated population of 1,567,442 and more than 6 million in the seventh-largest metropolitan statistical area, . Philadelphia is the economic and cultural anchor of the Delaware Valleya region located in the Northeastern United States at the confluence of the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers with 7.2 million people residing in the eighth-largest combined statistical area in the United States. - Delaware is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic and/or Northeastern regions of the United States. It is bordered to the south and west by Maryland, to the northeast by New Jersey, and to the north by Pennsylvania. The state takes its name from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and Virginia's first colonial governor. - Diapsids (\\"two arches\\") are a group of amniote tetrapods that developed two holes (temporal fenestra) in each side of their skulls about 300 million years ago during the late Carboniferous period. The diapsids are extremely diverse, and include all crocodiles, lizards, snakes, tuatara, turtles, and dinosaurs (both avian and non-avian). Although some diapsids have lost either one hole (lizards), or both holes (snakes and turtles), or have a heavily restructured skull (modern birds), they are still classified as diapsids based on their ancestry. At least 7,925 species of diapsid reptiles exist in environments around the world today (nearly 18,000 when birds are included). - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - A turbine (from the Latin \\"turbo\\", a vortex, related to the Greek , \\"tyrb\\", meaning \\"turbulence\\") is a rotary mechanical device that extracts energy from a fluid flow and converts it into useful work. The work produced by a turbine can be used for generating electrical power when combined with a generator or producing thrust, as in the case of jet engines. A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels. - Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania German: \\"Pennsylvaani\\"), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. The Appalachian Mountains run through its middle. The commonwealth borders Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east. - Icarosaurus ( meaning \`\` Icarus lizard '' ) is an extinct genus of kuehneosaurid reptile from the Late Triassic ( Carnian age ) Lower Lockatong Formation of New Jersey , dated to around 228 million years ago . It is closely related to lizards and the tuatara . Based on a partial skeleton missing part of the tail , some ribs , a hand , and parts of the legs , it was a small animal , about 10 centimeters ( 4 in ) long from the skull to the hips . Like its relative Kuehneosaurus , it was able to glide short distances using ' wings ' consisting of highly elongated ribs covered with skin , with the upper surface convex and the lower surface concave , thus creating a simple airfoil structure well - suited to gliding . This method of gliding is also seen in Coelurosauravus and the modern Draco , neither of which are closely related to Icarosaurus . - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present. - It is part of the Newark-Union, NJ-PA Metropolitan Division of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-PA Metropolitan Statistical Area. - Per capita income or average income measures the average income earned per person in a given area (city, region, country, etc.) in a specified year. It is calculated by dividing the area's total income by its total population. - New Jersey is a state in the Northeastern United States and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. It is bordered on the north and east by New York, on the southeast and south by the Atlantic Ocean, on the west by Pennsylvania, and on the southwest by Delaware. New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state but the 11th-most populous and the most densely populated of the 50 United States. New Jersey lies entirely within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia and is the third-wealthiest U.S. state by per capita income as of 2014. - Toxicofera (Greek for \\"those who bear toxins\\"), is a proposed clade of scaled reptiles (squamates) that includes the Serpentes (snakes), Anguimorpha (monitor lizards, gila monster, and alligator lizards) and Iguania (iguanas, agamas, and chameleons). Toxicofera contains about 4600 species, (nearly 60%) of extant squamata. It encompasses all venomous reptile species, as well as numerous related non-venomous species. There is little morphological evidence to support this grouping, however it has been recovered by all recent molecular analyses. - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\". - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes. - Skin is the soft outer covering of vertebrates. Other animal coverings, such as the arthropod exoskeleton have different developmental origin, structure and chemical composition. The adjective cutaneous means \\"of the skin\\" (from Latin \\"cutis\\", skin). In mammals, the skin is an organ of the integumentary system made up of multiple layers of ectodermal tissue, and guards the underlying muscles, bones, ligaments and internal organs. Skin of a different nature exists in amphibians, reptiles, and birds. All mammals have some hair on their skin, even marine mammals like whales, dolphins, and porpoises which appear to be hairless. The skin interfaces with the environment and is the first line of defense from external factors. For example, the skin plays a key role in protecting the body against pathogens and excessive water loss. Its other functions are insulation, temperature regulation, sensation, and the production of vitamin D folates. Severely damaged skin may heal by forming scar tissue. This is sometimes discoloured and depigmented. The thickness of skin also varies from location to location on an organism. In humans for example, the skin located under the eyes and around the eyelids is the thinnest skin in the body at 0.5 mm thick, and is one of the first areas to show signs of aging such as \\"crows feet\\" and wrinkles. The skin on the palms and the soles of the feet is 4 mm thick and the back is 14 mm thick and is the thickest skin in the body. The speed and quality of wound healing in skin is promoted by the reception of estrogen. - Kuehneosaurus is an extinct genus of Late Triassic kuehneosaurid reptile known from the Late Triassic (Norian stage) of southwest England. It was named by P. L. Robinson in 1962 and the type and only species is Kuehneosaurus latus. Measuring 72 centimetres long (2.3 feet), it had \\"wings\\" formed from ribs which jutted out from its body by as much as 14.3 cm, connected by a membrane which allowed it to slow its descent when jumping from trees. It is a member of a family of gliding reptiles, the Kuehneosauridae, within the larger group Lepidosauromorpha, which also contains modern lizards and tuatara. - The Triassic Lockatong Formation is a mapped bedrock unit in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York. It is named after the Lockatong Creek in Hunterdon County, New Jersey. - Amphisbaenia (called amphisbaenians or worm lizards) is a group of usually legless squamates, comprising over 180 extant species. Amphisbaenians are characterized by their long bodies, the reduction or loss of the limbs, and rudimentary eyes. As many species have a pink body and scales arranged in rings, they have a superficial resemblance to earthworms. While the genus \\"Bipes\\" retains forelimbs, all other genera are limbless. Although superficially similar to the snakes and Dibamidae, recent phylogenetic studies suggest that they are most closely related to the Lacertidae. Amphisbaenians are widely distributed, occurring in North America, Europe, Africa, South America, and the Caribbean. Most species are less than long. Little is known of them outside of their anatomy, and even that is difficult to study due to the mechanics of dissecting such small animals. - A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\\"Sus scrofa\\"), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals. - The Crocodilia (or Crocodylia) are an order of mostly large, predatory, semiaquatic reptiles. They appeared 83.5 million years ago in the Late Cretaceous period (Campanian stage) and are the closest living relatives of birds, as the two groups are the only known survivors of the Archosauria. Members of the order's total group, the clade Pseudosuchia, appeared about 250 million years ago in the Early Triassic period, and diversified during the Mesozoic era. The order Crocodilia includes the true crocodiles (family Crocodylidae), the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), and the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae). Although the term 'crocodiles' is sometimes used to refer to all of these, a less ambiguous vernacular term for this group is crocodilians. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - An airfoil (in American English) or aerofoil (in British English) is the shape of a wing, blade (of a propeller, rotor, or turbine), or sail (as seen in cross-section). - Herpetology (from Greek \\"\\"herpein\\"\\" meaning \\"to creep\\") is the branch of zoology concerned with the study of amphibians (including frogs, toads, salamanders, newts, and caecilians (gymnophiona)) and reptiles (including snakes, lizards, amphisbaenids, turtles, terrapins, tortoises, crocodilians, and the tuataras). Batrachology is a further subdiscipline of herpetology concerned with the study of amphibians alone. - A combined statistical area (CSA) is composed of adjacent metropolitan (MSA) and micropolitan statistical areas (µSA) in the United States and Puerto Rico that can demonstrate economic or social linkage. The United States Office of Management and Budget defines a CSA as consisting of various combinations of adjacent metropolitan and micropolitan areas with economic ties measured by commuting patterns. These areas that combine retain their own designations as metropolitan or micropolitan statistical areas within the larger combined statistical area. - The Northeastern United States, also referred to as the American Northeast or simply the Northeast, is a geographical region of the United States of America bordered to the north by Canada, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the south by the Southern United States, and to the west by the Midwestern United States. The Northeast is one of the four regions defined by the Census Bureau for the collection and analysis of statistics. The Census Bureau-defined region has a total area of with of that being land mass. Though lacking a unified cultural identity, the Northeastern region is the nation's most economically developed, densely populated, and culturally diverse region. Of the nation's four census regions, the Northeast is the second most urban, with 85 percent of its population residing in urban areas, led by the West with 90 percent. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - Rhynchocephalia is an order of lizard-like reptiles that includes only two living species of tuatara (\\"Sphenodon punctatus\\" and \\"Sphenodon guntheri\\"), which only inhabit parts of New Zealand. Despite its current lack of diversity, the Rhynchocephalia at one time included a wide array of genera in several families and represents a lineage stretching back to the Mesozoic Era. Many of the niches occupied by lizards today were then held by sphenodontians. There were even several successful groups of aquatic sphenodontians such as pleurosaurs and the bizarre \\"Ankylosphenodon\\". - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - The Lepidosauria (from Greek meaning \\"scaled lizards\\") are reptiles with overlapping scales. This subclass includes Squamata and Rhynchocephalia. It is a monophyletic group and therefore contains all descendents of a common ancestor. Squamata includes snakes, lizards, and amphisbaenia. Rhynchocephalia was a widespread and diverse group 220-100 million years ago; however, it is now represented only by the genus \\"Sphenodon\\", which contains two species of tuatara, native to New Zealand. Lepidosauria is the sister taxon to Archosauria, which includes Aves and Crocodilia. Lizards and snakes are the most speciose group of Lepidosaurs and, combined, contain over 9,000 species. There are many noticeable distinguishing morphological differences between lizards, tuataras, and snakes. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - British English is the English language as spoken and written in the United Kingdom or, more broadly, throughout the British Isles. Slight regional variations exist in formal, written English in the United Kingdom. For example, the adjective \\"wee\\" is almost exclusively used in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and occasionally Yorkshire, whereas \\"little\\" is predominant elsewhere. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in \\"written\\" English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described by the term \\"British English\\". The forms of \\"spoken\\" English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken, so a uniform concept of British English is more difficult to apply to the spoken language. According to Tom McArthur in the \\"Oxford Guide to World English\\", British English shares \\"all the ambiguities and tensions in the word \\"British\\" and as a result can be used and interpreted in two ways, more broadly or more narrowly, within a range of blurring and ambiguity.\\" - Hair is a protein filament that grows from follicles found in the dermis, or skin. Hair is one of the defining characteristics of mammals. The human body, apart from areas of glabrous skin, is covered in follicles which produce thick terminal and fine vellus hair. Most common interest in hair is focused on hair growth, hair types and hair care, but hair is also an important biomaterial primarily composed of protein, notably keratin. - The Carnian (less commonly, Karnian) is the lowermost stage of the Upper Triassic series (or earliest age of the Late Triassic epoch). It lasted from 237 to 228.4 million years ago (Ma). The Carnian is preceded by the Ladinian and is followed by the Norian. Its boundaries are not characterized by major extinctions or biotic turnovers, but a climatic event (known as the Carnian Pluvial Event) occurred during the Carnian and seems to be associated with important extinctions or biotic radiations. - Coelurosauravus (meaning \\"hollow lizard grandfather\\") is a genus of basal diapsid reptile, with specialized wing-like structures allowing it to glide. These were rod like structures with skin stretched over them. These bony rods are not extensions of the ribs but are newly evolved dermal bones, a feature which is unique to the genus. - In Greek mythology, Icarus (the Latin spelling, conventionally adopted in English \\"Íkaros\\", Etruscan: \\"Vikare\\") is the son of the master craftsman Daedalus, the creator of the Labyrinth. Often depicted in art, Icarus and his father attempt to escape from Crete by means of wings that his father constructed from feathers and wax. Icarus' father warns him first of complacency and then of hubris, asking that he fly neither too low nor too high, so the sea's dampness would not clog his wings or the sun's heat melt them. Icarus ignored his father's instructions not to fly too close to the sun, when the wax in his wings melted and he fell into the sea. This tragic theme of failure at the hands of hubris contains similarities to that of Phaëthon. - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish. - Arthropods (class Athropoda) are covered with a tough, resilient integument or exoskeleton of chitin. Generally the exoskeleton will have thickened areas in which the chitin is reinforced or stiffened by materials such as minerals or hardened proteins. This happens in parts of the body where there is a need for rigidity or elasticity. Typically the mineral crystals, mainly calcium carbonate, are deposited among the chitin and protein molecules in a process called biomineralization. The crystals and fibres interpenetrate and reinforce each other, the minerals supplying the hardness and resistance to compression, while the chitin supplies the tensile strength. Biomineralization occurs mainly in crustaceans; in insects and Arachnids the main reinforcing materials are various proteins hardened by linking the fibres in processes called sclerotisation and the hardened proteins are called sclerotin. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - Dinosaurs are a diverse group of animals of the clade Dinosauria that first appeared during the Triassic. Although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research, the current scientific consensus places their origin between 231 and 243 million years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the TriassicJurassic extinction event 201 million years ago. Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended when the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups 66 million years ago. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - Tuatara are reptiles endemic to New Zealand. Although resembling most lizards, they are part of a distinct lineage, the order Rhynchocephalia. Their name derives from the Mori language, and means \\"peaks on the back\\". The single species of tuatara is the only surviving member of its order, which flourished around 200 million years ago. Their most recent common ancestor with any other extant group is with the squamates (lizards and snakes). For this reason, tuatara are of great interest in the study of the evolution of lizards and snakes, and for the reconstruction of the appearance and habits of the earliest diapsids, a group of amniote tetrapods that also includes dinosaurs, birds, and crocodilians. - Kuehneosauridae is an extinct family of small, lizard-like lepidosauromorph diapsids known from the Triassic period of Europe and North America. - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. - Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe.

Are these two questions asking the same thing? Options are: [I] no; [II] yes;","completion":"First question: What are some Bible verses that describe Satan? There are numerous Bible verses that describe Satan or refer to his various names in different contexts. Some of these include: 1. Isaiah 14:12-15 \\"How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations! You said in your heart, 'I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of Mount Zaphon. I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.' But you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the depths of the pit.\\" 2. Ezekiel 28:12-17 \\"Son of man, take up a lament concerning the king of Tyre and say to him: 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says: You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone adorned you: carnelian, chrysolite, and emerald, topaz, onyx, and jasper, lapis lazuli, turquoise, and beryl. Your settings and mountings were made of gold; on the day you were created, they were prepared. You were anointed as a guardian cherub, for so I ordained you. You were on the holy mount of God; you walked among the fiery stones. You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created till wickedness was found in you. Through your widespread trade, you were filled with violence, and you sinned. So I drove you in disgrace from the mount of God, and I expelled you, guardian cherub, from among the fiery stones. Your heart became proud on account of your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. So I threw you to the earth; I made a spectacle of you before kings.\\" 3. Luke 10:18 He replied, \\"I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.\\" 4. John 8:44 \\"You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.\\" 5. 1 Peter 5:8 \\"Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.\\" Second question: Who is Satan? Satan, also known as the Devil, Lucifer, or Beelzebub, is a supernatural being that represents the forces of evil and stands in opposition to God and his divine will. In Christianity, Satan is often viewed as a fallen angel who was cast out of heaven due to his rebellious nature and pride, desiring to be equal to or greater than God. Satan is portrayed throughout the Bible as a deceiver and tempter, seeking to lead people away from righteousness and into sin. He is most famously depicted in the Book of Genesis, where he takes the form of a serpent and tempts Adam and Eve to eat from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, resulting in their expulsion from the Garden of Eden and the introduction of sin into the world. In the New Testament, Satan is mentioned by Jesus in the Gospels as a real and active force seeking to disrupt and destroy the work of Jesus and his followers. He tempts Jesus during his 40-day period of fasting in the wilderness, attempting to dissuade him from his divine mission. Throughout church history, Satan has often been seen as a symbol of evil, deception, and temptation. Belief in Satan's role in the world has varied among Christians, with some interpreting his existence in a more symbolic or metaphoric sense, while others maintain a belief in a literal, supernatural figure. Are these two questions asking the same thing? [I] no These two questions address different aspects of Satan's character and existence. The first question focuses on specific Bible verses that describe Satan, his fall from grace, and his traits as a force of evil and deception. The second question seeks a more general understanding of who Satan is, touching upon his history as a fallen angel and his role in tempting humanity away from God. While both questions relate to the subject of Satan, they approach the topic from distinct angles, seeking different pieces of information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: U.S. President Donald Trump attempted to reset his relationship with Africa on Monday, as he hosted Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year. In January, Nigeria joined a list of outraged African countries demanding an explanation from the U.S. ambassador after Trump's reported vulgar comments referring to African countries. Asked whether those comments came up during his private meeting with Trump, Buhari declined to comment. \\"I'm very careful with what the press says about other than myself. I'm not sure about, you know, the validity or whether that allegation was true or not. So, the best thing for me is to keep quiet,\\" Buhari said. Question: After President Buhari's meeting with Trump, how does he really feel about President Trump? Answer: OPT: (i) He doesn't believe President Trump feels remorse for his comments (ii) He is very cautious, but will use the relationship to his advantage (iii) He believes they both suspended any ill feelings (iv) not enough information","completion":"After President Buhari's meeting with President Trump, it is not explicitly clear how he truly feels about President Trump. However, it can be inferred that he is very cautious about how he perceives and responds to the media and others' claims about Trump. Buhari did not openly comment on the alleged derogatory remarks, highlighting his conscious choice to \\"keep quiet\\" and focus on cooperative aspects of the relationship between Nigeria and the U.S., such as military support in the fight against Boko Haram and expanding trade. This suggests that he is pragmatic about working with Trump, willing to use the relationship to benefit Nigeria while avoiding public controversies. Buhari's true feelings about Trump might lie somewhere between options (ii) and (iv). That is, he is cautious but willing to use the relationship to Nigeria's advantage, while acknowledging that there may not be enough information for a decisive judgment on Trump's character."},{"prompt":"What is the final step of the following process: - Water seeps into rocks - The water freezes and thaws - Cracks form in the rocks - Cracks also form when rocks heat up Answer:","completion":"The final step of the process is: the rocks break apart due to the cracks, leading to rock weathering and erosion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The villagers rely on traditional methods for their necessities and their way of life has been preserved for centuries. Beliefs and rituals are deeply ingrained in their daily routines, and the village is virtually cut off from the modern world. Ayo, a young and ambitious villager, feels a longing for knowledge and leaves his village to pursue higher education in the city. Despite initial hardships and cultural differences, he remains determined to learn and better himself. Over time, he excels academically and ends up becoming an accomplished social worker. The city has opened his eyes to a world of opportunities and progress, but his heart yearns for his village. Act 2: Ayo decides to return to Nalari armed with his education and experience, unabated enthusiasm to introduce positive change within his community. The village elders and fellow villagers are initially skeptical about his ideas and perceive them as threats to their age-old customs and traditions. Despite the opposition, Ayo meets a few like-minded individuals and starts small schools, holding sessions in his home. He teaches the children and younger generation about the importance of education, healthcare, and sanitation. Slowly and steadily, he gains the trust of the villagers as they witness the benefits of education and new ways of thinking. Act 3: As the young generation embraces modern education and becomes increasingly aware of their rights and privileges, conflicts arise between them and the conservative elders. An internal power struggle ensues, leading to clashes and unrest within the village. Frustrated by slow progress, Ayo faces the challenge of finding a balance between respecting traditions and implementing changes that uphold the community's best interests and sustainable growth. Eventually, he decides to involve the elders in the process, seeking their wisdom and counsel. Climax: The movie reaches its climax during a long-awaited, much-debated village council meeting, where both Ayo's supporters and detractors debate on the need for change. In the end, Ayo's perseverance pays off as the village realizes the value of balanced growth, peacefully reconciling tradition with modernity.

How do you say this sentence in English?","completion":"The sentence \\"¡Es el tiempo para transformar el dolor y el sufrimiento en gozo, paz y prosperidad!\\" translates to English as \\"It's time to transform pain and suffering into joy, peace, and prosperity!\\" Breaking it down more: 1. \\"Es\\" is the third person singular of the verb \\"ser\\" (to be). It's mostly comparable to \\"is\\" in English. 2. \\"El tiempo\\" literally translates into \\"the time\\", but, in this context, it's better translated as \\"it's time\\". 3. \\"Para\\" is a preposition that means \\"for\\", \\"to\\", or \\"in order to\\". In this context, it fits best as \\"to\\". 4. \\"Transformar\\" is a verb that means \\"to transform\\". The context keeps this the same in English. 5. \\"El dolor y el sufrimiento\\" translates into \\"the pain and the suffering\\". In English, it's common to remove the second instance of \\"the\\" in lists like this one, making it \\"pain and suffering\\". 6. \\"En\\" is a preposition like \\"in\\" or \\"into\\". Because of the transformative context, it's translated as \\"into\\". 7. \\"Gozo, paz y prosperidad\\" simply means \\"joy, peace and prosperity.\\" So, in English, the whole sentence reads: \\"It's time to transform pain and suffering into joy, peace, and prosperity!\\" This clearly communicates the speaker's desire and intention to change a current state of hardship and grief into a bright future full of positivity, tranquility, and abundance.

Write a summary based on this article: Myanmar's army chief denied his forces committed rape and other sexual abuses during a crackdown he ordered on Rohingya Muslims, as he addressed UN Security Council delegates in the capital Naypyidaw. Senior General Min Aung Hlaing heads an army accused of \\"ethnic cleansing\\" by the United Nations, including the widespread rape and murder of civilians in its \\"clearance operations\\" ostensibly targeting Rohingya militants. Launched in August 2017, that campaign drove around 700,000 Rohingya refugees into Bangladesh, fleeing burnt villages and army atrocities. Denied access to Myanmar in the months immediately after the crisis, a UN Security Council delegation is making a belated first visit to Myanmar to ratchet up pressure for a safe and dignified return of the Muslim minority. Late Monday they met the army chief, who controls all security matters in the country without oversight from the elected government. \\"The Tatmadaw (army) is always disciplined... and takes action against anyone who breaks the law,\\" he told the delegates, according to a post late Monday on his official Facebook page. Rohingya women and girls in Bangladesh have provided consistent accounts of sexual violence -- reports verified by conflict monitors -- but Min Aung Hlaing said his forces have \\"no such history of sexual abuse.\\" \\"It is unacceptable according to the culture and religion of our country,\\" he said, adding anyone found guilty of crimes would be punished. He also repeated the official line that Myanmar was ready to take back the refugees who could be verified as residents as per a repatriation deal with Bangladesh. Several months after the deal was signed, no refugees have returned. That has enraged Bangladeshi officials, who accuse Myanmar of pretending to co-operate for the benefit of the international community. Calling the refugees \\"Bengalis\\" -- official shorthand for illegal immigrants from over the border -- Min Aung Hlaing blamed \\"terrorists\\" for causing the violence. The UN delegates will travel by helicopter Tuesday over the scarred landscape of northern Rakhine state and give a press conference back in the capital Naypyidaw later in the afternoon. Their visit to Myanmar comes after an emotionally-charged stay in Bangladesh where Rohingya refugees told delegates of their trauma including sexual abuse. Myanmar denies the Rohingya citizenship and the accompanying rights. It has driven two thirds of its roughly 1.5 million Rohingya population out since 2012. But the country is under mounting pressure to respond to a humanitarian crisis of its making. Civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi also met the UN delegates on Monday afternoon, urging their understanding of a complex, festering conflict and vowing to repatriate the refugees. ||||| Nearly nine months after Myanmar’s military was accused of widespread sexual violence in a crackdown against Rohingya communities, aid groups in Bangladesh’s Rohingya refugee camps are scrambling to identify women and girls now pregnant by rape. “We’re kind of working against the clock before the bulk of these pregnancies will be delivering,” said Siobhan O'Malley, sexual and gender-based violence consultant with Médecins Sans Frontières. Healthcare workers are warning of a “child protection crisis” in late May, when nine months will have passed since a military purge drove some 686,000 Rohingya people into Bangladesh from Myanmar’s Rakhine State. They fear that some rape survivors are hiding their pregnancies because of shame and stigma, and may risk giving birth in secret or abandon their babies. Madha Khatun, 65, a Rohingya midwife who fled to Bangladesh last year, said she believes many survivors are hiding rapes and pregnancies, not just from humanitarian organisations and local authorities but also from their own communities and families. \\"They won't tell anyone because they are scared about what people will think of them,\\" she said. \\"They think it will stop them getting married in the future.\\" In a November report based on interviews with Rohingya victims of sexual violence, Human Rights Watch said two thirds of women interviewed had not reported their rape to aid groups or Bangladeshi authorities in the camps. “A lot of these girls, because they’re young and ashamed of what happened, a lot of them are concealing these pregnancies,” O’Malley said. “Because they’re so scared of these pregnancies, they won’t try to access care.\\" Aid groups in the camps are planning to offer shelter to women before and after they give birth – and to care for abandoned newborns. But first they need to identify the women and girls who may need aid and then convince them to seek help. An outcome of violence Myanmar’s military is accused of committing systematic and widespread rape against women and girls during last year’s violent purge of Rohingya refugees from Rakhine State – part of a campaign that rights groups, UN officials, and foreign diplomats have called ethnic cleansing. In an annual report to be discussed at the UN Security Council on Monday, 16th April, Secretary-General António Guterres puts Myanmar’s army on a watchlist of security forces and armed groups “credibly suspected” of using rape and sexual violence in conflict – a list that includes the so-called Islamic State, Boko Haram, and the Lord’s Resistance Army. “The widespread threat and use of sexual violence was integral to their strategy, humiliating, terrorising and collectively punishing the Rohingya community and serving as a calculated tool to force them to flee their homelands and prevent their return,” Guterres says in the report. “Violence was visited upon women, including pregnant women, who are seen as custodians and propagators of ethnic identity, as well as on young children, who represent the future of the group.” While Myanmar has barred UN investigators from entering the country, the report listed at least 70 “specific and indicative” cases of sexual violence allegedly committed by security forces in the months leading up to the August 2017 refugee exodus from Rakhine. A stalled repatriation agreement between Bangladesh and Myanmar also specifies that “children born out of unwarranted incidents” could be eligible for returns. Myanmar’s military has denied almost all accusations of violence; it says its operations in Rakhine were in response to attacks on border areas by a group of Rohingya militants. The number of Rohingya rape survivors is unclear, as is the number who are now pregnant. Humanitarian aid groups reported treating hundreds of sexual violence cases in the aftermath of the August violence, but such numbers are likely vastly under-representative; many survivors never seek medical help out of shame and fear of being shunned by their families and others. Kaamil Ahmed/IRIN Madha Khatun, a traditional Rohingya midwife, believes women and girls are hiding rapes and pregnancies from their families and communities. MSF alone has treated at least 230 survivors of sexual violence in the camps, including at least 162 rape survivors. O’Malley said more than half the pregnancies the group has seen involved girls younger than 18. In the weeks after the August and September violence last year, MSF offered care to women who had tried to terminate their pregnancies themselves, resulting in incomplete or septic abortions, O’Malley said. Some women arrived at MSF clinics haemorrhaging. “How could I live with their baby?” MSF also cared for women like a 20-year-old now living in the camps. The woman, who did not want her name to be used, said that Myanmar soldiers shot and killed her husband during the crackdown last August, before taking her away and raping her. \\"I lost my senses,” she said in an interview. “It was like I was lifeless. They did whatever they wanted with me.\\" Nursed to consciousness while hiding in a nearby forest, she said her husband’s family carried her to Bangladesh, where doctors with MSF told her she was pregnant. On her request, they terminated her pregnancy. \\"I was raped by those Rakhine soldiers. How could I live with their baby?\\" she said, crouched on a small wooden stand in the hut she now shares with her husband's extended family in the sprawling camps. MSF officials say the majority of women and girls treated with post-rape care last year were abused in Myanmar, but that now more women are seeking help for domestic abuse they’ve suffered in the refugee camps. Yet there’s still a severe shortage of post-rape care in the overcrowded camps, according to the Interagency Working Group on Reproductive Health in Crisis, which includes major agencies currently working in Bangladesh. Safe abortion, emergency contraception, and other sexual and reproductive health services are often basic, inconsistent, and sporadically available, the group says. Racing the monsoon Adding to these problems is the imminent monsoon season, which typically begins by May, bringing heavy rains that could douse the ramshackle camps and turn the precariously built homes and footpaths into a disaster zone. O’Malley said the priority now is to find new ways to reach pregnant women and girls, before the weather deteriorates, to let them know help is available – a complicated task when many survivors don’t want to be found and traditional outreach and communications tactics aren’t working. As Save the Children spokeswoman Daphnee Cook told IRIN in a written statement: \\"In the most tragic cases, some of these women, faced with the stigmatisation of having a baby outside of marriage and the trauma of having a child from sexual assault, have made the heartbreaking decision to abandon their babies.\\" Cook said her organisation has already established short-term stopgaps such as emergency shelters and foster care families for newborns. But longer-term care options are still needed, she said, adding: “there is a child protection crisis on the doorstep that urgently needs to be addressed.” ka/il/js/ag ||||| Agencies braced for spike in unwanted children who were conceived as a result of sexual violence by Myanmar soldiers and militiamen When hundreds of thousands of Rohingya flooded into south-east Bangladesh last year they told of systematic rape and other sexual violence by Myanmar soldiers and militiamen. May will mark nine months since that exodus started. Aid agencies, especially those who work with women and children, have been bracing for the date. Over the next weeks, babies conceived as a result of sexual assaults committed during the crackdown will be born. 'Lives will be lost': 700,000 Rohingya face cyclone season under tarpaulin Read more Save the Children says it is expecting the number of babies who are abandoned by their mothers to increase next month in line with the milestone. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), which runs hospitals in the sprawling Cox’s Bazar camps, is preparing to counsel affected mothers. “They may feel they cannot care or are not equipped to care for their new baby,” says Melissa How, a medical coordinator with the doctors’ group. “Many of them are young women under the age of 18. Additionally, how they will be perceived socially due to stigma is an added stress.” Yet they will not be the first children conceived in this way to be born in the camps. About one year ago, Ayesha Akhtar* missed her period. A few weeks earlier, the Rohingya woman says three Burmese soldiers had burst into her home in a village south of Maungdaw town, threatened to shoot her children, then raped her. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Rohingya refugees cross the Naf river to Bangladesh last year. Photograph: Mohammad Ponir Hossain/Reuters Similar raids had been taking place for months across Rakhine state as part of a Myanmar army crackdown beginning in November 2016. Ayesha, a mother of five whose husband died in 2012, says the “dirty act” left her reeling. She tried keeping it from her neighbours, but they quickly guessed. “Everyone knew the soldiers commit rape when they raid villages,” she tells the Guardian inside her tarpaulin shelter on a slope in Balukhali, one of the congested refugee camps that has swollen with new arrivals since last August. Q&A Who are the Rohingya? Show Hide The Rohingya are Muslims who live in majority-Buddhist Myanmar. They are often described as \\"the world's most persecuted minority\\". Nearly all of Myanmar's 1.1 million Rohingya live in the western coastal state of Rakhine. The government does not recognise them as citizens, effectively rendering them stateless. Extremist nationalist movements insist the group are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, although the Rohingya say they are native to Rakhine state. Rights groups accuse Burmese authorities of ethnic cleansing, systematically forcing Rohingya from the country through violence and persecution, a charge the government has denied. Photograph: Tracey Nearmy/AAP In Myanmar, most Rohingya had little or no access to healthcare, let alone abortion services. Ayesha, 34, says she bought “medicine” from a village doctor that failed to halt the pregnancy. As a widow, she felt a particular stigma against asking other villagers for help. “Seeking help to abort pregnancy is very difficult for a widow in our society,” she says. “I stopped searching for any way to get rid of the pregnancy and I left everything to the mercy of Allah.” In August 2017, when she was five months’ pregnant, a new round of military raids began in her area. Like nearly 700,000 other Rohingya she fled across the border to Bangladesh. Inside the heaving refugee camps, she again sought help to terminate the pregnancy. But by then it was too late. Bangladesh law prohibits abortion after the first trimester. Doctors warned her an illegal procedure could endanger her life. “I had other little children at home,” she says. “I chose not to take the risk.” Nobody knows how many women like Ayesha there are in the camps. MSF says it treated 224 victims of sexual violence up to 25 February, but acknowledges there are many more who do not seek help. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Thousands of Rohingya women have reported being raped by Myanmar troops. Photograph: Andrew Philip/Tearfund In January, so many women were showing up at the organisation’s hospitals bleeding that midwives speculated many were probably trying to abort their pregnancies at home. The UN’s special envoy on sexual violence, Pramila Patten, has concluded the Myanmar army use rape as a weapon of genocide. “[It is] a calculated tool of terror aimed at the extermination and removal of the Rohingya as a group,” she says. Earlier in April, the UN added Myanmar’s military, the Tatmadaw, to a list of armies known to commit sexual violence in armed conflict. On 26 January, Ayesha gave birth to a boy named Fayaz*. He was healthy, despite the traumas his mother had suffered. He has an eager smile, she says. “He is very playful and jolly.” Fayaz’s arrival divided the family, and the community. Two of Ayesha’s daughters told her the infant was not really their brother. “They said I should give him to an orphanage,” she says. Zafar Alam, another refugee in the same part of the camp, admitted some in the area looked down on the child. “But many more have stood in support of Ayesha and her son,” he says. “We told them she was a victim.” Her new neighbours have been comforting her. They say she isn’t the only one. “They tell me there are hundreds or thousands of Rohingya women who have been attacked in the same way,” Ayesha says. She has been telling her daughters the same thing. “I told them this pregnancy was forced on me, and the whole world knows that. You have no reason to be embarrassed or ashamed.” The girls are changing their minds, she says. They play with Fayaz more often. “Perhaps they also love him,” she says. Ayesha has never doubted that she does too. “He might have been born because of a cruel act, but I can’t blame him for that,” she says. “He is innocent, just a baby. I love him like my other children. It doesn’t feel different.” Ko Ko Linn, a Rohingya political activist based in Bangladesh, said he knew of 15 cases of women who were pregnant after being sexually assaulted by Myanmar soldiers during the military campaign that started in August. But he is certain many more are undocumented. Surveys conducted by Human Rights Watch in November estimated two-thirds of the women who had been experienced sexual violence in Myanmar had not reported it to authorities or aid groups in Bangladesh. Linn says children already born in these circumstances, or those who will be in the next weeks, should face no stigma. “They will be given birth by a Rohingya mother who held them for up to 10 months, bearing all sorts of pain and hurt,” he says. “Therefore, they are sons and daughters of Rohingya.” *Names have been changed to protect the identities of people in this story. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Myanmar's army chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, has denied allegations of rape and other sexual abuses by his forces during a crackdown on Rohingya Muslims.

A new law limits exploration to an area south of the southern end of the long coastline; production limits have been laid down(though these have already been raised) ; and oil companies have not been allowed to employ more than a limited number of foreign workers. But the oil industry has a way of getting over such problems, and few people believe that the government will be able to hold things back for long. Ever since the war, the government has been carrying out a program of development in the area north of the Arctic Circle. For the past few years this program has had a great deal of success: Torso has been built up into a local capital with a university, a large hospital and a healthy industry. But the oil industry has already started to draw people south, and within a few years the whole northern city could be in ruins. The effects of the oil industry would not be limited to the north, however. With nearly 100 per cent employment, everyone can see a situation developing in which the service industries and the tourist industry will lose more of their workers to the oil industry. Some smaller industries might even disappear altogether when it becomes cheaper to buy goods from abroad. The real argument over the oil industry is its effects on the Norwegian way of life. Farmers and fishermen do not make up most of the population, but they are an important part of it because Norwegians see in them many of the qualities that they regard with pride as real Norwegians.

Bosons make up one of the two classes of particles, the other being fermions. The name boson was coined by Paul Dirac to commemorate the contribution of the Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose in developing, with Einstein, BoseEinstein statisticswhich theorizes the characteristics of elementary particles. Examples of bosons include fundamental particles such as photons, gluons, and W and Z bosons (the four force-carrying gauge bosons of the Standard Model), the recently discovered Higgs boson, and the hypothetical graviton of quantum gravity; composite particles (e.g. mesons and stable nuclei of even mass number such as deuterium (with one proton and one neutron, mass number = 2), helium-4, or lead-208); and some quasiparticles (e.g. Cooper pairs, plasmons, and phonons). - A quark (or ) is an elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of matter. Quarks combine to form composite particles called hadrons, the most stable of which are protons and neutrons, the components of atomic nuclei. Due to a phenomenon known as \\"color confinement\\", quarks are never directly observed or found in isolation; they can be found only within hadrons, such as baryons (of which protons and neutrons are examples) and mesons. For this reason, much of what is known about quarks has been drawn from observations of the hadrons themselves. - Gravity, or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass are brought toward (or \\"gravitate\\" toward) one another, including planets, stars and galaxies. Since energy and mass are equivalent, all forms of energy, including light, also cause gravitation and are under the influence of it. On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects and causes the ocean tides. The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing, forming stars and the stars to group together into galaxies so gravity is responsible for many of the large scale structures in the Universe. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become increasingly weaker on farther objects. - Particle physics (also high energy physics) is the branch of physics that studies the nature of the particles that constitute \\"matter\\" (particles with mass) and \\"radiation\\" (massless particles). Although the word \\"particle\\" can refer to various types of very small objects (e.g. protons, gas particles, or even household dust), \\"particle physics\\" usually investigates the irreducibly smallest detectable particles and the irreducibly fundamental force fields necessary to explain them. By our current understanding, these elementary particles are excitations of the quantum fields that also govern their interactions. The currently dominant theory explaining these fundamental particles and fields, along with their dynamics, is called the Standard Model. Thus, modern particle physics generally investigates the Standard Model and its various possible extensions, e.g. to the newest \\"known\\" particle, the Higgs boson, or even to the oldest known force field, gravity. - In particle physics , a hadron i / hædrn / ( Greek : , hadrós , \`\` stout , thick '' ) is a composite particle made of quarks held together by the strong force ( in a similar way as molecules are held together by the electromagnetic force ) . Hadrons are categorized into two families : baryons , made of three quarks , and mesons , made of one quark and one antiquark . Protons and neutrons are examples of baryons ; pions are an example of a meson . Hadrons containing more than three valence quarks ( exotic hadrons ) have been discovered in recent years . A tetraquark state ( an exotic meson ) , named the Z ( 4430 ) , was discovered in 2007 by the Belle Collaboration and confirmed as a resonance in 2014 by the LHCb collaboration . Two pentaquark states ( exotic baryons ) , named P + - In particle physics, mesons (or ) are hadronic subatomic particles composed of one quark and one antiquark, bound together by the strong interaction. Because mesons are composed of quark sub-particles, they have a physical size, with a diameter of roughly one fermi, which is about the size of a proton or neutron. All mesons are unstable, with the longest-lived lasting for only a few hundredths of a microsecond. Charged mesons decay (sometimes through mediating particles) to form electrons and neutrinos. Uncharged mesons may decay to photons. Both of these decays imply that color is no longer a property of the byproducts. What object entity has the relation of 'interaction' with the subject 'hadron'?

Anxious to fight at any opportunity, as his father suggested, the young Gascon challenges Rochefort, only to have his sword struck in two. He is knocked out as his new enemy goes to meet an approaching carriage. Rochefort greets the passenger inside--Milady DeWinter (Faye Dunaway)-- and tells her she must go to England to report on the Duke of Buckingham (Simon Ward). The pair are spies for Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston). D'Artagnan again tries to pick a fight but ends up falling in the mud.Finding the musketeers' headquarters, D'Artagnan awaits an appointment with their commander M. Treville (Georges Wilson). As he makes his way through the indoor training ground, he sees Porthos (Frank Finlay) having his portrait done while Aramis (Richard Chamberlain) watches; outside Treville's office, Athos (Oliver Reed) has a shoulder wound attended to. Treville reads D'Artagnan's letter and asks to see the familiar sword, which D'Artagnan sheepishly produces; the commander knows the weapon, realizes what has happened and lets him borrow a new one. Unfortunately there is no place in the musketeers for him, Treville says, until he has established his reputation on campaign or in killing, but a place in the guard might be suited...

The head of a maraschino cherry factory who shot himself dead last Tuesday after police found a secret drug lab on site could have been making up to 10million a year from his illicit venture. Arthur Mondella, 57, president of Dell's Maraschino Cherries factory in Brooklyn, was believed to have been managing a huge marijuana operation on the side of his food business. According to a report in the the New York Post, he could have earned up to 6,500 for a pound of the substance - depending on the quality. Scroll down for video. Arthur Mondella (above) hid his massive marijuana business behind his hugely successful cherry business authorities believe. It has been claimed he could have been making up to 10million a year. The smell of the 400,000 pounds of cherries produced each day in his factory hid the smell of the 1,200 plants he grew. Mondella asked his sister Joanne Capece (right) to 'take care of [his] kids (two daughters Dana and Dominique and ex-wife Elaine left),' and then shot himself dead in his private bathroom. If he was growing 100 plants and the drug was 'high quality', it means he would have been making more than 2.5million every three months, a consultant told The Post. It was revealed on Saturday that he was able to keep investigators in the dark as the smell of the 400,000 pounds of Maraschino cherries his plant processed each week managed to mask the stench of the marijuana plants. Reports suggest he was capable of growing at least 100 at a time, but could have managed up to 1,200, meaning he could have been making substantially more from the criminal enterprise. Furthermore, the other red flag for authorities would have been the heightened electric bill from running grow lamps - something that was also masked by his large operation. This as many still have questions as to why the president of Dell's Maraschino Cherries, after cooperating with investigators for five hours Tuesday as they looked in to claims that his business was dumping hazardous waste, excused himself, asked his sister Joanne Capece to 'take care of [his] kids,' and then shot himself dead in his private bathroom. The New York Daily News reports that investigators then discovered a crawl space that led to a 50-foot-by-50-foot area that was divided into several rooms. Authorities now believe the rooms were for growing the plans. One room contained seeds of 60 different marijuana strains and about 125,000 in cash. Salvatore Capece (left), nephew of Mondella, and Dominique Mondella (right), his daughter, continued the family legacy by working at Dell's Maraschino Cherries. They believe a crop had just been harvested, as only three bags with about 100 pounds of marijuana were discovered during their search. All that, along with 120 expensive grow lamps, were completely hidden, leading one source to speculate he could have been working alone and not with the help of others at the company. 'In theory, it could have been him and outsiders,' said the source. 'This is a secreted part of a large factory that was designed so a large number of employees won’t know.' Despite all this, the company, which has contracts with numerous national restaurant chains such as Red Lobster, Buffalo Wild Wings, Chick-fil-A and TGI Fridays, is back in business and family lawyer Michael Farkas states managers are cooperating fully with the District Attorney's investigation. Mondella is survived by three children from two marriages. His father, Arthur Mondella Sr, started the business as a Brooklyn storefront in 1948.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No, the answer you provided refers to Tennessee's involvement in the Civil War, not how it originally became a state. Here is the correct and detailed answer: Tennessee became the 16th state of the United States on June 1, 1796. Prior to statehood, the region was part of the Territory South of the River Ohio, more commonly known as the Southwest Territory. The Southwest Territory was created in 1790 from land ceded to the U.S. federal government by the state of North Carolina. The process leading to Tennessee's statehood began with a popular movement within the Southwest Territory advocating for the establishment of a state government. This movement culminated in a constitutional convention that was held in Knoxville in January 1796. At this convention, delegates from across the territory drafted a state constitution and submitted it to the United States Congress for consideration. One of the key figures in Tennessee's statehood was John Sevier, a veteran of the Revolutionary War and a prominent political leader in the territory. He became a strong advocate for statehood and was later elected as Tennessee's first governor. After reviewing the submitted constitution, the U.S. Congress passed an act admitting Tennessee into the Union on June 1, 1796. Tennessee thus became the first territory to gain statehood through a grassroots movement and subsequent constitutional convention, establishing a precedent for how territories would be admitted as states in the future."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Question 1: How do I convert my 2 million dollars to a billion dollars in 2 year time? Question 2: How do I convert 30 million dollars into 1 billion dollars? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"I will answer both questions separately and provide an explanation for each. Afterward, I'll compare the answers to determine if they would be the same. Question 1: To convert 2 million dollars to a billion dollars in 2 years, follow these steps: Step 1: Determine the target amount. In this case, the target amount is 1 billion dollars. Step 2: Calculate the required growth rate. To convert 2 million dollars to 1 billion dollars in 2 years, you need to find the growth rate required for that period. 1,000,000,000 (target amount) ÷ 2,000,000 (initial amount) = 500 This means you need a 500-fold increase in your initial investment over two years. Step 3: Calculate the annual growth rate. To achieve this growth rate in 2 years, your annual compound growth rate would need to be: (500)^(1/2) = about 22.36 Step 4: Convert the annual growth rate to a percentage. To convert to a percentage, multiply the result by 100. 22.36 × 100 = approximately 2,236% To achieve this goal, you need an investment that returns approximately 2,236% per year. This level of return is highly unlikely and unrealistic from an investment standpoint. Question 2: To convert 30 million dollars into 1 billion dollars, follow the same steps: Step 1: Determine the target amount (still 1 billion dollars). Step 2: Calculate the required growth rate. 1,000,000,000 ÷ 30,000,000 = 33.33 This means you need a 33.33-fold increase in your initial investment. Step 3: Calculate the annual growth rate. (33.33)^(1/2) = about 5.77 Step 4: Convert the annual growth rate to a percentage. 5.77 × 100 = approximately 577% To achieve this goal, you need an investment that returns approximately 577% per year, which is still highly unlikely and unrealistic. Comparison: The answers to both questions are not the same, as the required growth rates are different. For the first question, you need a return of approximately 2,236% per year, while for the second question, you need a return of approximately 577% per year.

The painting has been imitated a thousand times, satirised, stolen and vandalised with acid, red paint, stones and even a teacup. And now, it seems, there might be a second Mona Lisa — a bigger Mona, with a less enigmatic, slightly jollier smile, and a pair of new classical columns on either side of her mysterious, beguiling face. On Friday in Geneva, the Isleworth Mona Lisa is to be revealed by its owners — a Swiss consortium, who argue that their version is Leonardo’s first stab at the painting; and that the famous version, held in the Louvre in Paris, was his second bite of the cherry. Anatoly Karpov, the chess grandmaster and member of the Mona Lisa Foundation, will unveil the painting. In comparison: The real Mona Lisa, Leonardo's enigmatic masterpiece, is seen (left); while the Isleworth Mona Lisa, a younger likeness between two pillars, is also shown (right) Opinion within the art world is split over whether it is a real Leonardo or a later copy, painted in the late 16th century, long after the original was executed, between 1503 and 1519. Among those backing the theory that it is genuine are Alessandro Vezzosi, director of the Museo Ideale Leonardo da Vinci in Vinci, the artist’s birthplace on the edge of Florence. On Friday, he will present the reasons for his conclusion, alongside Carlo Pedretti, of the University of California. A spokesman for the Mona Lisa Foundation has promised that, on Friday, the foundation will produce ‘historical, comparative and scientific evidence’ that the painting ‘was indeed executed by Leonardo’. Not everyone is so convinced. ‘I would have to be deeply sceptical,’ says Philip Mould, the portrait expert, Antiques Roadshow presenter and host of Fake Or Fortune? ‘It would be an extraordinary find, the ultimate prize. Leonardo did do variants [different versions of the same picture], like his Madonna Of The Rocks in last year’s National Gallery show. So it wouldn’t be unheard of for him to do another Mona Lisa. ‘Still, you must remember that about one new supposed Mona Lisa turns up on the market every year. You’d have to look at the provenance and history of this one very, very carefully.’ The known history of this second Mona goes back to 1914, when it was bought by a critic and artist called Hugh Blaker, from Isleworth, West London — hence the name. World famous: The painting by Leonardo da Vinci, pictured, has been imitated a thousand times, satirised, stolen and vandalised with acid, red paint, stones and even a teacup. Blaker bought the picture from a grand collection in Somerset, where it had apparently hung on the walls for a century. In 1962, an American art collector, Henry F. Pulitzer, bought the painting and devoted much of his life to proving it was an original. He even wrote a book backing his claim, Where Is The Mona Lisa?, published by the Pulitzer Press, his own company. 'I would have to be deeply sceptical. It would be an extraordinary find, the ultimate prize' Philip Mould, portrait expert. Pulitzer — and other defenders of the Isleworth Mona Lisa — depend for their attribution on Leonardo’s 16th-century biographer, Giorgio Vasari, himself a painter. Vasari said that Leonardo started the Mona Lisa in 1503 and ‘left it unfinished’. But then, in 1517, said Vasari, a completed picture of a ‘certain Florentine lady’ popped up in Leonardo’s collection. This picture is the Louvre version, while the unfinished earlier version was the Isleworth Leonardo, or so the theory goes. That order of events would explain why the Isleworth Mona Lisa looks younger than the famous version — because it was, theoretically, painted years before the famous version. Pulitzer also depended for his theory on Raphael, the painter and contemporary of Da Vinci, who sketched a version of the Mona Lisa in 1504. His sketch included the columns that are found in the Isleworth version. The final big piece in the jigsaw, said Pulitzer, was a 1584 art history book, Trattato dell’arte della Pittura Scultura ed Architettura, by Giovanni Lomazzo, which refers to ‘della Gioconda, e di Mona Lisa’ — ‘the Gioconda, and the Mona Lisa’ — suggesting there were two pictures. Admiration: Art fans look at the Mona Lisa painting by Leonardo da Vinci, left, in the Louvre museum in Paris. The Gioconda is an alternative title for the Mona Lisa; Mona is an abbreviation of ‘Ma donna’, or My Lady, while Gioconda is Italian for the jocund, or happy, one. The sitter’s real name is in fact thought to be Lisa Gherardini, wife of a rich Florence silk merchant, Francesco del Giocondo. On Leonardo’s death in 1519, the picture — the Louvre’s version, that is! — was left to his assistant, Salai, who in turn sold it to King Francis I of France. The painting remained in the royal collection until the French Revolution in 1789, when it was moved to the Louvre. There it has remained ever since, with a few notable absences. Napoleon kept it in his bedroom in the Tuileries Palace and, during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1, it was transferred for safekeeping to the Arsenal in Brest. During World War II, it migrated all over France to avoid damage. It has also been on tour to New York and Washington, Tokyo and Moscow. But the picture’s biggest excursion was in 1911, when it was stolen by an Italian Louvre worker, called Vincenzo Peruggia, who wanted it returned to Italy. He pulled off the biggest art theft in history in the simplest way: hiding in a broom cupboard during the day, then slipping out after closing time, the Mona Lisa stuffed under his coat. He kept it in his flat for two years and was only discovered when he brazenly tried to flog the picture to the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. Extraordinary skill: Leonardo's exceptional Lady With An Ermine was painted in around 1490, nearly 15 years before the Louvre's Mona Lisa; and already it displays Leonardo's supreme talent. That wasn’t the end of Mona Lisa’s troubles. In 1956, the poor old girl was first scarred with acid, and then attacked with a rock. Bulletproof glass protected it when, in 1974, a disabled woman, protesting against the Louvre’s policy on handicapped visitors, threw red paint at the picture. The glass again saved the picture only three years ago, when an angry Russian woman, denied French citizenship, threw a teacup at the painting. Meanwhile, the other supposed Mona Lisa gathered dust in a Swiss bank vault, where it has rested for 40 years. After Pulitzer’s death, he left the picture to his girlfriend and, on her death, the Swiss consortium bought it. 'She might look younger, but this is probably because the copyist — and I believe it is a copy done a few years after the Mona Lisa — just painted it that way' Martin Kemp, Oxford University. This Friday, the art world will examine it in the flesh for the first time since Pulitzer briefly exhibited it in an American show half-a-century ago. Many art historians remain doubtful. ‘So much is wrong,’ says the Leonardo expert and emeritus professor of art at Oxford University, Martin Kemp. ‘The dress, the hair and background landscape. This one is also painted on canvas, which Leonardo rarely did.’ The famous Mona Lisa is painted on wood, as are practically all of his paintings. ‘She might look younger,’ says Professor Kemp, ‘but this is probably because the copyist — and I believe it is a copy done a few years after the Mona Lisa — just painted it that way.’ The theory used to go that, because the Isleworth picture was done earlier in Leonardo’s career, he had not matured in style when he painted it. That theory was blown out of the water last year at the National Gallery exhibition, when his exceptional Lady With An Ermine was shown. That picture was painted in around 1490, nearly 15 years before the Louvre’s Mona Lisa; and already it displays Leonardo’s supreme talent. ‘That show confirmed his extraordinary skill in the way he expressed skin and modelling,’ says Philip Mould. ‘You’d have to have a dispassionate look at the technique in the Isleworth picture, and do lots of forensics. But still, nothing is impossible.’ And so the art world will wait with bated breath until Thursday, when the door of that Swiss bank vault creaks open, to see if lightning really did strike twice for the world’s greatest artist. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"The article discusses the Isleworth Mona Lisa, which some believe is a second version of Leonardo da Vinci's most famous painting. A Swiss consortium owns the painting and claims that their version is Leonardo's first attempt, while the famous version held in the Louvre in Paris is his second. The Isleworth Mona Lisa, which features a younger-looking Mona Lisa with a less enigmatic smile and additional columns surrounding her face, has divided opinion within the art world over whether it is an authentic Leonardo or a later copy. Important supporters of the Isleworth Mona Lisa's authenticity include Alessandro Vezzosi, director of the Museo Ideale Leonardo da Vinci in Vinci, and Carlo Pedretti of the University of California in Los Angeles. However, other art experts and historians remain skeptical, pointing to discrepancies in the painting's background, dress, hair, and even the fact it is painted on canvas rather than wood. The history of the Isleworth Mona Lisa dates back to 1914, when it was bought by Hugh Blaker, an art critic and artist from Isleworth, West London. The painting's authenticity is based on the account of Leonardo's 16th-century biographer, Giorgio Vasari, who suggested that Leonardo started the Mona Lisa in 1503 and \\"left it unfinished\\" until a completed version appeared in 1517.

A:","completion":"The Blues Brothers movie, directed by John Landis and starring John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, was released in the United States on June 20, 1980. The film, which was adapted from a popular sketch on the television show \\"Saturday Night Live,\\" follows the comedic and musical misadventures of two brothers, Jake and Elwood Blues, as they attempt to reunite their band and save the Catholic orphanage where they were raised. The film has since become a cult classic, with its memorable characters, quotable lines, and lively musical performances, featuring some of the biggest names in American rhythm and blues, soul, and blues music, such as James Brown, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, and Cab Calloway. The film also includes appearances by musicians Steve Cropper, Donald \\"Duck\\" Dunn, and Matt \\"Guitar\\" Murphy, who all contributed to the film's energetic live music scenes and were part of the original Blues Brothers Band. The movie had a budget of around 27 million, which was relatively high for a comedy at the time. Despite mixed critical reception at the time of its release, The Blues Brothers has endured and is now considered a beloved classic. The combination of its slapstick comedy, distinctive characters, and outstanding musical performances have contributed to its lasting popularity. The film grossed more than 115 million at the box office worldwide, and its success led to the creation of a sequel, \\"Blues Brothers 2000,\\" released in 1998, with Dan Aykroyd reprising his role as Elwood Blues and John Goodman joining the cast as Mighty Mack McTeer, replacing the late John Belushi's character. In addition to the two movies, the Blues Brothers story has expanded into other formats, including a video game, an animated TV series, comic books, and numerous live concert tours featuring various musicians from the original film and others who have joined the fold.

Readers can then comment on the articles, and they can also give up or down votes on individual comments. Each comment receives a rating calculated by subtracting negative votes from positive ones. The experiment performed a subtle, random change on the ratings of comments submitted on the site over five months: right after each comment was made, it was given an arbitrary up or down vote, or — for a control group — left alone. Reflecting a tendency among the site’s users to provide positive feedback, about twice as many of these arbitrary initial votes were positive: 4,049 to 1,942. The first person reading the comment was 32 percent more likely to give it an up vote if it had been already given a fake positive score. There was no change in the likelihood of subsequent negative votes. Over time, the comments with the artificial initial up vote ended with scores 25 percent higher than those in the control group. “That is a significant change,” Dr. Aral said. “We saw how these very small signals of social influence snowballed into behaviors like herding.” Meanwhile, comments that received an initial negative vote ended up with scores indistinguishable from those in the control group. The Web site allows users to say whether they like or dislike other users, and the researchers found that a commenter’s friends were likely to correct the negative score while enemies did not find it worth their time to knock down a fake up vote. The distortion of ratings through herding is not a novel concern. Reddit, a social news site that said it was not the one that participated in the study, similarly allows readers to vote comments up or down, but it also allows its moderators to hide those ratings for a certain amount of time. “Now a comment will more likely be voted on based on its merit and appeal to each user, rather than having its public perception influence its votes,” it explained when it unveiled the feature in April. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A new study shows how subtle manipulations can influence people's behavior on a news website, exhibiting a herding effect.

Sir Henry Irving (6 February 1838 - 13 October 1905), born John Henry Brodribb, sometimes known as J. H. Irving, was an English stage actor in the Victorian era, known as an actor-manager because he took complete responsibility (supervision of sets, lighting, direction, casting, as well as playing the leading roles) for season after season at the Lyceum Theatre, establishing himself and his company as representative of English classical theatre. In 1895 he became the first actor to be awarded a knighthood, indicating full acceptance into the higher circles of British society. Irving is widely acknowledged to be one of the inspirations for Count Dracula, the title character of the 1897 novel Dracula whose author, Bram Stoker, was business manager of the theatre. After a few years' schooling while living at Halsetown, near St Ives, Cornwall, Irving became a clerk to a firm of East India merchants in London, but he soon gave up a commercial career for acting. On 29 September 1856 he made his first appearance at Sunderland as Gaston, Duke of Orleans, in Bulwer Lytton's play, Richelieu, billed as Henry Irving. This name he eventually assumed by royal licence. When the inexperienced Irving got stage fright and was hissed off the stage the actor Samuel Johnson was among those who supported him with practical advice. Later in life Irving gave them all regular work when he formed his own Company at the Lyceum Theatre. For 10 years, he went through an arduous training in various stock companies in Scotland and the north of England, taking more than 500 parts. his delineations of the various characters (...) were admirably graphic, and met with repeated rounds of applause. Possesed of a fine voice, which he modulated with great taste and judgment, he was able to mark the depth or frivolity of the character he was representing with remarkable facility. He gained recognition by degrees, and in 1866 Ruth Herbert engaged him as her leading man and sometime stage director at the St. James's Theatre, London, where she first played Doricourt in The Belle's Stratagem. One piece that he directed there was W. S. Gilbert's first successful solo play, Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack (1866) The next year he joined the company of the newly opened Queen's Theatre, where he acted with Charles Wyndham, J. L. Toole, Lionel Brough, John Clayton, Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Wigan, Ellen Terry and Nellie Farren. This was followed by short engagements at the Haymarket Theatre, Drury Lane, and the Gaiety Theatre. Finally he made his first conspicuous success as Digby Grant in James Albery's Two Roses, which was produced at the Vaudeville Theatre on 4 June 1870 and ran for a very successful 300 nights. In 1871, Irving began his association with the Lyceum Theatre by an engagement under Bateman's management. The fortunes of the house were at a low ebb when the tide was turned by Irving's sudden success as Mathias in The Bells, a version of Erckmann-Chatrian's Le Juif polonais by Leopold Lewis, a property which Irving had found for himself. The play ran for 150 nights, established Irving at the forefront of the British drama, and would prove a popular vehicle for Irving for the rest of his professional life. With Bateman, Irving was seen in W. G. Wills' Charles I and Eugene Aram, in Richelieu, and in 1874 in Hamlet. The unconventionality of this last performance, during a run of 200 nights, aroused keen discussion and singled him out as the most interesting English actor of his day. In 1875, again with Bateman, he was seen as the title character in Macbeth; in 1876 as Othello, and as Philip in Alfred Lord Tennyson's Queen Mary; in 1877 in Richard III; and in The Lyons Mail. During this time he became lifelong friends with Bram Stoker, who praised him in his review of Hamlet and thereafter joined Irving as the manager for the company. How did that affect his confidence?","completion":"Going through various stages of his career, facing initial challenges, and eventually achieving significant successes would have had a profound impact on Sir Henry Irving's confidence. Here is the step-by-step analysis of how his career advancements likely affected his confidence: 1. Early challenges: Irving faced obstacles early in his career, including stage fright and being hissed off the stage. However, the support and guidance from fellow actors like Samuel Johnson would have helped him gain confidence and learn from his mistakes. 2. Years of training: Going through arduous training in various stock companies in Scotland and the north of England for 10 years, where he took on more than 500 roles, would have significantly developed his acting skills and increased his confidence as a performer. 3. Recognition and opportunities: As he gained recognition and started receiving opportunities to work in prominent theaters like the St. James's Theatre, Queen's Theatre, Haymarket Theatre, Drury Lane, and the Gaiety Theatre, his confidence would have continued to grow. 4. Conspicuous success in Two Roses: Irving's key success as Digby Grant in James Albery's Two Roses, which ran for 300 nights, would have been a major boost to his confidence, marking him as an accomplished and sought-after actor in the industry. 5. Association with the Lyceum Theatre: His association with the Lyceum Theatre and the subsequent successful run of The Bells, which ran for 150 nights and established him at the forefront of the British drama, would have greatly increased his confidence in his ability to lead and star in successful productions. 6. Playing iconic roles and lifelong friendship with Bram Stoker: Irving's unconventional performance as Hamlet, taking on other iconic roles like Macbeth, Othello, and Richard III, and forming a lifelong friendship with Bram Stoker (who joined him as the company's manager) would have enhanced his confidence in his ability to innovate and excel in his craft. Overall, the growth and accomplishments Sir Henry Irving experienced throughout his career would have significantly bolstered his confidence as an actor and theater producer. His determination, resilience, and talent enabled him to overcome initial challenges, earn recognition, and secure his place in British theater history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Satisfaction Guarantee: Every RC Willey professional works tirelessly to ensure you are completely satisfied with your EXPERIENCE and purchases at RC Willey... We purchased a bedroom set on October 18th and were told by our sales associate, Michael H., that the headboard was back-ordered, but that we would have it before Halloween. It is now November 1st and I have called a number of times to see what the status of our delivery was to only be given very vague answers with no real date to look for. So today we called directly to our associate, Michael H., in hopes that he could get things moving for us. Instead, he let us know that our order may not arrive until late December! When I spoke of my irritation on this, he was rude and boasting that he was right and the fault lies on everyone else... I explained that I would like to cancel my order because we were told that the set would be in our home before Halloween and that date had come and gone. I felt that I had been misled and given false hope of our delivery times by him. He said, no you were not misled...the manufacturer pushed the shipment. I said that I didn't like that he was \\"passing the buck.\\" His response was to tell me he just wanted me to know that I was wrong and to have a nice day. In my opinion, no matter who was at fault for the shipment delay he should have taken the responsibility and apologized. Both my experience with shipment delays and my sales associate have left me with a negative view of RC Willey in general. I can't speak to my purchases because those were never received...

He was brought up as a Roman Catholic, and was educated at Lochaber High School in Fort William. He went on to study for a Master of Arts degree in Politics and Philosophy at the University of Glasgow. At university he became politically active, joining the SDP, as well as the Dialectic Society. On 6 January 2006 Kennedy was informed that ITN would be reporting that he had received treatment for a drinking problem. He decided to pre-empt the broadcast, called a sudden news conference, and made a personal statement that over the past eighteen months he had been coming to terms with a drinking problem, but had sought professional help. He told reporters that recent questions among his colleagues about his suitability as leader were partly as a result of the drinking problem but stated that he had been dry for the past two months and would be calling a leadership contest, in which he would stand, to resolve the issues surrounding his authority once and for all. It was later claimed that the source for ITN's story was his former press secretary turned ITV News correspondent, Daisy McAndrew. The admission of a drinking problem seriously damaged his standing and 25 MPs signed a statement urging him to resign immediately. It was later claimed in a biography of Kennedy by the journalist Greg Hurst that senior Liberal Democrats had known about Kennedy's drinking problem when he was elected as leader in 1999 and had subsequently kept it hidden from the public. On 7 January 2006, Kennedy called another press conference, at which he announced that while he was buoyed by the supportive messages he had received from grass root members, he felt that he could not continue as leader because of the lack of confidence from the Parliamentary party. He said he would not be a candidate in the leadership election and was standing down as leader \\"with immediate effect\\", with Menzies Campbell to act as interim leader until a new leader was elected. He also confirmed in his resignation statement that he did not expect to remain on the Liberal Democrat Frontbench Team. He pledged his loyalty to a new leader as a backbencher, and said he wished to remain active in the party and in politics. Campbell went on to win the resulting leadership election, and Kennedy subsequently gave his successor full public support. His leadership had lasted slightly less than six years and five months. Did he continue to stay in politics?","completion":"Yes, Kennedy continued to stay in politics. After stepping down as the leader of the Liberal Democrat party, he remained an active member of the party and continued to serve as a backbencher, which means he was still a member of the parliament and participated in political activities, but not as a leader or in a prominent position.

Now, Gao has to go to prison for six months and pay a 4,000 yuan fine. Gao is the first star to be punished under China's new drunk driving law. From May 1 on, drunk drivers will pay a fine, and be banned from driving for five years or even forever. Drunk driving has become a serious social problem in China.According to the Ministry of Public Security , police caught more than half a million drunk drivers last year, a 68 % increase from 2009. The new law sees drunk driving as a crime. In the West, drunk driving is also a crime. In the US, for example, if the police catch a drunk driver, the driver will pay a fine, lose his or her license and even go to prison. If the driver wants to drive again, he or she must do public service, and take part in educational programs. You may think: drunk driving is a crime? Isn't this law too unkind?

When teenagers go on a trip in a camper van there are many clichés that you can guarantee will follow. 1)The teenagers will be warned not to go where they are going by a crazy local. Dan Van Husen handles that with ridiculous exposition about deadly Sirens. What, who, how and why are handled in one almost unintelligible burst. 2)The van will break down. 3)Whilst looking for help the group will be split up and be picked off one by one by whatever monster they have been warned about.4)They will find a house inhabited by a madman, he will capture them. 5) The house will have a phone but it will not work, it will be disturbingly decorated, there will be flickering neon light, spiders and maggots. 6)The madman will catch them as they try to escape in a vehicle that won't start (here the high speed getaway was to be made on a tractor). 7)The madman will be seemingly killed only to come back from the dead for a cheap, weak scare and will then be killed properly. 8)Only a girl will be left alive from the group. 9)There will be an unnecessary twist at the end. Add to these elements naked Sirens (who the characters seem to react to in startling different ways despite the fact that everyone that sees them is supposed to fall into lust with them immediately) that seduce and kill the teens, throats being ripped out and bodies being pulled in half and you have something resembling a twelve year old boys dream movie. I think it is only fair to say that my opinion of the director and his previous work is as low as it is possible to be but I am happy to point out that there are a few elements that boarder on pleasurable and are a great improvement on his previous film, Darkhunters, which is one of the worst films I have ever seen. At times the cinematography is very good, the music and editing are a cut above his previous films and some other low budget horror movies. I was impressed to hear that it was achieved with a third of the money spent on the previous monstrosity. However, the worst things about this movie are not to be found in the body of the film, it is ultimately a mildly diverting if pointless movie that has been done time and time again, but amongst the DVD extras. If you do rent this film I implore you to listen to the director's commentary it is beyond belief. There is more to say about this than the film itself. One staggering part of the commentary is the director's claim that the film is cliché leaden because it was a preconceived idea. He says it is a deliberate attempt to use all of the clichés and openly he wonders if \\"people will get it\\". I'm afraid to say that if this is supposed to be a clever nod and a wink to films of the past and the genre clichés within them then it is not wittily scripted enough, acted in an appropriate tone nor directed with enough style to work. If this film was made to order it leads me to ask one question; \\"What was the point?\\" This is s afilm that just slips right into the canon of bad horror movies, any attempt to do something clever or different haven't worked. The next nugget of brilliance is a conversation about the snobbery towards digital film formats. They rightly point out that digital is often synonymous with cheapness and ease of use. However, the best moment of the conversation comes when they bemoan the fact that when Michael Mann makes a film in the format he is branded as a visionary. There is a simple distinction to be made here; Mann is a talented director who will use the format to fit his story and style, Roberts is a horror hack who uses it to produce bottom shelf genre pictures . I think the differences are obvious and the comparison is not only arrogant but redundant. The best moment is reserved for Robert's comments about people who have taken the time to review his previous film. Those who didn't like it are generalised as 'geeks' and he even goes as far as to single out specific people for having the nerve to voice their opinion in forums that encourage them to do just that. I must admit I was slightly disappointed that my review of his last film wasn't singled out for ridicule. The tirade goes further as the group joke about Norwegian reviewers, complete with 'hilarious' accents to imply that people from Norway wouldn't know a good film simply because of where they are born. As always these sorts of comments say more about those saying them than those they are targeting, they simply make the director and his friends look ignorant. The package in rounded out with a tasteful featurette about how the Sirens were cast. Robert's swears blind in voice over, 'I didn't want to make a film that was like Baywatch' as we see audition tapes of topless and naked girls writhing around on the ground. There is also a simpering, self-indulgent documentary about the making of Darkhunters during which Robert's says that a reviewer has claimed that Forest is \\"The best British film in years\\". I don't know who he is trying to convince. At one point in the commentary track Robert's says jokingly \\"I can see people sitting at home saying \\"this isn't amazing, its sht\\" he isn't wrong. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is decidedly negative and highly critical. The reviewer not only finds the film to be clichéd and poorly executed, but they also take issue with the director's comments and attitudes evidenced in the DVD extras, questioning the director's motives and competence. The reviewer suggests that any attempts to make the film clever or different fail, and they express disappointment in the manner in which the film was created and presented.

Article: When my son, Mark, was in the third grade, he saved all his pocket money for over three months to buy holiday presents. The third Saturday in December Mark said he had made his list and had twenty dollars in his pocket. I drove him to a nearby supermarket. Mark picked up a hand basket and went in while I waited and watched in the car. It took Mark over 45 minutes to choose his presents. Finally he came to the checkout counter and reached into his pocket ... Mark stood there holding his basket, tears falling down his face. Then a surprising thing happened. A woman came up to Mark and took him in her arms. \\"You would help me a lot if you let me pay for you,\\" said the woman. \\"It would be the most wonderful gift you could give me. I only ask one day you will pass it on. When you grow up, I would like you to find someone you can help. When you help others, I know you will feel as good about it as I do now.\\" Mark took the money, dried his tears and ran back to the checkout counter as fast as he could. That year we all enjoyed our gifts almost as much as Mark enjoyed giving them to us.

Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Max and Page Conners (Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt) are a mother-daughter con artist team. When the film opens, the Conners are finishing a con on Dean Cumanno (Ray Liotta), an auto-body shop owner and small-time crook. The con, which the Conners have played many times before on other men, involves Max marrying Dean, passing out on their wedding night to avoid consummating the marriage, and then Page (posing as Dean's secretary) luring Dean into a compromising position to justify Max's immediate divorce and hefty settlement. The con is a success.Page declares that she wants to go solo. Max initially relents, but when they go to the bank to split their earnings, they're confronted by an IRS agent (Anne Bancroft) who declares that they owe the government a considerable sum on top of the rest of their savings, which have already been seized. Page reluctantly agrees to work one last con with Max in Palm Beach, to get enough money to pay off the IRS and set Page up to work on her own. For their target, they choose widower William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman), a tobacco baron who is addicted to his own product.While working the main con with Tensy, Page attempts a side con without her mother's knowledge. Page targets beachfront bartender Jack (Jason Lee), who is worth 3 million, but develops genuine feelings for him. Max learns of the side con and tells Page to break the relationship off, which Page does reluctantly.Tensy proposes to Max ahead of schedule, but before they can get married, he accidentally chokes and dies while trying to initiate sex with Max. While Max and Page are deciding what to do with the body, Dean arrives, having tracked Max down to apologize and propose to her again. Dean figures out that Max and Page conned him, and threatens to call the authorities. Max offers to return Dean's divorce settlement money if he'll help them make Tensy's death look like an accident. Max tells Page that their money wasn't really taken by the IRS; the agent was Max's mentor, Barbara, who agreed to help prevent Page from leaving. However, when Max, Page and Dean go to the bank, the money really has gone, having been liquidated in an act of betrayal by Barbara.In order to help Max, Page returns to Jack and accepts his proposal, planning to work it as a regular con. Page insists that Jack will not cheat on her, but is heartbroken when, on their wedding night, she breaks into her mother's room and finds him in a compromising position with Max. After the divorce settlement is paid, Dean confronts Max about the ethics of their con, pointing out that even a \\"goody-goody\\" like Jack is only human. Max reveals that Jack actually turned her down and that she had to drug him, but she defends her actions by saying that Jack would hurt Page eventually. Dean counters that Max has no right to keep Page from the man she loves because of what \\"might\\" happen.Chastened, Max tells Page the truth, admitting that her efforts to protect her daughter have only hurt her in other ways. Page returns to Jack, giving him back the bar he'd had to sell to pay the settlement, and tells him her real name. Max and Dean also get together, Dean having admitted that he still loves Max despite what she put him through.

Translate to English","completion":"The idea suggested is as follows: why not register a new DNS name that would point to an existing server? Registering a new DNS name that points to an existing server can be a beneficial move for various reasons. Here is a detailed and in-depth explanation of the advantages and the process: 1. Advantages: a. Simplified access: A new, more intuitive, and easily memorable DNS name can make it easier for users to access the website or services hosted on the server. This can lead to increased traffic and user engagement. b. Multi-domain setup: It allows for hosting multiple websites or services under different domain names on a single server. This can help businesses maintain diverse brands and cater to varied targeted audiences without the need for additional infrastructure or cost. c. Search engine optimization: A keyword-rich, well-designed domain name can help improve search engine rankings and enhance organic traffic. d. Security: By deploying multiple domain names pointing to the same server, it becomes possible to implement SSL certificates for all domains without the need for additional IP addresses, enhancing security across the board. 2. Procedure: a. Choose and register a domain name: The process begins by selecting a suitable domain name that best represents the purpose and branding of the website or service. Once chosen, it can be registered with a domain registrar. Usually, domain registration comes with an annual fee. b. Update DNS records: After registering the new domain name, you will need to configure its DNS records, including an A record (for IPv4 address) or an AAAA record (for IPv6 address) that points to the server's IP address. This can be done through the domain registrar's control panel or by contacting their support services. c. Configuring the server: To host multiple domain names on an existing server, you must configure the server and the underlying software (such as a web server like Apache or Nginx) to recognize and serve content for the new domain name. This is usually achieved by setting up virtual hosts, which instruct the server to serve different content based on the domain name requested. d. Deploying SSL certificates (optional): If security is a concern, deploying SSL certificates for the newly registered domain is essential. With modern web servers, it is possible to use a single certificate for multiple domain names (SAN or Subject Alternative Name certificates), or use separate SSL certificates for each domain. In conclusion, there are various advantages to registering a new DNS name that points to an existing server, such as simplified access, multi-domain setup, search engine optimization, and enhanced security. To implement this, go through the process of domain registration, updating DNS records, configuring the server, and deploying SSL certificates (if required)."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Gov. Jerry Brown signed six stringent gun-control measures Friday, July 1, 2016, that will require people to turn in high-capacity... (Associated Press) SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California's gun laws, already some of the strictest in the nation, will get even more stringent next year. Gov. Jerry Brown signed onto much of the gun-control agenda advocated by legislative Democrats, who are clamoring to crack down in the wake of high-profile mass shootings including last year's terrorist attack in San Bernardino. The Democratic governor signed six bills Friday requiring gun owners to give up magazines holding more than 10 rounds and to undergo a background check before they can purchase ammunition, among other measures. While he vetoed five bills — including a one-gun-per-month purchase limit — he endorsed the most ambitious pieces of the Legislature's gun control push over the roar of gun-rights advocates frustrated by the increasing weight of restrictions. \\"Independence and freedom and liberty in California has been chopped down at the knees and kicked between the legs,\\" said Sam Paredes, executive director of the advocacy group Gun Owners of California. Brown's actions are consistent with his mixed record on gun control. Some of the enacted bills duplicate provisions of a November ballot measure by Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom. Some of the vetoed measures also appear in Newsom's initiative, giving voters a chance to overturn Brown's veto and protecting the initiative from becoming moot. \\"My goal in signing these bills is to enhance public safety by tightening our existing laws in a responsible and focused manner, while protecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners,\\" Brown wrote in a one-sentence message to lawmakers. The state's move to tighten laws further comes amid years of gridlock at the federal level, which spawned a tense clash in Washington last week as Democrats camped out on the floor of the U.S. House and shouted down Republicans. \\"Strong gun laws work. ... What we're doing in California is a better job of keeping guns out of dangerous hands,\\" said Amanda Wilcox, a spokeswoman for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, whose daughter was killed by a shooter using a high-capacity magazine. Brown's action will require people who own magazines that hold more than 10 rounds to give them up. It extends a 1999 law that made it illegal to buy a high-capacity magazine or to bring one into the state but allowed people who already owned them to keep them. In an attempt to slow gun users from rapidly reloading, the governor signed a bill outlawing new weapons that have a device known as a bullet button. Gun makers developed bullet buttons to get around California's assault weapons ban, which prohibited new rifles with magazines that can be detached without the aid of tools. A bullet button allows a shooter to quickly dislodge the magazine using the tip of a bullet or other small tool. People will be allowed to keep weapons they already own with bullet buttons, which are often referred to as \\"California compliant,\\" but they'll be required to register them. Brown also endorsed a bill requiring ammunition sellers to be licensed, buyers to undergo background checks and transactions to be recorded. It's the Legislature's second attempt to regulate ammunition sales after a judge struck down a 2009 law as too vague. He also opted to require a background check before a gun can be loaned to someone who isn't a family member. The governor vetoed an effort to expand a 6-month-old program that allows courts to temporarily restrict gun ownership rights for people suspected of being dangerous. He decided against restricting all firearm purchases to one per month, a limitation that already applies to handguns. For the third time since 2012, he vetoed a bill requiring gun owners to report a lost or stolen firearm to authorities within five days. \\"I continue to believe that responsible people report the loss or theft of a firearm and irresponsible people do not; it is not likely that this bill would change that,\\" he wrote in a veto message. California is one of six states to get the highest grade from the pro-gun control Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. ___ Associated Press writer Don Thompson contributed to this report. ||||| Fairfax, Va.— California Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law on Friday a package of gun bills that were rushed through the state legislature with no regard for proper process. The National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA) released the following statement in reaction: “Gov. Jerry Brown today signed a draconian gun control package that turns California’s law-abiding gun owners into second-class citizens. The governor and legislature exploited a terrorist attack to push these measures through even though the state’s already restrictive laws did nothing to stop the attack in San Bernadino,\\" said Amy Hunter, California spokesperson for NRA-ILA. \\"These bills make no one safer, they only add another layer of laws that criminals will continue to break. The National Rifle Association is prepared to pursue all options moving forward – legal, legislative and political.” Here's a summary of Brown's actions: SIGNED BOTH- Assembly Bill 1135 and Senate Bill 880 would make changes of monumental scale to California’s firearm laws by reclassifying hundreds of thousands of legally owned semi-automatic rifles as “assault weapons.” This legislation effectively outlaws magazine locking devices, more commonly known as “bullet buttons”.These areconstitutionally protected firearms that have no association with crime. These changes would happen quickly with great individual costs to many gun owners and without public notice. Governor Brown vetoed similar legislation in 2013. SIGNED Assembly Bill 1511 would effectively end the long-standing practice of temporarily loaning a firearm for lawful purposes. Under this legislation the ability to loan a firearm to anyone other than a family member would now be prohibited unless conducted through a dealer, absent very narrow and limited exceptions. A simple loan to a trusted friend for a few days would take almost a month to complete from loan to return, requiring two background checks, two 10 day waiting periods, two fees and multiple trips to a gun dealer. The result of the misguided legislation would turn otherwise law-abiding citizens into criminals simply for borrowing or storing a firearm with a friend. VETO - Assembly Bill 1673 would expand the definition of “firearm” to include unfinished frames and/or receivers that are “clearly identifiable as being used exclusively as part of a functional weapon”. Depending on how this vague terminology is interpreted, AB 1673 could essentially treat pieces of metal as firearms, subjecting them to California’s exhaustive regulations and restrictions currently applicable to firearms. VETO - Assembly Bill 1674 would expand the existing one handgun a month law to include ALL guns, including those acquired through a private party transfer. AB 1674 will have no impact on criminal access to firearms and instead significantly hamper law abiding individuals, causing increased costs, time and paperwork to purchase multiple firearms. Criminals will continue to ignore this law purchasing firearms illegally, ignoring this burdensome and ineffective restriction. SIGNED - Assembly Bill 1695 would create a 10-year firearm prohibition for someone convicted of falsely reporting a lost or stolen firearm. The NRA does not oppose making it a misdemeanor to knowingly file a false lost or stolen report to law enforcement. Our reason for opposition is related to the restriction of a constitutional right for the conviction of a misdemeanor offense. VETO - Assembly Bill 2607 would expand the class of individuals who could seek a Gun Violence Restraining Order (GVRO).” The NRA opposes the current GVRO procedures because they provide a mechanism for an individual to lose the right to keep and bear arms with no due process of law. AB 2607 would compound these problems by significantly expanding the classes of individuals who could seek a GVRO. This expansion would now include employers, coworkers, mental health workers and employees of secondary and postsecondary schools. VETO - Senate Bill 894 would require a victim of a crime to report to local Law Enforcement the theft of a firearm within an arbitrary time requirement of five days and the recovery of the firearm within 48 hours. Governor Brown has twice vetoed similar legislation stating, “I was not convinced that criminalizing the failure to report a lost or stolen firearm would improve identification of gun traffickers or help law enforcement disarm people prohibited from possessing guns. I continue to believe that responsible people report the loss or theft of a firearm and irresponsible people do not.” SIGNED - Senate Bill 1235 would place unjustified and burdensome restrictions on the purchase of ammunition and would require the attorney general to keep records of purchases. This legislation would further require any online ammunition sales to be conducted through a licensed vendor. First and foremost, the reporting of ammunition sales has already been tried -- and failed -- at the federal level. Throughout the 1980s, Congress considered repeal of a federal ammunition regulation package that required, among other things, reporting of ammunition sales. In 1986, the director of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms supported eliminating the reporting requirement, stating: \\"The Bureau and the [Treasury] Department have recognized that current record keeping requirements for ammunition have no substantial law enforcement value.\\" As a result, the Firearms Owners Protection Act of 1986 repealed the ammunition restrictions, with little opposition to the removal of that requirement. SB 1235 will similarly fail to reduce violent crime, as a law requiring the registration of ammunition purchases by honest citizens will not deter criminals. Governor Brown has twice vetoed similar legislation. SIGNED - Senate Bill 1446 would ban the simple possession of ammunition feeding devices/magazines that are capable of holding more than 10 cartridges. The federal “large-ammunition feeding device” ban of 1994-2004 was allowed to sunset due in part to its ineffectiveness. Yet, California anti-gun legislators still are persisting with this ban knowing that the congressionally-mandated study concluded that “the banned guns were never used in more than a modest fraction of all gun murders” before the ban and the bans 10-round limit on new magazines was not a factor in multiple-victim or multiple-wound crimes. ||||| Gov.

Jerry Brown signs 6 gun-control bills, vetoes 5 1 / 12 Back to Gallery SACRAMENTO — It will soon be harder to buy ammunition in California and illegal to own magazine clips that hold more than 10 rounds under a suite of gun-control bills Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law on Friday. Brown signed six bills and vetoed five, actions that will nonetheless build upon the state’s arsenal of gun control laws aimed at curtailing mass shootings and keeping weapons and ammunition away from the wrong people. California already has the strictest gun laws in the nation. Many of the 11 gun bills that landed on the governor’s desk this week were crafted in response to the mass shooting in San Bernardino in December, and got a boost of urgency following the mass shooting in an Orlando nightclub last month. The new laws include SB880 by Sen. Isadore Hall III, D-Compton (Los Angeles County), and Sen. Steve Glazer, D-Orinda, which expands the definition of assault weapon to include specified guns with military-style features capable of accepting any type of detachable magazine. Another bill signed by the governor bans so-called “bullet buttons,” a tool developed by gun manufacturers that allows magazines to easily detach for rapid replacement. Brown also signed SB1446 by Sen. Loni Hancock, D-Berkeley, which makes it illegal to possess magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. The sale or manufacturing of large-capacity magazines was already illegal in the state. Among the vetoes was the only bill with bipartisan support, AB1176, which would have authorized a ballot measure asking voters to make it a felony to steal a gun or buy a stolen gun, regardless of its value. The new restrictions led by California’s Democratic-controlled Legislature come on the heels of gridlock over gun control laws in Congress, where House Democrats staged a sit-in to protest last month. “My goal in signing these bills is to enhance public safety by tightening our existing laws in a responsible and focused manner, while protecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners,” Brown said in a signing message Friday. All of the bills except AB1176 were opposed by Republicans and gun rights advocates. “These are constitutionally illegitimate laws passed by a patently illegitimate government that had the audacity to attack and criminalize millions of its own people in Stalin-esque fashion,” said Brandon Combs, president of the Firearms Policy Coalition, a gun rights group. Whether Californians want the state’s gun-control laws to go further will be left to voters in the fall. Brown said he vetoed AB1176, the gun-theft felony bill, because it is nearly identical to parts of Proposition 63, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s “Safety for All” ballot initiative, which will appear on the November ballot. But the governor signed SB1235, the ammunition background check bill, which also overlapped with Newsom’s ballot measure. SB1235 requires background checks for people buying ammunition, a license for people selling bullets and purchasing data submitted to the state Department of Justice. Newsom’s measure also requires background checks, vendor licensing and data sharing on ammunition purchases, although regulated differently. Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León, D-Los Angeles, urged Newsom to withdraw his measure while the Legislature worked to pass the gun control legislation. Newsom declined before Thursday’s deadline to remove measures from the fall ballot. De León’s ammunition bill, SB1235, however, was amended recently so that if signed by the governor, as it was Friday, parts of it would supersede Newsom’s ammunition proposal should voters approve it. Newsom’s ballot measure still contains several gun control provisions that the gun lobby is fighting, including requiring gun owners to report when their firearm is lost or stolen. “Voters will finally have a chance to take matters into their own hands and keep the momentum going with bold reforms that build on these achievements and go well beyond,” Newsom said in a statement.

Here's how the law works. Photo: Reuters As the nation is again plunged into a debate about gun violence after the Orlando massacre, authorities in California are using a new law designed to prevent the next mass shooting by temporarily confiscating guns from people considered a danger to themselves or others. California, which already has some of the toughest gun restrictions in the nation, this week moved forward with a sweeping new package of gun control laws that underscores the power of the Democratically controlled state to carve its own path on the issue.... ||||| “It is really far-reaching and bold, and really has the potential to save a lot of lives,” Ms. Wilcox said. “It can give us a handle on who has illegal guns in the state, as well as limiting access to ammunition by dangerous people who may have illegal guns.” The new laws would prohibit the possession of high-capacity magazines — those holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition — for assault weapons. “These so-called high-capacity magazines are not for target shooting or hunting,” said Senator Loni Hancock, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. “Their sole purpose is to kill as many people as possible in the shortest period of time.” A separate bill banned semiautomatic weapons with “bullet buttons,” which make it easy to quickly remove a magazine and replace it with another. Among the bills Mr. Brown vetoed was one that would have expanded the definition of a firearm. “While I appreciate the author’s intent, the actual wording of the bill is unduly vague and could have far-reaching and unintended consequences,” Mr. Brown wrote in his veto message. Shannon Grove, a Republican Assembly member who spoke out against the bills during the debate, said that none of those signed would reduce gun violence or prevent mass shootings. Instead, she said, the restrictions compromised the rights of California families to protect themselves. “I think it’s death by 1,000 paper cuts for our Second Amendment rights,” she said. “Nowhere in this nation do you give up your rights under any other amendments.” The signing was not the end of gun control measures that might be enacted here in the wake of a wave of violence that has traumatized the world and the nation, including the shooting in San Bernardino that killed 14 people at a holiday party in December. A separate set of gun control measures will appear before voters in November; some of them have been passed by the Legislature, but Mr. Brown vetoed those, saying they should be left to voters to decide. ||||| The carnage in Orlando on June 12 left Americans feeling helpless. And so it makes sense that many took heart in the Congressional push for gun control legislation that happened in the immediate aftermath. In light of shooter Omar Mateen’s potential ties to terrorism, Democratic politicians quickly jumped on a loophole that allows Americans on terrorist watch lists to buy guns. Connecticut senator Chris Murphy spent 14 hours leading a filibuster calling for an end to this loophole on June 15. When the Senate failed to pass any laws that might address the problem, House Democrats staged an old-school sit-in for 26 more hours. It was all very dramatic. I appreciate their efforts. But such piecemeal measures offer very little in terms of real policy. The fact is that we need fewer guns in the United States. We need to stop selling assault rifles. And if there no way to do this in a way that satisfies constitutional scholars, we need to change the Second Amendment. As my colleague Tim Fernholz noted earlier this week, lost in the chaos and rhetoric of the Orlando massacre is the fact that terror watch lists are ineffective, potentially discriminatory and almost certainly unconstitutional. “It may seem easier to let a secret court assess who should have these military weapons than to convince society to ban them entirely,” Fernholz wrote. “But rarely do such measures come without unintended consequences. And these proposed policies leverage the same politics of fear that many in the US came to regret after 9/11.” What watchlist were these guys on? pic.twitter.com/cOoJI6WRwu — Imraan Siddiqi (@imraansiddiqi) June 23, 2016 It’s also worth asking why we’re pouring so much energy into what is ultimately a minor change. If it is this hard to try and get Congress to vote on a potentially ineffective bill, how will they ever push through meaningful reforms? The National Rifle Association (NRA) has backed US politicians into a corner, spending millions to keep them in office—and in the pocket of the gun lobby. Meanwhile, the country remains loyal to a flawed, centuries-old piece of parchment written by a bunch of white men who didn’t believe women should have the right to vote and who thought that slavery was an economic necessity. There is nothing sacrosanct about our founding fathers. In the past decade alone, thousands of American lives have been lost to guns because of the way some legal scholars interpreted a comma. It wasn’t always this way. As reported by Politico, “From 1888, when law review articles first were indexed, through 1959, every single one on the Second Amendment concluded it did not guarantee an individual right to a gun.” Rather, the amendment was interpreted as a rather dated measure meant to protect state militias prevalent during the 18th century. Thousands of American lives have been lost because of the way legal scholars interpreted a comma. What changed? A shift in NRA leadership lead to an aggressive lobbying effort meant to expand Second Amendment protections. Gun control guidelines were targeted and the “well regulated militia” aspect of the amendment was de facto erased. Now the Constitution, much like the Bible–another flawed text used for centuries as a tool of oppression and tyranny–has become a crutch for lazy leadership and moral ambiguity. It’s an excuse for cowards to masquerade as patriots. Today, the NRA treats personal gun ownership as an inviolable right, regardless of its function or purpose. No matter that, in the case of semiautomatic assault rifles, one person’s cool toy is also the the killing tool of choice for mass murderers. Which brings me back to Orlando. The past two weeks have not been easy for members of the LGBT community. Heading into the final days of Pride month, the mood remains somber as we remember the members of our queer family who can no longer celebrate with us. We still do not know what exactly motivated the shooter. We do not know if he was, in fact, tied to any Islamist terror organizations even as he pledged his allegiance to them. We do not know if he was motivated instead by inner demons or mental illness or a tortured relationship with his own sexuality. What we do know is that a man who was born in the US walked into a gun store near his home in St. Lucie and legally purchased a Sig Sauer .223 caliber assault rifle, a Glock 17, and multiple magazines and rounds of ammunitions. The Constitution, much like the Bible, has become a crutch for lazy leadership and moral ambiguity All told, he made three trips to the store, ultimately coming away with semiautomatic weaponry designed specifically so that special forces personnel could kill the most people in the quickest amount of time. (Bonus: assault-style rifles are super manly.) Of course, Mateen was no soldier. The blood that covered the floor of the gay club that night was the blood of men and women mowed down by a rifle firing over 40 rounds per minute. His victim never had a chance. The worst nightmare of gun rights advocates is an apocalyptic scenario in which president Barack Obama personally arrives at their doors and takes away their legally purchased guns. The idea that the government wants to run roughshod over the Second Amendment is repeated over and over in order to drum up conservative hysteria. It’s also a lie—Obama has never expressed any interest in anything remotely resembling gun confiscation. But maybe he should. Because if we really wanted to honor the memories of the 49 people murdered in Orlando, we wouldn’t be talking about watch lists and waiting periods. We would be talking about decreasing America’s massive gun surplus. Yes, maybe the government should come for some of our guns. Or at the very least, maybe the government should be finding ways to limit the number of civilians allowed to own highly lethal killing machines. According to the NRA’s own blog, the assault-style AR-15 is the most popular rifle in the US. We are a nation drunk on our own gun-loving self-righteousness. It’s so popular that an estimated nine million people owned one in 2014, a number that has undoubtedly risen in the past two years as Americans rush to gun stores in the wake of every mass shooting. The cycle of violence is perpetuated by our cycle of gun purchases. This isn’t a problem that can be solved simply by closing loopholes. We are a nation drunk on our own gun-loving self-righteousness. We are a nation so delusional that the murdering of children seems like an acceptable price to pay for the contents of your neighbor’s gun safe. To be clear, I know plenty of responsible gun owners. I want hunters to be able to hunt—but not with semiautomatic weapons. And I would like people who enjoy a little target practice to be able to do so at to their local firing range—but not with semiautomatic weapons. If you want to fire 43 bullets a minute, join the military. The Constitution is supposed to protect Americans’ right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. But right now, the Second Amendment ensures that killers have the right to end the lives of innocents in movie theaters, shopping malls, elementary schools and now gay bars. Orlando was a reminder that LGBT Americans have never really felt safe in America, but honestly, straight Americans shouldn’t really feel safe in America either. Not if we continue to interpret (or misinterpret) the Second Amendment. Of course, changing the rules would be difficult. A constitutional amendment clarifying the Second Amendment would require a massive plurality in Congress, and it would then need to be ratified by three-quarters of US state legislatures. But seeing as incremental gun control reform hasn’t been working, our options seem increasingly limited. We can choose to resign ourselves to a future of endless and unnecessary bloodshed. Or we can finally accept that our right to bear unlimited arms matters less than our right to live free from the constant fear of gun violence.

The so-called \\"bullet button loophole\\" in the state's assault-weapon ban will close, the state will regulate sales of ammunition and owners of magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition must sell them or turn them into the state. These gun restrictions are contained in legislation signed Friday by California Gov. Jerry Brown. In all, the Democratic governor signed six of the 11 gun-related bills that landed on his desk the day before following a series of votes in the State Senate and Assembly. The signings make California's already strict gun laws more so, and follow last year's terrorist attack in San Bernardino. In a statement, Brown said signing the legislation will \\"enhance public safety by tightening our existing laws in a responsible & focused manner while protecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners.\\" AB 1135 and SB 880 close the \\"bullet button loophole.\\" The loophole refers to the sale of \\"California legal\\" firearms that don't fall under California's ban of guns with detachable magazines. To comply with the law, manufacturers created versions of firearms that feature a button that can be pushed with a small tool — for instance the tip of a bullet — to release an empty magazine and insert a new one. This isn't the first time Brown has faced a decision to ban firearms with a bullet button. In October 2013 he vetoed similar legislation saying it was too far-reaching. Under SB 1235 anyone purchasing ammunition would be subject to a driver's license check, which would then be sent to the Department of Justice after the purchase. Capitol Public Radio's Ben Adler reports this bill would take precedence should a gun control initiative on the November ballot be approved by voters. Reports Adler: The bill has also exposed tension between its author, Senate Leader Kevin de León and Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom, who are both Democrats. Newsom has qualified a gun control initiative for the November ballot, which would regulate ammunition sales, as well as adopting similar provisions to other bills voted on Thursday. De León had asked Newsom to hold the initiative off the ballot, if the bills pass, while Newsom has refused. The two measures address background checks differently. The Newsom initiative would require buyers to obtain permits, similar to firearms permits, while De León’s bill would require a driver’s license check, which is then sent to the Department of Justice after the purchase. Legislators established the \\"assault weapon\\" as a new classification of firearm in 1989. Following a court challenge in 2000, the law was upheld. Gun owners could keep their assault weapons provided they registered with the state before Jan. 23, 2001. Below is an overview of the actions Brown took related to firearms legislation. ||||| \\"By acting within 24 hours after being sent these bills, and not allowing the public to voice their opinions in order to depart for his European vacation, the governor compounded the miscarriage of legislative process and procedure while demonstrating disdain for Californians who now face laws that clearly infringe on their constitutional rights,\\" the group said in a statement. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"California Governor, Jerry Brown, has signed a series of gun control bills that will tighten several gun laws in the state. Some of the new changes include a requirement for gun owners to give up magazines holding more than 10 rounds and to undergo a background check before being allowed to purchase ammunition. The new bills extend a 1999 law which made it illegal to buy a high-capacity magazine or bring one into the state, but allowed people who already owned them to keep them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the 14th century, these dialects came to be collectively known as the \\"langues d'oïl\\", contrasting with the \\"langue d'oc\\" or Occitan language in the south of France. The mid-14th century is taken as the transitional period to Middle French, the language of the French Renaissance, specifically based on the dialect of the Île-de-France region. - Emperor Seinei ( Seinei - tenn ) was the 22nd emperor of Japan , according to the traditional order of succession . No firm dates can be assigned to this emperor 's life or reign , but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 480 -- 484 . - Empress dowager (also dowager empress or empress mother) is the English language translation of the title given to the mother of a Chinese, Japanese, Korean or Vietnamese emperor. - An empire is defined as \\"an aggregate of nations or people ruled over by an emperor or other powerful sovereign or government, usually a territory of greater extent than a kingdom, as the former British Empire, French Empire, Brazilian Empire, Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, Byzantine Empire or Roman Empire.\\" An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or of territories far remote from the homeland, such as a colonial empire. - An emperor (through Old French \\"empereor\\" from ) is a monarch, usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm. Empress, the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife (\\"empress consort\\"), mother (\\"empress dowager\\"), or a woman who rules in her own right (\\"empress regnant\\"). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings. In Europe the title of Emperor was, since the Middle Ages, considered equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope, due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of Western Europe. The Emperor of Japan is the only currently reigning monarch whose title is translated into English as \\"Emperor\\". - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Honour (also honor in American English, see spelling differences) is an abstract concept entailing a perceived quality of worthiness and respectability that affects both the social standing and the self-evaluation of an individual or corporate body such as a family, school, regiment or nation. Accordingly, individuals (or corporate bodies) are assigned worth and stature based on the harmony of their actions with a specific code of honour, and the moral code of the society at large.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence: \\"I sent money.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","completion":"Yes, a linguist would generally consider the sentence \\"I sent money.\\" to be acceptable linguistically. It is a grammatically correct, concise, and clear sentence that effectively conveys the main action and subject involved. Here's a detailed explanation of why it is an acceptable sentence from a linguistic standpoint, broken down into several linguistic components: 1. Syntax: Syntax refers to the rules governing the arrangement of words in a sentence to form grammatical constructions. \\"I sent money.\\" follows standard English syntax, which follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order. In this sentence, this order is correctly applied with \\"I\\" as the subject, \\"sent\\" as the verb, and \\"money\\" as the object. 2. Grammar: Grammar encompasses the rules dictating how words and phrases interact within a sentence. The sentence \\"I sent money.\\" demonstrates correct grammar, as it uses a subject pronoun \\"I,\\" followed by a correctly conjugated past tense verb \\"sent,\\" and finally a noun, \\"money,\\" to function as the direct object of the sentence. 3. Semantics: Semantics deals with meaning conveyed by a sentence. The sentence \\"I sent money.\\" is semantically appropriate since it presents comprehensible meaning as it indicates that the speaker performed the action of sending money. All the elements in the sentence work together to convey a complete thought. 4. Pragmatics: Pragmatics is concerned with how language is used in context and the impact of context on meaning. Though the context is not provided in the task, the sentence \\"I sent money.\\" in isolation can still be considered pragmatically acceptable from a linguist's perspective. In different contexts, the sentence could provide relevant information about a past action taken or state a reason for the current financial situation. 5. Morphology: Morphology deals with the internal structure of words and the way words are formed. In the sentence \\"I sent money,\\" the words are morphologically correct and appropriately chosen. The verb \\"sent\\" is the past tense form of the verb \\"send,\\" which is correctly used to indicate a completed action in the past. Similarly, \\"money\\" is a singular, non-countable noun that appropriately represents the object in question. In conclusion, from a linguistic standpoint, the sentence \\"I sent money.\\" demonstrates several essential components of language, such as syntax, grammar, semantics, pragmatics, and morphology. Therefore, a linguist would rate this sentence as being linguistically acceptable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A studyhas shown that people tend to believe that organic foods contain fewer calories, so buy and eat more. But people who decide to \\"go organic\\" could soon find themselves piling on the pounds. The warning comes from American researchers who studied whether the sight of an organic label was enough to influence a person's choice. For example, if people believe organic foods, produced without using pesticides and artificial fertilizers , have fewer calories, they may end up eating far too much and spending less time on sports activities and put on weight. Cornell University researchers said: \\" Some people mistakenly think that these foods are more nutritious , just because they carry an organic label.\\" \\"The growing popularity of organic foods has led to some concern, as these foods may not necessarily be healthier than non-organic ones, but still may lead consumers to nutritional mis-judgments. If people feel a food to be more nutritious, they tend to let their guard down when it comes to counting calories---in the end leading them to overeat.\\" Although a small number of differences in nutrient content were found to exist between organically-produced crops and traditionally-produced ones, these are of little health importance. It shows that there is no proof to support the choice of organically over traditionally-produced foods because of nutritional advantage. Question: Which of the following is TRUE?

When your city has an unenviable reputation for insulting tourists and fleecing them for every cent, inviting hotel guests to pay what they want could be a risky move. That's the experiment being tested by several hotels in the French capital during the height of the summer season. \\"It's something like a trust contract between the client and the hotel,\\" says Aldric Duval, who came up with the \\"Payez ce que vous voulez\\" (Pay what you want) concept as a gimmick to promote Tour d'Auvergne, his three-star hotel in the city's Opera district.

If guests decide their stay is barely worth a dollar -- or euro, this being","completion":"Paris -- the hotel owners could be left heavily out of pocket. On the other hand, if the scheme successfully builds trust between the hoteliers and their clientele, it could lead to an increase in customer satisfaction and positive word of mouth, resulting in a long-term boost to business. As the trial period came to an end, the participating hotel owners anxiously awaited the result of the daring initiative. To their surprise and relief, the majority of guests had paid fairly, close to, if not higher than the regular room rates. Many visitors, appreciative of flexible pricing and the trust placed in them, left glowing reviews online, praising the hotel staff, the service, and the unique experience. At the same time, it seemed that the \\"Pay what you want\\" model had brought about a sense of accountability among the participating hotels. Knowing that their earnings would be directly linked to guests' satisfaction, the staff became more diligent, paying attention to the tiniest details. Consequently, service standards improved noticeably, further enhancing the visitors' perception of worth. Another unexpected outcome was the increased attention that the hotels received from local and international media. Inquiries flooded in from prospective guests, intrigued by the concept. Moreover, the \\"Pay what you want\\" movement became the talk of the tourists, with many seeking out the hotels to see what the hype was all about. As positive responses and reviews poured in, the hotel owners decided to extend the trial period, with some even contemplating making the pricing model a permanent fixture. Inspired by the success of the pilot program, other establishments in Paris began to consider adopting the concept as well, with restaurants, museums, and more joining the initiative. In an effort to rebrand Paris as a city that values its visitors and trusts their judgment, the local government acknowledged the success of the campaign and encouraged businesses across the hospitality sector to consider implementing similar or complementary strategies. Ultimately, the bold experiment by the five hotels achieved more than its initial goal of promoting a single establishment; it revitalized the city's image and strengthened its bond with the tourists. Gone were the days when visitors dreaded encountering rude staff and overpriced services. By taking a leap of faith, the Parisian hospitality industry managed to turn its reputation around, demonstrating the potential power of trust and transparency in the service sector, leaving a lasting positive impact on the city."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Chandni Chowk to China Context: This article needs an improved plot summary. (November 2015) Sidhu (Akshay Kumar) is a lowly vegetable cutter at a roadside food stall in the Chandni Chowk section of Delhi, who consults astrologers, tarot card readers, and fake fakirs despite his foster father Dada's (Mithun Chakraborty) exhortations. When two strangers from China claim him as a reincarnation of war hero 'Liu Shen' and take him to China, Sidhu, encouraged by trickster Chopstick (Ranvir Shorey), believes he will be feted as a hero, unaware of his own recruitment to assassinate the smuggler Hojo (Gordon Liu). Sidhu travels to China with Chopstick. Along the way he meets Sakhi (Deepika Padukone), the Indian-Chinese spokesmodel known as Ms. Tele Shoppers Media, or Ms. TSM, who also appears in China. Her twin sister Suzy, known as the femme fatale Meow Meow, works for Hojo, not knowing Hojo tried to kill her father, Inspector Chiang (Roger Yuan). Sidhu, through a series of accidents, initially eludes Hojo, but Hojo eventually exposes him as a fraud. Thereupon Hojo kills Dada, and Sidhu is beaten and urinated on by Hojo. Injured and disgraced Sidhu vows revenge. He thereafter encounters an amnesiac vagrant, whom he later identifies to Sakhi as Inspector Chiang. Chiang later recovers his memory and trains Sidhu in kung fu. When Hojo again meets with Sidhu, Suzy injures Chiang; but upon seeing Sakhi, betrays Hojo. Sidhu fights Hojo in single combat, eventually using a modified vegetable-cutting technique to overwhelm him. In the aftermath, Sidhu opens a vegetable stall in China, but is recruited to fight for some African pygmies. The film thereupon concludes with the announcement \\"To be Continued â Chandni Chowk to Africa\\".

Article: If you are really interested in music festivals, then you have probably heard of the Bestival Music Festival. It takes place every September on the Isle of Wight, the UK. As it is at the end of summer, people think it's their last chance to go to a festival and have fun before going back to boring work. The dream begins as soon as you start traveling to the island. In order to get to the campsite of the Bestival, you have to take the ferry . The ferry is full of happy festival lovers who are ready to take part in the fantastic music party. After you arrive at the campsite, you can put your tent up. There people talk with each other openly. They are not that cold like those you meet in your everyday life. The festival lasts for four days. During that time you forget all your worries and problems, just like living in a dream. And it is really hard for you to come back to \\"reality\\" after that. It seems that it is this kind of music event that makes people gather together. It gives people a real sense of unity. I took part in the Bestival with my friends the year before last. It was so exciting and we all lost ourselves in the beautiful music. We are family sung by Sister Sledge was my favorite. I'm really looking forward to joining in it for a second time. Question: What does the writer think of the people at the Bestival? - Crazy. - Friendly. - Cold. - Patient. Answer:","completion":"The writer thinks that the people at the Bestival are friendly. Evidence to this is found in the article where the writer mentioned that, at the campsite, people talk with each other openly. They suggest that attendees are not as \\"cold\\" as those they encounter in their everyday life, implying a more approachable, open, and friendly atmosphere at the Bestival. The writer does not use the terms \\"crazy\\", \\"cold\\", or \\"patient\\" to describe the attendees. This friendly environment enables festival attendees to forget all their worries and problems, furthering the notion of unity and relaxation during the event. Furthermore, the writer's expression of desire to return to the festival in the future also suggests a positive experience with the other festival-goers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Collins introduced himself to the modern Barnabas Collins family as a cousin from England , a hard-working businessman who was never seen during the day . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Yes, these two sentences are paraphrases of each other, despite some minor differences in structure and word choice. Both sentences convey similar information about a character named Barnabas Collins who introduces himself to the modern Collins family as a cousin from England. Additionally, both sentences describe this character as a hard-working businessman who is never seen during the day. The information and overall meaning communicated by the two sentences are, therefore, essentially the same. However, it is worth noting that there are some differences in structure and word choice between the two sentences. In the first sentence, the subject and object positions are 'Barnabas Collins' and 'the modern Collins family,' respectively, which is a slightly more natural phrasing in English. In the second sentence, these positions are inverted so that 'Collins' (presumably referring to Barnabas Collins) and 'the modern Barnabas Collins family' occupy the subject and object positions. This creates some awkwardness in the structure, but it does not change the overall meaning. Moreover, there are minor differences in word selection and order. The first sentence utilizes the phrase \\"a hard-working businessman,\\" whereas the second sentence uses \\"a hard-working businessman who was never seen during the day.\\" Although the second sentence adds the past tense verb \\"was\\" before \\"never seen,\\" the intended meaning remains consistent—that Barnabas Collins never appeared during daytime. In conclusion, the two sentences can be considered paraphrases since they both convey the same information about Barnabas Collins introducing himself to the modern Collins family and describing himself as a hard-working businessman. Although there are minor differences in structure, word choice, and phrasing, the overall meaning remains consistent between the two sentences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

WASHINGTON — Republicans in the U.S. House of Representative plan to hold a vote next week on an immigration bill despite Trump urging them Friday to abandon efforts to pass legislation until after the mid-term elections. Even if the Republicans — who have a majority in both the House and Senate — approve a bill, it faces almost certain defeat in the upper chamber where Democrats hold enough seats to prevent Republicans, even if they all vote together, from reaching the 60 votes needed for passage. Earlier in the week, the president had called for Congress to quickly approve sweeping immigration legislation. But in a Friday tweet the president said, \\"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November.

To begin, we can combine the terms with y to simplify the equation as follows: (17y + 2y) + 76 = 0 19y + 76 = 0 Now, our goal is to isolate the term with y (in this case, 19y) and find the value of y that satisfies the equation. We can achieve this by performing the following steps: 1. Subtract 76 from both sides of the equation to move the constant term to the right side: 19y = -76 2. To find the value of y, we need to isolate y by dividing both sides of the equation by 19 (since 19 is the coefficient of y): 19y / 19 = -76 / 19 y = -4 Now that we have found the value of y that satisfies the equation, we can conclude that: y = -4 To confirm that our solution is correct, we can substitute the value of y back into the original equation: 17(-4) + 2(-4) + 76 -68 - 8 + 76 8 - 8 0 Since the equation equals zero, our solution of y = -4 is correct."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Students in Enlightenment universities and academies were taught these subjects to prepare them for careers as diverse as medicine and theology.

However, since you requested a detailed and lengthy answer, let us discuss the Finnish language and how negation works in it a bit more. Finnish belongs to the Uralic language family and is mainly spoken in Finland and some parts of Sweden and Norway. It is an agglutinative language, meaning that it often forms words by combining multiple smaller components called morphemes. Unlike English, where the negation is generally formed by adding words like \\"not\\" or \\"no\\" to the sentence, Finnish uses a different negation system. In Finnish, the negation is expressed through the negative verb \\"ei\\" (no), which needs to agree with the subject in person and number. For example: - Minä en (1st person singular). \\"I don't\\" in English. - Sinä et (2nd person singular). \\"You don't\\" in English. - Hän ei (3rd person singular). \\"He/She doesn't\\" in English. - Me emme (1st person plural). \\"We don't\\" in English. - Te ette (2nd person plural). \\"You (plural) don't\\" or \\"You (formal) don't\\" in English. - He eivät (3rd person plural). \\"They don't\\" in English. Furthermore, negation can also be expressed through other means, such as adjectives or adverbs that carry a negative meaning. For example, \\"ei koskaan\\" (never), \\"ei mitään\\" (nothing), and \\"ei kukaan\\" (nobody). In conclusion, the Finnish language uses a negative verb system to express negation, which contrasts with the English method of adding words like \\"not\\" or \\"no.\\" The direct translation of \\"no\\" in Finnish is \\"ei,\\" which is the 3rd person singular negative verb form."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is San Diego is a sanctuary city, however, San Diego County is a participant of the Secure Communities program. a good answer to this question?","completion":"The answer you provided does not directly answer the question asked. The question asks about the number of employees in San Diego for every 137 residents, which is unrelated to San Diego being a sanctuary city or the participation in the Secure Communities program. To answer the question, we need data on the city's population and labor force. According to the United States Census Bureau, the population of San Diego in 2019 was estimated to be around 1,423,851. In order to determine the number of employees for every 137 residents, we have to look into the labor force statistics. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2019, the civilian labor force in San Diego was around 776,157. This figure includes both the employed and unemployed members of the labor force. To calculate the employed portion of the labor force, we need to consider the unemployment rate in 2019. Data from the same source shows that the unemployment rate in 2019 in San Diego was 3.1%. Using this information, we can calculate the number of employed workers in San Diego in 2019: Employed workers = Total labor force × (1 - Unemployment rate) Employed workers = 776,157 × (1 - 0.031) Employed workers ≈ 751,482 Now, we can find the ratio of employed workers to the total population of San Diego: Employment ratio = (Number of employed workers) / (Population) Employment ratio ≈ 751,482 / 1,423,851 Employment ratio ≈ 0.5275 In other words, for every resident of San Diego, about 0.5275 of them were employed in 2019. To find the number of employed workers for every 137 residents, we can multiply this ratio by 137: Number of employed workers for every 137 residents = 0.5275 × 137 Number of employed workers for every 137 residents ≈ 72.27 So, in summary, for every 137 residents in San Diego, there were approximately 72 employees in 2019. To answer the original question, it would be more appropriate to provide this information, as it is more relevant to the context of the question than discussing the city's status as a sanctuary city and its participation in the Secure Communities program."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, this does not necessarily mean he is openly rude to her. The key difference lies in the words \\"subtly\\" and \\"openly.\\" When someone is subtly menacing, they express an intention to cause harm or discomfort to another, but do so in an indirect, understated manner. This can include using implicit threats, discreet body language, or non-verbal cues that convey hostility towards the other person. This form of communication is not direct, explicit, and can be unclear to anyone observing the interaction without a deep understanding of the context or the individuals involved. On the other hand, being openly rude refers to a more overt form of hostility towards another person. This involves explicitly belittling, insulting, or mocking someone without any attempt to conceal the intent behind the words or actions. Being openly rude leaves little doubt about the hostility and is very clear to anyone witnessing the interaction. Based on the original phrase, it is clear that the man is being subtly menacing in response to her objection. There is no mention or evidence to suggest that he is openly rude to her.

Article: However, asymmetry of causation can be observed in a non-arbitrary way which is not metaphysical in the case of a human hand dropping a cup of water which smashes into fragments on a hard floor, spilling the liquid. In this order, the causes of the resultant pattern of cup fragments and water spill is easily attributable in terms of the trajectory of the cup, irregularities in its structure, angle of its impact on the floor, etc. However, applying the same event in reverse, it is difficult to explain why the various pieces of the cup should fly up into the human hand and reassemble precisely into the shape of a cup, or why the water should position itself entirely within the cup. The causes of the resultant structure and shape of the cup and the encapsulation of the water by the hand within the cup are not easily attributable, as neither hand nor floor can achieve such formations of the cup or water. This asymmetry is perceivable on account of two features: i) the relationship between the agent capacities of the human hand (i.e., what it is and is not capable of and what it is for) and non-animal agency (i.e., what floors are and are not capable of and what they are for) and ii) that the pieces of cup came to possess exactly the nature and number of those of a cup before assembling. In short, such asymmetry is attributable to the relationship between temporal direction on the one hand and the implications of form and functional capacity on the other. Now answer this question: What else, besides direction, is asymmetry attributable to?","completion":"Besides direction, asymmetry is also attributable to the relationship between form and functional capacity.

Short movie review: seriousness and quality Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"In this short movie review, the critic expressed their thoughts on the seriousness and quality of the film. It is essential to examine the specific points the critic discussed, as well as the tone of the review, in order to determine whether their opinion was positive or negative. To begin, the focus on seriousness suggests that the film in question is likely a drama or deals with weighty subject matter. If the critic highlights the movie's ability to handle serious topics with care and skill, it's possible that they found the film engaging and thought-provoking. Key aspects the critic may have mentioned include the film's mature themes, character development, strong performances, and the overall emotional impact it had on the audience. Further, discussing quality requires a comprehensive analysis of various aspects of the film, such as its script, direction, cinematography, and editing. A positive review might praise the movie's strong storyline, unique filmmaking techniques, or memorable visuals, along with its capacity to capture the viewer's attention and immerse them into the narrative. Positive remarks about the film's direction would emphasize the filmmaker's intentionality, artistry, and mastery of the medium. On the other hand, should the critic point out flaws in the film's seriousness or approach to its subject matter, it could reflect a negative perception of the movie. For instance, if the critic argues that the film failed to treat important topics with sensitivity, they may feel that the movie was exploitative or shallow. Additionally, the critic may mention issues with the film's pacing, plot inconsistencies, or underdeveloped characters as factors that detracted from the overall viewing experience. Regarding the film's quality, a negative review may touch on its weak storylines, clichéd themes, or lack of innovation in filmmaking. Similarly, criticism directed towards the film's direction, acting performances, or production values might imply that the movie was amateurish or uninspired. Considering the above factors, it is crucial to note the balance between positive and negative remarks within the review. If the critic predominantly focuses on the film's capacity to connect with audiences through its seriousness and high-quality production, it can be inferred that their perspective is primarily positive. However, if the reviewer's comments lean more towards disappointment with how the movie dealt with its subject matter or its subpar quality, it would be safe to assume that they viewed the film negatively. In conclusion, understanding whether the critic thought positively or negatively of the movie depends on a comprehensive analysis of the tone and content of the short review. By delving into their assessment of the movie's seriousness and quality, one can gain insights into their overall opinion and determine whether their review was primarily favorable or unfavorable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Can we infer the following? Jordan will host the meeting between President Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.","completion":"Yes, we can indeed infer that Jordan will host the meeting between President Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki based on the information provided. The statement clearly mentions that the meeting is scheduled to occur \\"next week in Jordan,\\" indicating that the chosen location for the meeting is within the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. The decision to hold this crucial meeting in Jordan could be attributed to several factors, some of which are: 1. Neutral ground: By choosing a third-party country like Jordan, both the United States and Iraq are ensured a neutral meeting ground which helps maintain a balance in diplomatic discussions. Jordan, being a neighbouring country to Iraq and a key U.S. ally in the Middle East, further reinforces its suitability as a meeting location. 2. Security concerns: Jordan has a reputation for being a relatively stable and secure nation within the region. Given that the purpose of the meeting is to discuss the deteriorating security situation in Iraq, it is imperative that both leaders and their accompanying delegations are able to meet in a secure environment, without the added concerns of potential threats or disturbances that may arise in either Iraq or the United States. 3. Regional diplomacy: Holding the meeting in Jordan may also be a strategic move to involve regional partners and stakeholders in the discussions and potential solutions for the security crisis in Iraq. Jordan's geographic proximity to Iraq, as well as its diplomatic relations within the region, underscores its role as a potential mediator or facilitator in any collaborative efforts that may arise from the high-level talks between President Bush and Prime Minister al-Maliki. 4. Confidentiality: Meeting in a third-party country allows the leaders of these nations to meet privately and maintain an atmosphere of discretion surrounding their discussions. In such high-stakes diplomatic situations, both President Bush and Prime Minister al-Maliki understand that privacy is essential in order to have candid conversations about the best way to address the security challenges facing Iraq. In conclusion, the information provided indicates that Jordan will host the meeting between President Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in November 2006. Based on this information, we can infer that the choice to hold this critical discussion in the neutral territory of Jordan is likely motivated by factors such as neutrality, security, regional diplomacy, and confidentiality. From this perspective, the meeting's location in Jordan serves to foster a conducive environment for productive and focused dialogue on the pressing issues of Iraq's security situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What was the name of the album that Bono described as \\"the most personal album we've written\\"? Answer the above question based on the context below: Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary. In February 2014, another new U2 song, the single \\"Invisible\\", debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS.

Movie title: Bugsy Context: Gangster Benjamin \\"Bugsy\\" Siegel, who works for the New York mob, goes to California and instantly falls in love with Virginia Hill, a tough-talking Hollywood starlet. The two meet for the first time when Bugsy visits his friend, actor George Raft, on a film set. He buys a house in Beverly Hills from opera singer Lawrence Tibbett, planning to stay there while his wife and two daughters remain in Scarsdale. As a representative for his associates Meyer Lansky and Charlie Luciano, Bugsy is in California to wrestle control of betting parlors away from Los Angeles gangster Jack Dragna. Mickey Cohen robs Dragna's operation one day. He is confronted by Bugsy, who decides he should be in business with the guy who committed the robbery, not the guy who got robbed. Cohen is put in charge of the betting casinos; Dragna is forced to admit to a raging Bugsy that he stole 14,000, and is told he now answers to Cohen. After arguments about Virginia's trysts with drummer Gene Krupa and a variety of bullfighters and Siegel's reluctance to get a divorce, Virginia makes a romantic move on Bugsy. On a trip to Nevada to visit a gambling joint, Bugsy comes up with the idea for a hotel and casino in the desert. He obtains 1 million in funding from lifelong friend Lansky and other New York mobsters, reminding them that in Nevada, gambling is legal. Virginia wants no part of it until Bugsy puts her in charge of accounting and begins construction of the Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, but the budget soon soars to 6 million due to his extravagance.

Murray Newton Rothbard (; March 2, 1926 - January 7, 1995) was an American heterodox economist of the Austrian School, a historian, and a political theorist whose writings and personal influence played a seminal role in the development of modern right-libertarianism. Rothbard was the founder and leading theoretician of anarcho-capitalism, a staunch advocate of historical revisionism, and a central figure in the twentieth-century American libertarian movement. In 1953, in New York City, he married JoAnn Schumacher (1928-1999), whom he called Joey. JoAnn was his editor and a close adviser, as well as hostess of his \\"Rothbard Salon\\". They enjoyed a loving marriage, and Rothbard often called her \\"the indispensable framework\\" behind his life and achievements. According to Joey, patronage from the Volker Fund allowed Rothbard to work from home as a freelance theorist and pundit for the first fifteen years of their marriage. The Fund collapsed in 1962, leading Rothbard to seek employment from various New York academic institutions. He was offered a part-time position teaching economics to the engineering students of Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute in 1966, at age 40. This institution had no economics department or economics majors, and Rothbard derided its social science department as \\"Marxist.\\" However, Justin Raimondo writes that Rothbard liked his role with Brooklyn Polytechnic because working only two days a week gave him freedom to contribute to developments in libertarian politics. Rothbard continued in this role for twenty years, until 1986. Then 60 years old, Rothbard left Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute for the Lee Business School at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, where he held the title of S.J. Hall Distinguished Professor of Economics, an endowed chair paid for by a libertarian businessman. According to Rothbard's friend, colleague and fellow Misesian economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Rothbard led a \\"fringe existence\\" in academia, but was able to attract a large number of \\"students and disciples\\" through his writings, thereby becoming \\"the creator and one of the principal agents of the contemporary libertarian movement.\\" Rothbard maintained his position at UNLV from 1986 until his death. Rothbard founded the Center for Libertarian Studies in 1976 and the Journal of Libertarian Studies in 1977. In 1982, he co-founded the Ludwig von Mises Institute in Auburn, Alabama, and was vice president of academic affairs until 1995. The Institute's Review of Austrian Economics, a heterodox economics journal later renamed the Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics, was also founded by Rothbard in 1987. After Rothbard's death, Joey reflected on Rothbard's happiness and bright spirit. \\"...he managed to make a living for 40 years without having to get up before noon. This was important to him.\\" She recalled how Rothbard would begin every day with a phone conversation with his colleague Llewellyn Rockwell. \\"Gales of laughter would shake the house or apartment, as they checked in with each other. Murray thought it was the best possible way to start a day.\\" Rothbard was irreligious and agnostic toward the existence of God, describing himself as a \\"mixture of an agnostic and a Reform Jew.\\" Despite identifying as an agnostic and an atheist, Rothbard was critical of the \\"left-libertarian hostility to religion\\". In Rothbard's later years, many of his friends anticipated that he would convert to Catholicism, but he never did. The New York Times obituary called Rothbard \\"an economist and social philosopher who fiercely defended individual freedom against government intervention.\\" Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: When did he marry her?","completion":"In the article, it states: \\"In 1953, in New York City, he married JoAnn Schumacher (1928-1999), whom he called Joey.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: In his 1924 publication dealing with Kent, the archaeologist O. G. S. Crawford, then working as the archaeological officer for the Ordnance Survey, listed the Coldrum Stones alongside the other Medway Megaliths. In 1926, the Coldrum Stones were given to The National Trust, which dedicated it as a memorial to the Kentish prehistorian Benjamin Harrison. A plaque was erected to mark this, which erroneously termed the monument a stone circle; in 1953, the archaeologist Leslie Grinsell expressed the view that \\"it is hoped that this error may be rectified in the near future\\". Still owned by the Trust, the site is open to visitors all year round, free of charge. On their website, the Trust advises visitors to look for \\"stunning views from the top of the barrow\\". John H. Evans characterised the site as \\"the most impressive\\" of the Medway Megaliths, while Grinsell described it as \\"the finest and most complete\\" of the group.Among the Pagans who use the Coldrum Stones for their ritual activities, there is general satisfaction with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. A patch of scorched earth exists on the grass in the centre of the monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires to do so in the same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves. The site also faces a problem from litter left by visitors, although Pagans who regularly visit the site clean this up. answer the following question: What is the name of the site for which the responsible Trust warden has chosen to leave the patch of scorched earth rather than seeding it over?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Choose from the possible answers, would the following sentence, by the strictest standards, be considered correct by a linguist? For Jenny, I intended to be present. Choose from: -- unacceptable. -- acceptable.","completion":"The sentence, \\"For Jenny, I intended to be present,\\" would be deemed acceptable by a linguist. This sentence is grammatically correct and communicates a clear message. Let's break it down: Firstly, the phrase \\"For Jenny\\" acts as a prepositional phrase that modifies the whole sentence. It means that whatever action the speaker is intending to do benefits or involves Jenny. Prepositional phrases lend more context to sentences and are quite normal in English language structure. The core of the sentence is \\"I intended to be present,\\" which is a simple, past-tense statement. It is made up of the subject \\"I\\", the verb \\"intended\\", and a to-infinitive verb phrase \\"to be present\\". \\"I\\" is the subject of the sentence, the one to whom the action pertains. \\"Intended\\" is the verb, a past tense form of the verb \\"to intend\\". It may be worth noting that a simple past tense verb is absolutely fine to use when referring to past intentions. And finally, \\"to be present\\" adds both detail and depth to the intention communicated, with the pairing of \\"to be\\" (a perfectly correct infinitive form of the verb \\"to be\\") with the adjective \\"present\\". Just to solidify our analysis, we can compare this sentence to an unquestionably correct sentence: \\"For my birthday, I wanted to have cake\\". \\"For my birthday\\" is the equivalent of \\"For Jenny\\", \\"I wanted\\" is similar to \\"I intended\\", with both statements using the first person past simple, and \\"to have cake\\" is structurally comparable with \\"to be present\\", with both parts being infinitive verb phrases. In conclusion, there are no grammatical errors or unusual constructs that would make this sentence unacceptable by a linguist. The syntax, semantics, and morphology are all in line with the standard conventions of English language, hence it can be confidently categorized as \\"Acceptable\\". It is grammatically correct, the word choice is appropriate, and the statement clearly conveys a past intention related to 'Jenny'."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Chad Copeland (Scott Thomson) and Kyle Blankes (Brant van Hoffman) (from the first Police Academy movie).

Q: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — During his first year in office, South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s persistent pursuit of diplomacy, often working in parallel with U.S. President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign, played a significant role in persuading North Korea to engage in talks to end its nuclear program. “Before the extreme measures might have been chosen by the United States, he gave diplomacy another chance to succeed,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University’s Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul. A year ago this week, Moon, a former human rights lawyer and candidate for the progressive Democratic Party, won a special presidential election held after former conservative President Park Geun-hye was impeached for her involvement in a bribery and corruption scandal. This year, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison during criminal trial related to the scandal in which she was charged with abuse of power, coercion and bribery. Moon assumed power at a time of increasing tensions, not just concerning North Korea’s accelerated nuclear and ballistic missile tests, but also China’s imposing of informal economic sanctions against South Korea for deploying the U.S. THAAD missile defense system, and the Trump administration’s talk of possible military action to end the North’s efforts to develop a nuclear armed intercontinental missile that could strike the U.S. mainland. In his inaugural address in May 2017, Moon promised to engage in shuttle diplomacy with Washington, Beijing and Pyongyang to work out a peaceful solution to the growing crisis. In a July speech in Berlin, President Moon laid out his vision for inter-Korean reconciliation that called for peaceful co-existence of the two Korean governments, but also said that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is “the absolute condition for peace.” But unlike past progressive South Korean governments that provided unconditional economic assistance, the Moon administration complied with economic sanctions in place and...

The reviewer expresses profound dissatisfaction and disappointment with the movie they are discussing. There are several points that clearly demonstrate the unfavorable sentiment: 1. The reviewer claims to have seen over 1000 movies, which establishes them as an experienced movie viewer with a broad range of exposure to films. This suggests that their opinion on what constitutes a good or bad movie comes with a certain degree of credibility. 2. They categorize the movie in question as among the worst they have ever seen. This statement indicates that the reviewer found the film to be of exceptionally low quality and it failed to meet their expectations on various levels, finding it difficult to find redeeming qualities. 3. The association of the movie with The Angels' 1963 song \\"My Boyfriend's Back\\" is perceived as a shame, implying that the reviewer holds the song in high regard and feels that its attachment to the film tarnishes its reputation. This reveals a disapproval of the movie's content and a sense of disappointment for negatively impacting the song's legacy. 4. The final statement of the review advises others to choose painful dental work over watching the movie. This comparison not only expresses the reviewer's intense negative sentiment but also serves as a warning to potential viewers to steer clear of the film. Suggesting that the alternative of undergoing dental pain is preferable highlights just how unworthy the movie is perceived to be. In conclusion, the sentiment expressed in the review is decidedly negative.

Who in Roman mythology, was the goddess of strife?","completion":"In Roman mythology, the goddess associated with strife is known as Discordia. Discordia is the personification of disagreement, conflict, and chaos. She is known to wield the element of discord and could incite battles and quarrels among individuals and groups, leading to a breakdown of social order and harmony. Discordia is derived from the Latin word 'discord', which means 'disagreement' or 'dissension'. Despite being a relatively less significant figure in Roman religion when compared to prominent gods and goddesses, Discordia played a critical role in various Roman myths and legends. Discordia was, however, a parallel figure to the well-known Greek goddess of strife named Eris. While both figures are similar in terms of attributes and purpose, the myths and tales surrounding these goddesses differ slightly according to Roman or Greek perspectives. Eris, in Greek mythology, was the daughter of Nyx, the personification of night, and Erebus, the personification of darkness. Eris has numerous siblings, including Thanatos (death), Hypnos (sleep), and Nemesis (retribution), among others. She was acknowledged as both a mischievous and malevolent entity. In some accounts, Eris was also considered to be the mother of various Spirits of Hardship known collectively as the Kakodaimones, including Ponos (toil), Lethe (forgetfulness), and Horkos (oath), to name a few. The most well-known myth involving Eris is the tale that led to the Trojan War, which stemmed from her absence at the wedding of Peleus and Thetis. Eris, who was renowned for sowing discord, was intentionally excluded from this event. In retaliation, she crafted a beautiful golden apple, known as the \\"Apple of Discord,\\" which bore the inscription \\"To the fairest.\\" Eris then threw the apple into the festivities, leading to a disagreement between the goddesses Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite as to who deserved this distinguished title. Eventually, this dispute escalated, and the Trojan prince, Paris, was appointed to judge the matter. After each goddess attempted to bribe Paris, Aphrodite's bribe to grant him Helen, the most beautiful woman in the world, won out. Consequently, Paris awarded Aphrodite the apple, ultimately leading to the abduction of Helen, exacerbating the hostilities between the Greeks and Trojans, and resulting in the outbreak of the Trojan War. In conclusion, Discordia was the goddess of strife in Roman mythology. She was derived from the Greek goddess Eris, who had the same attributes of creating chaos and conflict among individuals or groups. Though seldom worshiped or celebrated, her presence could be felt in many myths and legends, and she played an essential role in weaving some of the most iconic stories in the ancient world, such as the infamous Trojan War. Overall, Discordia stands as a symbol of the destructive potential of jealousy, rivalry, and discord."},{"prompt":"Title: Don't waste your money Review: I am about halfway through this book and have serious doubts about being able to finish it.The writing style is juvenile and irritating.

In the discography section he does not mention that on the Van Halen 'Greatest Hits Vol. 1' CD that in the original pressing \\"Running With the Devil\\" had verses two and three reversed.

To the east is the neighboring island of Lombok. To the south of Bali lies the expanse of the Indian Ocean, while to the north is the Bali Sea. The most popular resort with holidaymakers is Ubud north of Sanur. When to go? Bali has a tropical climate year round with an average daily temperature of 31degC(87degCF). The wet season is between October and April. The dry season is between May and September, and is the busiest time to visit the island as travelers take advantage of the long hot days and little rain. Beach Bali has a string of beaches, mainly in the south of the island. Head away from Bali's beaches and a totally different world awaits you. Ubud is an easily accessible jungle resort town with a good range of hotels, shops and restaurants. The active volcano of Mount Batur is a highlight and so are the mountain lakes. Family fun All of the resorts have plenty of facilities for families. In Ubud there is a monkey park, where young ones can see monkeys that are not kept in tiny cages and an elephant park where holidaymakers can ride an elephant. Eating out All of Bali's holiday resorts offer international cooking to suit every tourist's taste, with most of the better hotels having excellent restaurants. Indonesian Bintang beer is very popular. Getting around There are a limited number of local buses. The other public transport is to take the local \\"bemo\\" minibuses.

Please answer the following question: Article: Every human being has a unique arrangement of the skin on his fingers and this arrangement is unchangeable. Scientists and experts have proved the uniqueness of finger-prints and discovered that no exactly similar pattern is passed on from parents to children, though nobody knows why this is the case. The ridge structure on a person's fingers does not change with growth and is not affected by surface injuries. Burns, cuts and other damage to the outer part of the skin will be replaced in time by new one which bears a reproduction of the original pattern. It is only when the inner skin is injured that the arrangement will be destroyed. Some criminals make use of this fact to remove their own finger-prints but this is a dangerous and rare step to take. Finger-prints can be made very easily with printer's ink. They can be recorded easily. With special methods, identification can be achieved successfully within a short time. Because of the simplicity and economy of this system, finger-prints have often been used as a method of solving criminal case. A suspected man may deny a charge but this may be in vain. His finger-prints can prove who he is even if his appearance has been changed by age or accident. When a suspect leaves finger-prints behind at the scene of a crime, they are difficult to detect with the naked eye. Special techniques are used to \\"develop\\" them. Some of the marks found are incomplete but identification is possible if a print of a quarter of an inch square can be obtained. Question: It is _ for a criminal to deny his crime when finger-prints are used to identify him. Yes or no, is the answer \\"useless\\"? A:","completion":"Yes, the answer is \\"useless.\\" It is useless for a criminal to deny his crime when fingerprints are used to identify him, as fingerprints provide strong evidence of a person's presence at a crime scene. Fingerprints are unique to each individual, making them an effective method for accurately identifying someone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Does use mean the same thing in these two sentences?","completion":"No, the word \\"use\\" does not mean the same thing in these two sentences, although it might appear to be the same word. In fact, \\"use\\" functions differently in terms of context and semantics in these two sentences. In Sentence 1: \\"We only use Spanish at home,\\" the word \\"use\\" pertains to the language spoken or employed in communication. In this context, \\"use\\" conveys adopting or utilizing a particular language – Spanish – as the medium of communication at home. The meaning of \\"use\\" here is tied to the functional aspect of language. In Sentence 2: \\"I can't use this tool,\\" the word \\"use\\" relates to the ability or capability to operate or handle a specific tool or device. In this case, \\"use\\" signifies the physical or mental manipulation of an object, presumably to accomplish a particular task or achieve a goal. The meaning of \\"use\\" here is focused on the practical action involving a tool or instrument. To summarize, even though the word \\"use\\" appears in both sentences, it serves different functions and bears distinct meanings in each case. In the first sentence, \\"use\\" concerns the employment of a language as a means of communication, while in the second sentence, \\"use\\" denotes the action of operating a tool or instrument. These discrepancies illustrate the semantic versatility of the word \\"use\\" in the English language, as it can assume varying meanings depending on the context in which it is employed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

U.S. President Donald Trump says he is considering tariffs, quotas, and retaliatory taxes on imports of steel and aluminum from countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea.

The president said U.S. steel and aluminum industries are being \\"decimated\\" by the \\"dumping\\" of cheap imports of those materials into U.S. markets. Trump has long threatened what he calls \\"reciprocal\\" trade action to deal with steel, aluminum, and other imports. But he has so far avoided taking any major steps, ostensibly out of fear of hurting the country's strong economic performance since he took office. Several lawmakers on Tuesday urged Trump to be cautious when considering retaliatory trade steps, saying such measures could spark a trade war that leads to higher prices for U.S. producers and consumers. \\"It's very, very much a double-edged sword,\\" Trump conceded. \\"I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry,\\" he added. The Trump administration is currently renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement with South Korea. Trump called the U.S.-South Korea deal \\"very, very bad\\" and \\"horrible.\\" He also said Canada has \\"treated us very, very unfairly.\\" Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department sent a so-called \\"232 report\\" to the White House, examining the national security impacts of steel and aluminum imports, and giving Trump 90 days to impose quotas or tariffs.

The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

When the owner was questioned about the lack of highchairs, he noted that they were on backorder, and that customers have requested them every day since they have been open. Don't try for delivery yet, either, even though the menu says they offer it. According to the owner, they don't have their Point Of Service program in operation, and until that happens, delivery isn't an option. Pizza, as a food in general, is usually pretty good even when it isn't the best, and Mama Theresa's is good enough. Veggie Lasagna served in a portion large enough for three is also middle of the road, but for the price, is acceptable. Located in Graystone Crossing in the former J & S Butcher Shop space (let's pour one out for the dearly departed butcher homeys, please), outdoor signage is banners, and the interior du00e9cor is sparse. Most of the wall art is promotional posters for pasta sauce, which indicates that they don't make their own. If memory serves, though, those posters might be remnants from the butcher shop, which sold fresh pasta and sauce. So, they are either advertising that they don't have house made sauce, or they have pictures of another business's products. Neither is particularly good for their image, which at this point seems a bit commitment phobic. Here's hoping that as their new buisness kinks are sorted, the experience at Mama Theresa's will improve. Choose: was this review given positively or negatively?

But do you know that a colour has weight? I think you'll say \\"no\\". But I am afraid you are wrong. If you don't believe, you may do a small experiment . First, put two objects with the same weight into two boxes. Then cover the boxes. Wrap one box with a red piece of paper, the other with a white piece of paper. Now hold the boxes with your hand one by one. It is certain that you will think the red one is a little heavier. Why does it happen? A scientist found that different colours have different weight in a man's mind. So he did many tests and at last he got the result. That is to say, every colour has its own weight in our mind. The heaviest colour is red, then blue, green, orange, yellow and white. The scientists told us that colours also have smell. Can you smell the colour? Of course not. Then why did the scientists say so? That is because every colour represents a kind of light wave ------ a certain wavelength . It reaches our brain through organs According to this discovery, scientists say that people accept the colour they like, and _ the colour they hate. So your body and mind will be healthy by using the colours you like. Or you'll be nervous or even get ill. If you stay in a room with red windows, wallpapers and furniture for two hours, you'll feel you have been there for four hours. But if the room is blue, you'll feel you have been there for only one hour. Another example, if a person walks out of a red room and into a blue room, his temperature will fall. That means our body temperature will change when we see different colours. Question: According to the passage, how long will you feel if you stay in a red room for an hour? Options: A: Two hours.

The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases.

With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by now-abandoned railways, for example, have fallen off the beaten path.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. No matter what vehicle you’re using, it’s important to keep 2 hands on the wheel at all times. To give yourself maximum control, imagine that your steering wheel is a clock and keep your hands at the 9-o’clock and 3-o’clock positions. This is particularly important for vans because, if you don’t keep a firm grasp on the wheel, you could lose control of the vehicle and cause a rollover. Vans are heavier and bulkier than normal cars, meaning they take longer to brake. To account for this, leave more space than normal between yourself and other cars. As a general rule, leave at least 4 seconds of distance between you and the car in front of you. To calculate how far behind a car you are, wait until the car passes a clear object or road marker. As soon as it does, count how many seconds it takes until you pass that same object. Depending on the area and the exact size of the vehicle, your van may be subject to special speed restrictions different from the posted speed limit. In most cases, this will be 10 miles (16 km) per hour lower than the max for standard cars. To see if an area you’re traveling in enforces van-specific speed limits, contact the local Department of Motor Vehicles or search online for local driving regulations. Vans are tall and narrow, which means they’re more prone to tipping over. Though not usually a problem on straight paths, this can make turning more precarious. To minimize the risk of tipping, slow down to around 5 to 10 miles (8.0 to 16.1 km) per hour before making sharp turns. To avoid colliding with curbs, road signs, and other vehicles, make sure your van is positioned in the left or right-most lane, depending on which direction you need to turn. Make sure other vehicles are far enough away from the van that you won’t side sweep them when turning. Then, make your turn, waiting until you are far enough into the intersection that your vehicle’s back end won’t hit other cars. Before changing lanes or backing up, put on your blinkers to indicate your intentions. Then, check all your mirrors for other cars and pedestrians. If your cargo van has a clear back window, turn your head and look through it to make sure there are no cars in your blind spot. If necessary, get out of your van to check the surroundings before backing up. Though vans are not as large as semi trucks, they are significantly taller than normal cars, meaning they may not be able to go under bridges and ledges other vehicles can. Before going under a low ledge, check the clearance sign on top to see if your van is short enough to fit underneath. Do not go under ledges that are lower than your vehicle. Most major bridges are tall enough to accomodate semi trucks, so look out primarily for old, small-town bridges and clearance poles at places like gas stations and fast food restaurants. Summary:","completion":"When driving a van, keep 2 hands on the wheel in the 9 and 3 o'clock positions for control. Vans are bigger and heavier, so leave more space between you and other cars. Watch for special speed limits and be extra careful when turning. Use your mirrors, blinkers, and check your surroundings before changing lanes or backing up.

'We had weight training every day in. sixth period, but instead of going to the weight room, Kevin was going. to her office - and the door was locked' Devastated, the girl informed school officials of the pair's exchanges, and confronted her boyfriend. According to the school's report, Eng admitted having oral sex and intercourse with Sayar between eight to 12 times. The New York Post reports that the lovers exchanged an incredible 3,856 text messages over a 17-day period in December, an average of 227 per day. One midnight tryst apparently saw Sayar pick the boy up from his house in her car. 'Eventually, they began kissing and then engaged in sexual intercourse and oral sex inside the SUV,' the report said, adding that the boy had described tattoos on intimate parts of Sayar’s body. A spokesman for the Department of Education said Sayar, who earns just over 78,000 (£50,000) a year, is still technically employed at the school, although she was removed from the classroom in January. The school investigators have submitted their report to Brooklyn's District Attorney Charles Hynes, strongly recommending she be fired. Eng, who is now 17, is still a pupil at the school. The sordid allegations are not the first to hit James Madison High School, christened 'Horndog High' after its past sex scandals. Language teachers Cindy Mauro and Alini Brito were dismissed from their posts after an alleged lesbian romp in a school classroom in November 2009 - a claim they both denied. Prior to that, 29-year-old English teacher Craig Roffman was sacked and arrested in 2005 after he was found emailing child pornography. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"A 36-year-old teacher in Brooklyn, named Erin Sayar, is in trouble because she did something very wrong with one of her high school students. Her husband, Jimmy Lathrop, is very angry and embarrassed about this, so he wants to get a divorce and end their marriage. Erin is accused of having an inappropriate relationship with a 16-year-old student named Kevin Eng. This is against the law, and she faces serious consequences if found guilty. She was supposed to be helping him with his schoolwork, but instead, they did things they shouldn't have. The school found out about the relationship when Kevin's girlfriend became suspicious and found some messages between Erin and Kevin. The school and police are now investigating the case, and Erin could go to jail. This is not the first time something like this has happened at their school, which is called James Madison High School. In the past, there have been other scandals involving teachers doing wrong things, so the school needs to make sure they do something to stop these problems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Joseph Romano, pictured in 2012, claimed Monday the FBI framed him in a plot to kill a judge and prosecutor. A conman already imprisoned in a collectible coin scam was sentenced to a life term on Monday for a bizarre, behind-bars plot to decapitate a judge and a prosecutor. Joseph Romano, of Levittown, New York, was convicted in January on charges he gave orders to have the prosecutor's breasts cut off as well, and that body parts should be preserved in formaldehyde as proof both people were dead. He claimed on Monday that he was framed by federal agents who fabricated the scheme as part of an undercover sting operation. 'I don't care what sentence you give me as long as I know one thing: I'm innocent,' a defiant Joseph Romano told the judge in a rambling statement in federal court in Brooklyn. Romano, 51, went on for more than hour, referencing Charles Manson, literary classics such as Moby Dick and A Christmas Carol and his own weight - 300 pounds. He insisted that the FBI targeted him to silence him. 'They want to bury me,' he said, pointing at grim-faced FBI agents sitting in the audience. 'They want to shut me up... I've never hurt anybody.' U.S. District Judge John Keenan told Romano that he deserved life behind bars because trying to orchestrate a pair of contract killings 'cannot be tolerated in a civilized society' Romano listened quietly, then gathered up a stack of documents and thanked the judge as he was led out of the courtroom. The plot unfolded in 2012 after Romano was sentenced to 15 years in prison and ordered to forfeit 7 million in the coin scheme, which victimized elderly investors. His business partner, Dejvid Mirkovic, was sentenced to 24 years in prison for the same scheme. Six months into Romano's sentence, another inmate reported through his lawyer that he had overheard Romano talk about seeking revenge. Joseph Romano, left, was sentenced to life behind bars on Monday for putting a hit on the federal judge and prosecutor who put him and his business partner, Dejvid Mirkovic, right, away for a collectable coin scheme. The inmate agreed to wear a wire and introduce Romano to an undercover federal agent pretending to be a hit man named Bobby Russo. Over the course of several recorded conversations, Romano arranged through a former business partner to pay the undercover agent 40,000 to carry out the killings, referred to in code as 'Dodge trucks.' Jurors heard one recording where Romano gave instructions to shoot the judge, saying, 'Find out where (the judge) is, go there and - boom - right in' the head. Prosecutors alleged that he wanted the prosecutor's body stuffed in a steel drum and dumped in a place where it could never be found. Romano also was accused of trying to arrange an assault a Long Island mechanic for repossessing one of his vintage muscle cars. Undercover investigators staged a photo to make it look as though the mechanic had been knocked out in a beat-down.

Listen to what side the rattling is on, so you have an idea of which wheel bearing is going bad.; (B). If this occurs, it's time to get the vehicle back on the road.

If there is a suspicion of bad wheel bearings, it's crucial to address the issue before continuing to drive to avoid any accidents or further damage to the vehicle. C. Although this option mentions snapping and pops while the wheel spins, it focuses on the cv joint, not the wheel bearings.

Possession of livestock allowed competition between households and resulted in inherited inequalities of wealth. Neolithic pastoralists who controlled large herds gradually acquired more livestock, and this made economic inequalities more pronounced. However, evidence of social inequality is still disputed, as settlements such as Catal Huyuk reveal a striking lack of difference in the size of homes and burial sites, suggesting a more egalitarian society with no evidence of the concept of capital, although some homes do appear slightly larger or more elaborately decorated than others. Who was in possession of large herds that would produce more livestock?","completion":"The text suggests that the Neolithic pastoralists were in possession of large herds that would produce more livestock. These pastoralists, living around 8000 BC, engaged in the early form of agriculture known as pastoralism, which involved the domestication and rearing of animals. Their control over large herds allowed them to acquire more livestock over time, contributing to economic disparities and reinforcing social inequality due to the resultant increase in wealth. In essence, those who had more livestock had the potential to generate more wealth, thereby creating a cycle that resulted in some households being significantly wealthier than others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This remarkable video shows the dramatic transformation in a mother with cerebral palsy after she smokes cannabis to relieve her symptoms. Jacqueline Patterson, from Kansas City, Missouri, has a severe stutter and suffers incredible pain because of her condition. She has found that marijuana is the only thing that really helps - but each time she buys or smokes it, she runs the risk of losing custody of her four children. Despite marijuana being legal for medical reasons in 20 states, it is not legal in Kansas City where Ms Patterson lives. But because of her debilitating symptoms, she says using the drug actually makes her better mother. Before she smokes cannabis, she seriously struggles to speak. Afterwards, she speaks calmly and with no problems at all. In the video, she explains: 'I was born with cerebral palsy and a severe stutter - which has got to be one of the most stigmatising disabilities invented by God. It's very humiliating. 'My right side of my body is much noticeably weaker than my left and my right arm is always painfully tense. 'I went through my entire childhood in pain because I couldn't move my muscles.' She realised from the first time she smoked cannabis that it eased her symptoms. In a letter to the Kansas City Star, she said: 'I. was born with cerebral palsy and discovered early on that cannabis. mitigated the most painful physical and emotional manifestations of my. disorder. Ms Patterson has found that marijuana is the only thing that really helps her symptoms. Despite it being legal for medical reasons in 20 states, it is not legal in Kansas City, Missouri, where she lives (file picture) 'I later learned that cannabis can help stutterers speak more clearly and that decades ago, doctors discovered the herbâ€™s ability to alleviate muscle spasms, from which I also suffer.' In the film, viewers meet Ms Patterson when she hasn't smoked marijuana for three days. Her stutter means it can take several seconds for her to pronounce a word. Driving into downtown Kansas City to look for the drug, she explains: 'I smoke to be the mother my children deserve - they are really cool kids. 'Being a good mother to my children is the most important thing in the world to me. Cerebral. palsy is an umbrella term used to describe damage to the brain that. occurs before, during or after birth. birth. It is a condition that. affects muscle control and movement. People with cerebral palsy often. have other related conditions or problems, including: difficulties. speaking or understanding other people speak, incontinence, learning. difficulties, visual impairment and hearing impairment. 'I hate the way I stutter and it's the most effective treatment I have found. 'But if I were to get busted buying or smoking marijuana there is a possibility I could lose my children.' Back home, after three hits of the drug, she is able to speak completely normally. Speaking about the remarkable difference, she says: 'The third hit is when I begin to feel the tension dissipate. 'It really helps my speech - I feel much calmer, much less rushed and I feel like I can control the muscles that I couldn't before I smoked. 'It's kinda nice and I don't make as many funny faces.'

Article: You can collect information from them in several ways: telephone or e-mail surveys, statistical reviews of customer order history, and market trends. Ask them about their purchasing plans and projected buying behavior. Use a large pool to help generalize results. Ask them how likely they are to buy your products and tally the results. Customers are in the best position to know the demand for a product. The danger from surveys is that they often overestimate actual demand. While a customer may show interest in your product, actually buying it is a different thing altogether. Keep in mind that conducting surveys can be expensive, difficult, and time consuming. Surveys rarely form the base of a successful demand forecast. Use this during the early stages of your product development. Find a small, isolated, area that has your targeted demographic. Roll out every stage of your marketing plan including advertising, promotion, and distribution plans. Measure product awareness, penetration, market share and total sales. Fine tune your market strategy based on the information you receive so that you will run into fewer problems when you launch your product nationally. Gather a small group of potential customers in a room and let them use your product and discuss it. The customers are usually paid a small amount for participating. Panels are similar to surveys in that they are more useful to analyze the product rather than forming the basis for a demand forecast. Find a large set of household customers to agree to participate in an ongoing study of their buying habits at grocery stores, for example. Have these customers agree to submit information such as the size of their households, their ages, their household income, and any other information you find relevant to your product. Whenever they buy groceries, their purchases are recorded and analyzed. This data can be collected when they use their store grocery card.

Article: (2013*II,B)In 1947 a group of famous people from the art world headed by an Austrian conductor decided to hold an international festival of music,dance and theatre in Edinburgh.The idea was to reunite Europe after the Second World War. It quickly attracted famous names such as Alec Guinness,Richard Burton,Dame Margot Fonteyn and Marlene Dietrich as well as the big symphony orchestras .It became a fixed event every August and now attracts 400,000 people yearly. At the same time,the \\"Fringe\\" appeared as a challenge to the official festival.Eight theatre groups turned up uninvited in 1947,in the belief that everyone should have the right to perform,and they did so in a public house disused for years. Soon,groups of students firstly from Edinburgh University,and later from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge,Durham and Birmingham were making the journey to the Scottish capital each summer to perform theatre by littleknown writers of plays in small church halls to the people of Edinburgh. Today the\\"Fringe\\",once less recognized,has far outgrown the festival with around 1,500 performances of theatre,music and dance on every one of the 21 days it lasts.And yet as early as 1959,with only 19 theatre groups performing,some said it was getting too big. A paid administrator was first employed only in 1971,and today there are eight administrators working all year round and the number rises to 150 during August itself.In 2004 there were 200 places housing 1,695 shows by over 600 different groups from 50 different countries.More than 1.25 million tickets were sold. Question: What was the purpose of Edinburgh Festival at the beginning? Yes or no, is the answer \\"To bring Europe together again.\\"?

Millions of lives perished, and those who survived had only two choices â kill or be killed. The battalions of warring states Liang and Wei collided in a bloodbath that lasted from dawn until dusk. Only two men were left standing â a foot soldier from Liang and the rival General from Wei. The Soldier survived because he is an expert in playing dead, with a device strapped on his body which protruded like an arrowhead for added realism. The Soldier captured the wounded General, hoping to use the enemy as his ticket to freedom â by handing the General to the Liang warlord, the Soldier could be honorably discharged and return home to his peaceful life. The young General, though taken captive, was condescending towards the Soldier.

They indicate the type of metal and its purity. Many words can be used to denote this, but considering the context, it might be a specific hallmark. 2.

Answer the above question based on the context below: \\"Freedom of the seas\\" is a principle in international law dating from the seventeenth century. It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in international waters. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.UNCLOS defines various areas of water. \\"Internal waters\\" are on the landward side of a baseline and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. \\"Territorial waters\\" extend to 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres; 14 miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource. A \\"contiguous zone\\" extending a further 12 nautical miles allows for hot pursuit of vessels suspected of infringing laws in four specific areas: customs, taxation, immigration and pollution. An \\"exclusive economic zone\\" extends for 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres; 230 miles) from the baseline.

The answer to the question: What are the names of the missionaries of Britain that the sculptures in the north represent and are identifiable by their attributes?? is inside the article: The sculptures on the west front at Wells include standing figures, seated figures, half-length angels and narratives in high relief. Many of the figures are life-sized or larger, and together they constitute the finest display of medieval carving in England. The figures and many of the architectural details were painted in bright colours, and the colouring scheme has been deduced from flakes of paint still adhering to some surfaces. The sculptures occupy nine architectural zones stretching horizontally across the entire west front and around the sides and the eastern returns of the towers which extend beyond the aisles. The strongly projecting buttresses have tiers of niches which contain many of the largest figures. Other large figures, including that of Christ, occupy the gable. A single figure stands in one of two later niches high on the northern tower. In 1851 the archaeologist Charles Robert Cockerell published his analysis of the iconography, numbering the nine sculptural divisions from the lowest to the highest. He defined the theme as \\"a calendar for unlearned men\\" illustrating the doctrines and history of the Christian faith, its introduction to Britain and its protection by princes and bishops. He likens the arrangement and iconography to the Te Deum.According to Cockerell, the side of the façade that is to the south of the central door is the more sacred and the scheme is divided accordingly. The lowest range of niches each contained a standing figure, of which all but four figures on the west front, two on each side, have been destroyed. More have survived on the northern and eastern sides of the north tower.

Philosopher A devised a clever paradox and presented it before the court. He called the paradox Problem A. But philosopher B didn't come up with a paradox. He too presented a clever problem which was not a paradox - he called it problem B.

It was humbling that so many chose to mark the anniversary of a duty which passed to me 60 years ago. People of all ages took the trouble to take part in various ways and in many nations. But perhaps most striking of all was to witness the strength of fellowship and friendship among those who had gathered together on these occasions. On the barges and the bridges and the banks of the river there were people who had taken their places to cheer through the mist, undaunted by the rain. That day there was a tremendous sense of common determination to celebrate, triumphing over the elements. That same spirit was also in evidence from the moment the Olympic flame arrived on these shores. The flame itself drew hundreds and thousands of people on its journey around the British Isles, and was carried by every kind of deserving individual, many nominated for their own extraordinary service. As London hosted a splendid summer of sport, all those who saw the achievement and courage at the Olympic and Paralympic Games were further inspired by the skill, dedication, training and teamwork of our athletes. In pursuing their own sporting goals, they gave the rest of us the opportunity to share something of the excitement and drama. We were reminded, too, that the success of these great festivals depended to an enormous degree upon the dedication and effort of an army of volunteers. Those public-spirited people came forward in the great tradition of all those who devote themselves to keeping others safe, supported and comforted. For many, Christmas is also a time for coming together. But for others, service will come first.

The paragraph describes \\"Squeezing Out Sparks\\" as being the fourth studio album by English musician Graham Parker and his band, the Rumour. Even though the band's name is not credited on the cover of the album, their contribution is mentioned on the album's label. The inclusion of the Rumour in the making of this album shows that this album was a collaborative effort between Graham Parker and the Rumour. This implies a level of collaboration and work relationship between Graham Parker and the band. Therefore, it is true to say that Graham Parker worked with the Rumour. However, it's important to note that while this particular album demonstrates a partnership between Graham Parker and the Rumour, it doesn't necessarily mean that they collaborated on all of his work or that they continued to work together indefinitely. It merely confirms that they worked together on the \\"Squeezing Out Sparks\\" album. Further information would be needed to substantiate any claims about the nature and longevity of their partnership, interaction in other projects, or the extent of the Rumour's participation in Parker's other works. It is also worth noting that \\"Squeezing Out Sparks\\" did not just achieve relative obscurity; it was recognized as album of the year in the 1979 Village Voice Pazz & Jop Critics Poll and was later ranked number 334 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. This certainly reflects the quality of the collaboration between Graham Parker and Rumour and possibly the depth of their teamwork."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this summary: No new large gas plants will be built as a result of a key government mechanism to ensure the lights stay on in the future. Article:","completion":"Title: Government Mechanism Shifts Focus Away from Large Gas Plants to Secure Future Energy Needs Introduction: In a move towards a more sustainable and environmentally-conscious energy policy, the government has announced that their primary mechanism for ensuring the lights remain on in the future will no longer support the construction of new large-scale gas plants. This shift reflects the growing global awareness of the impacts of fossil fuel-based energy sources on the environment and highlights the need for alternative, cleaner forms of power generation. The Key Government Mechanism: The key government mechanism in question is the Capacity Market, a policy tool designed to ensure a reliable energy supply by rewarding high-performing power plants that help balance the energy grid. These plants are critical in providing backup power in times of peak energy demand or emergencies, thus ensuring the stability of the energy network. By excluding the construction of new large-scale gas plants from this mechanism, the government has taken a significant step towards building a more sustainable energy future. Impact on the Energy Industry: The decision to no longer support new large gas plants will have several effects on the energy industry. Firstly, it emphasizes the importance of more sustainable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydro power in meeting the growing energy needs of the country. The exclusion of new gas plants from the Capacity Market will create a competitive advantage for companies focused on renewable energy technologies, and increase investments in the research, development, and deployment of such technologies. Secondly, this move will likely necessitate the closure of existing large gas plants or their conversion into more efficient and cleaner alternatives. This will affect the workers and communities that rely on these plants for employment and economic stability. As a result, it becomes necessary for the government and the energy industry to work together to ensure a smooth transition and minimize the negative impacts of these changes on affected parties. Long-term Implications: In the long run, the government's decision will contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and help mitigate the effects of climate change. Investing in clean energy sources also bolsters the nation's energy security, as it reduces reliance on imported fossil fuels, protects against price shocks, and supplies a more diverse and resilient energy mix. Furthermore, the increased demand for renewable energy technologies will generate employment opportunities and contribute to economic growth. As a result, the transition to a more sustainable energy model will necessitate the development of a skilled workforce in the clean energy sector, creating a solid foundation for future growth in this vital industry. Conclusion: The government's decision to exclude new large gas plants from their Capacity Market mechanism reflects a pivotal shift in energy policy. By placing emphasis on cleaner, more sustainable energy sources, the government demonstrates its commitment to tackling climate change and building a resilient energy network capable of meeting future energy needs. This change will require collaboration, investment, and forward thinking, but ultimately, it paves the way for a brighter, cleaner future."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The values of 'i' and 'j' are non-negative integers, with 'i' always less than 'j' and both 'i' and 'j' being less than the length of the list 'A'. 2. Given input: In this example, 'i' = 7, 'j' = 15, and 'A' = ['q', 'i', 'i', 'o', 'T', '8297', 'P', '393', '4027', 'L', '417', '275', 'c', 'w', '9375']. 3.

Background: Hans Lundgren was born on 3 November 1957 in Spanga, the son of Sigrid Birgitta (nee Tjerneld), a language teacher, and Karl Johan Hugo Lundgren, an engineer and economist for the Swedish government. He lived in Spanga until the age of 13, when he moved to his grandparents' home in Nyland, Angermanland. Some sources wrongly state 1959 as his year of birth, but Lundgren himself has confirmed it to be 1957. He has two sisters and an older brother; he was raised in the Lutheran church. Context: Lundgren resides in Los Angeles, California. He speaks Swedish and English, as well as smaller amounts of French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish, but is not fluent in five languages as has often been reported. He is an avid football fan. He supported Everton FC when he lived in Europe, but developed more of an interest in international football tournaments (such as the UEFA European Championship and the FIFA World Cup) after moving to Los Angeles. During the 1980s, Lundgren had relationships with Jamaican singer Grace Jones and American model Paula Barbieri. In 1994, he married Anette Qviberg, a jewellery designer and fashion stylist, in Marbella. The couple decided they liked Marbella so much that they rented accommodation there for years, before eventually buying a family home there. They have two daughters: Ida Sigrid Lundgren and Greta Eveline Lundgren, both born in Stockholm. Lundgren and Qviberg have cited the reason for living away from Hollywood is that they want to give their children as normal a childhood as possible. His father died in 2000. In early May 2009, Lundgren's Marbella home was reportedly broken into by three masked burglars who tied up and threatened his wife, but fled when they found a family photo and realized that the house was owned by Lundgren. Lundgren later stated he believed the intruders to be Eastern European and had asked contacts in Bulgaria to investigate them, but to no avail. After the incident, Lundgren's elder daughter, Ida, suffered from PTSD. His wife was the \\"most traumatized\\", and as of 2011, they are divorced.

Are these two questions asking the same thing? Select from: [1]. no; [2]. yes;","completion":"[1]. No; The two questions are different but related as they both involve the concept of atmospheric pressure. The first question is asking about the conversion of atmospheric pressure to pressure in terms of water column height. This conversion is made through physical principles. One atmospheric pressure is approximately equivalent to a 10.33 meter column of water because the weight of water in this column would exert a pressure similar to the normal atmospheric pressure we experience at sea level on the Earth. The second question is a hypothetical scenario that involves pressure differentials and the implications of a small breach in a high pressure area. It expects understanding of pressure principles, but the nature of the question is not the same as the first. So, while both questions deal with pressure, they are asking different things - one is about a conversion measure and the other is a hypothetical scenario which could lead to different discussions such as the speed of gas escaping from the box, potential damage e.t.c."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options are: A). yes B). it is not possible to tell C). no","completion":"C). No From the provided information, it is clear that we cannot conclude that \\"It doesn't cost companies anything to carry the insurance.\\" In fact, the statement has provided several key points that suggest otherwise: 1. Some companies can't afford to carry the insurance any longer. 2. Companies are dropping the insurance as they no longer have a choice. 3. It is bankrupting companies. These points not only indicate that insurance can indeed be a significant expense for companies, but also that the cost can be so high that it threatens the financial stability of these businesses. As a result, companies may have to make the difficult decision to stop carrying the insurance altogether. This indicates that there is a definite cost for companies to carry insurance, especially in cases where maintaining it becomes too burdensome for them to continue. Moreover, insurance costs can vary depending on several factors, such as the type of insurance, the industry of the company, the size and risk profile of the business, and the insurance provider. These factors can influence the premiums and policy coverage that the companies require, which in turn affects their bottom line. In conclusion, claiming that it doesn't cost companies anything to carry insurance is not supported by the information provided. It is evident that some companies struggle with the costs associated with carrying insurance, to the point where they may have to drop their coverage or face potential bankruptcy.

Here's a detailed explanation of what may happen: 1. Strengthened Communication: Regular communication is essential for maintaining a healthy relationship. If he calls back, it shows that he is making an effort to stay in touch and values the relationship. This gesture will help in reinforcing trust and ensuring that both parties are on the same page regarding their expectations and feelings. 2. Better Understanding of Each Other's Situation: Calling back provides an opportunity for both of you to discuss the circumstances surrounding the short call and the reason behind it. Sharing such details can lead to a better understanding of each other's situation and help avoid any misinterpretations or hard feelings. 3. Opportunity to Discuss Future Plans: If he is indeed signing a lease for a new apartment, calling back offers a chance to discuss your shared future and any possible impact on your relationship. Open dialogue about important decisions like moving in together or maintaining separate living arrangements can help clarify expectations and ensure that both parties are on board with the same plan. 4. Preventing Miscommunication and Assumptions: In the absence of clear communication, there is a possibility of making incorrect assumptions about each other's feelings and actions. If he calls back, it dispels any doubts or negative thoughts that might be brewing due to the lack of communication, thus preventing misunderstandings from escalating. 5. Enhanced Emotional Connection: Regular phone calls help in keeping the emotional connection alive in a relationship. By calling back, he will be contributing to strengthening the emotional bond between the two of you. This constant connection helps in fostering a sense of closeness and attachment essential for relationship growth. 6. Potential Resolution of Conflicts or Disagreements: In case there were any disagreements or conflicts left unresolved, calling back provides an opportunity to address those issues and work towards a resolution. This communication prevents bottling up of negative emotions, which may harm the relationship in the long run. In conclusion, if he were to call back instead, it could result in improved communication, better understanding, the ability to discuss future plans, and prevent miscommunication or assumptions. Additionally, it also contributes to enhancing the emotional connection and resolving conflicts or disagreements.

In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a network administrator or a system administrator) requires a search warrant and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant.

Summarize this article: A HEARTBREAKING letter written by a dying young woman is going viral after she passed away last week. On the 4th of January Holly Butcher lost her battle with Ewing’s sarcoma, a rare form of cancer that affects mostly young people, at the age of 27. Before she died, the Grafton woman penned a letter which she asked her family to post on her Facebook account once she was gone. The message includes Holly’s moving insights as a 27-year-old woman forced to confront her mortality, despite not having done so many things she’d hoped and planned to do. “It’s a strange thing to realise and accept your mortality at 26 years young,” she reflected. “It’s just one of those things you ignore. The days tick by and you just expect they will keep on coming; until the unexpected happens. “That’s the thing about life,” she noted. “It is fragile, precious and unpredictable and each day is a gift, not a given right,” she said, adding “I’m 27 now. I don’t want to go.” After spending time reflecting on how she would live her life if she could overcome the disease, Holly decided to share her advice with those who get to keep on living. In just a few days it’s had almost 8,000 shares and more than 10,000 reactions. As a reminder to not sweat the small stuff, Holly assured you won’t be worrying about most of the things you complain about now when you’re on your death bed. “You might have got caught in bad traffic today, or had a bad sleep because your beautiful babies kept you awake, or your hairdresser cut your hair too short. Your new fake nails might have got a chip, your boobs are too small, or you have cellulite on your arse and your belly is wobbling. “Let all that s*** go,” she urged. “I swear you will not be thinking of those things when it is your turn to go. “I’m watching my body waste away right before my eyes with nothing I can do about it and all I wish for now is that I could have just one more birthday or Christmas with my family, or just one more day with my partner and dog. Just one more.” Holly wrote that we should be more mindful with money, and spend it on things that make other people happy rather than more stuff for ourselves. “It is a weird thing having money to spend at the end, when you’re dying. It’s not a time you go out and buy material things that you usually would, like a new dress. “It makes you think how silly it is that we think it is worth spending so much money on new clothes and ‘things’ in our lives,” she said. “Buy your friend something kind instead of another dress, beauty product or jewellery for that next wedding ... take them out for a meal, or better yet, cook them a meal. Shout their coffee. Give or buy them a plant, a massage or a candle and tell them you love them when you give it to them.” Lateness is something that irritates a lot of people, and Holly insightfully summed up why that is — because it shows disrespect for the other person and their time, which is limited. “Value other people’s time. Don’t keep them waiting because you are s*** at being on time. Get ready earlier if you are one of those people and appreciate that your friends want to share their time with you, not sit by themselves, waiting on a mate. You will gain respect too.” She also came to the realisation that documenting your life for social media dilutes the power of the moment while you’re actually living it. “Try just enjoying and being in moments rather than capturing them through the screen of your phone. Life isn’t meant to be lived through a screen nor is it about getting the perfect photo ... enjoy the bloody moment, people! Stop trying to capture it for everyone else.” Holly’s final point might be the most important. Receiving blood donations allowed her to live for an extra year, and she urged everyone to donate blood regularly. “Blood donation (more bags than I could keep up with counting) helped keep me alive for an extra year — a year I will be forever grateful that I got to spend here on earth with my family, friends and dog. A year I had some of the greatest times of my life.” Donate blood and save three lives — visit the Australian Red Cross Blood Service at www.donateblood.com.au for more information. ||||| A heartbreaking but inspiring letter from a dying Australian woman has gone viral after her death. Holly Butcher, 27, died from Ewing’s sarcoma and left behind a letter which she asked her family to post on her Facebook account after her death, according to News.com.au. Butcher wrote about enjoying life to the fullest and talked frankly about her mortality as well as the things she wished she had more time to do, like raise her own family. “It’s a strange thing to realise and accept your mortality at 26 years young,” she wrote. “It’s just one of those things you ignore. The days tick by and you just expect they will keep on coming; until the unexpected happens.” “That’s the thing about life,” she continued. “It is fragile, precious and unpredictable and each day is a gift, not a given right. I’m 27 now. I don’t want to go.” Holly Butcher Holly Butcher/Facebook Butcher explained she led a healthy life, but that her disease had left her to realize there were more important aspects of living a healthy lifestyle, such as being healthy emotionally and mentally. “Be grateful for each day you don’t have pain and even the days where you are unwell with man flu, a sore back or a sprained ankle, accept it is s— but be thankful it isn’t life threatening and will go away,” she wrote. “Whinge less, people! .. And help each other more.” She confessed it was “a weird thing having money to spend at the end.. when you’re dying. It’s not a time you go out and buy material things that you usually would, like a new dress. It makes you think how silly it is that we think it is worth spending so much money on new clothes and ‘things’ in our lives.” She offered a reminder to not spend time thinking about small issues, but to focus on experiencing moments with family and friends.

Just one more.” Butcher also encouraged readers to donate more blood, revealing that it extended her life by one year. “Oh and one last thing, if you can, do a good deed for humanity (and myself) and start regularly donating blood. It will make you feel good with the added bonus of saving lives,” she wrote. “I feel like it is something that is so overlooked considering every donation can save 3 lives! That is a massive impact each person can have and the process really is so simple.” She added, “Blood donation (more bags than I could keep up with counting) helped keep me alive for an extra year – a year I will be forever grateful that I got to spend it here on Earth with my family, friends and dog.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the quartet that wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal? Audioslave's history dates back to October 18, 2000, when Rage Against the Machine's lead vocalist Zack de la Rocha announced he was leaving the band, citing a breakdown in its \\"decision-making process\\". Rage Against the Machine broke up as a result of de la Rocha's departure, but the remaining three members of the band—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk—decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist. Several vocalists jammed with the three, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but they did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Contrary to popular belief, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains neither auditioned nor was asked to join the new project. Tom Morello denied this claim on his Twitter account in 2015. Music producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they play with Chris Cornell, the ex-frontman of Soundgarden. Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed \\"it could turn into a Yardbirds-into-Led Zeppelin scenario.\\" Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together. He called him \\"the angel at the crossroads\\" because \\"if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here today.\\"The chemistry between Cornell and the other three was immediately apparent; as Morello described: \\"He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it.

The Tharsis quadrangle is also referred to as MC-9 (Mars Chart-9). - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from . - A space probe is a robotic spacecraft that leaves Earth orbit and explores space. It may approach the Moon; enter interplanetary space; flyby, orbit, or land on other planetary bodies; or approach interstellar space. - Pavonis Mons (Latin for \\"peacock mountain\\") is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the middle member of a chain of three volcanic mountains (collectively known as the Tharsis Montes) that straddle the Martian equator between longitudes 235°E and 259°E. The volcano was discovered by the Mariner 9 spacecraft in 1971 and was originally called Middle Spot. Its name formally became Pavonis Mons in 1973. - A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface. - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. - Magma (from Ancient Greek (\\"mágma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock. - Tharsis is a vast volcanic plateau centered near the equator in the western hemisphere of Mars. The region is home to the largest volcanoes in the Solar System, including the three enormous shield volcanoes Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascraeus Mons, which are collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The tallest volcano on the planet, Olympus Mons, is often associated with the Tharsis region but is actually located off the western edge of the plateau. The name Tharsis is the Greco-Latin transliteration of the biblical Tarshish, the land at the western extremity of the known world. - The Tharsis Montes are three large shield volcanoes in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. From north to south, the volcanoes are Ascraeus Mons, Pavonis Mons and Arsia Mons. Mons (plural \\"montes\\") is the Latin word for mountain. It is a descriptor term used in astrogeology for mountainous features in the Solar System. - Ulysses Tholus is a Martian volcano. It is located in the Tharsis quadrangle at 2.89° north latitude and 121.55° west longitude. It is 58 km across and is named after a classical albedo feature name. Ulysses Tholus is immediately east and slightly north of another volcano, Biblis Tholus. - Olympus Mons (Latin for Mount Olympus) is a very large shield volcano on the planet Mars. By one measure, it has a height of nearly 22 km (13.6 mi). Olympus Mons stands about two and a half times as tall as Mount Everest's height above sea level. It is the youngest of the large volcanoes on Mars, having formed during Mars's Hesperian Period. It is currently the largest volcano discovered in the Solar System and had been known to astronomers since the late 19th century as the albedo feature Nix Olympica (Latin for \\"Olympic Snow\\"). Its mountainous nature was suspected well before space probes confirmed its identity as a mountain. - Ascraeus Mons is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the northernmost and tallest of three shield volcanoes collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The volcano's location corresponds to the classical albedo feature Ascraeus Lacus. - Biblis Tholus is an extinct Martian volcano located at 2.55 ° N 235.62 ° E , one of two volcanoes near the center of the Tharsis volcanism . Along with Ulysses Tholus , it is almost midway between Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes . It is approximately 170 kilometers ( 110 mi ) long and 100 kilometers ( 62 mi ) wide , rising about 3 kilometers ( 1.9 mi ) from its surroundings . In the middle of the volcano is a caldera , named Biblis Patera , believed to have formed as the result of collapse of the magma chamber during eruptions of the volcano . The caldera is 53 kilometers ( 33 mi ) in diameter and four kilometers ( 2.5 miles ) in depth . - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - Mount Everest, also known in Nepal as Sagarmth and in China as Chomolungma/, is earth's highest mountain. Its peak is above sea level. Mount Everest is in the Mahalangur Range. The international border between China (Tibet Autonomous Region) and Nepal runs across Everest's summit point. Its massif includes neighbouring peaks Lhotse, ; Nuptse, , and Changtse, . - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges. - A magma chamber is a large underground pool of liquid rock found beneath the surface of the Earth. The molten rock in such a chamber is under great pressure, and given enough time, that pressure can gradually fracture the rock around it creating outlets for the magma. If it finds a way to the surface, then the result will be a volcanic eruption; consequently many volcanoes are situated over magma chambers. Magma chambers are hard to detect, and most of the known ones are therefore close to the surface of the Earth, commonly between 1 km and 10 km under the surface. In geological terms, this is extremely close to the surface, although in human terms, it is considerably deep underground.

Gaelic Ireland (Irish: Eire Ghaidhealach) was the Gaelic political and social order, and associated culture, that existed in Ireland from the prehistoric era until the early 17th century. Before the Norman invasion of 1169, Gaelic Ireland comprised the whole island. Thereafter, it comprised that part of the country not under foreign dominion at a given time. For most of its history, Gaelic Ireland was a \\"patchwork\\" hierarchy of territories ruled by a hierarchy of kings or chiefs, who were elected through tanistry. Warfare was common in Gaelic Ireland, as territories fought for supremacy against each other and (later) against the Anglo-Normans. Champion warfare is a common theme in Irish mythology. In the Middle Ages all able-bodied men, apart from the learned and the clergy, were eligible for military service on behalf of the king or chief. Throughout the Middle Ages and for some time after, outsiders often wrote that the style of Irish warfare differed greatly from what they deemed to be the norm in Western Europe. The Gaelic Irish preferred hit-and-run raids (the crech), which involved catching the enemy unaware. If this worked they would then seize any valuables (mainly livestock) and potentially valuable hostages, burn the crops, and escape. The cattle raid was often called a Tain Bo in Gaelic literature. Although hit-and-run raiding was the preferred tactic in medieval times, there were also pitched battles. From at least the 11th century, kings maintained small permanent fighting forces known as \\"troops of the household\\", who were often given houses and land on the king's mensal land. These were well-equipped professional soldiers made up of infantry and cavalry. By the reign of Brian Boru, Irish kings were taking large armies on campaign over long distances and using naval forces in tandem with land forces. A typical medieval Irish army included light infantry, heavy infantry and cavalry. The bulk of the army was made-up of light infantry called ceithern (anglicized 'kern'). The ceithern wandered Ireland offering their services for hire and usually wielded swords, skenes (a kind of long knife), short spears, bows and shields. The cavalry was usually made-up of a king or chieftain and his close relatives. They usually rode without saddles but wore armour and iron helmets and wielded swords, skenes and long spears or lances. One kind of Irish cavalry was the hobelar. After the Norman invasion there emerged a kind of heavy infantry called galloglaigh (anglicized 'gallo[w]glass'). They were originally Scottish mercenaries who appeared in the 13th century, but by the 15th century most large tuatha had their own hereditary force of Irish galloglaigh. Some Anglo-Norman lordships also began using galloglaigh in imitation of the Irish. They usually wore mail and iron helmets and wielded sparth axes, claymores, and sometimes spears or lances. The galloglaigh furnished the retreating plunderers with a \\"moving line of defence from which the horsemen could make short, sharp charges, and behind which they could retreat when pursued\\". As their armour made them less nimble, they were sometimes planted at strategic spots along the line of retreat. The kern, horsemen and galloglaigh had lightly-armed servants to carry their weapons into battle. Warriors were sometimes rallied into battle by blowing horns and warpipes. According to Gerald de Barri (in the 12th century), they did not wear armour, as they deemed it burdensome to wear and \\"brave and honourable\\" to fight without it. Instead, most ordinary soldiers fought semi-naked and carried only their weapons and a small round shield--Spenser wrote that these shields were covered with leather and painted in bright colours. Kings and chiefs sometimes went into battle wearing helmets adorned with eagle feathers. For ordinary soldiers, their thick hair often served as a helmet, but they sometimes wore simple helmets made from animal hides.","completion":"This text is about Gaelic Ireland, which refers to the Gaelic political and social order, as well as the associated culture, that existed in Ireland from the prehistoric era until the early 17th century."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The butcher nodded, acknowledging Vuk's information and took a deep breath, both of them fully aware of the gravity of the situation they found themselves in. The infected, once humans, now roamed their city and hunted the few survivors left, turning them into more of their own kind. Vuk and the butcher had joined forces out of necessity, as teamwork greatly increased their chances of survival. As the butcher finished reloading, he handed Vuk a spare revolver he had picked up earlier, ensuring they both had a means to defend themselves. Sensing they shared a mutual understanding, both men knew they would have to trust one another in order to navigate the treacherous landscape of their once-familiar world. They crept closer to the corner, weapons in hand, prepared to confront whatever horrors lay beyond it. Vuk peeped around the corner, trying to discern the location of the infected that killed the one who had almost taken his life. The smoke billowing from the seemingly impossibly tall stack made it difficult to see anything at first, but gradually, Vuk could make out certain shapes and lines in the dense mist. He saw the silhouette of a hunched figure, blood dripping down its now lifeless face, but no sign of the one responsible for it. Vuk knew he had to be careful – one wrong move, and it would mark the difference between life and death for both him and the butcher. The butcher, sensing Vuk's hesitation, devised a plan. He pulled a jury-rigged Molotov cocktail from his bag and lit the cloth trapped in the bottle's mouth. He whispered to Vuk, \\"On the count of three, I'll throw this into the mist. It should give us a clear line of sight and force whoever took down that infected toward us.\\" Vuk nodded, knowing the situation required risks, and they braced themselves for what was to come. As the butcher counted down, Vuk tightened his grip on the revolver, his heart pounding in his chest. The moment the butcher reached \\"three,\\" he hurled the makeshift weapon as far away from them as possible, letting it shatter and explode in a burst of fire. Flames engulfed part of the mist, revealing the empty top of the smokestack and a horde of infected converging on the source of the noise and light. Taking advantage of the chaos, a masked figure slid down the ladder from the smokestack, landing in a crouch next to the pair. The butcher and Vuk aimed their weapons at him, unsure whether their mysterious savior intended to help or harm. The figure raised his hands, his voice low and measured as he explained how he had been following them for some time, admiring their tenacity and resourcefulness. He had taken out one of the infected just in time to save Vuk from certain death, but had remained hidden, not wanting to reveal his presence until he felt it was absolutely necessary. Vuk, recognizing he owed his life to this stranger, realized they needed all the help they could get in this new, hostile world. In a somber tone, he offered the figure an opportunity to join them in their journey for survival. Expressing gratitude for their trust, the stranger accepted, introducing himself as Marek. The butcher, Vuk, and Marek formed a reluctant but determined alliance, vowing to lean on each other amid the harsh new reality they were thrust into. Together, the trio faced both the infected and the dangers of the desolate environment, forging ahead into the unknown, doing whatever it took to cling onto life for just one more day. Their journey through adversity tested the limits of their trust, ingenuity, and resilience.

Please answer a question about the following article about Gamal Abdel Nasser: Zakaria Mohieddin, who was Nasser's vice president, said that Nasser gradually changed during his reign. He ceased consulting his colleagues and made more and more of the decisions himself. Although Nasser repeatedly said that a war with Israel will start at a time of his, or Arab, choosing, on 1967 he started a bluffing game \\"but a successful bluff means your opponent must not know which cards you are holding. In this case Nasser's opponent could see his hand in the mirror and knew he was only holding a pair of deuces\\" and Nasser knew that his army is not prepared yet. \\"All of this was out of character...His tendencies in this regard may have been accentuated by diabetes... That was the only rational explanation for his actions in 1967\\". What did Mohieddin attribute Nassir's mistakes in 1967 to?","completion":"Zakaria Mohieddin, who served as Gamal Abdel Nasser's vice president, attributed Nasser's mistakes in 1967 to a combination of factors. Firstly, he observed that Nasser had gradually changed during his reign, increasingly making decisions on his own without consulting his colleagues. This shift in Nasser's leadership style might have led him to make less-informed decisions and take risks without proper guidance. Secondly, Mohieddin highlighted Nasser's unsuccessful bluffing game in the context of the 1967 Arab-Israeli conflict. Nasser had repeatedly claimed that the timing of a war with Israel would be determined by him or the Arab states; however, in 1967, he began bluffing about his military readiness. The problem was that Israel could \\"see his hand in the mirror\\" and knew that he was bluffing, as they were aware that his army was not yet prepared for war. This unsuccessful bluff resulted in a dangerous miscalculation, which ultimately led to Egypt's defeat in the Six-Day War. Lastly, Mohieddin suggested that Nasser's out-of-character actions during this period could be partially attributed to his diabetes. This was the only rational explanation that Mohieddin could provide for Nasser's unusual choices in 1967, implying that his medical condition might have affected his decision-making abilities and exacerbated his tendency to make risky moves without consulting his colleagues. Overall, Mohieddin attributed Nasser's mistakes in 1967 to the combination of his changing leadership style, unsuccessful bluffing, and potential health-related factors."},{"prompt":"Given the question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Your stomach digests the food - Sugars from food enter your bloodstream - Insulin helps turn sugars into energy - Insulin helps your body store the energy in fat, muscle and liver cells - The answer is:","completion":"You consume food."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Kirill says he will, if the master will come to the monastery and ask for him personally, in front of all the monks. To his bitter disappointment, he sends someone else, to ask for Andrei instead. Andrei agrees to go, but Danila refuses, when Andrei asks him to accompany him. Andrei is devastated. The next morning, he goes to Danilas cell and confesses, We have shared the same cell for years.

Answer:","completion":"William Henry Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton, was born on 24 December 1724 and passed away on 14 September 1808. He was the youngest son of Sir Thomas Lyttelton, the 4th baronet. Not expecting to inherit his family's estates, William took up various government appointments throughout his years. In 1755, he was appointed as the Governor of Colonial South Carolina, where he played a crucial role in America's fight for independence. He held this office for a few years before being appointed as the Governor of Jamaica in 1760 and later as the envoy-extraordinary to Portugal in 1766. Lyttelton was raised to the Irish peerage in 1776 as Baron Westcote. His predecessor in the Irish peerage was Ambrose Aungier, 2nd Earl of Longford. After the death of his nephew, Thomas Lyttelton, the 2nd Baron Lyttelton in 1779, William inherited the family baronetcy and the estates in Frankley, Halesowen, and Hagley. However, the estates in Upper Arley passed to the late Lord's sister Lucy, wife of Arthur Annesley, 1st Earl of Mountnorris. The title Baron Lyttelton was revived for Baron Westcote (William Henry Lyttelton) in 1794. He married twice during his lifetime. His first wife was Martha Macartney, daughter and coheir of James Macartney of Longford, nephew and coheir of Ambrose Aungier, 2nd Earl of Longford. They had three children, one of whom was George Fulke Lyttelton, who succeeded him as the 2nd Baron Lyttelton. His second wife was Caroline Bristow, with whom he had two children, including William Henry Lyttelton, who later became the 3rd Baron Lyttelton. In summary, William Henry Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton, held various offices, such as Governor of Colonial South Carolina, Governor of Jamaica, and envoy-extraordinary to Portugal during his years. His successor was his son, George Fulke Lyttelton, as the 2nd Baron Lyttelton. His predecessor in the Irish peerage was Ambrose Aungier, 2nd Earl of Longford."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a sentence in the Swedish language and your task is to convert it into the English language.

Maurice put up flyers for the new salon to try to get more customers after canceling the online ads, because the","completion":"online ads campaign had not been as effective as he had hoped. He chose to distribute the flyers in strategic locations around the city, where potential clientele frequented. These locations included coffee shops, gyms, malls, and public transportation hubs. Maurice knew that in order for the new salon to thrive, he needed to reach the right audience: people who are interested in fashion, looking for a change, or simply in need of a convenient salon experience. To make the flyers more attractive, Maurice collaborated with a local graphic designer to create an eye-catching layout with intriguing visuals, ensuring the salon's services and promotions stood out. The flyers showcased the salon's chic interior, skilled staff, and a variety of hair and beauty services. In addition, the flyers included a limited time promotional offer - a 20% discount on the first visit as an extra incentive for potential clients to give his salon a try. Maurice also decided to share the flyers with his family, friends, and established customers, encouraging them to spread the word about the new salon and refer their networks. Word-of-mouth marketing has always been a powerful tool; by leveraging personal connections, Maurice was optimistic about attracting new customers and securing repeat visits. To gauge the impact of the flyers campaign, Maurice implemented a system to track the number of new customers acquired from the promotional offer. He made a note of asking clients how they had heard about the salon and diligently recorded this information. This would not only help Maurice evaluate the success of the flyer distribution but also provide valuable insights on which locations and demographics were most responsive to his marketing efforts. Moreover, Maurice recognized the importance of social media in today's business landscape and, although he had canceled the online ads, he continued to be active on social media platforms to promote the salon. He shared images of the flyer on the salon's official Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter accounts and invited his followers to like, share, and repost the content. This approach, combined with regularly showcasing his stylists' work on various social media channels, generated a buzz around the salon, piquing people's curiosity and earning new clients. Within a few weeks, Maurice began to notice an increase in walk-ins and appointments, as well as a rise in positive online reviews from satisfied customers. The salon's reputation started to grow, and soon, it became the talk of the town. Encouraged by these results, Maurice decided to set up a loyalty program to retain the newfound customer base and reward them for their continued support. He developed a rewards system where customers would earn points for every service they received, which could later be redeemed for discounts on future visits. Additionally, he initiated a referral program, where both the referrer and referee would receive a discount on their next service. This not only encouraged client retention but also facilitated continuous word-of-mouth promotion. In conclusion, Maurice's strategic decision to cancel the ineffective online ads and switch to a more targeted and personal method of promoting his salon proved to be successful. By leveraging the power of flyers, word-of-mouth marketing, and social media, Maurice attracted and retained new clients, consequently securing the growth and success of his salon in an increasingly competitive market."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Jan wanders off on her own and encounters a shifty reptilian character in a white suit who introduces himself as \\"B.L. Zebubb\\", a record producer. He and his weasel assistant, Weez Weezel, offer her fame and fortune in exchange for signing a contract in blood. Jan does not read the fine print and trusts B.L., signing herself over to his record production company. Little does she suspect that B.L. is none other than the Devil himself, and at the height of her fame he will return to collect her soul. To assist her, Weez conjures three band members from thin air, a rabbit (Rabbit Delight), a beaver (Boom Boom Beaver), and a praying mantis (Pray Mantis). As \\"Funky Jan\\", Jan is soon the most popular rock star on the planet while the oblivious Daniel is left out in the cold. But when B.L. comes for her soul and she realizes what she has done, a distraught Jan goes to Daniel for help. A trial is held in the woods at night over Jan's soul, with Weez as the judge and Daniel acting as Jan's attorney. As an additional stipend, the Devil states that should Daniel lose the trial, his soul as well as Jan's will be taken as payment. At first, the trial seems hopeless, considering Daniel has no education as a lawyer and cannot present even the beginnings of a reasonable argument to release Jan. Having nothing else to offer, Daniel begins to sing a heartfelt song. Jan joins in, as do her three heretofore unhelpful band members.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No, the answer provided does not correctly address the question regarding the commander of the United Nations (UN) forces in Korea. The question is asking for the name of the commander who led the United Nations forces during the Korean War. The United Nations Command (UNC) was a multinational force created in response to North Korea's invasion of South Korea in 1950. The UN forces were comprised of military personnel from several countries, most notably the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and others. The correct answer to your question is that General Douglas MacArthur was appointed the commander of the UN forces in Korea at the onset of the Korean War in 1950. Gen. MacArthur was a distinguished and experienced military leader, having played key roles during World War I, World War II, and the post-war administration of Japan. He commanded the UN forces during the early crucial stages of the Korean War, including the Inchon Landing and the retreat from North Korea after the Chinese intervention. However, the leadership of UN forces in Korea changed later in the war. In April 1951, President Harry S. Truman relieved Gen. MacArthur of his command, as he disagreed with MacArthur's proposed strategy for the conflict, which included aggressive actions against China. At that point, General Matthew Ridgway was appointed as the new commander of UN forces in Korea, who served in this position through the remainder of the war. Ultimately, the Korean War ended with an armistice signed on July 27, 1953, leading to the continued division of the Korean Peninsula along the 38th parallel.

(CNN) -- With a probate court trial over the sale of the Los Angeles Clippers scheduled to begin Monday, lawyers for Donald Sterling filed paperwork Thursday to have the matter moved to federal court. Donald Sterling's estranged wife, Shelly, is asking a probate judge to approve an agreement she reached with billionaire Steve Ballmer to sell the NBA team. For years, she and her husband had equal shares in the franchise through a family trust, but Shelly Sterling negotiated a deal in late May to sell the team after two doctors declared her husband was mentally incapacitated. Donald Sterling's lawyers filed a notice of removal in U.S. District Court in central California requesting the change of courts. For the team to be sold, either OPTIONS: - CNN would have to sign a binding term sheet or a court would have to agree Shelly Sterling acted legally in selling the team. - California would have to sign a binding term sheet or a court would have to agree Shelly Sterling acted legally in selling the team. - Clippers would have to sign a binding term sheet or a court would have to agree Shelly Sterling acted legally in selling the team. - Donald Sterling would have to sign a binding term sheet or a court would have to agree Shelly Sterling acted legally in selling the team. - Los Angeles Clippers would have to sign a binding term sheet or a court would have to agree Shelly Sterling acted legally in selling the team. - NBA would have to sign a binding term sheet or a court would have to agree Shelly Sterling acted legally in selling the team. - Shelly would have to sign a binding term sheet or a court would have to agree Shelly Sterling acted legally in selling the team. - Shelly Sterling would have to sign a binding term sheet or a court would have to agree Shelly Sterling acted legally in selling the team. - Steve Ballmer would have to sign a binding term sheet or a court would have to agree Shelly Sterling acted legally in selling the team. - U.S. District Court would have to sign a binding term sheet or a court would have to agree Shelly Sterling acted legally in selling the team.","completion":"For the team to be sold, either Donald Sterling would have to sign a binding term sheet or a court would have to agree Shelly Sterling acted legally in selling the team. The situation at hand revolves around the legality and control over the sale of the Los Angeles Clippers, which is caught in a dispute between Donald Sterling and his estranged wife, Shelly Sterling. Shelly has already negotiated a deal with billionaire Steve Ballmer to sell the team, but Donald Sterling's consent or legal validation of Shelly's actions is necessary for the sale to push through successfully. Thus, the court's role becomes crucial in determining if Shelly Sterling had the legal authority to sell the NBA team without her husband's consent. If the court finds that Shelly Sterling acted within her legal rights, then the sale can proceed even without Donald Sterling's approval. However, if Donald Sterling decides to sign a binding term sheet, it would mean he has agreed to the sale, and the dispute would essentially be resolved."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Martin's first recording session with the Beatles took place at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London on 6 June 1962. Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place. Already contemplating Best's dismissal, the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them. A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of \\"Love Me Do\\" featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"P.S. I Love You\\".Martin initially selected the Starr version of \\"Love Me Do\\" for the band's first single, though subsequent re-pressings featured the White version, with Starr on tambourine. Released in early October, \\"Love Me Do\\" peaked at number seventeen on the Record Retailer chart. Their television debut came later that month with a live performance on the regional news programme People and Places. After Martin suggested rerecording \\"Please Please Me\\" at a faster tempo, a studio session in late November yielded that recording, of which Martin accurately predicted, \\"You've just made your first No.1.\\"In December 1962, the Beatles concluded their fifth and final Hamburg residency. By 1963, they had agreed that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group. Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist. Epstein, in an effort to maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing.

You might not mean to but you do. One out of three people collects tangible things such as cats, photos and noisy toys. There are among some 40 collections that are being shown at \\"The Museum Of\\"--the first of several new museums which, over the next two years, will exhibit the objects accumulated by unknown collectors. In doing so, they will promote a popular culture of museums, not what museums normally represent. Some of the collections are fairly common--records, model houses. Others are strangely beautiful--branches that have fallen from tree, for example. But they all reveal a lot of things: ask someone what they collect and their answers will tell you who they are. Other on the way include \\"The museum of Collectors\\" and \\"The Museum of Me.\\"These new ones, it is hoped, will build on the success of \\"The Museum Of.\\" The thinkers behind the project want to explore why people collect, and what it means to do so. They hope that visitors who may not have considered themselves collectors will begin to see they, too, collect. Some collectors say they started or stopped making collections at important point: the beginning or end of adolescence--\\"it's a growing-up thing; you stop when you grow up,\\"says one. Other painful times are mentioned, such as the end of a relationship. For time and life can seem so uncontrollable that a steady serial arrangement is comforting. Question: What can be learned about collectors from their collections? Answer: A:","completion":"From their collections, it can be learned that collectors often have unique personalities, interests, and experiences that shape their choice of items to collect. Collections can provide insight into the individual's values, preferences, and passions, offering a glimpse into their identity and personal story. Collections can range from fairly common items, such as records and model houses, to more eccentric and strangely beautiful objects, such as fallen tree branches. The variety in collections highlights the diversity of interests and creative expressions amongst collectors. Some collectors begin or stop making collections at significant points in their lives, such as the beginning or end of adolescence or the end of a relationship. This suggests that collecting can serve as a coping mechanism for individuals undergoing life transitions or emotional turmoil. The sense of order and control offered by gathering and maintaining collections may provide comfort and stability when other aspects of life seem unpredictable and overwhelming. Furthermore, collecting may serve as a form of self-expression, personal achievement, or an avenue to develop expertise in a particular subject matter. The act of collecting can contribute to one's sense of identity and purpose, as well as foster a sense of belonging within a community of like-minded individuals who share similar interests. In conclusion, collections can reveal a wealth of information about collectors, including their personalities, interests, experiences, and motivations. By examining the types of items collected and the circumstances surrounding the creation or cessation of a collection, we can gain a better understanding of the individual behind the collection and the personal significance it holds for them. The new museums, such as \\"The Museum Of,\\" \\"The Museum of Collectors,\\" and \\"The Museum of Me,\\" aim to promote this understanding of the human desire to collect and the valuable insights it can provide into an individual's life and identity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world. Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction. Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith.

Begin by adding both sides of the equation by 8x to eliminate the term with x from the right side of the equation: -6x + 8x = -8x + 8x + 6 Now, simplify: 2x = 6 2. Now, we need to isolate the variable x.

Answer the question...how many layers are there in osi model??","completion":"The OSI model, short for Open Systems Interconnection model, is a conceptual framework used to standardize the functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. It was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as a way to improve compatibility and communication between different networks and computing systems. The OSI model divides the functions of a network into seven distinct layers, each of which is responsible for performing a specific set of tasks and interacting with the layers directly above and below it. Here is a detailed explanation of each of the seven layers in the OSI model: 1. Physical Layer (Layer 1): The lowest layer of the OSI model, the physical layer is responsible for the physical connection between devices, including electrical, mechanical, and functional means. This encompasses everything from the type of cable being used to the physical network topology. It is also responsible for converting digital data into electrical signals for transmission over network cables, as well as receiving and converting those electrical signals back into digital data upon receipt. 2. Data Link Layer (Layer 2): This layer establishes and maintains reliable communication between devices on the same network segment. It focuses on error detection and correction, as well as the management of data frames being transmitted between devices. Additionally, the data link layer is responsible for defining the MAC (Media Access Control) address, which uniquely identifies devices within a local network. 3. Network Layer (Layer 3): The network layer is responsible for identifying and selecting the best path for data transmission between devices, often spanning multiple network segments. This is where routers and IP (Internet Protocol) addressing come into play, with each device being assigned a unique IP address to enable proper routing of data packets between source and destination devices. 4. Transport Layer (Layer 4): This layer is responsible for the reliable transmission of data between devices across a network. It primarily focuses on error detection, error recovery, and ensuring that data is delivered in the correct order. Two commonly used transport layer protocols are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). TCP provides error-checking and reliability, while UDP prioritizes speed over reliability, which might be preferable in applications like real-time video streaming where minor data loss is acceptable. 5. Session Layer (Layer 5): The session layer is responsible for establishing, maintaining, and terminating connections, or \\"sessions,\\" between devices on a network. This layer manages the synchronization of data exchange and coordinates the communication between the devices involved in a session. It also takes care of any necessary authentication and authorization processes. 6. Presentation Layer (Layer 6): This layer acts as a translator between application data and network data formats, ensuring that the data is formatted correctly for the intended recipient. Responsibilities include data encryption, compression, and character set translation (e.g., converting between ASCII and Unicode). The presentation layer essentially serves as an intermediary between the application layer and lower-level network layers. 7. Application Layer (Layer 7): The highest layer in the OSI model, the application layer deals with the software applications and end-user processes that interact with the network. This layer is responsible for providing user interfaces, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), and other services like email, file transfers, and web browsing. Examples of application layer protocols are HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for web browsing, FTP (File Transfer Protocol) for file transfers, and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for email communication. In summary, the OSI model comprises seven layers: the Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, Session Layer, Presentation Layer, and Application Layer. Each layer is responsible for performing certain tasks and directly interacts with adjacent layers in the model, allowing for effective communication and data transmission between different networks and devices. The OSI model has played a pivotal role in facilitating the standardization and interoperability of network technologies around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

There was a boy named Chan who loved his parents, though they did not love him back; he was not even given a first name. He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there.

It was also found that there is a strong East- West difference. In places like the US, blogs that offer information on news attract more readers but in China, blogs are more likely to be about sharing personal feelings. It seems that bloggers can be divided into three types: IT bloggers, bloggers who record their ordinary feelings and media bloggers. When blogging first started, the IT people had the technological advantage and they took the chance to put their thoughts on the web. Some of these IT people now have had over a million people read their blogs. The next wave of bloggers did not have any training as writers or in IT and wrote about normal daily life. Media bloggers, however, are trained writers, such as journalists and editors. When the many media bloggers , the everyday bloggers lost most of their readers. Media bloggers have the advantage of knowing how to communicate well through the written words. However, the normal bloggers are still out there and increasing in number. It seems that blogging is the new way to express your feelings. People feel like the world is listening to, or rather reading, their problems, even if they are not.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: If you have said or done something that was insensitive or hurtful to a specific person or group, you should apologize. You should also apologize when you make a mistake. Never try to cover up your mistakes by shifting blame to another person. For example, imagine you invite friends over and order pizza. You forget that one of your friends is a vegetarian, and ordered only meat lovers pizzas. This oversight can make it look like you didn’t care enough to consider that friend’s preference. In this case, you should apologize for the mistake and try to fix it (order a cheese pizza). Some people are apologize compulsively. When you over apologize, people may take it for granted that you assume they are right. This will leave the impression that you have low self-esteem and that you are not secure in your opinions. Aside from weakening your stance on an issue, this will bring the sincerity of any serious apologies into question. For example, if you say “I’m sorry,” every time you pour yourself the last cup of coffee or take the last napkin, saying I’m sorry,” might be taken as insignificant when you make a mistake like spilling your coffee on your boss. You should not apologize for being honest. If you respectfully state your opinion or stance on an issue, there is no need to apologize. If you make a decision that you feel was for the best, you should not apologize. You can look at the other person’s viewpoint and validate their opinion, but you should not invalidate your own. For example, if you say something like “Studies show that the economy needs to be diversified with more renewable energy jobs to be competitive in the future,” you should not apologize to someone just because they work in the fossil fuel industry and disagree.

Here's how I proceed: \\"In an endearing incident echoing the power of simple, sentimental moments, Christina Cooper, the loss-prevention lead supervisor at the renowned La Torretta Lake Resort, recently found herself center stage in a heartwarming tale involving a returned stuffed animal, a 'lambie', with a special message for its young owner.\\" Step 2: Detailing the Main Characters Next, I would have to flesh out the characters in our story.

In fact, so many solutes can dissolve in water that water has been called the universal solvent. Even rocks can dissolve in water, which explains the cave that opened this article. A solute that can dissolve in a given solvent, such as water, is said to be soluble in that solvent. Conversely, a solute that cannot dissolve in a given solvent is said to be insoluble in that solvent. Q: What liquid is referred to as the \\"universal solvent\\"? A: A:","completion":"The liquid that is referred to as the \\"universal solvent\\" is water. In the context provided, the term \\"universal solvent\\" depicts the unique capability of water to dissolve a vast number of different solutes. Solutes cover a wide range of substances, and these include but are not limited to substances like salts, sugars, acids, alkalis, some gases and even some organic molecules. The reason water is able to dissolve so many different substances is anchored on its polar nature. Water molecules have a slight electric charge due to the nature of the bond between the hydrogen and the oxygen atoms that comprise water. This means that water has 'positive' and 'negative' ends or poles. Consequently, it interacts with many different types of molecules, especially those that also have electric charges or those that can develop charges, leading them to break down or dissolve in water. For instance, when table salt (sodium chloride) comes into contact with water, the positive end of a water molecule is attracted to the chloride ions (negative), and the negative end of the water molecule is attracted to the sodium ions (positive). Through these attractions, water can cause the ions to separate from one another and become thoroughly mixed into the water, effectively causing the salt to dissolve. The solubility of rocks leading to the formation of caves, as mentioned in the paragraph, is also a product of this unique property of water. Over significant periods of time, water can break down certain types of rocks like limestone; it seeps into cracks in the rock, freezes, expands and causes the rock to further fracture, through this cyclic process, it can over time cause enough break down to form a cave. So, when a substance is described as being soluble, it means that it can be dissolved in a solvent, such as water. The opposite, insoluble, refers to a substance that cannot be dissolved in a solvent. Hence, referring to water as the 'universal solvent' highlights its remarkable ability to dissolve more substances than any other liquid."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Es könnte Chile zwar daran hindern, sich vor den Launen der Kapitalmärkte zu schützen, es könnte aber auch sein, dass es weder zu einem wirklich freien noch zu einem ausgewogenen Handel führt. Translate to English","completion":"Although Chile may be prevented from protecting itself from the whims of the capital markets, it could also be the case that it leads neither to truly free nor to balanced trade. Chile, as a country with a strong focus on export-oriented industries, could potentially face difficulties in protecting itself from the fluctuations and unpredictable nature of the global capital markets. A series of factors, domestic and international, can have significant impacts on Chile's economic stability, as well as the fairness and balance of its trade relationships with other nations. First, let's consider the global economic context. Volatility in capital markets often arises from factors outside of a nation's control, such as geopolitical tensions, financial crises, global recessions, or even unforeseen worldwide events. These external factors can pose an immense challenge for export-dependent countries such as Chile, as they can lead to significant fluctuations in demand for their products and services. As a result, Chile may find it challenging to shield its economy from the negative impacts of these external events, which can lead to economic instability and a lack of balanced trade. Moreover, the structure of Chile's economy presents additional challenges. Chile is well-known for its dependence on the export of commodities, particularly copper, which constitutes a significant portion of the country's GDP and export earnings. This heavy reliance on a single commodity can render the economy susceptible to fluctuations in copper prices, which can be influenced by a multitude of factors, both domestic and international, such as shifts in global demand, changes in mining industries, and varying trade policies. As such, the composition of Chile's trading partners and the nature of its trade agreements also play a pivotal role in determining the balance of its trade. Countries that primarily engage in trade with a small number of partners, or with partners that hold overwhelming economic power, may find themselves in more vulnerable positions, as their trade balance can be disproportionately affected by the actions and policies of these partners. This could lead to situations where Chile is unable to achieve truly free or balanced trade, as it may become subject to the interests and demands of its more powerful trading partners. Furthermore, industrial policies and domestic issues within Chile can contribute to the country's struggles relating to free and balanced trade. For example, subsidies or protectionist measures adopted by the government might hamper Chile's ability to compete fairly in the global marketplace. Additionally, domestic issues such as socioeconomic inequality, lack of access to quality education, and inadequate infrastructure can put constraints on the nation's internal growth and development, ultimately affecting its international trade and economic stability. In conclusion, Chile may find it challenging to protect itself from the whims of the capital markets, in part due to its export-dependent economy and reliance on commodities like copper, as well as the influence of various external factors. Furthermore, the balance and fairness of Chile's trade relationships can be affected by its trading partners, domestic policies, and internal constraints. Consequently, the country might find it difficult to achieve a state of truly free and balanced trade."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the building that remains in use by the Church of England? St Denys' Church, Sleaford, is a medieval Anglican parish church in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, England. While a church and a priest have probably been present in the settlement since approximately 1086, the oldest parts of the present building are the tower and spire, which date to the late 12th and early 13th centuries; the stone broach spire is one of the earliest examples of its kind in England. The Decorated Gothic nave, aisles and north transept were built in the 14th century. The church was altered in the 19th century: the north aisle was rebuilt by the local builders Kirk and Parry in 1853 and the tower and spire were largely rebuilt in 1884 after being struck by lightning. St Denys' remains in use for worship by the Church of England. The church is a Grade I listed building, a national designation given to \\"buildings of exceptional interest\\". It is a prime example of Decorated Gothic church architecture in England, with the architectural historians Sir Nikolaus Pevsner and John Harris noting that \\"it is a prolonged delight to follow the mason's inventiveness\\". The church's tracery has attracted special praise, with Simon Jenkins arguing that its Decorated windows are \\"works of infinite complexity\\". Built out of Ancaster stone with a lead roof, St Denys' is furnished with a medieval rood screen and a communion rail, possibly by Sir Christopher Wren, and has a peal of eight bells, dating to 1796. The church also houses several memorials, including two altar tombs commemorating members of the Carre family, Sleaford's lords of the manor in the 17th century. The answer is:","completion":"The full name of the building that remains in use by the Church of England is St Denys' Church, Sleaford."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here's a step-by-step process for the solution: 1. Create a matrix with the shape (len(A) + 1) x (len(B) + 1). This will help in recording lengths of common subsequence through the iterations. 2. Iterate through each row (i) and column (j) in the matrix, starting from row 1 and column 1 (we leave row 0 and column 0 with 0s, which will help in our calculations). 3. If A[i-1] equals to B[j-1] (meaning the current elements of A and B are same), then matrix[i][j] = matrix[i-1][j-1] + 1. This implies that we are increasing the length of previously found common subsequence by 1. 4. If A[i-1] is not equal to B[j-1], then matrix[i][j] = max(matrix[i-1][j], matrix[i][j-1]). This means we are taking the maximum length of previously found common subsequences in row i or column j. 5. Once we fill in the entire matrix, the value at the bottom-right corner of the matrix (matrix[len(A)][len(B)]) will indicate the length of the longest common subsequence. 6. To find the actual subsequence, we backtrack from the bottom-right corner to the top-left corner in the matrix, while comparing elements in A and B: a. If A[i-1] is equal to B[j-1], include the element in the subsequence and move diagonally up-left in the matrix. b. If not, choose the direction (up or left) with the higher value in the matrix and continue making the choice until reaching the top-left corner. 7. Reverse the obtained longest common subsequence to get the correct order of elements in the subsequence. Given the lists A = [6731, 'U', 3385, 'a', 'Q', '2103', '1781', '2215', 'I', 4463, 'N'] and B = [3807, 1105, 'F', 'r', 'a', 'Q', '2103', '1781', '2215', 'y', 7587]: By following the steps, we find that the longest common subsequence in lists A and B is ['a', 'Q', '2103', '1781', '2215']."},{"prompt":"What is the final step of the following process: - A dam is built in an area prone to flooding - A large amount of rain occurs - The water builds up behind the dam - The dam opens its floodgates when it starts to get full - The water flows into a river below the dam - The dam closes its gates - The dam will occasionally open its gates again to gradually release more water","completion":"The final step is the dam occasionally opening its gates again to gradually release more water."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To do this, add 19*p to both sides of the equation to move the term with p on the left side to the right side: -19*p + 19*p - 4308 = 71*p + 19*p + 1632 -4308 = 90*p + 1632 Now, subtract 1632 from both sides to move the constant on the right side to the left side: -4308 - 1632 = 90*p + 1632 - 1632 -5940 = 90*p Step 3: Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable (90) to solve for p: -5940/90 = 90*p/90 After dividing, we get: -66 = p So, the solution for the equation -19*p - 2951 - 1357 = 71*p + 1632 is p = -66."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He starts the chase, until he runs into a large truck. Wile E. runs the other way, and the truck shows the credit. The chase ends in a win for the truck, and the Coyote emerges battered. A box with director Chuck Jones' credit then squashes him. The Coyote throws the box away, and the shot freezes: COYOTE - Eatius Birdius. He resumes the chase, which freezes to show the Road Runner: Delicius-Delicius. The chase continues down the road until the Road Runner makes a U-turn. The Coyote turns around, then stops. The Road Runner completes the circuit around, meanwhile, and beeps as the Coyote turns around, causing him to leap back.

He drops them and thinks of his new plan. 1. Wile E. hides in a manhole, and as the Road Runner passes over him, he pops out and fires a rifle. The bullet and the Road Runner are shown in slow time, with the bullet closing to within a half-body length of the bird. Then the Road Runner turns to notice the threat, lets out a beep and gears into super speed. The bullet then brakes in puzzlement and falls to the ground. Wile E. picks it up, and then it detonates. Behind another rock face (in completely different desert scenery), Wile E. paces until he comes up with a new plan. 2. Wile E. leaps out into the road with \\"1 sheet ACME Triple Strength BATTLESHIP STEEL ARMOR PLATE\\" in front of him; even this cannot stop the Road Runner from barreling through it.

Neil always brewed his coffee last thing in the morning unlike Steven because","completion":"Steven preferred to have his coffee first thing when he woke up. But today, Neil's peculiar coffee habit would prove to be a life-changing event. Over the years, Neil had perfected the art of brewing coffee, just the way he liked it. He enjoyed the process of choosing the right beans, grinding them, and using his special French press to create his beloved concoction. The intriguing aroma and the deep, rich taste of his coffee were something he looked forward to at the end of every morning routine. This daily ritual allowed him to fully savor the moment and prepare himself to tackle whatever challenges the day might bring. Steven, on the other hand, was more of a functional coffee drinker. To him, coffee was a necessity, like brushing his teeth or putting on deodorant. Every day, without fail, his first act upon waking would be to roll out of bed and stumble towards the kitchen, eyes half-open, to begin brewing his morning savior. It was a well-rehearsed dance, one that helped him transition from sleepy haze to a fully awake and functioning adult. This particular morning was different, though. Neil, with his passion for toying with different ingredients in his coffee, had picked up a rare coffee bean from the market the other day. An old lady with a cryptic smile had sold it to him, insisting it was sourced from the depths of the Amazon rainforest and claiming it would open his mind to a whole new world of tastes and sensations. Intrigued, Neil had bought the bag of beans for an exorbitant price, only to surprise Steven later in the day. Steven, however, had been anything but thrilled. He considered it a waste of time and money, believing that coffee was just coffee. Undeterred, Neil spent the morning in his typical methodical fashion, grinding the new beans just right, measuring the water temperature, and carefully maintaining the brewing time. The aroma was entrancing, boasting an otherworldly scent. Even Steven seemed to be a little curious now. The moment arrived, and Neil poured the aromatic brew into two cups, presenting one to Steven with a triumphant smile. Tentatively, the two took their first sips, and suddenly they both knew that this coffee was unlike anything they had ever tasted before. It was magical. The flavor was extraordinary, with intense, rich undertones and a hint of exotic spices. But the true wonder laid in the effect. As the brew filled their veins, the world around them changed – subtly yet unmistakably. Colors were magnified, sounds were sharper, and their senses were heightened beyond comprehension. Neil and Steven found themselves experiencing their surroundings in an entirely new way. Each bird's song reverberated through their bones, the air on their skin was electric, and the simple taste of food became a symphony of delight. It was as if they had been granted the ability to connect with the world on a level far beyond their previous understanding. As the day wore on, they began to grapple with their newfound hyper-awareness. It was both thrilling and overwhelming, but they grew to recognize that their lives would never be the same again. Neil, who had long been the more adventurous type, embraced the change wholeheartedly, pursuing further knowledge about the mysterious coffee bean and the meaning behind their enhanced abilities. Steven, on the other hand, was initially unsettled by the transformation, but eventually came to appreciate it. He began to understand the true depth of his friend's love for coffee and the magical unity of their morning ritual. Every morning thereafter, they brewed their coffee together, each with a newfound appreciation for the complexities it could bring. And though the magic of that first, otherworldly cup never quite returned to the same intensity, a small piece of that adventure lingered in every sip, a persistent reminder of the day their lives changed forever."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture. If you’re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture...

Loon island had a very stable environment, and there weren't many diverse species of plants and animals. Wolf island displayed lots of evidence for natural selection, and had a large variety of species inhabiting it. and a hint : New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks. Please answer this question : Which island had more animals that survived their environment? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided and the concept of natural selection, it can be inferred that Wolf Island had more animals that survived their environment in comparison to Loon Island. Loon Island is described as having a very stable environment, which can lead to fewer challenges and less pressure for species to adapt and evolve. Consequently, there might be less diversity on Loon Island as the stability of the environment does not necessitate the development of new adaptations in species, resulting in lesser variation among plant and animal species. On the other hand, Wolf Island exhibits a higher degree of natural selection and is home to a large variety of species. This suggests that the environment in Wolf Island is more dynamic and competitive, leading to various ecological challenges for its inhabitants. It is likely that some species on Wolf Island might have gone extinct due to their inability to adapt and compete effectively. However, the intense process of natural selection means that more surviving species would possess the necessary traits for adapting and thriving in this environment. As a result, the remaining, more diverse species on Wolf Island are better adapted to cope with the environmental pressures, leading to a higher probability of survival over time. In conclusion, natural selection plays a significant role in shaping the species composition and adaptability of organisms in a given environment. Wolf Island, being a more diverse ecosystem that has experienced greater natural selection, has more animals that have survived and adapted to the challenges posed by their environment as compared to the more stable, less diverse Loon Island."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Nobody knows that the diamonds are in possession of an old woman, Milady, who had stolen the diamonds from the duke and had brought them for Rochefort so that they would be nowhere to be found; Rochefort allows her to hold on to the diamonds in order to ensure this. Shortly after entering the academy of musketeers, D'Artagnan meets three of the finest among them, Porthos, Athos and Aramis. Though their first meeting had not gone well and had led to the challenging of several duels, the four of them become fine friends shortly after, since all four fight against the Cardinal's soldiers. When searching for lodging in Paris, D'Artagnan meets the lovely Constance Bonacieux, a good friend of the queen. Cardinal Richelieu orders all of the queen's closest friends to be arrested so that no one will be able to defend her once King Louis decides to have her beheaded. D'Artagnan defends Constance when a group of soldiers try to insolently have her arrested and then takes her to the safety of the queen. Constance trusts the queen and when she learns of the awful accusation that's been laid upon her, the woman asks of D'Artagnan to travel to England and fetch the Duke of Buckingham, the only one who may now save the queen.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Alice's Adventures in Wonderlandis one of the most loved children's books of all time, and many adults enjoy it as well. It tells the story of a young girl named Alice, who follows a rabbit entering a magical world called Wonderland. She has many experiences which seem to change the rules of reasoning or common sense. The popularity of the book comes from its imagination, interesting story, and art work. The writer of the book is Lewis Carroll. In fact, Lewis Carroll was not the writer's real name. His real name was Charles Dodgson. One day, he took a boat ride down the Thames River to have a picnic with three little girls who were friends of the family. To keep them entertained on the ride, he told them a story in which Alice, the middle child, was the main character. They enjoyed the story very much. Charles later wrote the story down under the nameAlice's Adventures Under Groundand gave it to Alice as a Christmas present. Later, he gave a copy to his friend George MacDonald. George read it to his children and they loved it. George suggested to Charles that he make a book from his story. Charles then wrote more parts to the story until it was around 35,000 words. It was first printed in 1866, with art work by John Tenniel, under the nameAlice's Adventures in Wonderland. The book was an immediate success. One of its first fans was Queen Victoria. She immediately requested a collection of all of Lewis Carroll's works. She was surprised to find that they included many works on math. In fact, Charles Dodgson was a highly respected mathematician. This can be seen in many puzzles and plays on reasoning that appear in his books and poems. Since the story was first printed, it has kept selling up to the present day. It has been translated into over fifty languages and has had several movies based on it. Question: Who first had the idea of making a book from the story \\"Alice Adventures Under Ground\\"?

Please answer the following question: Process: - Water is heated - The heated water evaporates - The salt is left behind - The evaporated water condenses on a cold surface - The evaporated water is collected - The process is repeated - More salt is removed from the water. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less global warming occurs happens, how will it affect more evaporation occurs. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, let's analyze each step of the process and address the perturbation hypothesis. Step 1: Water is heated - In this step, water containing salt is heated, typically through an external heat source or solar energy. Step 2: The heated water evaporates - As water is heated, it becomes a vapor and begins to evaporate, leaving the salt behind. Step 3: The salt is left behind - When the water evaporates, the dissolved salt is left behind as solid particles. Step 4: The evaporated water condenses on a cold surface - The water vapor from the evaporation process condenses on a cold surface, forming liquid droplets. Step 5: The evaporated water is collected - The condensed liquid droplets are collected separately as purified water. Step 6: The process is repeated - The process is repeated until most or all of the salt has been removed from the water. Step 7: More salt is removed from the water - With each repetition of the process, additional salt is removed from the water until the desired purity is achieved. Perturbation hypothesis: Suppose less global warming occurs; how will it affect more evaporation? - Global warming typically leads to an increase in average temperatures, which could enhance the evaporation process in some cases (for example, if solar energy is used for heating the water). If less global warming occurs, the effect on evaporation would depend on the specific region and climate conditions. In some cases, less global warming might lead to slower evaporation rates, while in other areas, the difference could be negligible. Regarding the perturbation's effect on the process: - Direct effect: A direct effect of the perturbation on the process would be if the reduction in global warming leads to slower evaporation rates, which in turn could affect the efficiency of the salt removal process. However, this effect would depend on the specific conditions and heat sources used for the process. - Indirect effect: An indirect effect might be observed if a reduction in global warming leads to changes in climate patterns or precipitation rates, influencing the availability or salinity of water sources. These changes could have implications for the need for salt removal processes, such as desalination, in particular regions. In summary, the perturbation of less global warming could have both direct and indirect effects on the process of evaporating and removing salt from the water. The extent of these effects would depend on the specific conditions and heat sources used for the process, as well as how regional climate and precipitation patterns are influenced by the decrease in global warming."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tetraplegic forensics expert Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) and a patrol cop, Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie), team up to solve a string of murders connected to a serial killer by his signature: a single shard of bone removed from each of the victims. Rhyme was paralyzed from the neck down in an earlier accident and is bed-bound and completely reliant on machines and his nurse Thelma (Queen Latifah). The killer poses as a New York City taxi driver and abducts and kills those who get in his taxi. The first victims are a married couple named Alan and Lindsay Rubin that the killer picked up at the airport. Amelia finds Alan's body buried in a Civil War-era railroad bed. She also finds a collection of clues including a pile of piece-ground oyster shells, which eventually leads Amelia - now working with Rhyme - to Alan's wife, and a scrap of paper. The detectives find Mrs. Rubin, too late, at a steam junction in a below-ground services area of a building in the Financial District, secured using old antique handcuffs or shackles at the mouth of a pipe which emits steam. She has been scalded to death from the steam. The killer has also removed a bit of flesh and bone from her arm. Amelia finds another scrap of paper at the scene. The killer then abducts an NYU student, who is taken to a derelict slaughterhouse where he is tied to a pole. Part of his thigh bone is surgically removed, and he is left for rats to feed on.

Since then, many new species have been discovered. The biochemistry of many organisms has also become known. Eventually, scientists realized that Linnaeus’s system of classification needed revision. Q: What scientist created the modern system for classifying organisms? A: A:","completion":"The modern system for classifying organisms is primarily credited to Swedish scientist Carl Linnaeus, who published his classification system in the 1700s. Linnaeus developed a hierarchical system known as binomial nomenclature, which is the basis for the taxonomic classification that we use today. Linnaeus's system categorized organisms based on shared physical and structural characteristics. In his system, each species was given a unique two-part name consisting of a genus and species descriptor. This simplified the naming and identification of organisms, making it easier for scientists to study and communicate about them. However, since Linnaeus's time, many new species have been discovered and our understanding of the biochemistry of organisms has advanced significantly. Additionally, advancements in scientific methods, such as the discovery of DNA and insights from evolutionary biology, have further expanded our knowledge of the relationships among living organisms. As a result, scientists recognized the need to revise Linnaeus's original classification system to incorporate new information and better reflect the true evolutionary relationships among species. Although Linnaeus's system has undergone numerous revisions and updates over the centuries, his foundational ideas and principles continue to shape the design of taxonomic classification systems today. In essence, Carl Linnaeus is considered the father of modern taxonomy and his original system, despite its necessary revisions, serves as the basis for classifying organisms in the present day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Since 0 times any number, x in this case, will always result in 0, the equation simplifies to: 6*x = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable. In order to find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Since x is being multiplied by 6, we can use the inverse operation, division, to achieve this. Divide both sides of the equation by 6: 6*x / 6 = 0 / 6 This simplifies to: x = 0 So, the answer is x = 0.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Arab League suspends Syria mission amid violence Arab League suspends Syria mission (CNN) -- At least 58 people were killed in Syria on Sunday, according to an opposition activist group, as the Arab League suspended a monitoring mission designed to protect Syrian civilians from government-sponsored violence. The dead included 19 in Homs, 12 in Hama and 16 around Damascus, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria. Earlier, another opposition activist group, the Syrian Revolution General Council, said as many as 34 people had died Sunday, including a person who had been killed under torture, a woman and two children. Heavy clashes took place in the Eastern Ghotta area outside Damascus, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. At least 50 people were wounded in random bombardment by government forces, the group said, adding the government forces attacked residential areas and cut off electricity, water and communication. The reported deaths come a day after opposition sources said at least 98 people were killed. CNN cannot independently confirm reports from Syria because the government limits the activity of journalists there. Ali Erfan, senior advisor to Arab League Secretary General Nabil el-Araby, said Sunday that observer activity in Syria has been suspended, and all observers who were outside Damascus have redeployed to the capital. Some will leave the country, he said. Others will stay on for the moment in Damascus, but they will not be conducting any missions, he said, adding that he did not have details on how many are leaving and how many are staying. Russia's foreign minister said earlier Sunday he is in favor of boosting the number of observers in Syria, adding that he did not understand why the Arab League suspended its monitoring mission. \\"We should like to understand why this useful instrument is treated in such a way,\\" Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said, according to reports in Russian state media. The Arab League announced Saturday it was suspending its mission because of a sharp increase in violence. Monitors representing the 22-nation alliance were in Syria to determine whether President Bashar al-Assad's government is abiding by an agreement with the Arab League to end violence against anti-government protesters. \\"I would support an increased number of observers,\\" Lavrov said. There were reports Sunday of violent clashes between Syrian troops and rebel forces, made up primarily of military defectors, in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta, according the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based opposition group. Three people were killed in the violence, the group said. At least 10 Syrian troops were killed when a roadside bomb targeted a military vehicle in the mountains in the northwest province of Idlib, the Observatory group said. A rebel soldier was killed in clashes between the towns of Bloludan and Zabadani, the group said. A roadside bomb targeted a bus carrying Syrian troops in a Damascus suburb, killing six soldiers and wounding six others, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported Sunday. Al-Assad's government has been under international pressure to stop a brutal, months-long crackdown on an anti-government uprising that began last year. The United Nations, the United States, the European Union and members of the Arab League have called on al-Assad to end the violence and step down. The United Nations last month estimated that more than 5,000 people have died since March, when the government launched a crackdown against demonstrators. Activist groups estimate a higher death toll, with counts near or exceeding 7,000 people. The opposition has blamed the deaths on government actions. The Syrian government says terrorists are responsible for the casualties. Diplomats at the U.N. Security Council are considering a draft resolution that calls on al-Assad to step down and transfer power to his vice president. Lavrov said the Arab League plans to submit new proposals to the U.N. Security Council next week. \\"We need to study a report,\\" he said, according to the ITAR-TASS news agency in Russia. Russia, which maintains trade relations with Syria, has proposed its own draft U.N. resolution that assigns equal blame for the violence on both al-Assad and the opposition, an option dismissed by the West. Lavrov said the draft resolution remains up for discussion. In October, Russia and China issued a rare double veto of a resolution that lacked sanctions but would have condemned the violence in Syria. This latest draft also lacks sanctions, but is tougher than the earlier version, which said nothing about transfer of power. France stepped up the pressure on Russia on Saturday, with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe sending a message to his Russian counterpart urging cooperation on Syria. Meanwhile, the Syrian National Council, the major opposition group in Syria, has called on expatriates to show their solidarity by sitting in front of Russian embassies and consulates starting at 2 p.m. ET on Sunday. There will be a Monday meeting of experts from the missions of the 15 countries on the Security Council. Syrian ambassador to the United Nations, Bashar Ja'afari, has dismissed the proposed resolution. \\"Syria will not be Libya; Syria will not be Iraq; Syria will not be Somalia; Syria will not be a failing state,\\" he told reporters. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz and Ben Wedeman contributed to this report.

The bourgeoisie (Eng.: ; ) is a polysemous French term that can mean: The \\"Bourgeoisie\\", in its original sense, is intimately linked to the existence of cities recognized as such by their urban charters (e.g. municipal charter, town privileges, German town law) so there was no bourgeoisie \\"outside the walls of the city\\" beyond which the people were \\"peasants\\" submitted to the stately courts and manorialism (except for the traveling \\"Fair bourgeoisie\\" living outside urban territories, who retained their city rights and domicile). In Marxist philosophy the bourgeoisie is the social class that came to own the means of production during modern industrialization and whose societal concerns are the value of property and the preservation of capital, to ensure the perpetuation of their economic supremacy in society. Joseph Schumpeter saw the creation of new bourgeoisie as the driving force behind the capitalist engine, particularly entrepreneurs who took risks to bring innovation to industries and the economy through the process of creative destruction. The Modern French word \\"bourgeois\\" derived from the Old French \\"burgeis\\" (walled city), which derived from \\"bourg\\" (market town), from the Old Frankish \\"burg\\" (town); in other European languages, the etymologic derivations are the Middle English \\"burgeis\\", the Middle Dutch \\"burgher\\", the German \\"Bürger\\", the Modern English \\"burgess\\", and the Polish \\"burżuazja\\", which occasionally is synonymous with the intelligentsia. 1.

Please answer the following question: After the second world war Germany and France took two different policies in respect to taxation. After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which country would have lower labor supply in response to their taxation? Hint: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided and the hint given, France would have a lower labor supply in response to their taxation.

During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous.

The \\"State Anthem of the Russian Federation\\" (Russian: Госуда́рственный гимн Росси́йской Федера́ции, tr. Gosudarstvennyj gimn Rossijskoj Federacii, IPA: [ɡəsʊˈdarstvʲɪnɨj ˈɡʲimn rɐˈsʲijskəj fʲɪdʲɪˈratsɨj]) is the name of the official national anthem of Russia. It uses the same music as the \\"State Anthem of the Soviet Union\\", composed by Alexander Alexandrov, and new lyrics by Sergey Mikhalkov, who had collaborated with Gabriel El-Registan on the original anthem. From 1944, that earliest version replaced \\"The Internationale\\", as a new, more Soviet-centric, and Russia-centric Soviet anthem. The same melody, but without lyrics mentioning dead Stalin by name, was used after 1956. A second version of the lyrics was written by Mikhalkov in 1970 and adopted in 1977, placing less emphasis on World War II and more on the victory of communism. The Russian SFSR was the only constituent republic of the Soviet Union without its own regional anthem. The lyric-free \\"Patrioticheskaya Pesnya\\", composed by Mikhail Glinka, was officially adopted in 1990 by the Supreme Soviet of Russia and confirmed in 1993, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, by the President of the Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin. This anthem proved to be unpopular with the Russian public and with many politicians and public figures, because of its tune and lack of lyrics, and consequently its inability to inspire Russian athletes during international competitions. The government sponsored contests to create lyrics for the unpopular anthem, but none of the entries were adopted. Glinka's anthem was replaced soon after Yeltsin's successor as President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, first took office on 7 May 2000. The federal legislature established and approved the music of the National Anthem of the Soviet Union, with newly written lyrics, in December 2000, and it became the second anthem used by Russia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

During his childhood, he lived and studied in the city of Vitebsk, now part of Belarus, and later spent 10 years in Smolensk living with his grandparents and attending the Smolensk Grammar School, spending summer vacations in Vitebsk. Always expressing an interest and talent in drawing, he started to receive instruction at 13 from Yehuda Pen, a local Jewish artist, and by the time he was 15 was teaching students himself. In 1909, he applied to an art academy in Saint Petersburg, but was rejected. While he passed the entrance exam and was qualified, the law under the Tsarist regime only allowed a limited number of Jewish students to attend Russian schools and universities. Like many other Jews then living in the Russian Empire, Lissitzky went to study in Germany. He left in 1909 to study architectural engineering at a Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt, Germany. During the summer of 1912, Lissitzky, in his own words, \\"wandered through Europe\\", spending time in Paris and covering 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) on foot in Italy, teaching himself about fine art and sketching architecture and landscapes that interested him. His interest in ancient Jewish culture had originated during the contacts with a Paris-based group of Russian Jews led by sculptor Ossip Zadkine, a lifetime friend of Lissitzky since early childhood, who exposed Lissitzky to conflicts between different groups within the diaspora. Also in 1912 some of his pieces were included for the first time in an exhibit by the St. Petersburg Artists Union; a notable first step. He remained in Germany until the outbreak of World War I, when he was forced to return home through Switzerland and the Balkans, along with many of his countrymen, including other expatriate artists born in the former Russian Empire, such as Wassily Kandinsky and Marc Chagall.Upon his return to Moscow, Lissitzky attended the Polytechnic... answer the following question: What was the full name of the person who exposed Lissitzky to conflicts between different groups within the diaspora?

However, with the right strategies, mindset, and a bit of luck, it is possible to turn a profit. Below, we will discuss some of the ways you can increase your chances of making money at online casinos, using roulette as a primary example. 1. Understand the Game: Before diving into the world of online casinos, take the time to learn the ins and outs of the games you wish to play. In the case of roulette, familiarize yourself with the bets, payout odds, and house edge. Knowing these details will help you develop your own strategies and increase your chances of success. 2. Choose a Reputable Casino: Before placing your bets, ensure that you are playing on a trustworthy and secure online casino platform. Check for certifications, read reviews, and compare different websites to find a casino that best fits your needs. A reputable casino ensures that your personal and financial information is guarded and that payouts are received promptly. 3. Manage Your Bankroll: Before you begin playing any casino game, set a loss limit that you are comfortable with. Stick to this budget and never allow yourself to go over it. Gamble responsibly, and don't think of the money as a ticket to instant riches. Instead, look at gambling as a form of entertainment with the potential of bringing some extra income. 4. Hunt for Bonuses and Promotions: Many online casinos offer bonuses and promotions to attract players. Take advantage of these offers to boost your bankroll and increase your chances of making money in the long run. Search for casinos that offer deposit bonuses, free spins, no-deposit bonuses, or cashback deals as a part of their promotional package. 5. Practice and Develop a Strategy: While roulette is mostly a game of luck, developing a strategy can help maximize your chances of winning. Some players use betting systems like the Martingale, Labouchere, or D'Alembert systems to manage their bets. Implement a disciplined approach, and always remember that there are no foolproof strategies - they merely try to minimize losses and optimize winnings. 6. Betting Wisely: Don't get caught up in high-risk bets with low probability outcomes. In roulette, stick to even-money bets like red/black or odd/even if you want to have a better chance at making money. Avoid the temptation of making large, impulsive bets, as those will likely lead to significant losses in the long run. 7. Keep Your Emotions in Check: Winning and losing streaks can and will happen in online gambling. Staying emotionally neutral while playing will help you continue to make informed decisions and avoid rash decision-making. 8. Know When to Walk Away: Sometimes the best way to make money is to walk away from the table when you're ahead. Don't let the thrill of winning cloud your judgment and make you lose everything you've gained. Set a profit target and once reached, cash out and enjoy your earnings. 9. Diversify Your Casino Games: While roulette can be a great way to make money at online casinos, it’s wise to explore other popular casino games as well, such as blackjack, poker, or slots. Each game has its own strategies, payout rates, and odds. Diversifying your gaming experience increases your overall knowledge, and this can lead to better results in the long run. By following the above tips and maintaining a disciplined approach, you can increase your chances of making money at online casinos. Remember, always gamble responsibly, and enjoy the thrill of the game as you work towards your financial goals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

News article: Walter Keane was an American artist who became famous in the 1950s and 1960s for painting a series of widely-reproduced images depicting vulnerable children with enormous eyes. His story begins in Berlin in 1946, as a young American Walter was in Europe to learn how to be a painter. It was there that the would-be artist found himself staring quite heartbroken at the big-eyed homeless children fighting over scraps of food in the street. Keane would later write: “As if goaded by a kind of frantic despair, I sketched these dirty, ragged little victims of the war with their bruised, lacerated minds and bodies, their matted hair and runny noses. Here my life as a painter began in earnest\\". By the early 1960s, the artist's prints and postcards were selling in the many millions; with the great and the good, including Natalie Wood, Joan Crawford, Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis and Kim Novak buying up the originals. Keane had become an art sensation; the student had become a renowned artist and fulfilled his dream - and with money and fame came power, and a hedonistic life-style to suit a film star. According to the artist's biographers, Adam Parfrey and Cletus Nelson, Keane was not a reflection of his 'innocent' work but a drinker and a lover, of some note - even if this was in fact stated by the artist himself. Keane describes to them in his own words his first meeting with Margaret, the woman who would become the artist's wife. The words are from Keane's 1983 memoir, The World of Keane: “I love your paintings,” she told me. “You are the greatest artist I have ever seen. You are also the most handsome. The children in your paintings are so sad. It hurts my eyes to see them. Your perspective and the sadness you portray in the faces of the children make me want to touch them.” - “No,” I said. “Never touch any of my paintings.” This is a conversation that apparently took place between the two at an art exhibition in San Francisco in 1955. Walter was still an unknown artist at the time, and would not become an art world sensation for another couple of years. Later that night, his memoir continues, Margaret told him: “You are the greatest lover in the world.” They were married that same year. Yet many years later Walter Keane was accused of lying by his wife; the perpetration in question was that the famous artist's paintings were in fact her own. In the subsequent slander suit Margaret challenged Keane to a \\"paint off\\", but he declined citing a sore shoulder. Margaret then painted a work of wide-eyed sentimentality before the jurors in a mere 53 minutes and the suit was settled in her favour for £2.5 million. Yet Margaret never saw a penny of the money; and in the media the case remained disputed. By then the couple were divorced; and a narcissistic Walter had lost his charm inside a bottle; drinking away every cent that was owed to his ex-wife. The truth of their marriage in fact hid the fraudulent reality of Walter Keane. The couple were happily married for the first two years until Margaret discovered that Walter was selling her paintings as his own; stating that they needed the money, and that people were more likely to buy a painting if they thought they were talking to the artist. According to Walter; people didn't want to think that he couldn't paint - and needed to have his wife do it for him. People already thought Walter painted the big eyes and if they suddenly saw it was his wife creating them, the Keane's would be sued. The fraudulent artist offered Margaret a solution: she would teach him how to paint the big eyes, and their problem would be solved. But this was impossible - Walter had no skills as a painter - and blamed his inability to learn on the apparent inadequacies of his wife. So began a ten year period that saw Margaret under house arrest in now luxurious surroundings, paid for by her art - as she painted behind locked doors. The true artist never saw the money - as the bank account was controlled by Walter - who ensured the servants never found out the truth - as he cavorted through his life of debauchery. But in the end Walter died in 2000. Having eventually given up drinking yet still missing those heady days of wealth and stolen fame, writing in his memoir that sobriety was his “new awakening, away from the drinking world of exciting sexy beautiful women, parties and art buyers”. By the 1970s, the big eyes had fallen out of fashion with a shuddering thud. Even Woody Allen mocked them in his sci-fi comedy 'Sleeper', imagining a terrifying future where they were still revered. Margaret Keane - the real artist behind the work - became a Jehovah’s Witness. She moved to Hawaii where she started painting big-eyed children swimming with tropical fish in azure seas. Yet in the Hawaii paintings a change began to occur to the sad, and trapped big-eyed children of the famous works - the viewer could see slight, cautious smiles begin to form on the faces depicted. They were free -as was the artist. Now many years after the works fell from favour, new light is being shed on the paintings, and the fascinating story behind them - as one of the biggest art frauds in history - a biopic, 'Big Eyes', is about to be released, starring Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz, after the story peaked the fascination of acclaimed director Tim Burton. So if you look closely enough during one of its many scenes you might see a now elderly Margaret, sitting on a park bench, in a cameo appearance in Tim Burton's new film - she may even have big eyes, and - a slight smile on her face. ||||| There’s a sweet, small suburban house in the vineyards of Napa, northern California. Inside, a family of devout Jehovah’s Witnesses bustles around, offering me a cheese plate. A Siamese cat weaves in and out of my legs. Everything is lovely. Sitting unobtrusively in the corner is 87-year-old Margaret Keane. “Would you like some macadamia nuts?” she asks. She hands me Jehovah’s Witness pamphlets too. “Jehovah looks after me every day,” she says. “I really feel it.” She is the last person you’d expect to be a participant in one of the great art frauds of the 20th century. This story begins in Berlin in 1946. A young American named Walter Keane was in Europe to learn how to be a painter. And there he was, staring heartbroken at the big-eyed children fighting over scraps of food in the rubbish. As he would later write: “As if goaded by a kind of frantic despair, I sketched these dirty, ragged little victims of the war with their bruised, lacerated minds and bodies, their matted hair and runny noses. Here my life as a painter began in earnest.” Fifteen years later and Keane was an art sensation. The American suburb had just been invented and millions of people suddenly had a lot of wall space to fill. Some of them – those who wanted their homes to express upbeat whimsy – opted for paintings of dogs playing pool or dogs playing poker. But a great number of others, who wanted something more melancholic, went for Walter’s sad, big-eyed children. Some of the children held sad, big-eyed poodles in their arms. Others sat lonely in fields of flowers. They were dressed as harlequins and ballerinas. They just seemed so innocent and searching. Walter himself was not a melancholic man. According to his biographers, Adam Parfrey and Cletus Nelson, he was a drinker and a lover – of women and of himself. This, for instance, is how he describes his first meeting with Margaret, the woman now sitting opposite me in Napa. It’s from his 1983 memoir, The World of Keane: “I love your paintings,” she told me. “You are the greatest artist I have ever seen. You are also the most handsome. The children in your paintings are so sad. It hurts my eyes to see them. Your perspective and the sadness you portray in the faces of the children make me want to touch them.” “No,” I said. “Never touch any of my paintings.” Walter and Margaret Keane work side by side in 1961. Photograph: Bettmann/Corbis This conversation apparently took place at an outdoor art exhibition in San Francisco in 1955. Walter was still an unknown artist. He wouldn’t become a phenomenon for another few years. Later that night, his memoir continues, Margaret told him: “You are the greatest lover in the world.” They married. Margaret’s memory of their first meeting is quite different. The centre of Walter’s universe in the mid-1950s was a San Francisco beatnik club, The Hungry i. While comedians such as Lenny Bruce and Bill Cosby performed onstage, out at the front, Walter sold his big-eyed-children paintings. One night Margaret decided to go to the club with him. “He had me sitting in a corner,” she tells me, “and he was over there, talking, selling paintings, when somebody walked over to me and said: ‘Do you paint too?’ And I suddenly thought – just horrible shock – ‘Is he taking credit for my paintings?’” He was. He had been telling his patrons a giant lie. Margaret was the painter of the big eyes – every one of them. Walter might well have seen sad children in postwar Berlin, but he hadn’t painted them, because he couldn’t paint to save his life. Margaret was furious. Back home she confronted him. She told him to stop. But something unexpected happened instead. During the decade that followed, Margaret would nod in respectful admiration as Walter told interviewers that he was the best painter of eyes since El Greco. She said nothing. Why did she go along with it? What was happening inside the Keane marriage? Margaret takes me back to the beginning. It’s true that he charmed her at that art exhibition in 1955, she says. “He was just oozing with charm. He could charm anyone.” But the rest of the conversation didn’t happen. How could it have? Their first two years were happy, but all that changed the night of the Hungry i. “Back home he tried to explain it away,” she says. “He said: ‘We need the money. People are more likely to buy a painting if they think they’re talking to the artist. People don’t want to think I can’t paint and need to have my wife paint. People already think I painted the big eyes and if I suddenly say it was you, it’ll be confusing and people will start suing us.’ He was telling me all these horrible problems.” Walter offered Margaret a solution: “Teach me how to paint the big-eyed children.” So she tried. “And when he couldn’t do it, it was my fault. ‘You’re not teaching me right. I could do it if you had more patience.’ I was really trying, but it was just impossible.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Margaret and Walter pose with a selection of paintings in 1965. Photograph: Bill Ray/The LIFE Picture Collection/Gett Margaret felt trapped. She wanted to leave, but she didn’t know how. How would she support herself and her daughter? “So finally I went along with it,” she says. “And it was just tearing me apart.” By the early 1960s, Keane prints and postcards were selling in the millions. You couldn’t walk into a Woolworths without seeing racks of them. Luminaries including Natalie Wood, Joan Crawford, Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis and Kim Novak were buying the originals. “Did you see any of the money?” I ask Margaret. “No,” she says. “I just painted. But we moved to a nice house. There was a swimming pool. Gated. Servants. So I didn’t need to do anything except paint.” She smiles, ruefully. Outside in the sun, Walter was living the high life. “There was always three or four people swimming nude in the pool,” he wrote in his memoir. “Everybody was screwing everybody. Sometimes I’d be going to bed and there’d be three girls in the bed.” The Beach Boys would visit, and Maurice Chevalier, and Howard Keel. But Margaret rarely saw them, because she was painting 16 hours a day. “Did the servants know what was going on?” “No, the door was always locked,” she says. “The curtains closed.” “You spent all those years with the curtains closed?” “When he wasn’t home he’d usually call every hour to make sure I hadn’t gone out,” she says. “I was in jail.” “Did you know about the affairs?” She shrugged. “I didn’t care what he did by then.” “It must have been lonely.” “Yes, because he wouldn’t allow me to have any friends. If I tried to slip away from him, he’d follow me. We had a chihuahua and because I loved that little dog so much, he kicked it, and so finally I had to give the dog away. He was very jealous and domineering. And all along he said: ‘If you ever tell anyone I’m going to have you knocked off.’ I knew he knew a lot of mafia people. He really scared me. He tried to hit me once. But I said, ‘Where I come from men don’t hit women. If you ever do that again I’ll leave.’” She pauses. “But I let him do everything else, which was even worse probably.” “Would he come home from his partying and demand you show him what you’d painted?” I ask. “He was always pressuring me to do more,” she says. “‘Do one with a clown costume.’ Or: ‘Do two children on a rocking horse.’ One day he had this idea that I’d do this huge painting, his masterwork, to hang in the United Nations or somewhere. I had a month to do that.” The “masterwork” was called Tomorrow Forever. It depicted a hundred sad-looking, big-eyed children of all creeds standing in a line that stretches to the horizon. The organisers of the 1964 World’s Fair hung it in their Pavilion of Education. Walter felt deeply proud of the achievement. He wrote in his memoir that his dead grandmother told him in a vision that “Michelangelo has put your name up for nomination as a member of our inner circle saying that your masterwork Tomorrow Forever will live in the hearts and minds of men as has his work on the Sistine chapel.” The art critic John Canaday reviewed Tomorrow Forever for the New York Times: “This tasteless hack work contains about 100 children and hence it is about 100 times as bad as the average Keane.” Stung by the review, the World’s Fair took down the painting. “Walter was furious,” Margaret says. “I felt hurt that they didn’t want it and were saying nasty things. When people said it was just sentimental stuff it really hurt my feelings. Some people couldn’t stand to even look at them. I don’t know why - just a violent reaction. But so many people really love them. Little children love them. Even babies. So eventually I thought: ‘I don’t care. I’m just going to paint what I want to paint.’” If you’d asked Margaret back then about her inspiration – which you never would have, of course – she would have shrugged and said she didn’t know. The paintings just flowed out of her. But now, she says, she thinks she understands: “Those sad children were really my own deep feelings that I couldn’t express in any other way. Their eyes were searching. Asking why. Why is there so much sadness? Why do we have to get sick and die? Why do people shoot each other?” “Why is my husband so crazy?” I suggest. “Why did I get into this mess?” Margaret nods. After 10 years of marriage, eight of them horrific, they divorced. Margaret promised Walter that she’d keep on secretly painting for him. And she did for a while. But after she’d delivered maybe 20 or 30 big eyes to him, she suddenly thought: “No more lies. From now on, I will only ever tell the truth.” Which is why, in October 1970, Margaret told a reporter from the UPI everything. “He wanted to learn to paint,” she revealed, “and I tried to teach him to paint when he was home, which wasn’t often. He couldn’t even learn to paint.” And so on. Walter went on the offensive, swearing that the big eyes were his and calling Margaret a “boozing, sex-starved psychopath” who he once discovered having sex with several parking-lot attendants. “He was really nuts,” Margaret says. “I couldn’t believe he had so much hate for me.” Margaret became a Jehovah’s Witness. She moved to Hawaii and started painting big-eyed children swimming in azure seas with tropical fish. In these Hawaii paintings you can see small, cautious smiles begin to form on the faces of the children. Walter’s life wasn’t so happy. He moved to a fisherman’s shack in La Jolla, California, and began to drink from morning until night. He told the few reporters still interested in him that Margaret was in league with the Jehovah’s Witnesses to defraud him. One reporter, from USA Today, believed every word, and they ran a story on Walter’s plight: “Thinking he was dead [Margaret] claimed to have done some of the Keane paintings. The claim, vehemently denied by a very much alive Keane, is in litigation.” Margaret sued Walter. The judge challenged them both to paint a child with big eyes, right there in court, in front of everyone. Margaret painted hers in 53 minutes. Walter said he couldn’t because he had a sore shoulder. “And there it is,” she tells me. She points to a framed portrait on the wall of a little girl with absolutely huge eyes, peering out nervously from behind a fence. “I painted it in Honolulu federal court. It has the exhibit number on the back.” In fact the walls of Margaret’s home are filled with big-eye paintings – children, poodles, kittens. There’s barely an inch of empty wall space. “That painting is symbolic of her triumph over the lies,” Margaret’s son-in-law tells me as he walks past us towards the kitchen. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Amy Adam plays Margaret Keane in Tim Burton’s film Big Eyes. Photograph: The Weinstein Company/Allstar/Allstar/The Weinstein Company Margaret won the court case, of course. She was awarded 4m, but she never saw a penny of it because Walter had drunk his fortune away. A court psychologist diagnosed him with a rare mental condition called delusional disorder. I ask Margaret if she knows anything about delusional disorder. She shakes her head and says she can’t even remember Walter being diagnosed with it. “It’s when a person who is otherwise completely normal has a particular delusion they’re absolutely convinced of,” I say. “Quite often it’s a jealous husband convinced his wife is cheating on him. Sometimes the person is convinced that some impostor is taking credit for their genius.” “I didn’t know that,” Margaret says. “If you have the disorder it means you truly believe it,” I say. Margaret thinks. “For a long time I felt very guilty about it,” she says. “Why guilty?” I ask. “If I hadn’t allowed him to take credit for the paintings, he wouldn’t have got as sick as he got.” Walter died in 2000. He gave up drinking towards the end, but you get the sense that he missed those days, writing in his memoir that sobriety was his “new awakening, away from the drinking world of exciting sexy beautiful women, parties and art buyers”. By the 1970s, the big eyes had fallen from favour. Woody Allen mocked them in Sleeper, imagining a ridiculous future where they were revered. But now, suddenly, there is a kind of renaissance. A Tim Burton biopic, Big Eyes, is about to be released, starring Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz. Margaret has a cameo: “I’m a little old lady sitting on a park bench.” “Was the film distressing to watch?” I ask her. “It was really traumatic,” she says. “I really think I was in shock for a couple of days. Christoph Waltz – he looks like Walter, sounds like him, acts like him. And to see Amy going through what I went through … It’s very accurate. Then it started to dawn on me how fantastic the movie is.” Margaret smiles, looking thrilled, and I realise that sometimes a wrong is so great it needs something as dramatic as a major biopic in which you’re the hero to heal the wounds. • Big Eyes will be released in the UK on 26 December. ||||| In San Francisco in the 1950s, Margaret was a woman trying to make it on her own after leaving her husband with only her daughter and her paintings. She meets gregarious ladies' man and fellow painter Walter Keane in a park while she was struggling to make an impact with her drawings of children with big eyes. The two quickly become a pair with outgoing Walter selling their paintings and quiet Margaret holed up at home painting even more children with big eyes. But Walter's actually selling her paintings as his own. A clash of financial success and critical failure soon sends Margaret reeling in her life of lies. With Walter still living the high life, Margaret's going to have to try making it on her own again and re-claiming her name and her paintings. Written by Anne Campbell ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Walter Keane and his wife Margaret were artists in the 1950s and 1960s. Walter became famous for painting pictures of sad children with big eyes. The paintings sold very well and made a lot of money. But, later on, Margaret claimed that she was the real artist who painted the big-eyed children, and that Walter was taking credit for her work. In a court case, Margaret painted a big-eyed child in just 53 minutes, while Walter said he couldn't paint because of a sore shoulder. Margaret won the case, and it was revealed that she was the true artist behind the famous paintings. A movie called 'Big Eyes', directed by Tim Burton, tells the story of Margaret and Walter Keane and the big-eyed paintings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the names of the two archipelagos of India? ? India's coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700 mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400 mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300 mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains. According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal. Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient often leads to severe floods and course changes. Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal; and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea. Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh. India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.The Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.

A satellite is a body that orbits a planet. All moons are satellites, and many planets have them. Some have many moons. Earth, of course, only has one. It's a special moon, though. It's the fifth largest moon in the solar system! In fact, the moon is much smaller than the sun. But it's much closer to Earth, so it looks as big as the sun. The moon is so close that you can see its dark and light spots without a telescope. Men flew and landed on the moon's surface many times by spacecrafts in the 1960s and 1970s. Neil Armstrong was the first human to step on the moon. He walked on the moon on July 20th, 1969. The flights to the moon have helped us learn much about it.

Bipasha Basu (born 7 January 1979), also known by her married name Bipasha Basu Singh Grover, is an Indian film actress and model. Primarily known for her work in Hindi films, she has also appeared in Tamil, Telugu, Bengali and English language films. One of the most popular and highest-paid actresses in India, Basu is the recipient of numerous accolades, including one Filmfare Award, among six nominations. Particularly known for her work in the thriller and horror film genres, she is frequently cited in the media as a sex symbol. One of the judges of the Godrej Cinthol Supermodel Contest in which Basu participated, Vinod Khanna, wanted to launch her alongside his son Akshaye Khanna in Himalay Putra, but she felt she was too young and declined the role, which eventually went to Anjala Zaveri. After returning home, she was convinced by Jaya Bachchan to star opposite her son Abhishek Bachchan in J. P. Dutta's Aakhari Mughal. However, the film was cancelled, and Dutta instead changed the script and made Refugee with Kareena Kapoor. Basu was also offered a role in Refugee opposite Sunil Shetty, which she declined. In 2001, Basu finally made her debut opposite Akshay Kumar in Vijay Galani's Ajnabee. The film, directed by Abbas-Mustan, was inspired by the American film Consenting Adults. It was a moderate box-office success and attracted unfavorable reviews from critics. However, Basu's performance in a negative role was appreciated by critics and won her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut. In 2002, Basu starred in the year's most successful thriller, Raaz. Directed by Vikram Bhatt, it established Basu in the Hindi film industry. Her portrayal of a woman who is pursued by a spirit received positive reviews. One review in The Tribune noted, \\"... it is Bipasha Basu who steals the show with her fine performance.\\" She was nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for Raaz. She was appreciated in a supporting role in Sanjay Gadhvi's Mere Yaar Ki Shaadi Hai, a moderate critical and commercial success. However, in David Dhawan's Chor Machaaye Shor, was her first commercial failure. She appeared in a supporting role opposite Mahesh Babu and Lisa Ray in the Telugu film, Takkari Donga. Gunaah, which released later that year, was also a box-office failure. She played the role of a cop who loves a convict and tries to reform him.

Only a bus driver and a boy, Julien, help her collect her books that the others have thrown into a puddle. To cheer Sophie up, Julien gives her a small tin box, a gift from his fatally ill mother. Because it is important to him, he asks her to lend it back to him from time to time. As Julien wants the box back at the moment he gave it to her, Sophie demands proof of how important it is to him. Julien disengages the handbrake of the bus without hesitation, and the bus full of children rolls down a hill. Their game has begun: the box changes its owner after each completed dare. Between the son of wealthy Belgian parents and the daughter of poor Polish immigrants a lasting friendship develops. As children they misbehave in school, wreak havoc on a wedding, and ask silly tasks of each other. As teenagers their romantic relationships with others suffer as a result of their dares. Meanwhile, the two friends ignore any consequences or punishment during their game. While they are always looking for the next kick, a love is slowly evolving between the protagonists.

Ferris frequently breaks the fourth wall, giving the audience advice on how to skip school, and to narrate about his friends. His younger sister Jeannie is less-convinced, but goes to school anyway. Dean of Students Edward R. Rooney notes and suspects Ferris is being truant again and commits to catching him. However, Ferris uses a computer to alter the school's records to indicate his absences from 9 to 2. Ferris convinces his friend Cameron Frye, who is absent due to illness, to report that his girlfriend Sloane Peterson's grandmother has died. Rooney doubts this, but they succeed as planned. Borrowing Cameron's father's prized 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder against Cameron's instinct, Ferris, Cameron, and Sloane drive into Chicago to sightsee. Leaving the car with two parking attendants, who promptly joyride it unknowingly to them, the trio visit the Art Institute of Chicago, Sears Tower, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and Wrigley Field.

Gay couples should be allowed to have their relationships blessed in church, the Church of England said yesterday. Bishops should lift their official ban on ceremonies to mark civil partnerships and the relationships of gay and lesbian churchgoers, a long-awaited CofE report said. It signalled an end to the Church’s longstanding insistence that gay relationships are sinful and less worthy than heterosexual marriage. The report, written by former civil servant Sir Joseph Pilling and a team of senior churchmen and women, may now open the way for a reversal of the CofE’s opposition to same-sex marriage and the eventual appointment of actively homosexual priests and bishops. It was published seven months after the Church first indicated it is looking at ‘accommodations’ for same-sex couples and four months after the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, told Church leaders that ‘we must accept there is a revolution in the area of sexuality.’ Archbishop Welby said yesterday that bishops will now ‘consider the report and decide how such a process might best be shaped.’ In its key paragraph the Pilling report declared: ‘We believe there can be circumstances where a priest, with the agreement of the parish, should be free to mark the formation of a permanent same-sex relationship in a public service but should be under no obligation to do so.’ Acknowledging arguments among the report team, it added: ‘Some of us do not believe that this can be extended to same-sex marriage.’ Current CofE guidance laid down by bishops forbids priests to conduct same-sex blessing services. Nevertheless, some estimates say 200 such services a year are carried out in Anglican churches. Bishops could permit gay blessing services simply by changing their guidelines. Their first opportunity to do so will come at meetings next month and in January. The Pilling report calls for two years of ‘facilitated conversations’ on a series of ideas that will sweep away the decades of opposition to gay rights if a majority in the Church accept them. Such talks may prove ‘difficult and divisive’ a statement by Archbishop Welby admitted. It called for the talks to end the rule dating from 1991 that says gays are welcome in the pews but that clergy must not be actively homosexual. ‘The Church’s present rules impose different disciplines on clergy and laity in relations to sexually active same-sex relationships,’ the report said. ‘It will be important to reflect on the extent to which laity and clergy should continue to observe such different disciplines.’ The report suggested that reforms might go ahead through bringing in different rules for junior clergy and for bishops - rules similar to those which currently allow women priests but not women bishops. The row over gay bishops has been toxic for the Anglicans since the last Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Williams, prevented the appointment of openly gay Canon Jeffery John as a bishop in 2003. Dr John is now Dean of St Albans. Under consideration: The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said the Church will now consider the recommendations. In a series of calls for new thinking, the report said the Church should show ‘real repentance for the lack of welcome and acceptance extended to homosexual people in the past’. However, it added: ‘No-one should be accused of homophobia solely for articulating traditional Christian teaching on same-sex relationships.’ The report suggested that the Bible does not condemn homosexuality and said no-one should teach that it does. It also warned that liberal attitudes to homosexuality in western countries can cause trouble in countries where Christians are vulnerable to attack. Congregations in countries like Nigeria and Pakistan, where homosexuality is universally condemned by Muslims, have been subjected to violence in recent years. The report said: ‘It is important, for some a matter of life and death, that the Church and church people speak with great care and attentiveness to how their words will be received, not only in their own culture but in cultures where Christians are marginalised.’ The CofE set itself against the gay rights agenda in 1987, at a time when pressure for recognition of gay relationships by Anglicans was just beginning. Its parliament, the General Synod, said then that gay sex was sinful. Last year the Church strongly opposed David Cameron’s same-sex marriage legislation, saying it would wreck traditional marriage and undermine families. The Pilling report said that there should be no formal liturgy for same-sex blessing services, but consenting priests and parishes should be allowed to work out their own form of service. It hinted strongly that full acceptance of same-sex marriage is on the way. ‘A willingness to offer public recognition and prayer for a committed same-sex relationship would, in practice, be hard to implement now for civil partnerships without also doing so for same-sex marriage,’ it said. One member of the report team, the Bishop of Birkenhead, the Right Reverend Keith Sinclair, said he was unable to accept the recommendations.

Article:","completion":"Title: Sture Bergwall's Murder Convictions: A Shocking Legal Tragedy Sparks Inquiry Into Legal System Shortfalls Sture Bergwall, a 63-year-old Swedish man, was convicted of eight murders between 1994 and 2001, despite the absence of any forensic evidence or witness testimonies to support the case. Over the years, Bergwall claimed to have killed 30 people, although he later recanted his confessions. Recently, he was released from a secure psychiatric unit, where he has been since 1991, sparking the government to launch an inquiry into potential flaws within the legal system. Understandably, many are troubled by the lack of concrete evidence that ultimately led to Bergwall's conviction. Despite not having any forensic evidence or witness statements, authorities were still able to convict Bergwall solely based on his confessions. Some speculate that Bergwall's fragile mental state at the time of his confession may have influenced the ease with which his admission of guilt was accepted, leading to questions being raised about how the legal system handles such cases. In light of the case, the Swedish government has initiated an inquiry to explore possible shortfalls within its legal system. The inquiry aims to examine and identify any weaknesses in the current system that could potentially allow such wrongful convictions to occur. The hope is that the findings of the inquiry will eventually lead to improvements within the legal framework, helping to prevent future instances of injustice. As for Sture Bergwall, his release from the secure psychiatric unit is a bittersweet victory. While he may have been released, the psychological impact of his wrongful conviction remains, and the damage done to his life can never be fully repaired. As the government continues its investigation, it is important to remember that the focus of the inquiry should not be solely on the errors within the legal system, but also on justice for victims like Bergwall. In conclusion, the case of Sture Bergwall serves as a stark reminder that the burden of proof must always be thoroughly scrutinized before a conviction can be made. The understanding and handling of evidence, particularly in cases where the defendant has a fragile mental state, should be held to the highest standards in order to avoid grave miscarriages of justice.

Based on the sentence \\"A boy is riding on a donkey carrying various items strapped to it.\\", is the sentence \\"There is a donkey carrying things.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"There is a donkey carrying things.\\" is a true sentence based on the scenario given in the statement \\"A boy is riding on a donkey carrying various items strapped to it.\\" To understand why this is the case, we need to break down the elements of the first sentence and see how they relate to the second 1. \\"A boy is riding on a donkey\\" 2. \\"The donkey is carrying various items strapped to it.\\" In the first part of the sentence, the boy is the subject, \\"riding on a donkey\\" is the action that boy is doing. In the second part of the sentence, the donkey is the subject, and the donkey is doing two things - carrying the boy (as indicated in the first part) and \\"carrying various items strapped to it\\". Here, 'various items' becomes the object that the donkey is carrying. Now, let's look at the second sentence - \\"There is a donkey carrying things.\\" \\"The donkey\\" from the first sentence is equivalent to \\"a donkey\\" in the second sentence. \\"The donkey carrying various items\\" matches with \\"a donkey carrying things\\". There is no explicit information given about the boy in the second sentence, but the main idea behind both sentences is a donkey carrying items or things. So, even though the second sentence does not provide as much detail as the first (it does not specify the exact quantity or nature of 'things', nor does it mention the boy), it is still true based on the information provided in the initial sentence. Hence, it can be confirmed that based on the described scenario, the sentence \\"There is a donkey carrying things\\" is indeed accurate. In essence, while the second sentence is a simplified version of the first one, it doesn't contradict or present any falsehood in relation to the first statement. It merely omits some of the details.

Desktop users may find the USB ports on the back or the front of the desktop tower, though iMacs have the USB ports on the back of the monitor itself. There are two main types of USB ports found on modern computers: USB 3.0 — A thin, rectangular slot that's about 3/4 of an inch (a little under two centimeters) wide. You should see a chunk of plastic in the upper half of this slot. USB 3.0 slots are found on the majority of Windows computers and on most Mac computers manufactured prior to 2016. USB-C — A thin, oval slot that's about 1/2 of an inch (a little over a centimeter) wide. These are most commonly found on MacBook and MacBook Pro computers, though some Windows laptops also have USB-C ports. If your computer has both types of port, you're free to use whichever port you like depending on your USB flash drive type. Look at the metal connector end of your flash drive: If the connector is rectangular and has a piece of plastic taking up part of the connector, you have a USB 3.0 flash drive. If the connector is oval and has no piece of plastic inside of it, you have a USB-C flash drive. If the flash drive that you want to use is a USB 3.0 version but your computer uses USB-C ports, you'll need to buy a USB-C adapter and plug it into the USB-C port on your computer. This is most common on MacBooks and MacBook Pros from 2016 and up, though some Windows computers also have only USB-C ports. If you're using a USB 3.0 flash drive, make sure that the plastic piece in the flash drive's connector is at the bottom of the flash drive so as to slide under the piece of plastic that's at the top of the USB 3.0 port. USB-C flash drives can be inserted either way. If you're using a USB-C adapter, you'll plug your USB flash drive into a USB 3.9 slot in the adapter instead.","completion":"This article is about where to find USB ports on your computer, the differences between USB 3.0 ports and USB-C ports, and how to properly insert different types of USB flash drives into these ports."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The games take place in the year 2188, and the story follows the main protagonist, a girl who is the only human student at St. PigeoNation's Institute, a high school for gifted birds. There are eight love interests in the first game who along with the protagonist make up the main cast of the series: Ryouta Kawara, the protagonist's kindhearted childhood friend; Sakuya Le Bel Shirogane, a haughty exchange student and nobleman from France; Yuuya Sakazaki, a flirtatious but shifty upperclassman; Nageki Fujishiro, a quiet and mysterious freshman; San Oko, an athletic, pudding-obsessed jock; Anghel Higure, the school eccentric; Kazuaki Nanaki, the school's helpful but narcoleptic math professor; and Shuu Iwamine, the creepy, suspicious school doctor. The dating simulation portion of \\"Hatoful Boyfriend\\" focuses on the protagonist's interactions with each of the love interests and the relationships that result, while the darker \\"Bad Boys Love\\" route of the game instead follows Ryouta, attempting to figure out the identity of the protagonist's killer after she is murdered. \\"Holiday Star\\" takes place in an alternate timeline in which the events of \\"Bad Boys Love\\" do not occur, and removes the otome game aspects of the first game in favor of a more linear storyline split into four chapters—the first two chapters are largely comedic, while the latter two chapters take place on the oneiric Holiday Star.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who warned conductor Eduard Nápravník that \\"I shan't be at all surprised and offended if you find that it is in a style unsuitable for symphony concerts\\"? from the following article ? Tchaikovsky remained abroad for a year after the disintegration of his marriage. During this time, he completed Eugene Onegin, orchestrated his Fourth Symphony, and composed the Violin Concerto. He returned briefly to the Moscow Conservatory in the autumn of 1879. For the next few years, assured of a regular income from von Meck, he traveled incessantly throughout Europe and rural Russia, mainly alone, and avoided social contact whenever possible. During this time, Tchaikovsky's foreign reputation grew and a positive reassessment of his music also took place in Russia, thanks in part to Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky's call for \\"universal unity\\" with the West at the unveiling of the Pushkin Monument in Moscow in 1880. Before Dostoyevsky's speech, Tchaikovsky's music had been considered \\"overly dependent on the West\\". As Dostoyevsky's message spread throughout Russia, this stigma toward Tchaikovsky's music evaporated. An unprecedented acclaim for him even drew a cult following among the young intelligentsia of Saint Petersburg, including Alexandre Benois, Léon Bakst and Sergei Diaghilev.Two musical works from this period stand out. With the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour nearing completion in Moscow in 1880, the 25th anniversary of the coronation of Alexander II in 1881, and the 1882 Moscow Arts and Industry Exhibition in the planning stage, Nikolai Rubinstein suggested that Tchaikovsky compose a grand commemorative piece. Tchaikovsky agreed and finished it within six weeks. He wrote to Nadezhda von Meck that this piece, the 1812 Overture, would be \\"very loud and noisy, but I wrote it with no warm feeling of love, and therefore there will probably be no artistic merits in it\\". He also warned conductor Eduard Nápravník that \\"I shan't be at all surprised and offended if you find that it is in a style unsuitable for symphony concerts\\".

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less carbon dioxide is removed happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen reaching the body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has an indirect effect on the process. If less carbon dioxide is removed from the lungs, it may lead to a buildup of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, a condition known as hypercapnia. This can cause the blood to become more acidic, which may lead to respiratory acidosis. Respiratory acidosis can impair the ability of hemoglobin, the molecule in red blood cells responsible for binding to and transporting oxygen, to effectively bind to oxygen. As a result, less oxygen will be transported through the body, possibly leading to symptoms such as shortness of breath, confusion, and fatigue. Additionally, the buildup of carbon dioxide can lead to increased respiratory effort as the body tries to remove the excess gas, potentially making it more difficult for the lungs to effectively oxygenate the blood. This could also contribute to reduced oxygen delivery to the body's tissues. In summary, while the perturbation of less carbon dioxide removal does not directly affect the amount of oxygen entering the body, it can indirectly impact the oxygen delivery to the body's tissues by influencing the effectiveness of hemoglobin binding and increasing respiratory effort."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person who is alive because a gold coin deflected a bullet?, using the article: H. L. Hunley takes his ship, the H.L. Hunley, out in the Charleston, South Carolina harbor and it sinks with all hands. As the blockade still needs to be broken, Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard has the ship raised and puts George E. Dixon in charge. He starts looking for a crew and after some difficulty finally finds enough volunteers to man it. They practice cranking the propeller. The crew do not all get along with each other. Dixon flashes back to the Battle of Shiloh, where a gold coin given to him by his wife (who was later killed in a steamboat explosion caused by a drifting mine) deflected a bullet and saved his life. They take the ship down and sit on the bottom to see how long they can stay down and almost get stuck. The U.S. Navy is warned about the sub. The crew votes that if after an attack they are stuck on the bottom, they will open the valves, flooding the ship, rather than suffocate. They go out to attack the USS Wabash, but the attack fails. Following the warning the ship has draped metal chain netting over the side. Also the rope which was attached to the torpedo they were to release under the ship gets loose and becomes entangled in the propeller. It has to be cut loose while sailors on the Wabash shoot at the Hunley. Beauregard proposes putting the torpedo at the end of a long spar. The USS Housatonic is ordered to change its position in the harbor and always be ready to steam, meaning it cannot hang metal netting over the side. The Hunley's second in command, Lt.

Write the answer: Marked by a violent fear of watter, what is the common name for the disease hydrophobia?","completion":"Hydrophobia, marked by a violent fear of water, is commonly known as rabies. Rabies is a deadly viral disease that affects the central nervous system of mammals, including humans, and is transmitted primarily through the bite of an infected animal, usually a wild one. The term \\"hydrophobia\\" originates from one of the most characteristic symptoms of rabies in its advanced stage – the intense fear of water or difficulty in swallowing, which occurs due to the virus affecting the person's throat muscles and causing severe pain upon attempting to swallow. The rabies virus is typically present in the saliva of infected animals and enters the victim's body when bitten or scratched. It can also be transmitted when an infected animal's saliva comes in contact with an open wound or mucous membranes, such as the eyes, mouth, or nose. Once inside the body, the virus travels through peripheral nerves to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), where it multiplies and causes inflammation, eventually spreading to other organs, including the salivary glands. The incubation period of rabies can range from a few weeks to several months, during which an individual exhibits no symptoms. However, once symptoms appear, the disease progresses rapidly and is almost always fatal if left untreated. Early symptoms of rabies may include fever, headache, malaise, and a general feeling of discomfort. As the disease progresses, more specific neurological symptoms appear, like agitation, anxiety, confusion, hallucinations, muscle weakness, paralysis, and the aforementioned swallowing difficulties and fear of water. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that around 59,000 people die from rabies each year, with more than 95% of these fatalities occurring in Africa and Asia. Dogs are the primary source of human rabies infection globally, contributing to over 99% of all cases. Prevention of rabies in domestic animals, therefore, is critical in minimizing human infection rates. Vaccinating pets and monitoring contact with wild animals are essential components of rabies prevention, as is seeking immediate medical attention for potential exposure to the virus. Although rabies is almost invariably fatal once symptoms appear, it can be prevented through timely post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). PEP involves administering a series of rabies vaccines, and in some cases, human rabies immune globulin, to individuals who have been exposed to the virus. The treatment is most effective when given soon after exposure, so seeking medical attention immediately after a potential rabies exposure is crucial. In conclusion, hydrophobia is a common name for rabies, a deadly viral disease characterized by a violent fear of water and difficulty swallowing due to infected throat muscles. Rabies is primarily transmitted through the bite or scratch of an infected animal and affects the victim's central nervous system. It is crucial to vaccinate pets, avoid contact with wild animals, and promptly seek medical attention after potential rabies exposure for effective prevention and treatment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The embassy on Wednesday attributed the death to head injuries from a rock thrown by \\"unknown individuals\\" on the outskirts of the capital, Addis Ababa. An Ethiopian official told The Associated Press that the American was an agricultural expert who had gone to the town of Burayu on Tuesday for field work. Fikadu Tessema, head of the Oromia region's spokesman's office, says the agricultural team that went to the town \\"didn't ask police protection at the time.\\" This is the first foreigner killed in the massive anti-government protests that have claimed the lives of hundreds of protesters since November 2015. ||||| An American citizen was killed in Ethiopia on Tuesday after the vehicle she was traveling in was struck by rocks thrown by unknown assailants, the State Department confirmed today. “On October 4, in the late afternoon, a passenger van was hit by rocks thrown by unknown individuals on the outskirts of the city of Addis Ababa. One of the passengers, a U.S. citizen, was struck by a rock and subsequently died from her injury,” the U.S. Embassy in Ethiopia said in a consular message issued to Americans in the region. State Department spokesman Mark Toner declined to identify the individual due to privacy considerations. “We offer our sincerest condolences to her family and loved ones on their loss,” Toner said, adding that the U.S. is “providing all possible consular assistance.” The State Department has referred all questions about the investigation to local authorities and declined to provide any further information. Addis Ababa has seen experienced a great deal of political and religious unrest recently. On Sunday, a protest broken up by the police resulted in a stampede that left more than 50 people dead, according to local reports. Demonstrators and government opposition members have been protesting against the Ethiopian government’s plan to integrate infrastructure development and expand the municipal boundary of the capital, Addis Ababa, into surrounding towns in Oromia. Some feared the urban expansion would cause Oromo farmers to lose their traditional lands. Largely peaceful protests have been met by federal security forces that have allegedly used excessive and lethal force to quell the demonstrations. More than 400 people are estimated to have been killed, thousands injured and tens of thousands arrested since November 2015, according to a recent report by Human Rights Watch based on over 125 interviews with witnesses, victims and government officials. ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption The Oromia region has been hit by waves of protests for almost a year A US citizen has been killed in Ethiopia amid large anti-government protests.

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"No, these two questions are not asking the same thing, despite the common term \\"Civil War\\" in both. They are about entirely different subjects—one is a historical and political concept, the other is about a popular culture reference, specifically a movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Let's break them down in detail: Question 1: \\"What is a civil war?\\" In general terms, a civil war is a violent conflict between opposing groups within the same country or nation. The warring parties are often identified along political, ethnic, religious, or tribal lines, who have differing objectives and aims. The scope of civil wars can vary greatly, from small-scale conflicts involving just a few cities or regions within a country, to large-scale wars that can engulf an entire nation. Civil wars are characterized by heavy casualties, widespread infrastructural damage, and significant economic disruption. Historically, there have been many significant civil wars, such as the American Civil War, the Spanish Civil War, and the Syrian Civil War, among others. These civil wars have had profound impacts on the respective nations involved, including changes in the nature of governance, shifts in territorial boundaries, or even alterations in a nation's demographic makeup. Question 2: \\"What is your review of Captain America: Civil War (2016 movie)?\\" Captain America: Civil War is a superhero film released in 2016, part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is based on the Civil War storyline from the Marvel Comics, which focuses on a schism between the superheroes of the Marvel Universe over legislation to regulate superhuman activities. The movie is well-renowned for its thrilling action sequences, deep emotional resonance, and its successful attempt at juggling a large ensemble cast, consisting of various superheroes like Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, Spider-Man and more. It tackles themes of responsibility, accountability, and friendship by presenting complex character dynamics and political dilemmas. The Russo Brothers' masterful direction, the character-driven plot, coupled with engaging performances, especially by Chris Evans (Captain America) and Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man), have contributed to the film's popularity. Despite the movie title containing the term \\"Civil War,\\" the film is not about a historical or political civil war in the way the term is generally understood. Rather, it dramatizes a personal and ideological conflict between two factions of superheroes within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, hence the title \\"Civil War.\\" So, while both the questions have \\"Civil War\\" in common, they are asking about two different subjects: one is about a category of conflict in political history, and the other is about a specific film in the genre of superhero cinema. They are entirely different in terms of the areas involved, the factors and stakes in play, and the consequences that resulted from those events."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information: - Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, or SFWA (or ) is a nonprofit 501(c)3 organization of professional science fiction and fantasy writers in the United States. It was founded in 1965 by Damon Knight under the name Science Fiction Writers of America, Inc. The president of SFWA as of 2015 is Cat Rambo. - Big science is a term used by scientists and historians of science to describe a series of changes in science which occurred in industrial nations during and after World War II, as scientific progress increasingly came to rely on large-scale projects usually funded by national governments or groups of governments. Individual or small group efforts, or Small Science, is still relevant today as theoretical results by individual authors may have a significant impact, but very often the empirical verification requires experiments using constructions, such as the Large Hadron Collider, costing between 5 and 10 billion. - Hard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by an emphasis on scientific accuracy. The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s \\"Islands of Space\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the \\"hard\\" (natural) and \\"soft\\" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful. - The Ringworld Throne is a novel by Larry Niven , first published in 1996 . It is the direct sequel to his previous work The Ringworld Engineers ( 1980 ) . He wrote it as a replacement after being unable to finish his contracted novel The Ghost Ships , the sequel to The Integral Trees and The Smoke Ring . - The Integral Trees is a 1984 science fiction novel by Larry Niven (first published as a serial in \\"Analog\\" in 1983). Like much of Niven's work, the story is heavily influenced by the setting: a gas torus, a ring of air around a neutron star. A sequel, \\"The Smoke Ring\\", was published in 1987. - A neutron star is the collapsed core of a large (1029 solar masses) star. Neutron stars are the smallest and densest stars known to exist. Though neutron stars typically have a radius on the order of 10 km, they can have masses of about twice that of the Sun. They result from the supernova explosion of a massive star, combined with gravitational collapse, that compresses the core past the white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei. Most of the basic models for these objects imply that neutron stars are composed almost entirely of neutrons, which are subatomic particles with no net electrical charge and with slightly larger mass than protons. They are supported against further collapse by neutron degeneracy pressure, a phenomenon described by the Pauli exclusion principle. If the remnant has too great a density, something which occurs in excess of an upper limit of the size of neutron stars at 2-3 solar masses, it will continue collapsing to form a black hole. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - The Magic Goes Away is a fantasy short story written by Larry Niven in 1976, and later expanded to a novella of the same name which was published in 1978. While these works were not the first in the \\"Magic Universe\\" or \\"Warlock\\" series, they marked a turning point after the 1973 oil crisis and Niven's subsequent transformation of the series into an allegory for a modern-day energy crisis. The setting was later used as a backdrop for a series of full-length novels, \\"The Burning City\\" (2000) and its sequel, \\"Burning Tower\\" (2005), which were co-written with Jerry Pournelle. - Laurence van Cott Niven (born April 30, 1938)known as Larry Nivenis an American science fiction writer. His best-known work is \\"Ringworld\\" (1970), which received Hugo, Locus, Ditmar, and Nebula awards. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America named him the 2015 recipient of the Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award. His work is primarily hard science fiction, using big science concepts and theoretical physics. It also often includes elements of detective fiction and adventure stories. His fantasy includes the series \\"The Magic Goes Away\\", rational fantasy dealing with magic as a non-renewable resource. - Detective fiction is a subgenre of crime fiction and mystery fiction in which an investigator or a detectiveeither professional or amateurinvestigates a crime, often murder. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - The Locus Awards are an annual set of literary awards by the science fiction and fantasy magazine \\"Locus\\", a monthly based in Oakland, California, United States. The award winners are selected by poll of magazine readers. - Ringworld is a 1970 science fiction novel by Larry Niven, set in his Known Space universe and considered a classic of science fiction literature. Niven later added four sequels and four prequels. (The Fleet of Worlds series, co-written with Edward M. Lerner provides the four prequels as well as \\"Fate of Worlds\\", the final sequel.) These books tie into numerous other books set in Known Space. \\"Ringworld\\" won the Nebula Award in 1970, as well as both the Hugo Award and Locus Award in 1971. - The Ringworld Engineers is a 1980 science fiction novel by Larry Niven. It is the first sequel to Niven's award-winning \\"Ringworld\\" and was nominated for both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1981. - The Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award is a lifetime honor presented annually by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America to no more than one living writer of fantasy or science fiction. It was inaugurated in 1975 when Robert Heinlein was made the first SFWA Grand Master and it was renamed in 2002 after the Association's founder, Damon Knight, who had died that year.

Despite a tight narrative, Johnnie To's Election feels at times like it was once a longer picture, with many characters and plot strands abandoned or ultimately unresolved. Some of these are dealt with in the truly excellent and far superior sequel, Election 2: Harmony is a Virtue, but it's still a dependably enthralling thriller about a contested Triad election that bypasses the usual shootouts and explosions (though not the violence) in favour of constantly shifting alliances that can turn in the time it takes to make a phone call. It's also a film where the most ruthless character isn't always the most threatening one, as the chilling ending makes only too clear: one can imagine a lifetime of psychological counselling being necessary for all the trauma that one inflicts on one unfortunate bystander. Simon Yam, all too often a variable actor but always at his best under To's direction, has possibly never been better in the lead, not least because Tony Leung's much more extrovert performance makes his stillness more the powerful. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"This review indicates a positive outlook on the movie, despite certain criticisms. Firstly, the reviewer acknowledges that \\"Election\\" feels as though it might have been a longer film initially due to numerous characters and plot strands left unresolved. However, this is partially accepted by noting that some aspects are resolved in the sequel, presenting this issue as a continuity matter rather than an inherent failing of the movie itself. Secondly, the reviewer praises the film as a \\"dependably enthralling thriller,\\" appreciating that it diverges from the traditional reliance on shootouts and explosions, opting instead for a complex portrayal of shifting alliances. This sophistication is admired as it enriches the storyline and maintains audience engagement. The treatment of character development also receives commendation. The depiction of a ruthless character who isn't always the most threatening one introduces a different dimension to the movie. The reviewer finds this chilling and profoundly impactful, implying that it triggers deep psychological revelations, suggesting that they found this element of the movie insightful and striking. Lastly, the performances of actors Simon Yam and Tony Leung receive high praise. The reviewer highlights that both actors turn in remarkable performances, with Simon Yam, in particular, delivering his possibly best ever performance under To's direction.

A recent video that surfaced online has stirred up quite the debate, as it shows a \\"bear-like\\" creature emerging briefly from a wooded area in the Adygeya Republic, Southwestern Russia. The footage captured by a Russian team has led some to believe that they may have finally captured footage of the elusive Yeti, whereas others remain skeptical and question the video's authenticity. The video, which lasts only a few seconds, displays a figure covered in hair as it emerges from an area of trees. Shortly after its appearance, the creature mysteriously disappears back into the woods. This rare sighting has left the Russian team and others convinced that they have identified the mythical Yeti, the legendary apelike beast purported to inhabit remote regions in the world. However, not everyone is convinced about the legitimacy of the footage. Critics have called attention to the possibility that the video was staged in a bid to boost tourism in the region, pointing out that such stunts are not uncommon to attract curious visitors. Skeptics urge a more cautious approach when examining the video and taking into account alternative explanations to the Yeti claim. While the debate surrounding the video's authenticity persists, the identity of the hairy, \\"bear-like\\" creature remains uncertain. For now, enthusiasts and skeptics alike will continue to analyze the footage and weigh in on the possibility of having captured a genuine sighting of the legendary Yeti, igniting further conversation about the existence of this mysterious creature. In conclusion, the short video featuring a hairy creature in Southwestern Russia has sparked much debate and garnered widespread attention as to whether it is truly footage of the long-rumored Yeti or simply a clever stunt to draw visitors.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person whose father was determined that his sons would not work in the mines?, using the article: Henry Moore was born in Castleford, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, to Mary Baker and Raymond Spencer Moore. His father was of Irish origin and became pit deputy and then under-manager of the Wheldale colliery in Castleford. He was an autodidact with an interest in music and literature. Determined that his sons would not work in the mines, he saw formal education as the route to their advancement. Henry was the seventh of eight children in a family that often struggled with poverty. He attended infant and elementary schools in Castleford, where he began modelling in clay and carving in wood. He professed to have decided to become a sculptor when he was eleven after hearing of Michelangelo's achievements at a Sunday School reading.On his second attempt he was accepted at Castleford Grammar School, which several of his siblings had attended, where his headmaster soon noticed his talent and interest in medieval sculpture. His art teacher broadened his knowledge of art, and with her encouragement, he determined to make art his career; first by sitting for examinations for a scholarship to the local art college. Moore's earliest recorded carvings – a plaque for the Scott Society at Castleford Secondary School, and a Roll of Honour commemorating the boys who went to fight in the First World War from the school – were executed around this time.Despite his early promise, Moore's parents had been against him training as a sculptor, a vocation they considered manual labour with few career prospects. After a brief introduction as a student teacher, Moore became a teacher at the school he had attended. Upon turning eighteen, Moore volunteered for army service. He was the youngest man in the Prince of Wales' Own Civil Service Rifles regiment and was injured in 1917 in a gas attack, on 30 November at Bourlon Wood, during the Battle of Cambrai. After recovering in hospital, he saw out the remainder of the war as a physical training instructor, only returning to France as the Armistice was signed.

Hypothesis: If you are dueling, you won't be hit by an arrow. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"To analyze whether or not the premise entails the hypothesis, let's dissect the premise and hypothesis into their core ideas and determine if a logical connection exists between them based on the rules of classical logic. Premise: You could be dueling beautifully until an arrow hits you in the back. This statement suggests three key ideas: 1. You are engaged in a duel. 2. You display exceptional skill in dueling. 3. At some point, an unexpected event occurs, disrupting the duel, i.e., you are hit by an arrow in the back. Hypothesis: If you are dueling, you won't be hit by an arrow. This statement expresses two core ideas: 1. You are engaged in a duel. 2. As long as you are dueling, you are safe from being hit by an arrow. Now, let's examine the relationship between the premise and hypothesis: The premise does not entail the hypothesis, as there is a contradiction between the two. According to the premise, it's possible to be engaged in a duel and still be hit by an arrow, while the hypothesis asserts that you cannot be hit by an arrow if you are dueling. In fact, the premise contradicts the hypothesis: the premise describes a situation where a person is dueling and subsequently hit by an arrow in the back. This fact demonstrates that being engaged in a duel does not guarantee safety from arrows, thus disproving the hypothesis. Furthermore, the hypothesis suggests that the act of dueling provides protection against being hit by arrows, while the premise implies that a beautiful duel can be interrupted by an arrow in the back. This disconnect further emphasizes the lack of logical entailment between the two statements. In conclusion, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise illustrates a scenario where one is dueling and gets hit by an arrow, which directly contradicts the hypothesis's assertion that being engaged in a duel prevents one from being hit by an arrow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that recorded travelers being assaulted by bandits on the road that reopened when the Tang reconquered the Four Garrisons of Anxi? from the following article ? Although the Silk Road from China to Europe and the Western World was initially formulated during the reign of Emperor Wu (141–87 BC) during the Han, it was reopened by the Tang in 639 when Hou Junji (d. 643) conquered the West, and remained open for almost four decades. It was closed after the Tibetans captured it in 678, but in 699, during Empress Wu's period, the Silk Road reopened when the Tang reconquered the Four Garrisons of Anxi originally installed in 640, once again connecting China directly to the West for land-based trade. The Tang captured the vital route through the Gilgit Valley from Tibet in 722, lost it to the Tibetans in 737, and regained it under the command of the Goguryeo-Korean General Gao Xianzhi. When the An Lushan Rebellion ended in 763, the Tang Empire had once again lost control over its western lands, as the Tibetan Empire largely cut off China's direct access to the Silk Road. An internal rebellion in 848 ousted the Tibetan rulers, and Tang China regained its northwestern prefectures from Tibet in 851. These lands contained crucial grazing areas and pastures for raising horses that the Tang dynasty desperately needed.Despite the many expatriate European travelers coming into China to live and trade, many travelers, mainly religious monks and missionaries, recorded the strict border laws that the Chinese enforced. As the monk Xuanzang and many other monk travelers attested to, there were many Chinese government checkpoints along the Silk Road that examined travel permits into the Tang Empire. Furthermore, banditry was a problem along the checkpoints and oasis towns, as Xuanzang also recorded that his group of travelers were assaulted by bandits on multiple occasions. The Silk Road also affected Tang dynasty art. Horses became a significant symbol of prosperity and power as well as an instrument of military and diplomatic policy. Horses were also revered as a relative of the dragon. Answer:","completion":"Xuanzang"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

However, we should remember that clothes designers study what ordinary people wear on the street. Then they make clothes like ordinary people's for everyone. Therefore, fashion really starts with individual finding a new look. Then a company uses that look and then it becomes fashionable! That doesn't mean you will. That is to say, a model might look perfect in a shirt but that doesn't mean you will. The same goes for mobile phones. Young people are always asking me when to change my mobile phones. Mobile phone companies are always putting new functions on their phones but do we really need all these extra functions? I use my phone to call people and to send messages to my friends. I don't need a camera, Internet surfing or a calendar on my phone. Again, if you buy the latest phone, it will only be the latest phone for a month or so.

Answer the following question: Information: - BMX, an abbreviation for bicycle motocross, is a cycle sport performed on BMX bikes, either in competitive BMX racing or freestyle BMX, or else in general on- or off-road recreation. BMX began when young cyclists appropriated motocross tracks for fun, racing and stunts, eventually evolving specialized BMX bikes and competitions. - BMX racing is a type of off-road bicycle racing. The format of BMX was derived from motocross racing. BMX bicycle races are sprint races on purpose-built off-road single-lap race tracks. The track usually consists of a starting gate for up to eight racers, a groomed, serpentine, dirt race course made of various jumps and rollers and a finish line. The course is usually flat, about wide and has large banked corners that help the riders maintain speed. The sport of BMX racing is facilitated by a number of regional and international sanctioning bodies. They provide rules for sanctioning the conduct of the flying, specify age group and skill-level classifications among the racers, and maintain some kind of points-accumulation system over the racing season. The sport is very family oriented and largely participant-driven, with riders ranging in age from 2 to 70, and over. Professional ranks exist for both men and women, where the age ranges from 18 to 40 years old. - The 2009 UCI BMX World Championships took place at the Adelaide Showgrounds in Adelaide in Australia and crowned world champions in the cycling discipline of BMX . - Cycle sport is competitive physical activity using bicycles. There are several categories of bicycle racing including road bicycle racing, time trialling, cyclo-cross, mountain bike racing, track cycling, BMX, and cycle speedway. Non-racing cycling sports include artistic cycling, cycle polo, freestyle BMX and mountain bike trials. The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) is the world governing body for cycling and international competitive cycling events. The International Human Powered Vehicle Association is the governing body for human-powered vehicles that imposes far fewer restrictions on their design than does the UCI. The UltraMarathon Cycling Association is the governing body for many ultra-distance cycling races. - A BMX bike is an off-road sport bicycle used for racing and stunt riding. BMX means bicycle motocross. - Cycling, also called bicycling or biking, is the use of bicycles for transport, recreation, exercise or sport. Persons engaged in cycling are referred to as \\"cyclists\\", \\"bikers\\", or less commonly, as \\"bicyclists\\". Apart from two-wheeled bicycles, \\"cycling\\" also includes the riding of unicycles, tricycles, quadracycles, recumbent and similar human-powered vehicles (HPVs). - A unicycle is a vehicle that touches the ground with only one wheel. The most common variation has a frame with a saddle, and has a pedal-driven direct drive. Unicycling is practiced professionally in circuses, by street performers, and in festivals and as a hobby. Unicycles have also been used to create new sports such as unicycle hockey. In recent years unicycles have also been used in activities similar to mountain biking or trials. - UCI BMX World Championships are the world championships for BMX racing (bicycle motorcross) held under the regulations of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), the sport's international governing body. - The Union Cycliste Internationale, commonly known by the acronym UCI, is the world governing body for sports cycling and oversees international competitive cycling events. The UCI is based in Aigle, Switzerland. - Motocross is a form of off-road motorcycle racing held on enclosed off-road circuits. The sport evolved from motorcycle trials competitions held in the United Kingdom. - Freestyle BMX is bicycle motocross stunt riding on BMX bikes. It is an extreme sport descended from BMX racing that consists of five disciplines: street, park, vert, trails, and flatland.

Please write a short summary for the following article: 1m reward for stolen Andy Warhols Andy Warhol sports paintings that have been stolen. Photograph: HO/Reuters A reward of 1m is being offered this weekend for information leading to the recovery of a unique collection of stolen Andy Warhol portraits. The works of art disappeared earlier this month from the Los Angeles home of Richard Weisman, who commissioned them from the artist in the 1970s. Weisman's 10 original silkscreen prints feature famous sporting figures. The images include portraits of boxer Muhammad Ali, tennis player Chris Evert, golfer Jack Nicklaus, footballer Pelé and disgraced actor and former American football star OJ Simpson. They were produced by Warhol between 1977 and 1979. The pieces were taken from the walls of the house's dining room, along with a Warhol portrait of Weisman. Police said the theft had been discovered by a nanny on 3 September. The Weisman family were not at home when she spotted that the Warhol works had been removed. Several valuable artworks, including other notable prints by Warhol, were left untouched. The house, in an exclusive area of the city on Angelo Drive, was locked at the time of the discovery and there was no sign of forced entry. Mark Sommer, a detective with the LA police department's art theft unit, said it was unclear how the paintings had been removed but that witnesses in the road had noted a maroon van parked in the drive at around the time the theft was noticed. \\"This was a very clean crime,\\" Sommer said. \\"[The home] wasn't ransacked. For some reason they had an interest in this collection.\\" Don Hrycyk, another detective, said that the delay in announcing the theft had allowed police to organise the reward and distribute photographs of the missing artworks. The 10 portraits that make up the collection are each about 40 inches by 40 inches and were featured in a book, Picasso to Pop: The Richard Weisman Collection, that was published by Weisman in 2003. He had tried to sell the collection the previous year for 3m (£1.8m). \\"The theft of Warhol's athlete series represents a profoundly personal loss to me and my family,\\" the collector said in a statement on Friday. Warhol became famous as an artist in the 1960s for his ground-breaking pop art images. The artist's bohemian lifestyle, combined with his avant garde film-making and the parties he held at the New York studio known as The Factory, helped to establish him as an enduring cult figure. Brenda Klippel, director of Martin Lawrence Galleries in Los Angeles, which has a large collection of Warhols, said: \\"Warhol was always a portraitist and fascinated with anyone in the public eye. He wanted all of his imagery to be instantly recognisable. \\"If Weisman was in his circle and had the money, he could commission what he wanted.\\" Summary:","completion":"A collection of really special paintings by an artist named Andy Warhol have been stolen, and the person who can help find them will get a reward of 1 million dollars! These paintings belonged to a man named Richard Weisman, and they had pictures of famous sport players like Muhammad Ali, Pelé, and OJ Simpson. The paintings were taken from Richard's house while he and his family were not home, but no one knows exactly how they disappeared."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The information given in the context does not provide any evidence or insight into Ed Cebula's motivations or feelings towards the project. To fully examine the validity of the hypothesis, we can break down the context and consider related factors. 1. Manufacturing and production: The context reveals that Mike Bossy the Scoring Machine was a prototype pinball machine manufactured by Game Plan, Inc. in 1982. Only one machine was produced, indicating that it was a unique and limited project. However, this information does not suggest whether or not Ed Cebula was interested in designing the machine. 2. Features and theme: The pinball machine featured New York Islanders hockey star Mike Bossy, which could be perceived as a selling point for hockey fans or those interested in limited-edition pinball machines. Still, this fact does not provide any indication as to the designer's intentions or preferences on taking part in the project. 3. Design and endorsement: According to the context, Ed Cebula designed the pinball machine, which was the only professionally endorsed pinball machine by Game Plan. This information highlights the uniqueness of the project but does not provide any direct evidence as to whether Cebula was interested or not in designing the machine. Based on available information, it is impossible to confirm or deny the hypothesis that Ed Cebula didn't want to design the pinball machine. The context does not provide sufficient details on the designer's emotions, motivations, or personal thoughts about the project. To support or disprove the hypothesis, more information would be needed, such as direct statements from Ed Cebula regarding his experience with the project or insight from colleagues or company insiders.

The Famous Flames were an American rhythm and blues vocal group founded in Toccoa, Georgia, in 1953 by Bobby Byrd. James Brown began his career as a member of the Famous Flames, emerging as the lead singer by the time of their first professional recording, \\"Please, Please, Please\\", in 1956. On hit songs such as \\"Try Me\\", \\"Bewildered\\", \\"Think\\", \\"I Don't Mind\\", and \\"I'll Go Crazy\\", the Flames' smooth backing harmonies contrasted strikingly with Brown's raw, impassioned delivery, and their synchronized dance steps were a prominent feature of their live shows. Altogether, they performed on 12 songs that reached the Billboard R&B and pop charts, in addition to being featured on numerous albums, including the groundbreaking Live at the Apollo. In 1986, the first committee of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame announced that James Brown would be one of the Hall of Fame's first charter members to be inducted. However, Brown's former singing group, the Famous Flames, were not included in this induction. The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame's criterion states that only artists whose first recording had been out for more than 25 years were eligible for induction. Brown's first solo recording did not meet that criterion. Rock & Roll Hall of Fame president and chief executive officer Terry Stewart contended that Brown was indeed eligible for induction but as a member of The Famous Flames. Concerning the Hall of Fame's failure to induct The Flames with Brown back in 1986, Stewart went on to say: \\"There was no legislative intent why they weren't included; somehow they just got overlooked.\\" In 2011, a special committee was set up to correct exclusions which might have occurred during the first two years of Rock Hall inductions (1986 and 1987) due to the impact of the bands' lead singers or front men. The Famous Flames (Byrd, Bennett, Terry and Stallworth) were inducted in April 2012 alongside other \\"backing groups\\" such as The Midnighters (Hank Ballard), The Comets (Bill Haley), The Crickets (Buddy Holly), The Blue Caps (Gene Vincent) and The Miracles (Smokey Robinson). Since all these lead singers were actually members of these groups, these were not really \\"backing groups\\" at all. This was highlighted by Smokey Robinson, who did the induction honors for all of the groups, including his own Miracles, who stated, \\"These people do not stand behind you. They stand with you.\\" \\"These are not backing groups. These are the groups.\\" Bennett, as the Famous Flames' only surviving member, accepted the honor in person in Cleveland on April 14, 2012. Bennett further stated the induction was not only a correction for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame committee's mishap in 1986 but also a reunion: \\"For years, I felt like we were all separated,\\" said Bennett. \\"I feel like we're whole again, I wish we could all be here as one group. Yes, James Brown was the most famous of the Flames, but we were all Famous Flames.\\" Onstage, during the induction ceremony, Miracles lead singer Smokey Robinson, said, \\"If James Brown was the Hardest Working Man in Show Business, The Famous Flames were the hardest-working group\\". The Famous Flames did appear in the James Brown biopic Get on Up, which was released in U.S. theatres nationwide on August 1, 2014. In May 2012, the oldies music magazine Goldmine inducted James Brown & The Famous Flames into their first class of The Goldmine Hall of Fame.

It's worth noting that the number of 'main' cast members in a film can often be subjective and context-dependent, usually referring to those who received top-billing or appear most prominently in the narrative. However, the use of the term 'stars' in the text suggests that these five actors were all considered lead players or 'main cast' for the purposes of this film.

Markham takes a somewhat 'unclear' point of view when writting about the French Emperor. At times it seems like he is praising Napoleon for one thing or the other and at other times he is criticizing the ' Corsican Orge'. He laudes Napoleon's form of government as being advanced beyond its years yet he draws on unreliable memoirs which denounced Napoleon with impunity. 'Unreliable' memoirs are those which were written by those, between 1815 and 1830, who wished to regain Bourbon favour and be allowed back into prestigious positions.

In total they gave away some 30,000 samples, in what was the 10th time in a row they have been generous at the biannual event. For Propercorn the giveaway is part of a strategy that also sees it offer free packets at arts events in the UK capital, such as Late at the Tate Britain, when the art museum opens its doors at night and puts on a music concert. It is a deliberate move by the company to target the so-called trendsetters and influencers, in the hope that they will speak positively about the product, giving it a word-of-mouth buzz. A Propercorn spokesman explains: \\"Positioning popcorn outside of traditional snack circles, and looking for inspiration at design, fashion, wellbeing and entrepreneurship events, helps us to remain fresh and part of this exciting cultural dialogue. \\"It's less about immediate increase in sales, and more about getting our product in the hands of people who will excitedly and personally engage in our brand and story.\\" Everyone loves a freebie, but is it really free? Not even remotely, says Jean-Pierre Dube, professor of marketing at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Instead, the cost of giving away free samples comes from a firm's marketing budget, which in turn comes from its overall earnings. Prof Dube says: \\"Giving things away is definitely a form of marketing. \\"[For example], when you buy a ski vacation that comes with 'free lessons', the lessons are of course not free. \\"The price of the package was set with the lessons taken into account.\\" He adds: \\"But what about literally giving things away? There is still no free. \\"This is an investment the firm makes in anticipation of receiving the reward in the future. For example, [US cable TV firm] Comcast gave away free digital video recorders as a promotion a few years ago. This was just an investment in receiving the monthly cash flows from people's service subscriptions.\\" If you want to be handed a freebie on the street, it certainly helps to live in a country's capital or largest city. This is not simply because of the larger population, but because a country's main conurbation is more often the trendsetter for retail purchases. So in the UK new products or new promotional campaigns are invariably launched in London, in the US it is New York, while in France it is Paris, and so on. The hope is that the young and fashionable of the big city will try the item, like it, and then talk positively about it - preferably on social media in this day and age. If all goes to plan this will kick start increased sales across the country as a whole. Consumer goods giant Unilever went for this approach last year when it sought to increase UK sales of its Lipton Ice Tea brand. Lipton's Daybreakers campaign saw it give out free drinks at a number of breakfast events across London that included DJ sets and live music. Venues included Old Street in fashionable east London, and the Sky Garden venue at the top of the 34-floor 20 Fenchurch Street building, otherwise known as the \\"walkie talkie\\". A Lipton spokesman says: \\"In order for people to look at Lipton Ice Tea in a new way, we needed to offer consumers a meaningful and relevant reason to try it. \\"We therefore went down an early morning experimental road to cut through and create a clearly different brand experience.\\" UK drinks firm Innocent is also in the habit of first giving out free samples in London, such as when it launched its coconut water product in 2015. This saw it hand out free samples at a pop-up bar in the trendy Shoreditch area. Innocent, which is majority owned by US giant Coca-Cola, has since gone on to offer free samples at UK music festivals Latitude and Wilderness, and at sporting events such as the Richmond marathon, in south west London. Last year it gave away more than 500,000 cartons. James Peach, Innocent's coconut water brand manager, says: \\"For [free] sampling to be effective it's important to be targeting the right type of consumer at the moment they would most likely want to use the product, so they get the most out of the experience, and understand the product's benefits. \\"Generally people drink coconut water to naturally re-hydrate or rejuvenate themselves after exercise or after excess [if they are hungover]. So we simply try to target those occasions as much as we can, to be there when people need it most.\\" While most consumers don't give freebies much thought, behavioural economist Enrico Trevisan says that from the perspective of the business there are three main types; \\"future selling\\", \\"cross selling\\" and \\"up-selling\\". \\"In the future selling approach, firms give away a product for free, assuming that clients will like it and want to buy more in the future,\\" he says. \\"With cross-selling, the company tries to gain new clients through an entrance product, with the intention of selling them additional products during their life cycle.\\" Mr Trevisan, who works for marketing consultancy Simon-Kucher & Partners, says that an example of cross-selling is banks giving current accounts away for free in order to later sell the client loans, mortgages and overdrafts. Finally, he says that up-selling is when a firm gives away a basic version of the product, but then charges the client for more advanced and complete versions. He cites the examples of online news websites that only offer a limited number of free articles. However, Mr Trevisan cautions that while \\"giving something for free to potential users is not necessarily complicated, to convert them into paying customers is a very different story\\". Follow Business Brain series editor Will Smale on Twitter @WillSmale1 Summary:","completion":"During special events like London Fashion Week, many companies give away free samples of their products to people who attend. These companies want to give samples to people who follow the latest styles and trends, because they hope these people will tell others about the product. This helps spread the word about the product and might make more people want to buy it. Companies spend money from their marketing budget to provide these free samples; the goal is to make customers interested in buying more in the future. Sometimes these tactics work, but sometimes it's difficult to turn people who get free samples into customers who actually buy the products."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: Dion Francis DiMucci (born July 18, 1939), better known mononymously as Dion, is an American singer, songwriter whose work has incorporated elements of doo-wop, rock and R&B styles--and, most recently, straight blues. He was one of the most popular American rock and roll performers of the pre-British Invasion era. He had 39 Top 40 hits in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a solo performer, with the Belmonts or with the Del Satins. He is best remembered for the singles \\"Runaround Sue\\", \\"The Wanderer\\", \\"Ruby Baby\\" and \\"Lovers Who Wander\\", among his other hits. Context: By the end of 1960, Dion had released his first solo album on Laurie, Alone with Dion, and the single \\"Lonely Teenager,\\" which rose to No. 12 in the US charts. The name on his solo releases was simply \\"Dion.\\" Follow-ups \\"Havin' Fun\\" and \\"Kissin' Game\\" had less success, and the signs were that Dion would drift onto the cabaret circuit. However, he then recorded, with a new vocal group, the Del-Satins, an up-tempo number co-written with Ernie Maresca. The record, \\"Runaround Sue,\\" stormed up the U.S. charts, reaching No. 1 in October 1961, and No. 11 in the UK, where he also toured. \\"Runaround Sue\\" sold over a million copies, achieving gold disc status. For the next single, Laurie promoted the A-side, \\"The Majestic,\\" but it was the B-side, Maresca's \\"The Wanderer,\\" which received more radio play and climbed swiftly up the charts to reach No. 2 in the U.S. in February 1962 and No. 10 in the UK (the 1976 re-release made the UK Top 20). \\"The Wanderer\\" has been used in the post-apocalyptic role-playing game Fallout 4, both in-game and in a trailer of the same name released in 2015. By the end of 1961, Dion had become a major star, touring worldwide and making an appearance in the Columbia Pictures musical film Twist Around the Clock. He followed with a string of singles - \\"Lovers Who Wander\\" (No. 3), \\"Little Diane\\" (No. 8), \\"Love Came to Me\\" (No. 10) - in 1962, several of which he wrote or co-wrote. He also had successful albums with Runaround Sue and Lovers Who Wander. At the end of 1962, Dion moved from Laurie to Columbia Records; he was the first rock and roll artist signed to the label, which was an anomaly considering that its then-A&R director, Mitch Miller, passionately loathed that particular genre of music. The first Columbia single, Leiber and Stoller's \\"Ruby Baby\\" (originally a hit for the Drifters) reached No. 2, while \\"Donna the Prima Donna\\" and \\"Drip Drop\\" (another remake of a Drifters hit) both reached No. 6 in late 1963. (Dion also recorded an Italian version of \\"Donna the Prima Donna\\" using the identical backup vocals.) His other Columbia releases were less successful, and problems with his addiction and changing public tastes, especially The British Invasion, saw a period of commercial decline. Question: Did he perform well for Columbia Records?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, Dion performed well for Columbia Records at first. When he moved to Columbia Records, some of his songs like \\"Ruby Baby\\" reached No. 2, and both \\"Donna the Prima Donna\\" and \\"Drip Drop\\" reached No. 6 in late 1963. However, his other releases with Columbia were less successful, and he faced problems with addiction and changing public tastes, which led to a period of commercial decline."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This difference indicates that the type of rape described in each sentence is not the same. - Perpetrators, victims, timing of the kidnap, and when sex occurs: These elements are the same in both sentences.

How is \\"Following the mid-term review, farmers are looking for alternative ways to carry on their business.\\" said in German?","completion":"Nach der Zwischenbewertung suchen Landwirte nach alternativen Möglichkeiten, um ihr Geschäft fortzuführen. Here is a detailed explanation of the translation: 1. \\"Following the mid-term review\\" - This phrase can be translated to \\"Nach der Zwischenbewertung\\" in German. \\"Nach\\" means \\"after\\" or \\"following,\\" \\"der\\" is the definite article in the dative case for \\"die Bewertung\\" (the review), and \\"Zwischenbewertung\\" is the compound noun meaning \\"mid-term review.\\" 2. \\"farmers\\" - The word \\"farmers\\" is translated to \\"Landwirte\\" in German. \\"Landwirt\\" is a singular noun, and to make it plural, you add an \\"-e\\" at the end. 3. \\"are looking for\\" - This phrase can be translated to \\"suchen\\" in German, which means \\"are searching for\\" or \\"are looking for.\\" In this context, \\"suchen\\" (the verb) should come in the second position in the sentence, as per the German sentence structure rule. 4. \\"alternative ways\\" - The phrase \\"alternative ways\\" is translated to \\"alternativen Möglichkeiten\\" in German. \\"Alternativen\\" is the plural form of \\"alternative\\" (alternative) and it agrees with \\"Möglichkeiten\\" (plural) in terms of grammatical gender (both are feminine) and number. \\"Möglichkeiten\\" is a plural term, which means \\"ways\\" or \\"options.\\" 5. \\"to carry on\\" - This phrase can be translated as \\"fortzuführen\\" in German. \\"Fortführen\\" means to continue or carry on and often becomes a separable verb. In this context, it is necessary to use its infinitive form (\\"fortzuführen\\") because it is combined with another verb (\\"suchen\\") in the sentence. 6. \\"their business\\" - This part can be translated as \\"ihr Geschäft.\\" \\"Ihr\\" is a possessive pronoun that means \\"their,\\" and \\"Geschäft\\" is a noun that means \\"business\\" or \\"trade.\\" In summary, the complete sentence \\"Following the mid-term review, farmers are looking for alternative ways to carry on their business\\" can be translated to \\"Nach der Zwischenbewertung suchen Landwirte nach alternativen Möglichkeiten, um ihr Geschäft fortzuführen\\" in German."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information: - Illinois is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1818. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics. - Edwin Thanhouser (11 November 1865 21 March 1956) was an actor, businessman, and film producer, most notable as a founder of the Thanhouser Company, which was one of the first motion picture studios, along with his wife Gertrude Thanhouser and brother-in-law Lloyd Lonergan. - Gertrude Homan Thanhouser (April 23, 1882 May 29, 1951), wife of co-founder Edwin Thanhouser, worked at the Thanhouser Company film studio as actress, scenario writer, film editor, and studio executive. Her efforts made the studio one of the key independent US film studios in the nickelodeon and transitional era, praised for its erudite adaptations of Shakespeare and other \\"classical\\" stage dramas to the screen. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.

The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music. - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America.

Tree city burned lots of gas and other fossil fuels, while Leaf city was very protective towards its environment. Which city caused less acid rain? Answer:","completion":"Leaf City caused less acid rain than Tree City. Acid rain is a result of air pollution caused by the release of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the atmosphere. These chemicals usually come from the burning of fossil fuels, like coal, oil, and gas in power plants, vehicles, and industrial processes. When sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides combine with moisture in the atmosphere, they create sulfuric and nitric acids, which eventually fall back to the ground as acid rain. Since Tree City burned larger amounts of gas and other fossil fuels, it contributed more to the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. In contrast, Leaf City was more environmentally-conscious and protective of its surroundings, which suggests that it relied more on clean energy sources and took measures to limit its use of fossil fuels. As a result, it released fewer pollutants, leading to less acid rain in and around the city. Overall, Leaf City was more environmentally responsible and experienced a lower impact of acid rain compared to Tree City."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Next, we need to get rid of the constant term \\"-94\\" to isolate the term with the variable \\"r\\". To do this, we'll add 94 to both sides of the equation: -85 + 94 = 3*r - 94 + 94 Simplify: 9 = 3*r 3. Now, we have the equation in the form 9 = 3*r. We can see that the coefficient of r is 3. In order to isolate r, we need to get rid of the coefficient \\"3\\" by dividing both sides of the equation by 3: (9 = 3*r) / 3 Simplify: 3 = r So, the solution to the equation -85 = 3*r - 94 is r = 3."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a short movie review that has \\"negative\\" sentiment ( + negative; + positive;).","completion":"Title: Disaster at Sunshine High Disaster at Sunshine High is a movie that evidently had potential, but unfortunately fell significantly short of the mark, leaving audiences dissatisfied and disappointed. While the premise initially seemed unique, the plot was haphazard and failed to live up to expectations. The movie aimed to blend dark humor with teen drama, centering on group of misfit students attempting to navigate the treacherous high school social landscape. However, the film struggled in finding the proper balance between comedy and impactful storytelling. The poorly constructed jokes and forced humor left the audience cringing more often than laughing, detracting from the narrative's overarching themes. Moreover, the character development in Disaster at Sunshine High was completely superficial and one-dimensional. The viewer is given little opportunity to empathize with or understand the motives of each character, as they are reduced to mere caricatures of high school stereotypes. This lack of depth prevented the audience from forming any emotional connection to the characters, leading to a dire lack of engagement. On a positive note, the movie's cinematography was quite impressive. The film utilized a visually striking color palette, which contrasted well with the dark undertones of the story. Additionally, the captivating use of background scores managed to temporarily break through the painful mediocrity of the other elements, providing an engaging relief to the largely flawed overall experience. In conclusion, Disaster at Sunshine High is a movie that should have been a powerful exploration of teen angst and identity struggles, but instead the heavy reliance on flat humor, lack of character depth, and weak plotlines resulted in a disappointing viewing experience. While the movie boasted commendable visuals, it's just not enough to save it from its numerous shortcomings. One can only hope that the creative minds involved will learn from this misstep and create more engaging and fleshed-out stories in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: The Mummy 's Shroud is set in 1920 and tells the story of a team of archaeologists who come across the lost tomb of the boy Pharaoh Kah-To-Bey . The story begins with a flash back sequence to Ancient Egypt and we see the story of how Prem , a manservant of Kah-To-Bey , spirited away the boy when his father was killed in a palace coup and took him into the desert for protection . Unfortunately , the boy dies and is buried . The story then moves forward to 1920 and shows the expedition led by scientist Sir Basil Walden and business man Stanley Preston finding the tomb . They ignore the dire warning issued to them by Hasmid , a local Bedouin about the consequences for those that violate the tombs of Ancient Egypt and remove the bodies and the sacred shroud . Sir Basil is bitten by a snake just after finding the tomb . He recovers , but has a relapse after arriving back in Cairo . Preston takes advantage of this and commits him to an insane asylum , to take credit for finding the tomb and Prince 's mummy himself . Meanwhile , after being placed in the Cairo Museum , the mummy of Prem is revived when Hasmid chants the sacred oath on the shroud . The mummy then proceeds to go on a murderous rampage to kill off the members of the expedition , beginning with Sir Basil after he escapes from the asylum .

Sentence 1: at six o'clock yeah yeah i know Sentence 2: It is at noon. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. In order to determine entailment, it is essential to understand the meaning of the two sentences and the relationship between them. Entailment is a semantic relation in which the truth of one sentence necessarily implies the truth of the other. In other words, if the first sentence is true, the second sentence must also be true for entailment to exist. Sentence 1: \\"At six o'clock yeah yeah I know\\" This sentence implies that the speaker acknowledges something happening or being discussed at six o'clock. The repetition of \\"yeah\\" might suggest the speaker's enthusiasm or impatience. However, without any additional context, it is difficult to determine the exact situation occurring at six o'clock. Sentence 2: \\"It is at noon\\" This sentence states that another event or occurrence is scheduled or expected to happen at noon. Here, the time mentioned is explicitly different from the time mentioned in Sentence 1 – noon as opposed to six o'clock. Because the two sentences mention different times (six o'clock and noon) and do not provide any explicit connection between the events or situations they refer to, there is no entailment between Sentence 1 and Sentence 2. They describe separate occurrences or situations without any direct implication of the truth of the other.

Article: prefix = st1 /Gland, Switzerland - Rivers on every continent are drying out, threatening severe water shortages, according to a new WWF report. The report, World's Top Rivers at Risk, released ahead of World Water Day (22 March), lists the top ten rivers that are fast dying as a result of climate change, pollution and dams. \\"All the rivers in the report symbolize the current freshwater crisis, which we have been signalling for years,\\" says WWF Global Freshwater Programme Director Jamie Pittock. \\"Poor planning and inadequate protection of natural areas mean we can no longer assume that water will flow forever. Like the climate change crisis, which now has the attention of business and government, we want leaders to take notice of the emergency facing freshwater now not later.\\" Five of the ten rivers listed in the report are in Asia alone. They are the Yangtze, Mekong, Salween, Ganges and Indus. Europe's Danube, the America'sLa Plataand Rio Grande/Rio Bravo, Africa's Nile-Lake Victoria andAustralia's Murray-Darling also make the list. Dams along the Danube River -- one of the longest flowing rivers in Europe -- have already destroyed 80 per cent of the river basin's wetlands and floodplains.

Nine people were killed in the shooting at the historic Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, on Wednesday night. On Thursday afternoon, Charleston County Coroner Rae Wooten officially identified all of the victims, some of whose names had leaked out over the course of the day. Here are brief sketches of their lives. State Sen. Clementa Pinckney Pinckney, 41, was a pastor at Emanuel AME and a widely respected state senator. “Sen. Pinckney was a legend,” said fellow state Sen. Marlon Kimpton on CNN. “He was the moral compass of the state Senate.” Pinckney’s desk in the statehouse was covered with a black cloth after news broke of his death: In SC, if a State Sen dies a black cloth is draped over their desk…this was Pinckney’s desk. http://t.co/fupAm838fJ pic.twitter.com/2ntw42e5TD — Ellison Barber (@ellisonbarber) June 18, 2015 During his remarks on Thursday afternoon, President Obama said he knew Pinckney personally, along with other members of the church. “To say our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families and their community doesn’t say enough to convey the heartache and the sadness and the anger that we feel,” he said. Sharonda Coleman-Singleton Coleman-Singleton, also a pastor at the church, was a coach at Goose Creek High School near Charleston.

They had gathered Wednesday night — as they did each week — at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church for a Bible study session. About an hour later, a 21-year-old gunman opened fire in a fit of rage, police said. Charleston County coroner Rae Wooten identified all nine victims in a press conference Thursday. \\"Immediately my heart started to sink because I knew this was going to mean a forever impact on many, many people,\\" Wooten said about being called in for duty after the massacre Wednesday night. The oldest victim was 87 years old, the youngest, 26. Four of them were reverends. Here's what we know about the slain parishioners, all of whom died of gunshot wounds — eight at the scene, and one in a hospital operating room later. The Rev. Clementa Pinckney Pinckney was a pastor at Emanuel AME and began preaching in the church in his teens. The 41-year-old married father of two also served in the South Carolina Senate and was at one time the youngest member of the state House when he was first elected at 23. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A sad event happened at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, where nine people were killed during a gathering.

Being a party planner suited Benjamin but not Dennis because Choose from: a. Benjamin paid attention to details.; b. Dennis paid attention to details.;","completion":"Being a party planner suited Benjamin but not Dennis because Benjamin paid attention to details. While both Benjamin and Dennis had a love for organizing events and creating memorable experiences, their approach to party planning was significantly different. Benjamin, as a detail-oriented party planner, thrived in the intricate and meticulous nature of the profession. He knew that when it came to planning an event, every little detail mattered – from the choice of venue and decorations, down to the color of the napkins and the arrangement of the food on the buffet table. Benjamin's keen eye for detail, combined with his skills in time management and organization, made him an exceptional party planner. He would spend hours researching and sourcing the perfect elements to meet his clients' expectations and ensure their parties were flawless and unforgettable. Benjamin understood that the success of each event relied heavily on his ability to juggle and manage multiple tasks at once, while also maintaining a laser-sharp focus on the finer points of the event planning process. On the other hand, Dennis struggled with focusing on details. He was more of a big-picture thinker, which caused him to overlook crucial aspects of party planning. Although his vision for the theme and vibe of the event might be spot-on, Dennis’s lack of attention to detail had the potential to result in underwhelming execution. For instance, Dennis might plan an incredible outdoor garden party with beautiful floral arrangements throughout the space, but fail to consider contingencies for poor weather, leaving the event ruined by an unexpected downpour. Additionally, Dennis's tendency to gloss over smaller aspects could lead to things like mismatched dinnerware or a lack of dietary options for guests with allergies, diminishing the overall event experience for attendees. It was evident that party planning was a particular niche that demanded a great deal of focus on details. Benjamin's natural affinity for the finer aspects of event planning not only made him a sought-after professional in the industry, but it also ensured that his clients were consistently satisfied with the results. Unfortunately, Dennis's inability to attend to details meant that he would be better suited to pursue a career that allowed him to focus on broader concepts and visions, rather than the intricacies inherent within the field of party planning."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Let's breakdown the problem. The equation is: -42u = -19u - 2u - 147. First, simplify the right hand side of the equation. -19u - 2u can be simplified to -21u. So, the equation then is -42u = -21u - 147. Next, we'll try to isolate the variable 'u'. We can do this by adding '21u' to both sides of the equation to balance it. -42u + 21u = -21u - 147 + 21u This simplifies to: -21u = -147. To completely isolate 'u', divide the equation by '-21'. (-21u) / -21 = -147 / -21 This simplifies to u = 7. So, the solution for the given equation is u = 7."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in \\"Lust of the White Serpant\\" cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself \\"disturbed and agitated\\" by her \\"ethereal beauty\\". In \\"Eternal Prisoner,\\" Madame White Snake's bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning \\"he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.\\" Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes \\"Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine's characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not\\".

And the answer is?","completion":"The state of Alaska has the longest border with Canada. Alaska is the largest and most sparsely populated U.S. state, situated in the northwest part of the North American continent. It has a total land area of 663,267 square miles (1,717,856 square kilometers) and a populace of approximately 731,545 as of 2019. Alaska's border with Canada stretches for approximately 1,538 miles (2,475 kilometers), sharing its boundaries with British Columbia and the Yukon Territory. The border to the east extends from the Beaufort Sea in the Arctic Ocean and traverses southward along the rugged terrains of mountain ranges, rivers, and dense forests until reaching the Dixon Entrance, a narrow body of water that separates Alaska and British Columbia. This extensive border is a result of historical events and various geopolitical negotiations, including the boundary treaty between the Russian Empire and the British Empire in 1825, and the Alaska Purchase in 1867. The latter saw the United States acquiring Alaska from the Russian Empire for a sum of 7.2 million. The border's length facilitates various forms of interactions between the United States and Canada, including trade, tourism, and diplomatic ties. However, it also poses challenges for cross-border security and environmental preservation efforts, particularly given the expansive and often-remote nature of the Alaskan wilderness. Despite these factors, Alaska's border with Canada remains the longest of all U.S. states, a testament to its vast geography and unique position on the continent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Once Were Warriors Context: Beth left her small town and, despite her parents' disapproval, married Jake \\"the Muss\\" Heke. After 18 years they live in an unkempt state house in an unnamed New Zealand city and have five children. Their interpretations of life and being MÄori are tested. Their eldest daughter, Grace, keeps a journal in which she chronicles events as well as stories she tells her younger siblings. Jake is fired from his job and is satisfied with receiving unemployment benefit, spending most days getting drunk at the local pub with his friends, singing songs, and savagely beating any patron he considers to have stepped out of line. He often invites crowds of friends from the bar to his home for drunken parties. When his wife \\"gets lippy\\" at one of his parties, he brutally attacks her in front of their friends. Beth turns to drink when things go wrong, and has angry outbursts and occasional violence of her own, on a much smaller scale. Her children fend for themselves, resignedly cleaning the blood-streaked house after their father has beat their mother. Nig, the Hekes' eldest son, moves out to join a gang whose rituals include getting facial tattoos (in MÄori culture called tÄ moko). He is subjected to an initiation beating by the gang members but is then embraced as a new brother, and he later sports the gangâs tattoos. Nig cares about his siblings but despises his father. He is angered when his mother is beaten but deals with it by walking away. The second son, Mark \\"Boogie\\" Heke, has a history of minor criminal offences; he is taken from his family and placed in a foster home as a ward of the state due to his parents' home life. Despite his initial anger, Boogie finds a new niche for himself, as the foster homeâs manager Mr. Bennett helps him embrace his MÄori heritage.

Officials working to free 33 trapped miners in northern Chile denied Thursday they are under political orders to rescue the men ahead of President Sebastian Pinera's planned mid-month trip to Europe. \\"No decision about any part of the rescue operation has been linked to any political decision. The miners' health and technical decisions come first,\\" Interior Minister official Cristian Barra said in a news conference at the San Jose gold and copper mine. \\"The president's agenda is not connected to the timeline for rescue. There are no guarantees this will be before October 17,\\" he added. Pinera said earlier this week he believed the 33 miners would be rescued before October 15. He is due to depart on a government visit to Europe on October 17, government officials said. In his last visit to the mine on September 19, Pinera pledged to return the day the miners were extracted and personally hug each one. Mines Minister Laurence Golborne said over the weekend that his best estimate was that the miners would be extracted in the second half of October. Political opponents and even some relatives of the trapped miners have speculated in recent weeks that Pinera was trying to score political points from the miners' rescue. National opinion polls show his popularity has risen thanks to his handling of the accident. Prior to the disaster his administration had been under political fire for the slow pace of government reconstruction after the February earthquake and tsunami along Chile's south and central coast, and for his handling of a hunger strike by members of the Mapuche indigenous group of southern Chile, who are fighting for independence. Against the backdrop of political questioning, technical problems plagued the drilling effort at the San Jose mine. The Strata 950 drill, dubbed Plan A, had reached 587 meters by 8 a.m. Tuesday. The men are nearly 700 meters (2,300 feet) underground, but could be rescued from different levels. Andre Sougarret, mines manager for state-run copper company Codelco and on-site rescue coordinator, said that operation was stopped Tuesday while the drill head was changed. It was not expected to resume until late Wednesday. It is currently making its first pass down with a 12.5-inch diameter hole to the roof of the 50-square-meter (500-square-foot) refuge at Level 100 (100 meters above sea level). It would have to make a second pass to widen that shaft to 28 inches. The Schramm T-130 drill, so-called Plan B, was at 466 meters as of 8 a.m. Tuesday and is aiming for the roof of the mine workshop on Level 135 (135 meters above sea level). It had completed just two meters in the previous 24 hours. Sougarret said the drill hammer had been swapped out but hit fresh problems after running into rock that was tougher than expected. He said the drill diameter would be reduced from 28 inches to 26 inches until the hammer had cleared the hard rock but added that the slightly smaller diameter would not cause problems for the rescue. The Rig 421 oil drill, so-called Plan C, is currently at 265 meters and en route to the roof of the tunnel at Level 150 (150 meters above sea level). It is currently drilling a 17.5-inch diameter hole -- smaller than the 28 inches required to rescue the miners -- in an effort to realign after veering off course over the weekend. Mine engineer Renee Aguilar, another of the rescue coordinators, said the first 10 members of a 16-strong extraction team arrived at the San Jose mine Tuesday. The group consisted of Codelco rescue experts. Two other rescue experts from the northern Atacama region, along with three Navy and one police paramedic, were due to arrive at the mine later Tuesday. Once the rescue shaft has been completed and the extraction begins, four members of the 16-person team will be chosen to descend into the mine to carry out final medical checks on the 33 miners. They will then enclose the miners, one-by-one, in a 21.5-inch diameter rescue cage that has been dubbed the \\"Phoenix capsule.\\" Rescuers on the surface will winch them up. Jean Romagnoli, sports medic and personal trainer working to get the miners in shape for their rescue, said the Phoenix capsule would be hoisted to the surface at a speed of about 60 kilometers per hour and would exert about 2 Gs of pressure on the miners. He said small bio-metric monitors, mounted on chest belts, had been sent down to the miners to help keep track of their physical condition. He said the miners are working out for at least one hour a day to ensure they keep their weight down and can fit into the rescue capsule. The U.S.-made monitors, known as Zephyr BioHarnesses, will record the miners' vital signs, pulse, heart rhythm and breathing. Romagnoli said similar monitors were used to check on the physical training of Chile's Davis Cup tennis stars. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in...

You must generate a detailed and long answer. The energetic young producer of theatrical prologues (those staged performances, usually musical, that often proceeded the movie in the larger cinemas in bygone days) must deal with crooked competition, fraudulent partners, unfaithful lovers & amateur talent to realize his dream of making his mark on the FOOTLIGHT PARADE. While closely resembling other Warner's musical spectaculars, notably the GOLDDIGGER films, this movie had a special attraction none of the others had: Jimmy Cagney. He is a wonder, loose-jointed and lithe, as agile as any tomcat - a creature he actually mimics a few times during the movie. Cagney grabs the viewers attention & never lets go, powering the rapid-fire dialogue and corny plot with his charisma & buoyant charm. The rest of the cast gives their best, as well. Joan Blondell is perfect as the smart-mouthed, big-hearted blonde secretary, infatuated with Cagney (major quibble - why wasn't she given a musical number?). Dick Powell & Ruby Keeler once again play lovers onstage & off; the fact that her singing & acting abilities are a bit on the lean side are compensated for by her dancing ; Powell still exudes boyish enthusiasm in his unaccustomed position as second male lead. Guy Kibbee & Hugh Herbert are lots of fun as brothers-in-law, both scheming to cheat Cagney in different ways. Ruth Donnelly scores as Kibbee's wealthy wife, a woman devoted to her handsome protégés. Frank McHugh's harried choreographer is an apt foil for Cagney's wit. Herman Bing is hilarious in his one tiny scene as a music arranger. Mavens will spot little Billy Barty, Jimmy Conlin & maybe even John Garfield during the musical numbers. Finally, there's Busby Berkeley, choreographer nonpareil. His terpsichorean confections, sprinkled throughout the decade of the 1930's, were a supreme example of the cinematic escapism that Depression audiences wanted to enjoy. The big joke about Berkeley's creations, of course, was that they were meant, as part of the plot, to be stage productions. But no theater could ever hold these products of the master's imagination. They are perfect illustrations of the type of entertainment only made possible by the movie camera. Berkeley's musical offerings generally took one of two different approaches, either a story (often rather bizarre) told with song & dance; or else stunning geometrically designed numbers, eye candy, featuring plentiful chorus girls, overhead camerawork & a romantic tune. In a spasm of outré extravagance, FOOTLIGHT PARADE climaxes with three Berkeley masterworks: \`Honeymoon Hotel' and its pre-Production Code telling of a couple's wedding night; \`By A Waterfall' - dozens of unclad females, splashing, floating & diving in perfect patterns & designs (peer closely & you'll see how the synchronous effects were achieved); and finally, \`Shanghai Lil' - a fitting tribute to the talents of both Cagney & Berkeley.

Broad shallow seas advanced across central North America (the Western Interior Seaway) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds. At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged. The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic. Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton. These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation. Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in Europe and China. In the area that is now India, massive lava beds called the Deccan Traps were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The massive amounts of chalk in the Cretaceous period were caused by mid-ocean ridge activity, which circulated seawater through the enlarged ridges, enriching the oceans in calcium.

Answer:","completion":"The director of the acclaimed films 'Twelve Angry Men,' 'Serpico,' and 'Network,' who passed away in 2011, was Sidney Lumet. Born on June 25, 1924, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Lumet grew up in a family deeply rooted in the performing arts, as his father Baruch Lumet was an actor in the Yiddish Art Theatre and his mother Eugenia Wermus Lumet was a dancer. Sidney Lumet began his career in the entertainment industry as a stage actor, transitioning to directing in the early 1950s. He initially directed several TV shows before making his feature film debut with the groundbreaking 1957 drama 'Twelve Angry Men.' The movie, which starred Henry Fonda and focused on jury deliberations in a murder trial, was critically acclaimed and was nominated for three Academy Awards, including Best Director. Continuing his illustrious career, Lumet directed 'Serpico' in 1973, a crime drama starring Al Pacino as Frank Serpico, a real-life NYPD officer who blew the whistle on rampant corruption within the police department. The film was a commercial and critical success, garnering Oscar nominations and solidifying Lumet's reputation as a master of gritty, realistic dramas. In 1976, Lumet directed 'Network,' a satirical film centered around a fictional television network, Union Broadcasting System (UBS), and its struggle for ratings. The film, written by Paddy Chayefsky, starred Faye Dunaway, Peter Finch, William Holden, and Robert Duvall. 'Network' was a monumental hit, receiving ten Academy Award nominations and winning four, including Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Original Screenplay. Throughout his career, Sidney Lumet directed over 50 films that spanned various genres and styles, leaving an indelible mark on the world of cinema. Some other renowned films in his repertoire include 'Dog Day Afternoon' (1975), 'Murder on the Orient Express' (1974), 'The Verdict' (1982), and 'Before the Devil Knows You're Dead' (2007). On April 9, 2011, Sidney Lumet passed away at the age of 86 in his Manhattan home due to complications related to lymphoma.

See the multi-choice question below: Sentence 1: um well i tell you what i think that uh you know this may this may be a cause rather the actual topic but uh i think that a lot of this is caused by the steady diet of violence they seem to Sentence 2: I know it isn't caused by all of the violence they see. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Available options: A). yes. B). it is not possible to tell. C). no.","completion":"C). no. The reason for this answer is as follows: In the first sentence, the speaker is expressing an opinion that a \\"steady diet of violence\\" may be a cause of an issue instead of explicitly stating it as a fact. The use of language in this sentence, such as \\"I think\\" and \\"may,\\" demonstrates the uncertainty and the tentative nature of the statement. This suggests that the speaker believes violence might be a contributing factor in a particular situation, but there could be other underlying causes as well. In contrast, the second sentence asserts that the issue is not caused by \\"all of the violence they see.\\" This statement implies that violence has a minimal or no impact on the situation, differing from the perspective expressed in the first sentence. Given that the first sentence presents an opinion suggesting violence may indeed be a contributing factor, and the second sentence contradicts this by stating that it is not caused by all of the violence seen, the two sentences cannot both be true simultaneously. Thus, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence is not true, making the correct answer \\"C). no.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room! The ER doctor was able to sew my head up, and sent me home with a diagnosis of “syncope, unknown origin”. After a few hours, I still felt spacey, but insisted on going on the date. I remember we went to a nice Italian place on Federal Hill! Here’s the Garden City location, where I worked. What did the waitress have to eat on her date? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - not enough information - Salad. - Alfredo. - Spaghetti. Answer:","completion":"- not enough information"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following passage \\"Detroit's protracted decline has resulted in severe urban decay and thousands of empty buildings around the city. Some parts of Detroit are so sparsely populated that the city has difficulty providing municipal services. The city has considered various solutions, such as demolishing abandoned homes and buildings; removing street lighting from large portions of the city; and encouraging the small population in certain areas to move to more populated locations. While some have estimated 20,000 stray dogs roam the city, studies have shown the true number to be around 1,000-3,000. Roughly half of the owners of Detroit's 305,000 properties failed to pay their 2011 tax bills, resulting in about 246 million in taxes and fees going uncollected, nearly half of which was due to Detroit; the rest of the money would have been earmarked for Wayne County, Detroit Public Schools, and the library system.\\", answer the following question.

Help as much as you can. Gwen owns a sauna. She wants to try something new and decides to make the room air tight, meaning no air can escape the room. After trialing this with a few customers she asks them for some feedback. The customers say they really like how there is never a draft in the room but they feel weird when they leave the room and their ears pop like when they are are on an airplane and the pressure is uneven. Will the pressure of a sealed container increase or decrease when a gas inside it is heated? Hint: Shown in the Figure below is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K). On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease.","completion":"The pressure of a sealed container will increase when a gas inside it is heated. As the temperature (measured in Kelvin) of the gas increases, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules also increases. This causes more forceful collisions with the walls of the container, resulting in an increased pressure. In the example you provided, when the temperature is doubled from 300 K to 600 K, the pressure of the gas also doubles. Conversely, if the temperature of the enclosed gas were to decrease, the pressure would decrease as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Gina racked her brain but could find nothing to say. In the options below, what is the most likely to happen next? Possible answers: * Tami wished Gina would shut up, but she just kept talking.; * They just walked comfortably in silence for a while.;","completion":"It is more likely that the next event in the story would be that they just walked comfortably in silence for a while. After having a conversation for five minutes, Gina and Tami found themselves out of things to discuss, and there is no indication in the given story that there is any tension or animosity between the two friends. In the first option, Tami wishing Gina would shut up assumes a negative intent that has not been hinted at in the story so far. If Gina is unable to come up with more topics for conversation and they have run out of things to talk about, it would be reasonable for them to simply enjoy each other's company without the need for constant conversation. Walking comfortably in silence showcases the strength of their friendship, as they can appreciate each other's presence without the need for constant engagement. This is a common characteristic of strong and long-lasting friendships, where people can be at ease in each other's company without the pressure of always needing to chat. It also allows Gina and Tami the opportunity to gather their thoughts or take a break from talking and simply enjoy the surroundings of the playground. As they continued their walk, it's possible that they might come across something that reignites their conversation. Perhaps they would see a group of children playing and recall their own childhood memories or spot an interesting structure at the playground that prompts them to discuss their likes and dislikes. In any case, the silence between them wouldn't necessarily last forever; it would simply serve as a natural and comfortable break in their conversation. In conclusion, the more likely option for this story would be that Gina and Tami walked comfortably in silence for a while after they ran out of things to discuss. This scenario aligns better with the context provided, demonstrating the strength of their friendship and how they can enjoy each other's company without always needing to be engaged in conversation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
