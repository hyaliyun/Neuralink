You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: All living things on the earth need other living things to live. Nothing lives alone. Most animals must live in a group, and even a plant grows close together with others of the same kind. Sometimes one living thing kills another, one eats and the other is eaten. Each kind of life eats another kind of life in order to live, and together they create a food chain . Some food chains are simple, while others are not. But all food chains begin with the sun, and all food chains become broken up if one of the links disappears. All life needs sunlight to live on. But only plants can use sunlight directly. Plants are 'factories'. They make food from sunlight, water and things in the soil and air. Plants feed all other living things. Animals can only use the sun's energy after it has been changed into food by plants. Some animals feed directly on plants, others eat smaller animals. Meat-eating animals are only eating plants indirectly. What about humans? We are members of many food chains. We eat rice, vegetables, and fruits and so on. We also eat meat and drink milk. But we often break up the food chains. We kill wild animals and also make rivers, lakes and seas polluted. When these rivers, lakes and seas are polluted, the fish in them can not be eaten. If we eat the fish, we will get strange illnesses. Each form of life is linked to all others. Breaking the links puts all life in danger. Question: Which living things can use the sun's energy directly? Options: A: Animals. B: Plants. C: Animals and plants. D: All living things. A:","completion":"The correct answer is B: Plants. The article clearly states that all life needs sunlight to live on, but only plants can utilize sunlight directly. Plants perform photosynthesis, a process through which they convert sunlight, in combination with water and carbon dioxide, into food. This process creates the base of most food chains, feeding other living organisms. Animals, unlike plants, are incapable of using the sun's energy directly. They rely on the food produced by plants or on other animals that have consumed plants. Thus, in the food chain, the sun's energy is transferred from plants to animals. Therefore, according to the information provided in the article, only plants have the ability to directly use the sun's energy. On a similar note, not all living things can directly utilize the sun's energy, which eliminates Option D. Rather, all living organisms depend on the conversion of the sun's energy into food by plants, forming complex food chains where energy is transferred from one organism to another."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here, it is about comparing the amounts of products manufactured and consequent production of hazardous waste between the United States and Belize. 3. The blank in the sentence must replace 'Belize' grammatically and contextually correctly. 4. The answer 'Belize' means that Belize produced higher hazardous waste, according to the context. Using those guidelines, we would suggest that, paradoxically, the text might not be congruent. If the United States manufactured many more products than Belize did last year, an intuitive assumption would be that the United States produced more hazardous waste, not Belize. It seems there's inconsistency between the narrative and provided answer. Therefore, we may infer that perhaps Belize, despite producing less products, has stricter regulations or uses materials that produce more hazardous waste per product.

Because the evening always starts with mass at 6 .. (3). Because Brianna likes Casey .. (4). Because last year they were always late because they did n't get off work early enough .. The answer:","completion":"(3). Because Brianna likes Casey. The most plausible reason why Brianna would join the Youth Group just because Casey was in it is that she likes Casey and values their friendship or relationship. By joining the same group, Brianna has a chance to spend more time with her friend, strengthening their bond and shared experiences. This could also mean that she wanted to support Casey in their activities and interests by participating in the same group. It is also important to note that people often feel more comfortable joining new activities or groups when they know someone there. This familiarity aids in the transition into the new setting, making it easier to adjust and participate confidently. Brianna may have felt more at ease joining the Youth Group because she knew she would have Casey there to support her and help her navigate any social situations or challenges. While the other options might affect the overall experience or timing of the Youth Group, they do not directly explain why Brianna would base her decision to join solely on Casey's involvement. For instance, Option (2) refers to the evening always starting with mass at 6, but that is a general detail about the Youth Group, unrelated to Brianna's and Casey's relationship. Option (4) discusses schedule conflicts from the previous year, which again does not clarify why Brianna would decide to join due to Casey's presence. Therefore, the most accurate explanation for Brianna's decision to join the Youth Group because Casey was in it would be Option (3), as it addresses the significance of their personal connection and highlights the importance of friendship and support in such choices."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Given the question: Question: \\"Apostasy in Jehovah's Witness is the definition of what?\\" Context: \\"Formal discipline is administered by congregation elders. When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help and possibly administer discipline. Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that \\"losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.\\" The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Members who disassociate (formally resign) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced. Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service, but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship. Marking, a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship, is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin.[note 4]\\" Answer: The answer is:","completion":"Apostasy in Jehovah's Witness is the definition of disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines or committing a serious sin, which can lead to a judicial committee determining guilt, providing help, and possibly administering discipline such as disfellowshipping, a form of shunning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: In a rare display of bipartisan unity during an election year, Republicans and Democrats alike have condemned presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for his comments about the ethnicity of a judge overseeing a class action suit against Trump University. Members of both parties lambasted the real estate mogul for remarks that they assert were racist.

U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska who has criticized Trump on multiple occasions during the campaign, tweeted: \\"Saying someone can't do a specific job because of his or her race is the literal definition of 'racism.''' Also leading the charge Monday were Trump’s two former rivals for the Republican nomination. Ohio Governor John Kasich tweeted that Trump's offensive \\"is flat out wrong.'' Trump, Kasich wrote, should \\"apologize to Judge Curiel & try to unite this country.'' Florida Senator Marco Rubio agreed. \\"It's wrong and I hope he stops.''

He also studied village B, which existed about 6,000 years ago. The village was much bigger and better developed. Hint: Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. Answer:","completion":"The paragraph does not provide specific birth rate data for either Village A or Village B. However, using the hint provided, we can infer that Village B likely had higher birth rates. This is because the Village B existed about 6,000 years ago, which is after the invention of agriculture around 10,000 years ago. The implementation of agriculture provided a more consistent food supply, allowed people to settle down, and as a result, increased birth rates. Village A, on the other hand, existed about 12,000 years ago, prior to the invention of agriculture, and so we can infer it probably had lower birth rates compared to Village B due to less stable food supply and less settled lifestyles."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Since the late 1990s,Huntingdon Life Sciences--a company that conducts testing of substances on animals conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration--has become a proving ground for aggressive strategies by animal-rights militants .At a hearing,a Senate.committee listened to testimony against Huntingdon employees and financial institutions providing services to the company.One experimentation witness at the hearing insisted that any means necessary were justified to spare animals' lives;he has previously accepted the idea of murder to that end. Use of animals in testing and in biomedical research continues to be necessary in many instances and is ethically preferable to experimenting on humans or giving up cures that could save human lives.But for the sake of people and animals alike,the development and acceptance of animal substitutes deserve enthusiastic support. In some instances, substitutes are already thought as good or better than animals,but supervising agencies have yet to catch up.In both the European Union and the U.S.,scientists and companies wanting to use the new alternative tests complain that regulatory standards for proving a drug or chemical to be safe for humans force the continued use of animals.Thus,animal-loving Americans might turn to persuading the EPA and the FDA to speed validation of new methods so that they can be more widely employed.And animal advocates who want to influence business could consider investing in the small biotech's and large pharmaceutical companies that are working to develop alternatives to animals in research.

The Turkish word for 'sovereign debt crisis' is 'süveren borç krizi', 'has worsened' can be translated as 'kötüleşti'. Together, they form \\"Süveren borç krizi kötüleşti\\". 2. \\"and the financial market turmoil\\": 'and' translates to 've' in Turkish. 'The financial market turmoil' is 'finansal piyasa karmaşası' in Turkish. So, joined with the previous part, it reads: \\"Süveren borç krizi kötüleşti ve finansal piyasa karmaşası\\". 3. \\"is set to dampen the real economy.\\": This part indicated an expected impact on the real economy due to the financial turmoil. 'is set to' can be translated as 'üzere', denoting an impending event. 'Dampen the real economy' is 'reel ekonomiyi sekteye uğratmak'.

Article: A new study gives us the warning that about thirty percent of the world's people may not have enough water by the year 2025. A private American organization called Population Action International did the new study. It says more than three-hundred-thirty-five-million people lack enough water now. The people live in twenty-eight countries. Most of the countries are in Africa or the Middle East. P-A-I researcher Robert Engelman says by the year 2025, about three-thousand-million people may lack water. At least 18 more countries are expected to have severe water problems. The demand for water keeps increasing. Yet the amount of water on Earth stays the same. Mr. Engelman says the population in countries that lack water is growing faster than in other parts of the world. He says population growth in these countries will continue to increase. The report says lack of water in the future may result in several problems. It may increase health problems. Lack of water often means drinking waters not safe. Mr. Engelman says there are problems all over the world because of diseases, such as cholera, which are carried in water. Lack of water may also result in more international conflict. Countries may have to compete for water in the future. Some countries now get sixty percent of their fresh water from other countries. This is true of Egypt, the Netherlands, Cambodia, Syria, Sudan, and Iraq. And the report says lack of water would affect the ability of developing to improve their economies. This is because new industries often need a large amount of water when they are beginning. The Population Action International study gives several solutions to the water problem. One way, it says, is to find ways to use water for more than one purpose. Another way is to teach people to be careful not to waste water. A third way is to use less water of agriculture. The report also says long-term solutions to the water problem must include controls on population growth. It says countries cannot provide clean water unless they slow...

But they had to keep the fire burning, for they couldn't start it again if there was no lightning. Later, they found out hitting two piece of stone together could make a spark . The spark could fire dry leaves. In this way they could make the fire again if it went out. Then people also learned to make a fire by rubbing. They made a hole on a big piece of wood and put a smaller stick into the hole. They turned the stick again and again. After a few minutes they got a fire. As years went by, people learned other ways to make a fire. Sometimes they used the heat from sun. they held a piece of glass in the right way and made a piece of paper on fire. About two centuries ago, people began to make matches . Matches brought people a quick and easy way to make fire. Today matches are still being used, but people have more new ways to make fires. One of them is to use an electric fire starter. Of course an electric fire starter is much more expensive than a box of matches. But it is more useful. Question: We can also get a fire by _ .

A New Vision for ‘Prince Igor’ at the Met It is common in contemporary opera for a director to update the setting of a story and impose some interpretive concept on a piece. Most directors do not go so far, however, as to reorder scenes, tweak the plot, excise whole ensembles and interpolate musical numbers from a different score. But the Russian director Dmitri Tcherniakov essentially does all of this in the Metropolitan Opera’s new production of Borodin’s “Prince Igor,” which opened on Thursday night. Yet his wonderful staging is dreamlike, wrenchingly human and viscerally theatrical. The impressive cast, with many Russian singers, is headed by the compelling bass Ildar Abdrazakov in the title role. If Mr. Tcherniakov takes big chances in this revelatory production, strong intervention is called for with “Prince Igor.” Borodin, a research chemist by profession, left the score in shambles when he died suddenly at 53 in 1887, having worked on the piece for 18 years. Rimsky-Korsakov, a respected Russian master, assisted by Glazunov, then a fledgling composer in his early 20s, salvaged Borodin’s original. They completed the orchestration, stitched segments together, fleshed out scenes left in sketches, and more. Their version became a beloved work in the Russian repertory, despite its flaws. Ildar Abdrazakov sings the title role in this scene from a recent dress rehearsal. At various times musicologists and conductors have sifted through Borodin’s reams of score pages and fashioned other versions. Still, it is impossible to know what the composer intended. The plot has big holes in it. Every production is a reclamation job. The Met’s may be the best of them. Working closely with the conductor Gianandrea Noseda, who led a vibrant and textured performance on Thursday, Mr. Tcherniakov has not so much condensed as concentrated the opera, which still runs for more than four hours (with two intermissions). Using vivid black-and-white silent-film segments created for the production, he brings the audience close to the singers and relates missing portions of the story. The libretto, written by Borodin, is based on an anonymous 12th-century epic poem. Actually, the basic plot is straightforward: Igor, an ancient Russian prince in the city of Putivl, gathers his army for a campaign against the nomadic Polovtsians, who have been ravaging the Russian territories. Igor’s troops are defeated, and he and Vladimir, his son, are taken captive. Vladimir falls in love with the sensual daughter of Khan Konchak, the ruler of the Polovtsians, who sees in his captive a potential ally, if only Igor will seek a truce. Vowing to continue the fight, Igor escapes. He returns to a city in ruins and feels like a failure. Still, his people hail his return. In this production, Mr. Tcherniakov emphasizes Igor’s self-doubting nature and insecurity. The opera is presented as Igor’s internal search for clarity, including dreamscape episodes in which he ponders what has happened. Mr. Tcherniakov, as is his practice, designed the sets. The prologue, in Putivl, takes place in a simple public meeting room with yellow-beige walls, a ceiling of wood beams and dangling electric lights. The people are gathered to send the soldiers, dressed in russet-colored uniforms (the costumes are by Elena Zaitseva), off to battle. It looks to be the early 20th century, though the settings convey timeless immediacy. Families and friends mostly sing from the balcony that surrounds the room. But Mr. Abdrazakov’s Igor, looking panicky, paces among the troops, sometimes adjusting their hats. Solid and ruggedly handsome, Mr. Abdrazakov is a confident actor. Though his voice is firm and robust, he is not one of those formidable, gravelly Russian basses. He is a fine singer of Italian repertory, and his Igor has moments of Italianate lyrical refinement. He brings passion, even a touch of neediness, to his exchanges with his devoted wife, Yaroslavna, the Ukrainian soprano Oksana Dyka in her Met debut. She is like a classic Russian soprano, with a cool, penetrating intensity, fearless high notes and a glint of steel in her sound. In this production, the prologue is followed by Borodin’s scene in the Polovtsian steppes, here called Act I. (Some versions place it as Act II.) The defeat of Igor’s troops is something we only learn about after it has happened offstage. Mr. Tcherniakov includes a filmed episode after the prologue showing close-ups of worried soldiers, flashes from explosions and, finally, the twisted corpses of fallen troops. These images overlap with the beginning of the haunting music of the Polovtsian scene, set in a wondrous, almost surreal field of red poppies, a captivating way to depict the lure of the East. The act is presented as if it is all taking place in Igor’s mind, but he encounters very real people. The charismatic Georgian mezzo-soprano Anita Rachvelishvili brings her plush big voice and a sultry physicality to the role of Konchakovna, the daughter of the Khan (the muscular Slovakian bass Stefan Kocan). Konchakovna, deep in thought and yearning for Vladimir, sings a great aria wondering when her beloved will come to her. The Russian tenor Sergey Semishkur, in his Met debut, is an earnest, impetuous Vladimir, singing with a slightly nasal and impassioned voice. The trade-off for turning this act into a dreamscape is the confusion Mr. Tcherniakov introduces for people new to “Prince Igor,” which is seldom heard in America. The work was last presented at the Met in 1917, if you don’t include a few performances in 1998 by the visiting Mariinsky Theater in a very traditional, very bland production. When Mr. Abdrazakov sings the captive Igor’s great aria of lament for having brought his army to defeat and his country to shame, at one point he addresses his wife, knowing that she alone would forgive him. In this staging, the wife, Ms. Dyka, appears as if in a vision to Igor. Some people in the audience might become confused over just who is real and who is a phantom in this scene. The best-known music from “Prince Igor” is the popular Polovtsian dances with chorus. To stage the music, Mr. Tcherniakov turns his poppy field into a lush pasture where some three dozen dancers (bare-chested men and women in light spring dresses) cavort to choreography by Itzik Galili. The Met choristers sing from the side boxes closest to the stage. Acoustically the effect is thrilling. By the end of the scene, even Igor seems momentarily enthralled by the sensory splendor all around him. Igor has entrusted his wife and his city to the care of his brother-in-law, Prince Galitsky, a coarse cad, who schemes to take power while Igor is captive. The feisty Russian bass Mikhail Petrenko is a sneering, prickly Galitsky, exhorting his followers into frenzied drunken revels that jibe with the pummeling rhythms of the music. For all its theatricality, this production focuses your attention on Borodin’s beguiling score. Even during anthems, dances and elegies, Borodin tapped into depths of sadness that seem part of the Russian culture and heritage. Mr. Noseda conveys the Russian character of the music, while conducting it with clarity and precision. The Met chorus is at its glorious best. Mr. Tcherniakov and Mr. Noseda take the biggest leap at the end of the opera. The libretto describes Igor as returning to a city in ruins. Here the decimated public meeting room, which has been hit by bombs lobbed by the Polovtsian troops, shows the grim extent of the ruination. The shellshocked Igor is barely recognizable. Mr. Abdrazakov does his most burnished, powerful singing in the prince’s despairing soliloquy in this scene. Then the people hoist Igor, as if oblivious, on their shoulders and sing his praises — the way the opera traditionally ends. But Mr. Abdrazakov’s Igor looks stunned to see his people cheering him. Then, “The River Don Floods,” an orchestral scene that Borodin wrote for another dramatic work, is played. During its turbulent opening episode, Igor stomps among his people looking unhinged. Slowly, as the music turns pensive, he calms down and picks up salvageable items from among the rubble. One by one, the others help him. The people of Putivl are going to regroup. It is not going to be easy. But they begin. “Prince Igor” runs through March 8 at the Metropolitan Opera; 212-362-6000, metopera.org. “Prince Igor” runs at the Metropolitan Opera through March 8, 212 362-6000, metopera.org A version of this review appears in print on February 8, 2014, on page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: A Blazing Folk Tale Spliced With Grainy Sorrow.

Other people tried to finish and fix it, but it was a big job. The opera is about a prince named Igor who goes to fight some nomadic people causing trouble. Unfortunately, Igor and his son get captured, but manage to escape and return home to a ruined city where they are hailed as heroes. This new production, led by a man called Dmitri Tcherniakov, changes many parts of the opera, even rearranging scenes and adding new music. Tcherniakov's idea is to make the opera focus on Prince Igor's inner journey, showing his doubt and insecurity. He even uses bits of silent film to help tell the story. Many different singers, including Ildar Abdrazakov as Igor, bring the characters to life with their wonderful voices. In the end, even though some things might be confusing for new viewers, Tcherniakov and his team create a beautiful and emotional production that brings new life to \\"Prince Igor\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: The first step to getting red lips is getting rid of dry, flaky skin that builds up and hides their natural color. Sloughing away the dead skin brightens your lips, brings out their inner red color and prepares them to take on a stain. Here's how to make and use your own scrub: Mix 1 teaspoon honey and 1 teaspoon brown sugar. Scrub the mixture into your lips in a circular motion. Rinse the mixture away with warm water. Repeat as necessary. Sometimes a basic lip scrub isn't enough to get rid of the dead skin. Using a soft-bristled toothbrush will do the trick. Choose a clean toothbrush, wet it with warm water, and gently scrub your lips in a circular motion. Rinse your lips. They should be left bright, plump and renewed. Increasing circulation to your lips makes them look plumper and redder. You can naturally make your lips a little plumper by using cinnamon or another spicy household item on your lips. Just rub a little on, wait a few minutes, then rinse your lips. You can use any of the following as a natural lip plumper: 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper mixed with a few drops of water 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon mixed with a few drops of water 5 drops of peppermint essential oil or peppermint extract A piece of fresh ginger rubbed over your lips Now that your lips have been exfoliated and plumped, it's time to make them soft and supple. This will help them keep their color longer and prevent them from drying out. Use any of the following ingredients as a lip serum; just rub it on your lips and wait a few minutes for it to absorb: 1/2 teaspoon coconut oil 1/2 teaspoon olive oil 1/2 teaspoon almond oil","completion":"To achieve red lips, follow these steps: 1) Remove dead skin by using a homemade honey and brown sugar scrub, or a soft-bristled toothbrush. 2) Boost circulation and plumpness with natural lip plumpers like cinnamon, cayenne pepper, peppermint, or ginger. 3) Keep lips soft and supple with a lip serum made from coconut oil, olive oil, or almond oil.

The moment she entered the class, we would all sit quietly and open the books. She would encourage me by giving me important assignments and also morning news to read during the assembly. She would come down and listen to my English debate , which made me take part in all debate competitions. The same was true of my biology and science teacher. She was very nice and sweet. She would always give me extra information on the biology project. I could not go to the lab for experiments, so she would bring the lab down and help me with the biology and science experiments and would give me excellent marks.

As anyone who has experienced occasional — or even chronic — constipation can tell you, it can really put a damper on quality of life and well-being. Constipation can also cause more substantial problems, such as: * Severe abdominal pain, which can lead to emergency room visits * Hemorrhoids, which can bleed or be painful * Increased irritability, agitation, or even aggression, in people with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia * Stress and/or pain that can contribute to delirium (a state of new or worse confusion that often happens when older adults are hospitalized) * Fecal incontinence, which can be caused or worsened by having a hard lump of stool lodged in the lower bowel * Avoidance of needed pain medication, due to fear of constipation Fortunately, it’s usually possible to help older adults effectively manage and prevent constipation. This helps maintain well-being and quality of life, and can also improve difficult behaviors related to dementia. The trouble is that constipation is often either overlooked or sub-optimally managed by busy healthcare providers who aren’t trained in geriatrics. They are often focused on more “serious” health issues. Also, since many laxatives are available over-the-counter, some providers may assume that people will treat themselves if necessary. Personally, I don’t like this hands-off approach to constipation. Although several useful laxatives are indeed available over-the-counter (OTC), I’ve found that the average person doesn’t know enough to correctly choose among them. Also, although in geriatrics we often do end up recommending or prescribing laxatives, it’s vital to start by figuring out what is likely to be causing — or worsening — an older person’s constipation. For instance, many medications can make constipation worse, so we usually make an attempt to identify and perhaps deprescribe those. In short, if you’re an older adult, or if you’re helping an older... According to the above context, answer the following question. What are some side effects of constipation in the elderly?

Stress and/or pain that can contribute to delirium (a state of new or worse confusion that often happens when older adults are hospitalized) 5.

I am definitely the hoarder in our house. My husband could live out of two bags, use about five kitchen items each year, and doesn’t gather anything for future use or hang on to much for sentimental value. (Which probably means the items he has hung on to mean a whole lot more!) I am always tucking something away here or stashing materials there…all in preparation for “some day.” It’s also part of the teacher in me. Do you know many teachers that don’t have a ton of stuff or utilize every bit of storage available? But, over the last several years, I’ve been fairly good about going through things every six months and weeding out a little here and a little there. Today I’ll be sharing six simple ways to declutter your home and why you should! GIVE THINGS AWAY It’s nice to make money, but sometimes you come across something that you really think someone else could use and you don’t want to throw it away. If it’s the perfect fit for that person, they may adopt the item and add their own wear and tear! Anyone that’s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it’s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don’t want the item, let it be. They’ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help. PACK If you know you don’t want to purge an item from your house AND you know that you will use it in the future, but it’s not an everyday use item, pack it up. We have several containers of things in our garage that are full of items we use once or twice each year. I have added close to 100 boxes of things to simply declutter our home while it’s on the market. I took a look at everything and kept the essentials (well, maybe even more than the essentials), and packed up the rest. Question: How does the author suggest that one can save money? Options: - by decluttering your home - not enough information - by recycling items you already own - by accepting used items from a friend or a relative === The correct answer is A:","completion":"- by accepting used items from a friend or a relative Justification: The author mentions that \\"kids go through things so fast and it's nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative\\". Hand-me-downs refer to used items that are given from one person to another. Thus, according to the author, one can save money by accepting used items from a friend or relative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In the cosmetic section of the drugstore you'll find shelves of products designed to have a lip-plumping effect. These glosses and chapsticks usually contain ingredients like cinnamon oil or capsaicin, the substance that makes hot peppers hot.","completion":"Used in small concentrations, these ingredients stimulate blood flow to the area where they are applied, causing a temporary swelling effect. They can also produce a subtle tingling sensation, which some people find pleasant, while others might experience a mild discomfort. To achieve pouty lips without undergoing more invasive procedures like lip fillers, follow these helpful guidelines for using lip-plumping products: 1. Choose the right product: Opt for a reputable brand, and remember that everyone's lips may react differently to certain ingredients. To find a product that works best for you, read reviews and consider asking for recommendations from friends or a beauty consultant. 2. Exfoliate your lips: Before applying your chosen lip-plumping product, gently exfoliate the surface of your lips to remove dead skin cells and create a smooth canvas for a more even application. Exfoliation can also boost blood circulation for a fuller, more voluminous look. You can use a store-bought lip scrub or concoct a simple mixture of sugar and honey to rub gently on your lips. 3. Hydrate and Moisturize: Because lip-plumping products containing particular ingredients can be drying, it's crucial to hydrate and moisturize your lips regularly. Use a hydrating lip balm as part of your daily skincare routine to ensure a healthy foundation for your plumping gloss or chapstick. 4. Follow the instructions: Each product will have specific application instructions, so follow them closely. Apply the product using an applicator brush, a lip brush or a fingertip, depending on your preferred method and the product's design. Begin with a thin layer to gauge your comfort level and the desired effect. Allow the product to work for a few minutes, observing any tingling sensation or redness. 5. Adjust application as needed: If you're satisfied with the results, you can reapply lip-plumping product throughout the day. However, if you experience any ongoing discomfort or irritation, discontinue use and consult with a dermatologist. It's possible that you are sensitive to one of the ingredients, so trying a different product with another formulation might yield better results. 6. Enhance with makeup: For an even more dramatic effect, use makeup to create the appearance of fuller lips. Apply a lip liner that matches your natural lip color, outlining just slightly outside your lip line to create the illusion of added volume. Fill in the space with lipstick or gloss, and add a dab of highlighter to the cupid's bow and the center of the lower lip to enhance the plump, pouty look. By following these tips and incorporating lip-plumping products into your beauty routine, you can achieve the appearance of fuller, more voluminous lips while avoiding costly or invasive procedures. Remember to pay close attention to how your lips react to various products to find the perfect match for your desired effect, and enjoy your newfound pout!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Before now reports Atari had dumped millions of game cartridges were widely believed to be an urban myth. But a three-hour dig at a landfill site turned up many Atari cartridges, including copies of the game ET: The Extra Terrestrial. Atari made millions of copies of the ET game, but it sold poorly and helped to contribute to the demise of the firm. \\"For a lot of people, it's something that they've wondered about and it's been rumoured and talked about for 30 years, and they just want an answer,\\" said Zak Penn, director of a documentary being made about the search for the site and its uncovering. The documentary, produced by Lightbox, is being prepared for Microsoft's Xbox TV channel. Atari was thought to have dumped truckloads of unsold games in the landfill site on the outskirts of Alamogordo in 1983 as the company was winding down. The game maker's descent from its position as the dominant force in home gaming in the late 1970s and early 1980s was swift and has been partly blamed on the gamble it took on making a game of Steven Spielberg's 1982 hit film ET. The game was made from scratch in five weeks for the Atari 2600 console. Even before the game was finished Atari, committed huge amounts of money and resources to it and produced millions of copies when it was done. The ET game has been described as one of the worst ever created. Its challenging game play and poor graphics put people off buying it and left Atari with huge amounts of unsold inventory. The search to see if the rumours about the dump were true was given new life by the efforts of one unnamed game enthusiast who did the detective work to narrow down its location. Red tape surrounding the uncovering of the landfill site held up the start of the dig but once permission was granted excavations began on 26 April. Three hours of digging with a backhoe uncovered significant amounts of Atari 2600 game cartridges - many of which were still in their original packaging. Only a limited amount of material could be retrieved from the dump because the dig was only allowed access for one day. The local authority of Alamogordo ordered the dig site to be refilled on 27 April. What was that article about?","completion":"The article is about the discovery of Atari game cartridges, including ET: The Extra Terrestrial, in a landfill site on the outskirts of Alamogordo in 1983.

If you enjoy romantic comedies then you will find this tale of two 30 year old singles who fall in love during the American League pennant race satisfying. On the other hand, if you are hanging around waiting for Kill Bill Volume 3 or Sin City 2 then you probably should stay away. The plot contains the obligatory guy meets girl's friends, girl meets guy's friends, and guy meets girl's parents scenes. There is even a guy meets girl's pet dog scene. That's all par for the course in a movie like this. However, what I liked about it was that the plot delved into the decision making process people make as they begin to realize that their romantic interest is not perfect and is in fact a bit quirky. The plot centers around answering the questions; how much quirkiness is too much and how much love does it take to trump those quirks? It is interesting to see the characters work that out because deep down (if we admit it) we all have quirks. Barrymore does a very good job in her role and Fallon sorta surprised me -- he's good as well. I rate it a 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy.

Process: - Blood is sent to the liver - The liver uses chemicals and proteins to treat the blood - The blood is cleaned - Energy is produced - The blood leaves the liver cleaned. Question: suppose you drink more alcohol happens, how will it affect You have better complexion. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","completion":"When you consume alcohol, the liver is primarily responsible for breaking it down and removing it from the bloodstream. The effect of drinking more alcohol on your complexion will be influenced by the liver's ability to process the alcohol you consume; this is the perturbation you have mentioned. To respond to the impact of this perturbation on the second effect mentioned, which is improved complexion, I will provide a detailed explanation. Upon drinking alcohol, it is absorbed into the bloodstream, and then the liver metabolizes it to prevent its harmful effects on the body. The liver takes up this responsibility by using specific enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). These enzymes break down alcohol into acetaldehyde, which is then further processed into water and carbon dioxide before being eliminated from the body. Consequently, the liver is a vital organ which plays a significant role in cleansing and detoxifying the body. When you drink more alcohol than the liver can successfully handle, the liver's ability to process the alcohol diminishes. As a result, the blood cannot be cleansed effectively, causing a buildup of harmful substances, inflammation, and oxidative stress. This impacts the liver's proper functioning and its capacity to produce energy. When it comes to the complexion, the liver is crucial in maintaining the health of the skin. A well-functioning liver promotes radiant skin as it can effectively detoxify the body. Conversely, when the liver is struggling to handle the amount of alcohol consumed, skin health may suffer. Since the liver is not able to carry out its detoxification process as efficiently, it can lead to a buildup of toxins affecting the skin's appearance, potentially causing dullness, acne, redness, or sallowness. Therefore, drinking more alcohol can have a negative effect on your complexion, as it imposes stress on the liver, impairing its ability to detoxify the body. This can lead to skin problems that reflect the body's internal imbalances. The supposed perturbation, which is an increased amount of alcohol consumption, influences the second effect mentioned (improved complexion) by having a detrimental effect rather than a positive one. Ultimately, increased alcohol consumption will lead to a less healthy complexion."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

And I was wondering What does Aubrey need to do before this?","completion":"Before Aubrey can offer themselves to the gods as part of the pagan religious ceremony, they should follow several steps to ensure they are well-prepared and respectful of the tradition. Here's a step-by-step guide: Step 1: Researching the Tradition Aubrey should start by researching the specific pagan tradition they are interested in, as there are many different pagan practices. This will help them understand the rituals, beliefs, gods, and ceremonies associated with that tradition. Step 2: Choose the Specific Deities After gaining knowledge about the particular pagan practice, Aubrey should decide which gods or goddesses they would like to offer themselves to. They should also learn about the deity's characteristics, preferences, and expectations. Step 3: Determine the Purpose of the Offering Aubrey needs to understand and set a clear intention for their offering. The purpose may be to seek the deity's guidance, protection, or blessings in a particular area of their life. Step 4: Cleanse and Purify Before the ceremony, it's essential to cleanse and purify oneself physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Aubrey may choose to take a ritual bath, meditate, or perform a cleansing ritual to prepare themselves for the offering. Step 5: Prepare Sacred Space Aubrey should set up an altar or sacred space dedicated to the chosen deity. This could include symbols, statues, or images representing the deity, as well as offerings such as food, flowers, or incense. Step 6: Invoke the Presence of the Deity During the ceremony, Aubrey should invoke the chosen deity's presence through various means such as prayer, chanting, or singing. They may also choose to cast a circle to establish a protective barrier around the sacred space. Step 7: Perform the Offering Ritual Aubrey should now perform the offering ritual, which may vary depending on the chosen pagan tradition or the deity. This could involve lighting candles, saying a prayer, or making symbolic gestures. Step 8: Give Thanks and Close the Ceremony After the offering ritual, Aubrey should express their gratitude to the deity for their presence and any blessings received. They can then close the circle if one was cast and respectfully pack up the sacred space. By following these steps, Aubrey will be well-prepared to offer themselves to the gods as part of the pagan religious ceremony."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Trump, speaking in the White House East Room during a National Space Council meeting, warned that \\"what's happening in Europe … we can't allow that to happen to the United States — not on my watch.\\" Earlier in the day, on the Twitter social media platform, the president inaccurately linked migration in Germany to a rising crime rate. In actuality, the latest German government statistics show reported crimes at the lowest level in 30 years. Tough border enforcement in the U.S. has led to the family breakups, with nearly 2,000 children being sent to mass detention centers or foster care from mid-April to the end of May, according to government officials. The regular White House briefing was delayed several times Monday amid the furor as officials huddled with Trump in the West Wing.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is some data: Andrews County Airport, 3rdRunwayLengthFeet, 2939. Generate a detailed description of this data","completion":"The provided data, \\"Andrews County Airport, 3rdRunwayLengthFeet, 2939\\", refers to specific details about a particular airport located in Andrews County. In this case, the focus is on the length of the 3rd runway at the airport, which is 2939 feet long. To better understand this information, let's break down each component and discuss them in more detail, starting with the location, the airport's general features, and finally the importance of runway length. Location: Andrews County The airport mentioned in the data is situated in Andrews County, a region in the state of Texas, United States. This county is located in the western part of the state, and its seat is the city of Andrews. The airport is utilized by the local community for transportation, connecting the area with other regional airports and serving domestic air travel needs. Airport Facilities The Andrews County Airport typically serves general aviation needs, which include private, corporate, and recreational flights. Many smaller airports like this one do not have regularly scheduled commercial flights; however, they often provide important services, such as charter flights, emergency services, flight training, and maintenance. Airports of this size have runways, taxiways, and aprons to accommodate various types of aircraft, including small propeller-driven airplanes and helicopters. Some might also house control towers, fueling stations, hangars, and terminal buildings to support the arrival and departure of passengers and crew members, along with their parking facilities. 3rd Runway Length In this particular data set, the focus lies on the length of the 3rd runway, which stands at 2939 feet. Runway length is essential for pilots and aviation planners to gauge whether the runway is suitable for a specific type of aircraft, as it can directly impact takeoff and landing safety. Factors that determine the required runway length include aircraft type, flight distance, airplane gross weight, air temperature (density altitude), and wind conditions. A 2939-foot-long runway, as in this case, is suitable for small- to medium-sized general aviation aircraft, as well as certain light business jets. These aircraft types can safely operate on shorter runways compared to large commercial jets since their takeoff and landing requirements are lower, allowing for efficient utilization of this specific airport. It's important to note that runway lengths can vary greatly depending on these parameters, so pilots and operators must consider their specific requirements carefully before attempting takeoffs and landings. In conclusion, the data provided outlines essential information about an airport located in Andrews County that serves the local community and its aviation needs. The length of the 3rd runway at 2939 feet offers a suitable ground infrastructure for small- to medium-sized aircraft, contributing to the safe and efficient operation of flights in and out of the Andrews County Airport. It is crucial for airport management, pilots, and aviation authorities to understand these variables for optimal functioning and the safety of all involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: The move comes in a frontbench reshuffle following Malcolm Turnbull's conservative coalition's recent close-run election victory. France won Australia's largest-ever defence contract in April beating rival bids from Japan and Germany. The new defence industry minister, Christopher Pyne, will oversee the A50bn (â‚¬34bn; Â£29bn) deal. The decision to build the naval fleet in South Australia - Mr Pyne's home state - is expected to create thousands of jobs and boost the local economy. The prime minister said it would completely transform the defence industry in Australia. \\"This is a big change, a big reform, and it requires additional leadership and additional oversight,\\" Mr Turnbull said. \\"This programme is vitally important for the future of Australian industry.\\" The reshuffle otherwise brought in only minor changes, with most key figures staying in their roles. Despite pressure from some right-leaning elements of his party, Mr Turnbull did not offer a cabinet post to Tony Abbott, the man he ousted as prime minister in 2015. Meanwhile another former prime minister, Kevin Rudd, has announced he has asked the government to nominate him for the post of secretary general of the United Nations. Mr Turnbull said cabinet would consider the request, which had been widely expected.

Cleese was born in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, the only child of Reginald Francis Cleese (1893-1972), an insurance salesman, and his wife Muriel Evelyn (nee Cross; 1899-2000). His family's surname was originally Cheese, but his father had thought it was embarrassing and changed it when he enlisted in the Army during the First World War. As a child, Cleese supported Bristol City FC and Somerset County Cricket Club. Cleese was educated at St Peter's Preparatory School, where he received a prize for English and did well at cricket and boxing. Cleese achieved greater prominence in the United Kingdom as the neurotic hotel manager Basil Fawlty in Fawlty Towers, which he co-wrote with his wife Connie Booth. The series won three BAFTA awards when produced and in 2000, it topped the British Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes. The series also featured Prunella Scales as Basil's acerbic wife Sybil, Andrew Sachs as the much abused Spanish waiter Manuel (\\"... he's from Barcelona\\"), and Booth as waitress Polly, the series' voice of sanity. Cleese based Basil Fawlty on a real person, Donald Sinclair, whom he had encountered in 1970 while the Monty Python team were staying at the Gleneagles Hotel in Torquay while filming inserts for their television series. Reportedly, Cleese was inspired by Sinclair's mantra, \\"I could run this hotel just fine if it weren't for the guests.\\" He later described Sinclair as \\"the most wonderfully rude man I have ever met,\\" although Sinclair's widow has said her husband was totally misrepresented in the series. During the Pythons' stay, Sinclair allegedly threw Idle's briefcase out of the hotel \\"in case it contained a bomb,\\" complained about Gilliam's \\"American\\" table manners, and threw a bus timetable at another guest after they dared to ask the time of the next bus to town. The first series was screened from 19 September 1975 on BBC 2, initially to poor reviews, but gained momentum when repeated on BBC 1 the following year. Despite this, a second series did not air until 1979, by which time Cleese's marriage to Booth had ended, but they revived their collaboration for the second series. Fawlty Towers consisted of only twelve episodes; Cleese and Booth both maintain that this was to avoid compromising the quality of the series. In December 1977, Cleese appeared as a guest star on The Muppet Show. Cleese was a fan of the show and co-wrote much of the episode. Cleese also made a cameo appearance in their 1981 film The Great Muppet Caper. Cleese won the TV Times award for Funniest Man on TV - 1978-79.

Though presented as a documentary, it's nothing more than a political hack job. The world according to Moore. And the worst sin of all, its incredibly boring. Answer: Answer:","completion":"Based on the analysis of the given product review, it is evident that the review is negative. The reviewer uses phrases like \\"distortions, half-truths, and innuendo\\" to describe the content of the movie, which clearly indicates dissatisfaction and disappointment in the way information has been presented. The reviewer also criticizes the movie's portrayal of certain figures, stating that Moore (the film's creator) could make even well-respected personalities like Roosevelt and WW2 look bad, further demonstrating the distrust and disdain the reviewer holds towards the film's narrative. Another strong indication of the negative tone throughout the review is the accusation of the movie insulting the intelligence of its viewers. By stating that even the \\"most apolitical among us can't help feeling manipulated,\\" the reviewer maintains that the film fails in maintaining the neutrality, balance, and credibility expected in a documentary, reducing it to what the reviewer calls a \\"political hack job.\\" Moreover, the reviewer refers to the film as \\"The world according to Moore,\\" suggesting that the film is a subjective and heavily biased portrayal of reality. This can be perceived as another strong critique that devalues the integrity and reliability of the movie. Lastly, the reviewer identifies the \\"worst sin of all\\" as the movie being \\"incredibly boring.\\" This critique not only addresses the content and the quality but also the entertainment and engagement factors, which are essential for any film to be successful. By referring to the movie as boring, the reviewer implies that the film lacks the captivating elements necessary to keep the audience interested, further solidifying the overall negative assessment. In conclusion, this product review is decidedly negative, with the reviewer expressing strong dissatisfaction with the film's content, portrayal of figures, and its entertainment value. The reviewer's language and choice of words provide ample evidence to support this analysis of the review being negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Choose from the possible answers, would the following sentence, by the strictest standards, be considered correct by a linguist? She doesn't believe much of that story. Options: 1). unacceptable; 2). acceptable;","completion":"2). acceptable; The sentence \\"She doesn't believe much of that story\\" can be considered correct by a linguist, even when applying the strictest standards. To provide a more detailed analysis of the sentence, let's break it down into its components and examine why the sentence is deemed acceptable. 1. Subject: \\"She\\" — The subject \\"she\\" is a pronoun that functions as the subject of the sentence. \\"She\\" is appropriate for third-person singular reference, which is commonly used in everyday speech and formal writing. The choice of \\"she\\" as the subject presents no linguistic issues. 2. Auxiliary Verb: \\"doesn't\\" — This is a contraction of \\"does not\\" and is used to form the negative of the main verb \\"believe.\\" \\"Doesn't\\" is the correct auxiliary verb for third-person singular negative sentences in the present simple tense. The use of this auxiliary verb is in line with standard English grammar rules. 3. Main Verb: \\"believe\\" — The main verb \\"believe\\" agrees with the subject \\"she\\" and the auxiliary verb \\"doesn't.\\" In the present simple tense, third-person singular subjects typically take the verb form with \\"-s\\" or \\"-es\\" added to the verb's base form (e.g., believes, goes). However, when using the negative form with \\"do not\\" or \\"does not,\\" the base verb form without the \\"-s\\" or \\"-es\\" (e.g., believe, go) is used. So, \\"believe\\" is the correct verb form in this context. 4. Object: \\"much of that story\\" — The phrase \\"much of that story\\" is an appropriate object for the verb \\"believe.\\" The quantifier \\"much\\" indicates a general, nonspecific amount, making the statement less definitive and suggesting that the subject (\\"she\\") accepts some parts of the story but not all of it. This expression is natural and acceptable in English. In summary, the sentence \\"She doesn't believe much of that story\\" can be considered acceptable by a linguist observing the strictest standards of grammar and usage. All components of the sentence are appropriate and comply with the rules of standard English grammar."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. When I first heard about \\"Down To Earth,\\" I was pretty excited. I'm a pretty big fan a Chris Rock, he was especially hilarious in Dogma. But this film proved to be a disappointment. Chris Rock's performance was not nearly as good as his past performances, and the movie was just very badly directed as a whole. First off, Chris Rock. He plays the entire movie as a standup comedy routine. Obviously, this works fine in the scenes where he's supposed to be doing standup, but in the rest of the movie, it doesn't. Even when he's talking to one other character, he seems to think he's trying to make a roomful of people laugh. He has a few funny moments, but they mostly come during the standup scenes (no wonder they decided to make his character a comedian). As for the rest of the cast, they're pretty much there just to give Rock someone to talk to, none of them stand out. Also, the movie was poorly directed. The movie has basically a one-joke plot: old white guy acting like a young black comedian. While I prefer movies with more than one joke, this still could have worked, and been quite funny. The problem was, we saw too much of Rock and not enough of the old white guy. It's supposed to be funny because it's this white guy telling Chris Rock's jokes, but for most of the time, we just see Chris Rock, so it's not nearly as funny. The few scenes where they decide to show us the white guy talking like Rock are, in fact, hilarious. If he had been shown more, the movie would have been a lot funnier. Overall, a few moments of laughter can't make up for the fact that \\"Down To Earth\\" is poorly acted, and poorly directed. This one was a pretty big disappointment. Rating: 4/10 How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment with Chris Rock's performance and the movie's direction, stating that it was poorly acted and directed. They mention some positive aspects, such as a few funny moments, but ultimately give the film a low rating of 4/10, reinforcing the negative sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The village is home to the Briarcliff Manor Union Free School District, which covers 6.58 square miles (17.0 km2) of land and most of the village of Briarcliff Manor and an unincorporated portion of the town of Mount Pleasant. Parts of Briarcliff Manor not covered by the school district include Scarborough and Chilmark; these areas are part of the Ossining Union Free School District. The district serves over 1,000 students and includes Todd Elementary School, Briarcliff Middle School, and Briarcliff High School. From Briarcliff Manor's settlement until 1918, students in grades 1–8 were taught within one school facility; from 1919 until the 1940s, students in grades 1–12 were as well. The district is noted for its annual high-school musicals. The elementary school (opened in 1953) is named after George A. Todd, Jr., who was the village's first teacher, first superintendent of schools, and taught for over 40 years. The middle school became a Blue Ribbon School in 2005.Briarcliff Manor has been home to a number of schools. Long Hill School was a public school in Scarborough until 1912, with about 70 students, two classrooms, and two teachers. Dr. Holbrook's Military School was on Holbrook Road from 1866 to 1915. Miss Tewksbury's School and later Mrs. Marshall's Day & Boarding School for Little Girls was at Dysart House. Miss Knox's School ran from 1905 in Pocantico Lodge, a hotel on Pleasantville Road under Briarcliff Lodge management.

Article: The Pacific Northwest continued to struggle Thursday under a parade of storms that have marched in like hostile armies from the Pacific. As Seattle coped with freezing rain and ice -- 300,000 homes were without power at midday -- officials in parts of Oregon were evacuating homes. The state was battling near-record floods as the snow that hit earlier in the week turned into torrential rain. The onslaught melted the snow, sending cascades of water down rivers and creeks. With prospects of continued flooding, Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber late Thursday declared a state of emergency due to severe winter weather in Marion, Coos, Benton and Lincoln counties. \\"In a couple of cases, we have had rivers and creeks reach levels of the last big round of floods we had in 1996. So this is serious,\\" Gene Evans, spokesman for Oregon's emergency operations center, told the Los Angeles Times. Hardest hit were small towns near the state capital of Salem, in the Willamette Valley, which saw up to 3 inches of rain over the last 24 hours, and areas along the coast, where residents got up to 6 inches of rain. In the town of Albany on Wednesday night, a vehicle with four people inside was swept out of a grocery store parking lot into a nearby creek that had suddenly overflowed. The car appears to have been sucked rapidly into a culvert under the road, where it became trapped, Wanda Omdahl, spokeswoman for the Albany Fire Department, said in an interview. Rescuers were able to pull out 24-year-old Christopher Wilgus and his 5-year-old son, Maliki, who were transported to the hospital, and they continued to search the watery darkness for the other two people in the car. \\"After about two hours, the chance of recovering anyone is not there. No one can survive under water that long. So we switched from a rescue to a recovery mode,\\" Omdahl said. Shortly after midnight, the body of 20-month-old Aiden McLaughlin was pulled from the water several hundred yards downstream; the body of his mother, Catherine McLaughlin, 18, was found at midday Thursday. The 5-year-old remained in critical condition Thursday. Albany Fire Department staffers were also working in the nearby town of Scio, where flooding on Thomas Creek prompted the evacuation of three-fourths of the town's 870 residents and stranded several people in their homes. Rescuers in boats were taking them to nearby evacuation centers. About 80 homes were evacuated in Turner, where Portland's KGW television had video images of the local fire department -- along with parts of the rest of the town -- surrounded by water. The capital city was experiencing problems as well, as street flooding washed through several basement parking garages and closed roads. \\"It's pretty much runoff at this point,\\" Evans said. On the other side of Oregon's Coast Range, rescuers were helping evacuate residents in the 900-resident town of Mapleton, where the Siuslaw River was raging. The rain had slowed down by Thursday afternoon -- but it was only a temporary respite, National Weather Service meteorologist Tiffani Brown warned. \\"We've got a little bit of a break this evening and tonight between systems. But another system is coming in from the west during Friday,\\" she said. \\"So we will kind of have a repeat of heavy rainfall for a good period of time. And the outlook just seems to be very similar, where we have a system coming from the west that will bring a good amount of rain every 24 to 36 hours, at least through midweek next week.\\" The flood warning issued by the National Weather Service for Oregon also extended into southwest Washington. Near Seattle, the precipitation was still coming down as snow and freezing rain, briefly suspending flights at Seattle Tacoma International Airport on Thursday morning and causing dozens of canceled flights. At least one fatality was blamed on the storm. A 60-year-old man died near Issaquah, Wash., when a tree fell on him as he was backing his all-terrain vehicle out of a lean-to, King County Sheriff's Department spokesman Cindi West said. \\"He was going to go for a ride, and his wife was going to go with him. He went to back it out, and when he didn't get back, she went out and found that a tree had fallen on him,\\" she said in an interview. Sheriff's deputies who investigated the incident were briefly held up from returning when a fallen tree blocked the road -- one of dozens of similar incidents across western Washington that left at least 200,000 homes without power. Puget Sound Energy, the major utility in the region, warned that some homes might not be brought back on the grid until the weekend. In what she said was \\"purely a precautionary measure,\\" Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire issued an emergency storm proclamation. It was designed, initially, to relieve restrictions on work hours for dairy truck drivers, helping ensure that milk product deliveries could reach their destinations. The proclamation will also allow the National Guard and other state agencies to step in if needed. \\"So far, we haven't received any requests for state assistance -- but we know weather conditions are rapidly changing. I want to make sure we have every resource available to ensure our communities are safe,\\" the governor said. The Washington forecast was for gradually warming temperatures, with the prospect of rainfall melting the accumulated ice and snow within the next few days.

SEATTLE A deadly ice storm swept across the Pacific Northwest on Thursday, adding to the misery of residents struggling with power outages and treacherous roads since an earlier record snowfall. Washington's governor declared a state of emergency and the storm was blamed for at least two deaths, including that of a 20-month-old boy in Albany, Oregon, who police said was sitting in a car that was swept into a rain-swollen creek. In Seattle, which normally sees mild temperatures and wet weather but not heavy snow, the storm has resulted in airport and school closures, car crashes, downed trees and lost power to at least 90,000 households. Overall, some 150,000 homes across the state were without power, officials said. Nicknamed \\"Snowmageddon,\\" the storm first walloped Seattle and other parts of Washington state with snow on Tuesday night. On Thursday, officials mainly expressed concern about icy rain and its potential to down power lines and cause car crashes. The icy roads led to crashes in many parts of Washington state on Thursday. On Interstate 90 near the town of Cle Elum, about 80 miles inland from Seattle, six semi-trailer trucks were involved in a collision that blocked the state's major thoroughfare through the Cascade Range of mountains, said Kandi Patrick of the Washington State Patrol. The emergency proclamation by Washington Governor Chris Gregoire allows for the activation of the Washington National Guard if needed but the governor has not asked for the guard to assist, said her spokeswoman, Karina Shagren. Record-setting daily snowfall of 6.8 inches was measured early Thursday at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, shattering the 1954 record of 2.9 inches, said meteorologist Dan DePodwin on Accuweather.com. One of three Sea-Tac runways remains shuts, said airport spokeswoman Charla Skaggs. The airport was conducting de-icing operations and at one point all runways were shut, she said. Few passengers were stranded because the airport is not a major hub for flight connections, Skaggs said. In the greater Seattle area, downed trees blocked lanes on at least three state highways, Washington State Patrol spokeswoman Julie Startup said. She said there were many collisions on the icy roads. BLOWN TRANSFORMERS Power outages kept residents in the dark but blown-out transformers put on a spectacular show. \\"Skies just keep lighting up,\\" Startup said. Puget Sound Energy warned power outages in some areas may not be restored until Saturday. Streets also were a mess as frigid temperatures and freezing rain in the Tacoma area, 35 miles south of Seattle, coated roads with ice. Near Issaquah, a suburb of Seattle, a 60-year-old man was killed when a snow-laden tree fell on him as he drove an all-terrain vehicle, said King County sheriff's spokeswoman Sergeant Cindi West. In Albany, Oregon, rescuers were still looking for the mother of Aiden McLaughlin, the toddler who was killed when the car he was in was swept from a grocery store parking lot into a creek, the city's police department said in a statement. The National Weather Service has issued flood warnings and advisories for most of western Oregon, where rivers and streams are swelling, causing pockets of flooding to roads and homes. Authorities called for voluntary evacuations of the town of Mapleton, Oregon, which has about 1,000 residents, and some nearby areas because expected flooding, said Amber Fossen, spokeswoman for Lane County.

Ahmed Wali Karzai, the Kandahar provincial council chief, was killed during a gathering, said Tooryalai Wesa, provincial governor. He did not know a motive. While the governor initially said a friend killed Karzai, his spokesman later clarified that the death was at the hands of a guard. Saidkhan Khakrezwal, a member of the Kandahar provincial council, told CNN he and others were with Ahmed Wali Karzai when a guard named Sardar Mohammad came into the room and asked to talk to him. The guard then \\"takes Wali to another room and shoots him with a pistol that he had in his hand,\\" Khakrezwal said. The shooter was shot dead by other guards. Sardar Mohammad was a trusted man who had worked as a guard for Karzai for eight years, Khakrezwal said. He was also a commander for a police post where there were about 30 policemen. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the shooting, saying that the guard accused of shooting him was working for them. Karzai suffered bullet wounds to his head and chest, said Mohammad Dawood Farhad, the head of Kandahar Hospital. \\"My brother Ahmad Wali Karzai was killed today,\\" said the Afghan president in a previously scheduled news conference with visiting French President Nicolas Sarkozy. \\"The Afghanistan people have suffered a lot. Every Afghan family has suffered. I hope one day these sufferings end.\\" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said President Barack Obama comdemned Karzai's murder and extended thoughts and prayers to his family. \\"The United States condemns in the strongest possible terms the murder of President Karzai's half brother in Kandahar,\\" Carney said. \\"There's been some claims and we will certainly work with the Afghan authorities on that, but right now the moment here is a personal one and we express our condolences.\\" Gen. David Petraeus, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan said ISAF will help the Afghan government \\"bring justice\\" to those involved in the killing. \\"President Karzai is working to create a stronger, more secure Afghanistan, and for such a tragic event to happen to someone within his own family is unfathomable,\\" Petraeus said. Ahmed Wali Karzai, who has been dogged by drug dealing and corruption accusations, had been the subject of WikiLeaks cables leaked last year. Without being prompted, he discussed the accusations with a senior U.S. diplomat, according to one of the cables. He said that the claims are part of a campaign to discredit him and offered suggestions on how to stop drug dealing. \\"He is willing to take a polygraph anytime, anywhere to prove his innocence,\\" the cable said. \\"He suggested that the coalition pay mullahs to preach against heroin, which would reduce demand for poppy cultivation.\\" A U.S. official who authored another cable wrote that even though he must be engaged as head of Kandahar's provincial council, \\"he is widely understood to be corrupt and a narcotics trafficker.\\" He said Karzai's \\"reputation for shady dealings\\" should be considered when he recommends \\"costly infrastructure projects. The official said dealing with people like Ahmed Wali Karzai represents a major challenge in Afghanistan: Fighting corruption and building support for government when government officials are corrupt themselves. Karzai \\"appears not to understand the level of our knowledge of his activities, and that the coalition views many of his activities as malign, particularly relating to his influence over the police,\\" the author of the first cable said. In addition to discussions of war, drugs and Afghan politics, a comment in one of the cables also addressed his days as a restaurant owner close to Chicago's Wrigley Field, the iconic baseball stadium. \\"His restaurant was a hub for American(s) in the Midwest who had worked or lived in Afghanistan prior to the Soviet invasion,\\" the cable read.

Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Beach volleyball is one of those sports that can be an exciting game to play and watch, or, can just be about some friends getting together to have a great time. It's really easy, and all you need is sand, a net and a group of people, of any age or fitness level, who want to have fun. Beach volleyball can be played with as few as two people on each team, making a total of four people. However, if you are less skilled and experienced in the game, it will be easier to play with a larger team. The more players you have, the less ground each person will be responsible for covering and the more time they will have to recover in between shots. If you only have a few players, each of you will get quite a workout running for the ball after each volley. If you are looking for that relaxing, fun, low-key experience, choose larger teams. Beach volleyball is similar to regular volleyball in its rules. However, even experienced volleyball players do not realize how much more difficult it is to run and jump on sand. Since it is harder to move quickly on sand than a hard ground, play will be much slower than regular volleyball on a playground. When a player trains for beach volleyball, he will focus on building lower body strength as well as upper body. While he needs to be able to hit the ball with a great deal of power and accuracy , strengthening his legs is extremely important. Whether you are in it for the competition, or just to have a great time with your friends, beach volleyball can be very exciting and fun. You may even start out with friends and fall in love with the sport. Question: The passage mainly tells us _ .

I know you're curious about a fun sports match. You have a question: How many points were scored on both teams' first possessions? Well, let's see if we can figure this out together. In any sport, like your favorite basketball or football game, teams try to score points to win. When a game starts, each team gets a turn called a \\"possession.\\" And, of course, there are two teams in a game, so we have to see what happened for both of them during their first possession. Let's say, Team A scored 3 points and Team B scored 7 points on their first possessions. If we add these numbers together, we'll find out how many points were scored in total on both teams' first possessions. Here's the easy math: Team A scored 3 points + Team B scored 7 points -------------------------- Total points: 10 points So, in this example, there were 10 points scored on both teams' first possessions. Keep in mind that the points will be different for every game, so always look for the results to know the right numbers. That's how you can learn about the points scored by the two teams in a game.

Pick from: [i] pulley [ii] blade [iii] lever [iv] wedge Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: The axe head and the doorstop are both examples of a wedge, a type of simple machine. Q: An axe head and a doorstop are types of what simple machine? A: A:","completion":"An axe head and a doorstop are both examples of a wedge, which is a type of simple machine. A wedge is one of the six classical simple machines, alongside the pulley, blade, lever, wheel and axle, and the inclined plane. The primary function of a wedge is to separate two objects, lift an object, or hold an object in place by applying force. A wedge works by converting the input force applied to it into output force exerted on the objects. It does this by magnifying the force along its sloping surfaces, effectively providing an increase in mechanical advantage. The mechanical advantage of a wedge can be determined by the ratio of its length to its thickness, making it more effective the longer and thinner it is. In the case of an axe head, the wedge shape enables it to efficiently split objects apart, such as wood, by concentrating the applied force along a narrow edge. The axe head is attached to a handle, allowing the user to apply a swinging force that drives the thin edge into the wood. The angled sides of the wedge then force the wood apart, resulting in a clean split. A doorstop, on the other hand, is a wedge used to hold a door open by preventing it from closing under its own weight or due to external forces, such as wind. The doorstop is placed under the edge of the door, and as the door attempts to close, the wedge shape of the doorstop converts the horizontal force exerted by the door into a vertical force that lifts the door slightly. This lifting action creates friction between the doorstop and the floor, as well as the door and the doorstop, keeping the door in place. In both cases, the wedge shape of these simple machines allows them to function effectively by transforming the applied force into a more efficient output force. The practical applications of wedges can be found in various aspects of our daily lives, from cutting tools and construction to everyday household items."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How do you do this: To stuff a fabric project and give it a heavier weight and feel, you can","completion":"use a combination of stuffing materials and weighted fillers. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to stuff a fabric project and give it a heavier weight and feel: 1. Choose the stuffing materials: There are various stuffing materials available for use in fabric projects, such as polyester fiberfill, cotton batting, wool, or even shredded foam. These materials are generally lightweight and help give volume and shape to your project. To add a heavier weight and feel, you will also need weighted fillers such as plastic pellets, poly beads, glass beads, or even rice or dried beans. These weighted fillers provide the desired weight and help create a more solid and stable stuffed project. 2. Prepare the fabric project: Start by ensuring that your fabric project is sewn together, leaving an opening for stuffing. Ideally, the opening should be large enough for your materials to pass through easily. If your project has small appendages or narrow areas, you can use a funnel or a long tool like a wooden dowel or knitting needle to help you stuff these areas easily. 3. Create a layered stuffing approach: To achieve the perfect balance of weight and softness, you can use a layering approach to stuff your fabric project. This means adding layers of lightweight materials and weighted filler materials. For example, you can start by adding a layer of polyester fiberfill and follow it with a layer of weighted fillers. 4. Start with lightweight stuffing material: Begin by loosely filling your fabric project with the lightweight stuffing material of your choice. Use your fingers or a tool like a wooden dowel to push the material into the corners and crevices of your project to create a smooth and even shape. Make sure not to over-stuff the project, as this can cause the seams to strain and possibly tear. 5. Add weighted filler material: Once your fabric project has a base layer of softer stuffing material, you can start adding the weighted fillers. To do this, pour a portion of your chosen filler into the opening of your project, distributing them evenly throughout the project. You can encase the weighted fillers in a small pouch made of fabric or nylon to keep them secure and prevent them from shifting. 6. Continue layering: Alternate between layers of lightweight stuffing material and weighted fillers until the project is full and has achieved the desired weight and feel. It's important to adjust the amount of stuffing and weighted fillers to suit your preferences. You can also use your fingers to distribute the materials more evenly to prevent any lumpiness in your final project. 7. Close the opening: Once you are satisfied with the weight and feel of your stuffed fabric project, it's time to close the opening. Using a needle and thread, sew the opening shut with small, tight stitches to maintain the structural integrity of your project. Make sure to secure the stitches with a knot before cutting the excess thread. 8. Inspect your finished project: Check your stuffed fabric project, assessing its overall weight distribution and ensuring there are no sharp points or lumps. If necessary, make any adjustments by opening the seam slightly, adding or removing material as needed, and re-sewing the opening shut. By following these steps, you will create a fabric project that not only has the desired weight and feel but also retains a soft and comfortable texture. This makes it perfect for a variety of purposes, such as weighted blankets, plush toys, or decorative pillows."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A: like a good worker B: Loving C: Miserable A:","completion":"From the given context, it's apparent that Taylor displayed a level of professionalism and empathy that one might associate with a good worker. When faced with an upset patient, many individuals can become flustered or equally upset. However, Taylor chose to patiently navigate the situation, attempting to improve the individual's mood instead. This signifies her ability to manage difficult situations smoothly while maintaining a compassionate and understanding attitude. Moreover, this trait is not just related to basic job performance but also entails emotional intelligence, an essential quality in any profession requiring interaction with other people. Given the nature of her work and interaction, it suggests that she has a significant level of tact and patience. Besides, she demonstrates a strong commitment to her responsibilities and displays leadership by taking matters into her own hands rather than avoiding it or passing it off to someone else. This dedication and dutiful performance are hallmarks of a good worker. We can also infer that she also might possess significant interpersonal abilities, being capable of turning a negative situation into a more positive one. Transitioning from encountering an upset individual to working on improving their mood is an admirable trait, showcasing her capabilities of problem-solving in real-time while making a genuine effort to ensure patients' emotional well-being. However, the context does not provide sufficient information to explicitly define Taylor as 'loving' or 'miserable'. While her actions could be interpreted as loving, this is subjective and not stated explicitly in the context. Similarly, labeling her as miserable would not be accurate as there's no indication of personal dissatisfaction or unhappiness in her work situation. Therefore, in response to the question 'how would you describe Taylor?' based upon the provided context and the suggested options, the most suitable answer would be A: 'like a good worker."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Select the topic that this about: Diminutive yet dynamic Sri Lankan wicketkeeper Romesh Kaluwitharana has retired following his omission from a Sri Lankan training squad due to face New Zealand next month. Available options: [a]. World [b]. Sports [c]. Business [d]. Science/Tech","completion":"[b]. Sports Romesh Kaluwitharana is a former Sri Lankan cricketer who has contributed significantly to the sports scene in Sri Lanka. Being a wicketkeeper-batsman, he played a crucial role in the Sri Lankan cricket team between the early 1990s and early 2000s. The retirement of Romesh Kaluwitharana following his omission from a Sri Lankan training squad due to face New Zealand next month marks the end of an impressive career in the sports category. Kaluwitharana, born on November 24, 1969, made his debut into the world of cricket at a young age when he played for his school, St. Sebastian's College in Moratuwa. He then progressed through the Sri Lankan cricket ranks and made his debut for the national team in 1990. He was an aggressive batsman and an effective wicketkeeper, which earned him a regular spot in the national team. During his career, Kaluwitharana was widely regarded for his outstanding wicketkeeping skills and his explosive batting style up the order. He demonstrated his ability as an opening batsman alongside the cricketing great Sanath Jayasuriya. The duo formed a powerful opening partnership, especially during the 1996 Cricket World Cup, where Sri Lanka claimed the championship under the captaincy of Arjuna Ranatunga. Kaluwitharana's role in the 1996 World Cup victory is still spoken or, as former Australian cricketer, Adam Gilchrist, once credited him and Jayasuriya for revolutionizing One-Day International (ODI) cricket with their aggressive batting during the first 15 overs. The pair's fearlessness in attacking the opposition bowlers set a new precedent for openers in limited-overs cricket. During his career, Kaluwitharana played 49 Tests and accumulated 1936 runs at an average of 22.22, with 93 catches and 26 stumpings. In ODI cricket, he featured in 189 matches and scored 3711 runs at an average of 22.76, while taking 132 catches and 75 stumpings. He has four Test centuries and five ODI centuries to his name. However, later in his career, as age began to catch up with him, Kaluwitharana started to face fierce competition from the upcoming younger talent. The drop in his performance and consistency ultimately led to his exclusion from the team that would face New Zealand next month. His retirement, therefore, signifies the natural progression for a sportsman who has given commendable dedication and service to the sport and his country. The retirement of Romesh Kaluwitharana will be remembered as a cherished chapter in the history of Sri Lankan cricket. His contribution to the evolution of limited-overs cricket is undeniable, and his legacy as one of the most explosive batsmen in the cricketing world will long be celebrated. As talented youngsters step up to fill his shoes in the Sri Lankan cricket team, fans can look back fondly at the unforgettable moments created by this diminutive yet dynamic cricketer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is also a colloquial term for the instrument used by players in all genres, including classical music. Fiddle playing, or fiddling, refers to various styles of music. Fiddle is also a common term among musicians who play folk music on the violin. The fiddle is part of many traditional (folk) styles of music which are aural traditions, taught 'by ear' rather than via written music. Fiddle is normally the term used for Irish Traditional Music. - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - \`\` Relentless '' is a song written by James LeBlanc and John Paul White and recorded by American country music artist Jason Aldean . It was released in May 2008 as the third and final single from his 2007 album of the same name . The song peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs in late 2008 . - The word Dobro is, in popular usage, the generic term for a wood-bodied, single cone resonator guitar. It is also an American brand of resonator guitar, currently owned by the Gibson Guitar Corporation. The Dobro was originally made by the Dopyera brothers when they formed the Dobro Manufacturing Company. Their design, with a single inverted resonator, was introduced in competition to the patented Tricone and biscuit designs produced by the National String Instrument Corporation. The Dobro name appeared on other instruments, notably electric lap steel guitars and solid body electric guitars and on other resonator instruments such as Safari resonator mandolins. - Broken Bow Records is an American independent record label based in Nashville, Tennessee.

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Jason Aldine Williams (born February 28, 1977), known professionally as Jason Aldean, is an American singer. Since 2005, Jason Aldean has been signed to Broken Bow Records, a record label for which he has released seven albums and 24 singles.

There are many types of harmonica, including diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions. A harmonica is played by using the mouth (lips and tongue) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed. A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway. When the free end is made to vibrate by the player's air, it alternately blocks and unblocks the airway to produce sound.

My partner’s parents decided to help with all the planning and set up for his sister’s wedding. I am sure part of the reason was because they had offered to foot part of the expenses. There came a point in the planning, when his mom seemed to sort of run-amok with her ideas. His sister ended up accepting some plans for her wedding that I don’t think she was really that fond of, but she went along with them anyways. One of the things that stands out the most to me, was this idea that they would make a large wooden box with a hole in it, and people would smash their dinner plates into the box. Then the fragments of the broken plates would be put into metal keepsake tins for the guests to take home. (The tins were cute, the trash inside seemed very weird to me.) So imagine it’s the evening of your wedding reception, and people are in a corner of the room smashing their plates into a box. And then part of your wedding party is supposed to go in the back and fix up the tins of broken ceramic ware. It was like an exercise in how to needlessly generate extra stress hormones in a large room full of people. My partner’s sister looked like she cringed every time someone threw a plate in the box. It is weird (and wasteful) to propose to break brand new plates for a tradition that isn’t even part of your ancestry. It’s weird to railroad the people getting married into accepting to do things they don’t really want. Soon after that, my partner’s mother offered that she would be happy to help us plan and throw our wedding too, just like they did for his sister.

Question: Nagarjuna said that sentient beings are empty of what? Is For Nagarjuna, it is not merely sentient beings that are empty of ātman; all phenomena (dharmas) are without any svabhava (literally \\"own-nature\\" or \\"self-nature\\"), and thus without any underlying essence; they are \\"empty\\" of being independent; thus the heterodox theories of svabhava circulating at the time were refuted on the basis of the doctrines of early Buddhism. a good answer to this question? pick from the following. (a). yes. (b). no.","completion":"(a). yes. This statement correctly explains Nagarjuna's view on emptiness. According to Nagarjuna, a central figure in Buddhist philosophy, sentient beings and all phenomena are devoid of self-nature (svabhava). This means that nothing exists independently or possesses an underlying essence. Therefore, it refutes prevailing theories of the time that declared the existence of a self-nature. However, the other option ('b'. no) is incorrect because the provided explanation is a comprehensive answer to the question.

Information: - The user interface (UI), in the industrial design field of humancomputer interaction, is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur. The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of the machine from the human end, whilst the machine simultaneously feeds back information that aids the operators' decision-making process. Examples of this broad concept of user interfaces include the interactive aspects of computer operating systems, hand tools, heavy machinery operator controls, and process controls. The design considerations applicable when creating user interfaces are related to or involve such disciplines as ergonomics and psychology. - A display device is an output device for presentation of information in visual or tactile form (the latter used for example in tactile electronic displays for blind people).

Initially operating from a single-room apartment, Techns was founded in 1981 by three staff members of Data East. Their first game was \\"Minky Monkey\\", released in 1982.

Video game is the most common form today, and for this reason the terms are often mistakenly used synonymously. Other common forms of electronic game include such products as handheld electronic games, standalone systems (e.g. pinball, slot machines, or electro-mechanical arcade games), and exclusively non-visual products (e.g. audio games). - An arcade game or coin-op is a coin-operated entertainment machine typically installed in public businesses such as restaurants, bars and amusement arcades. Most arcade games are video games, pinball machines, electro-mechanical games, redemption games or merchandisers. While exact dates are debated, the golden age of arcade video games is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s. Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s, the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home-based video game consoles such as Playstation and Xbox increased in their graphics and game-play capability and decreased in cost. - The Game Boy line is a line of handheld game consoles developed, manufactured, and marketed by Nintendo.

Though video games have been afforded legal protection as creative works by the Supreme Court of the United States, the philosophical proposition that video games are works of art remains in question, even when considering the contribution of expressive elements such as graphics, storytelling and music.

First came the shooting of a teenager in Columbus, Ohio, who had been brandishing a BB gun. Two days later, on Friday, was the shooting death in Tulsa, Okla., of a man who had his hands above his head before an officer opened fire. And then it was Charlotte, where Mr. Scott, 43, black like the other two, was shot by a police officer in a parking space marked “Visitor” outside an unremarkable apartment complex. On Wednesday that parking space was both a shooting site and a shrine, and Charlotte was a city on edge, the latest to play a role in what feels like a recurring, seemingly inescapable tape loop of American tragedy. “To see this happen multiple times — just time after time — it’s depressing, man,” said Tom Jackson, 25, who works with mentally disabled people. He didn’t know Mr. Scott but was drawn here nonetheless, one of many strangers and friends who came to pay their respects and make sense of their sorrow. In addition to the fatal attacks on police officers in Baton Rouge and Dallas, it was another grim snapshot of America’s continuing crisis in black and blue, this moment amplified by presidential politics. And as usual, there was very little consensus on what went wrong and how to fix it. ||||| Charlotte, North Carolina (CNN) One person was shot Wednesday during a second night of protests over a deadly police shooting in Charlotte, city officials said. The person, who was not identified, is in critical condition and on life support, the city tweeted. Earlier, the city had tweeted that the person had died. The person was shot by another civilian, the city said. One police officer was injured, according to a city tweet. The officer was transported to a hospital with undisclosed injuries. The riot and protests came on a day in which the city's police chief gave more details on the shooting that took the life of Keith Lamont Scott. Chief Kerr Putney addressed the Scott family's claim that he was reading a book in his vehicle when police officers approached and shot him. Putney said Scott, an African-American, was armed and no book was found at the scene. He was shot by an African-American officer after refusing repeated demands to put down a gun, which was recovered from the scene, Putney said. Wednesday night, scores of protesters gathered in two locations in Charlotte. Mayor Jennifer Roberts, who spoke by phone with CNN's Don Lemon, called on demonstrators to heed calls from Scott's family and the NAACP to remain peaceful. \\"Go home and tell everyone violence is not the answer. The investigation is ongoing, it will be transparent,\\" she said. A protest in a park was peaceful, the mayor said, and the rioting downtown was from a small group of agitators, the mayor said. Gov. Pat McCrory said the state is sending more troopers from the highway patrol to Charlotte. \\"Any violence directed toward our citizens or police officers or destruction of property should not be tolerated,\\" he said in a statement. Many rioters and protesters dispersed after police fired tear gas before 11 p.m. ET. Some apparently turned over trash cans and set the contents on fire. A few windows in at least one store were broken and one had \\"black lives matters\\" spray-painted on it. Differing stories on shooting Scott's family said he was unarmed and sitting in his car reading a book on Tuesday, waiting for his son to come home from school. Putney said Scott exited his car with a gun, not a book. He said officers couldn't find a book at the scene.

Three uniformed officers were wearing cameras, there is also dash cam recordings, and investigators are reviewing the footage, Putney said. The mayor said she will be watching video from the incident on Thursday. A person doesn't have to point a weapon directly at police to prompt deadly force, CNN law enforcement analyst Art Roderick said. \\"You don't have to actually wait until a handgun is pointed at you because you're talking milliseconds of a decision as to whether you're going to pull your trigger, or that individual is going to pull their trigger,\\" Roderick said. Who is the officer? Officer Brentley Vinson Vinson has worked for Charlotte-Mecklenburg police for two years. He played football at Liberty University from 2009-2012 and majored in criminal justice, according to his biography on Liberty University's website. Former teammate Austin Marsh told CNN that Vinson was a \\"standup guy.\\" \\"It breaks my heart to see something like this happen, and I have a really hard time believing that Brent shot a man in his car while waiting for his (son) for no reason,\\" Marsh said. \\"Brent has always been a great guy founded on good morals. I find it very hard to believe that he would gun down an innocent man.\\" CNN briefly spoke to Vinson's father, Alex Vinson, on the phone. He asked for privacy and said no one in the family would be speaking to the media. The officer has been placed on paid administrative leave, Mayor Jennifer Roberts said.

An investigation into Scott's death is ongoing. \\"I don't know that he definitively pointed the weapon specifically towards an officer,\\" Putney told reporters. \\"I can tell you from the facts that the story is a little bit different as to how it's been portrayed so far, especially through social media.\\" Police have identified the officer involved in the shooting as Brentley Vinson, who has been employed with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department since July 21, 2014, and is currently assigned to the metro division. He has been placed on paid administrative leave as the investigation continues, according to Putney. Vinson was not wearing a body camera at the time, but the other officers who responded to the incident were. The footage will not be released until the investigation is complete, Putney said. The incident began around 4 p.m. Tuesday, when officers arrived at an apartment complex in Charlotte, searching for a suspect who had an outstanding warrant, according to a police statement. Police said Scott, 43, was not the suspect officers had sought. Cellphone video shows the scene after Scott was shot. Several emergency responders tended to his body and lifted him onto a stretcher. Jeff Siner/The Charlotte Observer via AP Photo Violent protests rocked Charlotte after Scott's death. At least 16 police officers were injured while trying to quell the demonstrators, and multiple police vehicles were damaged, according to Putney. The protesters blocked northbound and southbound lanes on a portion of I-85 in Charlotte. Some individuals looted a tractor-trailer and set fire to its contents. Officers in riot gear gave multiple orders for the people to disperse, and when they didn't, police deployed tear gas. One person has been arrested, Putney said. During the news conference today, Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts expressed concern for Scott's family and the officers injured during the protests. She also called for peace and patience. \\"This is a difficult situation for everyone involved,\\" she told reporters. \\"Our top priority is for Charlotte to remain a safe community for everyone who lives and visits here.\\" North Carolina Gov.

The law, HB 972, says footage from police body or dashboard cameras may not be released publicly without a court order. \\"We join the people in Charlotte and across the nation in sending our deepest condolences to Mr. Scott's family,\\" said Karen Anderson, the executive director of the North Carolina ACLU. \\"We demand a full investigation into why yet another black person in the United States has died at the hands of a police officer. The public and Mr. Scott's family deserve answers.\\" In response to the fatal shooting, B.J. Murphy, a religious leader, called for an independent investigation into the incident and \\"an economic boycott\\" of the city. \\"Since black lives do not matter for this city, then our black dollars shouldn't matter,\\" Murphy said at a press conference with other black leaders today. \\"We're tired of being killed and nobody saying nothing.\\" He continued, \\"I don't want to offend nobody.

Many American kids collect baseball cards. The cards have pictures of their favorite players on them. In school, friends trade baseball cards just like they trade their lunches. Players are known as \\"the boys of summer\\" because people often play the sport mostly in warm months. You don't need to be of a certain size or shape to play baseball. You don't have to be tall like a basketball player or strong like an American footballer. You just need to want to have fun. Baseball is not as fast-paced a game as basketball. But when you go to see a game, there's time to relax, talk and get to know other people. Baseball may not be the most popular sport in the US, but it is the most traditional. It's not just a game any more, but an important part of American culture, like apple pie and grandma's house. Question: People like to play baseball in _ .

Please answer a question about the following article about Immaculate Conception: The celebrated John Duns Scotus (d. 1308), a Friar Minor like Saint Bonaventure, argued, on the contrary, that from a rational point of view it was certainly as little derogatory to the merits of Christ to assert that Mary was by him preserved from all taint of sin, as to say that she first contracted it and then was delivered. Proposing a solution to the theological problem of reconciling the doctrine with that of universal redemption in Christ, he argued that Mary's immaculate conception did not remove her from redemption by Christ; rather it was the result of a more perfect redemption granted her because of her special role in salvation history. What did the monk of minor believe could alleviate the tension in the matter of the","completion":"Immaculate Conception and the role of Christ in redemption? The Friar Minor, John Duns Scotus, believed that the theological tension between the Immaculate Conception of Mary and the universal redemption in Christ could be alleviated by arguing that Mary's Immaculate Conception did not exempt her from being redeemed by Christ. Instead, he proposed that her Immaculate Conception was the result of a more perfect and unique form of redemption granted to her by Christ due to her special role in salvation history. In other words, her preservation from all taint of sin was a direct result of Christ's merits, rather than a contradiction to them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Gangs of New York Context: The film opens with Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) shaving dry with an old, rusted straight razor. He deliberately cuts his cheek and then hands the blade to his son Amsterdam, who is about to wipe off the blood. Vallon tells him to leave it there, and his son puts away the blade in a black pouch with a sliver cross clasp. Vallon then says a prayer to St. Michael, puts a medallion over Amsterdam's head, grabs a steel cross, and marches out of his cave with Amsterdam. They walk past people making and finishing weapons, including a woman with clawed gloves named Hellcat Maggie. Vallon, his son, and the rest take communion as they continue exiting the caves. They finally reach the top level of an old brewery. They stop and Vallon asks a man named Monk if he will join them. Monk says he'll fight for pay. Vallon promises him ten dollars for every \\"new notch\\" on his club, so Monk agrees, picks up his wooden club, and kicks open the door, revealing a snow-covered intersection known as Paradise Square, the Five Points of Lower Manhattan.Vallon and his crew, the Dead Rabbits, leave the brewery and make their way onto the street. Amsterdam runs to join children on the steps of a nearby building, while the Dead Rabbits await the arrival of the Natives. A few moments later, men dressed in blue, The Natives, led by Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis), a ruthless New Yorker with a glass eye, walk onto the street, clearly outnumbering the Rabbits. Bill says that the ensuing fight will decide who holds the rule of the Five Points; Bill's mob who are Protestant or Vallon's Catholics. Vallon recants that it's a free country, that he and his immigrant crowd have been harassed incessantly by Bill and his men. The Rabbits are then joined by several other gangs that have allied themselves with Vallon, greatly increasing their numbers.Moments later, they begin fighting.

Summarize this article: For regular verbs ending in -er, you form the past participle by removing the -er ending and instead using an é. For example, the past participle of parler (to speak) is parlé. For regular verbs ending in -ir, you don't have to remove the entire ending. Just remove the r so that the verb ends with an i. For example, the past participle of the verb choisir (to choose) is choisi. If you have a regular French verb ending in -re, you simply remove the -re ending and replace it with a u to form the past participle. For example, the past participle of vendre (to sell) is vendu. Just as in English, French has a number of irregular verbs that may have endings similar to regular verbs, but are conjugated differently. Their past participles tend to be irregular as well, so you just have to memorize them as you come across them. In some cases you can find patterns. For example, most irregular verbs that end in -oir have a past participle that ends in u. The past participle of \\"voir\\" (to see) is \\"vu;\\" the past participle of \\"vouloir\\" (to want or to wish) is \\"voulu.\\" Most irregular verbs that end in -re have a past participle that ends in -is. For example, the past participle of \\"comprendre\\" (to understand) is \\"compris;\\" the past participle of \\"apprendre\\" (to learn) is \\"appris.\\"","completion":"The article provides an overview of how to form past participles in French for regular and irregular verbs. For regular verbs, the process depends on the verb's ending (-er, -ir, or -re). For regular -er verbs, one must remove the -er ending and replace it with an é. An example provided is the verb \\"parler\\" (to speak) which becomes \\"parlé\\" in its past participle form. In the case of regular -ir verbs, the process is slightly different, as one only removes the \\"r\\" while retaining the \\"i.\\" An example is \\"choisir\\" (to choose), which turns into \\"choisi.\\" For regular -re verbs, the formation of past participles involves removing the -re ending and replacing it with a \\"u.\\" The article uses \\"vendre\\" (to sell) as an example, which becomes \\"vendu.\\" However, irregular verbs do not follow these same patterns and can have different endings, which can sometimes resemble regular verb endings. Because of their irregular nature, their past participles are also irregular and require memorization. Despite the irregularity, the article points out that some patterns can be observed among irregular verbs. For instance, irregular verbs that end in -oir typically have past participles ending in \\"u,\\" such as \\"voir\\" (to see), which becomes \\"vu,\\" and \\"vouloir\\" (to want or wish), which becomes \\"voulu.\\" Additionally, most irregular -re verbs have past participles ending in -is, like \\"comprendre\\" (to understand), transforming into \\"compris,\\" and \\"apprendre\\" (to learn), becoming \\"appris.\\" In summary, the article describes the processes to form past participles in French for both regular and irregular verbs, highlighting the different patterns depending on the verb endings.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that painted Albrecht the Elder's panel? ? Albrecht the Elder was 62 or 63 when his panel was painted early in 1490. Barbara's portrait may have been completed soon after, when she would have been around 39. Their son was around 18 and had just completed his apprenticeship with Michael Wolgemut, and would soon leave for Nuremberg to travel as a journeyman painter. The father panel was painted first; for aesthetic reasons Dürer may have waited a year or two until his mother looked older.The sitters are presented in three-quarter view before flat, nondescript lacquer-like green backgrounds, which although lushly coloured, are thinly layered. Each has a white ground and light red imprimatura with lead content. The sitter's form and pose echo and in many ways counterbalance each other. Brand Philip draws attention to the similarities of the panels' linear construction, especially the manner in which the folds and lines of their clothing form triangular shapes. The train of Barbara's headdress across her chest corresponds with the opening of Albrecht's fur-lined coat. It was more usual in pendant portraits of this type for the male to be on the left-hand side; the positioning here may be an indication that Dürer originally intended his father's panel to stand alone, given that Barbara's was painted some time later.Albrecht the Elder's panel is regarded as the superior of the two works. This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments of male and female portraits; men were allowed more individuality, while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and were not as daring, for example showing evidence of ageing. In either case, the father painting is far more closely detailed, especially in the lining of clothing, which is summary in Barbara's panel, compared to the long seam of her husband's gown. This contrast in detail can also be seen in the treatment of the rosaries, which are given prominence and a glowing red colour in his panel, but are small and relegated in hers.Albrecht the Elder's panel is usually, but not always, thought to... The answer is:","completion":"Albrecht Dürer is the name of the person who painted Albrecht the Elder's panel.

The answer is:","completion":"The given review would likely increase the chances of you buying the product. The reviewer highlights the product's effectiveness in glowing both indoors and outdoors, and mentions that it lasts for 20-30 minutes after being exposed to light. Additionally, the review points out the increased visibility of the cat to oncoming drivers - which contributes to safety - and the ease of locating the cat.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the solution? Solve 0 = -561*a + 560*a for a.","completion":"To solve the given equation, 0 = -561*a + 560*a for the variable 'a', follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on one side of the equation. Since both terms on the right-hand side of the equation contain 'a', you can combine them by adding the coefficients of each term together. 0 = -561*a + 560*a Step 2: Add the coefficients of the terms containing 'a'. The equation now becomes: 0 = (-561 + 560)*a Computing the value of the sum (-561 + 560): -561 + 560 = -1 So the equation now is: 0 = -1*a Step 3: Solve for 'a'. To find the value of 'a', divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of 'a' which is -1. 0 / -1 = (-1*a) / -1 0 = a The solution to the equation 0 = -561*a + 560*a is a = 0."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A letter to Father Christmas dating back nearly a century has been found lodged in the chimney of a boarding school where it was sent by an enthusiastic young girl. The flame-singed note, written by a schoolgirl called Haly, asks Santa for a copy of a novel and a new dress, and was apparently sent in or shortly after 1922. It was found lodged inside a chimney at Haberdashers' Monmouth School for Girls, in South Wales, by a caretaker who was clearing out the fireplace after raven chicks had been nesting in it. Discovery: A century-old letter to Father Christmas has been found in a chimney at Haberdashers' Monmouth School for Girls by caretaker Andy Beddoes, pictured with a group of pupils. The letter was initially almost illegible because of the damage caused by exposure to years of smoke, but after it was restored it could be read once again. It was addressed to 'Daddy Xmas', and read in full: 'Dear Father Christmas, are you coming to see me again in two weeks' time I suppose? 'Tell Mummy I want a book, Tell England, and an evening dress. Love, Haly H XXX'. Tell England, a novel about the First World War by Ernest Raymond, was published in 1922 - leading school officials to assume that the letter is likely to have been written soon afterwards. Haly was probably around 10 or 11 years old at the time of the letter, because the bulding where it was found has always been a boarding house for girls of that age. Illegible: But the letter from a girl called Haly H could eventually be deciphered after it was restored. School caretaker Andy Beddoes found the note in October when he was vacuuming inside the chimney and realised there was something resting on a ledge. 'I pulled it out and saw it was a folded bit of paper and because I’m curious, I tried to read it,' he said. 'I could see \\"Dear Father Christmas\\" and the dress bit but that was all. It's a lot cleaner now but you still can't find a date on it. 'I was just surprised really that it hadn't been destroyed. I found it tucked up on the top ledge - it's quite a lucky find.' Delight: Pupils at the school have been trying to check up other chimneys to see if there's anything inside. Housemistress Liz Price said that the pupils had been trying to explore other chimneys in the school to see what treasures might be hidden inside. 'The girls were so excited about the letter,' she said. 'I think reading something like this makes them appreciate what they have more. 'You can tell them until you're blue in the face about how people in the old days didn't have as much as they do today, but actually reading this letter and seeing that all the girl asked for was a book and a dress made it more real.' Haberdashers' Monmouth School for Girls was founded in 1892, and moved to its present site in the town of Monmouth, near the border between England and Wales, five years later. The school accepts girls between the ages of seven and 18, with fees of nearly £26,000 a year for boarders.

Joel had been studying the language for a shorter amount of time.;","completion":"To determine the correct ending for the given sentence, let's analyze both options: I. Joseph had been studying the language for a shorter amount of time. This option suggests that despite studying German for a shorter period, Joseph still managed to gain a better command of the language compared to Joel. However, it would generally be expected that a longer study period would result in a better understanding of the language, making this option less likely. II. Joel had been studying the language for a shorter amount of time. This option states that Joel studied German for a shorter period than Joseph, which supports the fact that Joseph is better at the language due to more extended learning time. This option aligns more with the general expectation that more time spent studying would result in better proficiency.

The road ends at a tunnel leading to an abandoned theme park. It gives Chihiro the creeps, but her parents persuade her to go in with them and look around.After wandering across a grassy landscape and a dry riverbed, they climb a stone staircase and come to a street lined with restaurants and shops. Most are deserted, but the aroma of cooking leads them to the one restaurant that's well stocked with food -- though it's mysteriously deserted. Mom and Dad are hungry and start eating, despite Chihiro's objections. The food is delicious, and Chihiro wanders away to explore while they eat. She finds a towering, ornate building that she recognizes as a bathhouse (a spa resort); there's a train track running under it.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, if the dishes are only lightly soiled, it may have a direct effect on the dishwasher's cleaning performance as well as indirect effects on the overall process. Step-by-step process with justifications: 1. Rinse the dishes before placing them in a dishwasher - This step is particularly important if the dishes are only lightly soiled since pre-rinsing can help remove any loose food particles that may not be effectively cleaned by the dishwasher. 2. Load glasses and plastic wear on the top rack - This step remains the same, as it is essential to ensure that these more delicate items are not damaged during the washing cycle. 3. Put plates, bowls, pots, and pans on the bottom rack - This step also remains the same, as heavier items should still be placed on the bottom rack for stability and adequate cleaning. 4. Place all the utensils in the utensil basket - This step stays the same, as the utensil basket is designed to hold and clean individual utensils properly. 5. Put detergent into the detergent holder - In the case of lightly soiled dishes, you may consider using less detergent than for heavily soiled dishes. This will ensure adequate cleaning without overusing detergent. 6. Close the door and push the start button - This step remains unchanged, as it is necessary to initiate the dishwasher's cleaning cycle. 7. Perturbation hypothesis - If the dishes were only lightly soiled and the dishwasher wasn't cleaning them properly, the effect on the process would be that you may need to modify your pre-rinsing or detergent usage. You might also want to check the dishwasher settings to ensure you are using the appropriate cycle for lightly soiled dishes. Some dishwashers have an \\"eco\\" or \\"light\\" cycle specifically designed for this. So, while the supposed perturbation of having lightly soiled dishes can have both direct and indirect effects on the dishwasher's cleaning efficiency, these effects can be managed and mitigated by adjusting the pre-rinsing, detergent usage, and selecting the appropriate washing cycle. This will maximize the dishwasher's performance and energy conservation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Write highlights for this article: Roberto Martinez is confident Everton have finally resolved the hamstring issue that has ruined James McCarthy’s season. The Republic of Ireland midfielder had been Everton’s outstanding performer but he has spent much of the past two months on the sidelines. He missed six games after being injured in a Europa League tie in Wolfsburg on November 27 but then returned for two matches against Stoke and Newcastle but was substituted in both. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Premier League preview: Everton vs Manchester City. Roberto Martinez is confident Everton have got to the bottom of James McCarthy's recent injury troubles. McCarthy has subsequently been ruled out of the defeat by Hull on New Year’s Day and the 1-1 draw with West Ham in the FA Cup and is unlikely to figure against Manchester City on Saturday. Martinez, though, is satisfied that they have got to the bottom of the problem and he is predicting McCarthy will not be troubled by such injuries in the future. Martinez said: ‘James is developing well. We need to make sure when he comes back he is 100 per cent ready for the second half of the season. It is making sure over the next three or four weeks we get everyone fit and ready. McCarthy, pictured during the Merseyside derby, played against Stoke and Newcastle but had to be replaced. ‘We have got to the bottom of it and it will help him for the rest of his career. We have looked at his nutrition and how he recovers. He is a very peculiar profile of a midfielder as he is more of a sprinter. Midfielders are usually about stamina. ‘But James is a sprinter and those players need extra care. I think we have got to the bottom of it and now we have to make sure we manage it. I am sure when he will be back, he will be back for good.' Everton have not won since December 15 but manager Martinez is looking forward to taking on Man City. Everton have not won since December 15 but Martinez has no fear about facing Manchester City. Martinez said: ‘We are looking forward to every game. We have strong characters and bravery. You see the players wanting to get on the ball and to be brave. Man City is the only game that matters, it is going to be a glamorous occasion and we want to show our best form. ‘A real determination of wanting to succeed. We defended well and we did not accept it was going to go away. That pleased me more than anything. The winning mentality is very strong and now we have to be at our very best to get something against City.’ Highlights:","completion":"1.

Mystery US amnesia woman not an Australian Ashley Menatta was a free spirit who wandered the globe, including making regular trips to Australia. Over the decades it wasn't odd for her to lose contact with family members for long periods. That's why when she was discovered on February 1 with amnesia, no identification and stricken with cancer on a street corner near San Diego, in southern California, there were few clues and no missing persons reports to help identify her. Doctors diagnosed her with stage-three cancer, removed a volleyball-sized tumour from her ovary and were also forced to take out her uterus and other organs. For six months she relied on nursing staff and other strangers for help as she underwent chemotherapy, not knowing who she was and fearing she would die before the mystery was solved. She gave herself the name Sam, inspired by the biblical story of Samuel. One of the few comforts were dreams and faint memories of swimming and dining at Perth's Cottesloe Beach, Bondi and Byron Bay. Through social media, the mystery was solved on Wednesday. \\"Well, we have some great news,\\" Ms Menatta and the supporters who set up a Facebook page to help the search announced to the thousands of people across the globe who united to help. The FBI credited social media for solving the puzzle. A nephew of Ms Menatta's saw an online story on Wednesday about the woman known as Sam, recognised her photo and checked with family members. They contacted police who then alerted the FBI. The FBI put the family members in contact with Ms Menatta. \\"They were able to have some private communications amongst themselves and based on that she is self-identifying herself as Ashley Menatta,\\" FBI special agent Darrell Foxworth told AAP. With her dreams and fondness for Australia, as well as a hybrid Australian-British-American accent, many thought she may have been Australian. But she is a well-travelled American who was living near San Diego, not far from where she was found. The 53-year-old was born in Pennsylvania, never married, had lived in Arizona and has sisters in Colorado and Maryland. Her family lost track of her in 2013, around the same time she moved to southern California. \\"It was extremely emotional, we were all sobbing,\\" Ms Menatta, recalling the moment she was told her identity, told San Diego's NBC7 TV station. \\"They're so sorry I had to go through what I did during this time without them.\\" Ms Menatta will live with her sister in Maryland. Her sisters told her she was a regular visitor to Australia on \\"extended trips\\". \\"I've been going there throughout my life, she said. Do you have any news photos or videos?

You may find one through telephone book listings, advertisements, or through friends who have contacts with one. Select an artist who does work similar to what you want.","completion":"After identifying a suitable artist whose style aligns with your vision, the next step is to initiate communication and establish a relationship with the artist. Reach out to them via email, phone call, or through any available social media platforms. Introduce yourself, explain your purpose for contacting them, and give a brief overview of the project for which you require their services. Make sure to inquire about their availability and willingness to take on such a project. Upon receiving a positive response from the artist, arrange a more in-depth discussion about your illustration needs. This can take place through video calls, face-to-face meetings if possible, or even through detailed email correspondence. In this conversation, try to be as clear and precise as possible about your expectations. Provide the artist with details such as the desired style, the specific elements you want to be included, the color palette, the dimensions or proportions, and any other relevant factors. It is also imperative to discuss the timeframe for the project. Provide the artist with a deadline and mutually agree upon a reasonable timeline for the completion of the illustrations. Remember that artists may have multiple projects ongoing simultaneously, so be prepared to offer some flexibility when discussing deadlines. Next, negotiate the terms of payment with the artist. Freelance artists usually charge per illustration or may have a package rate for a specific number of illustrations or a project. Understand their fee structure, discuss your budget and settle on an appropriate price that works for both parties. It is also important to address the terms of payment, such as whether a deposit is required upfront or if the payment will be made in installments as each milestone is reached. Once you have agreed on the specifics and established trust, put the terms of your agreement in writing. Draft a contract outlining the terms of the project, including the scope of work, the deadlines, payment details, and any other clauses decided on during negotiation. This contract will serve as a legally binding document that protects both parties in case of any misunderstandings or disputes. During the creative process, establish a clear line of communication with the artist so they can ask for clarifications, and you can provide feedback on their progress. Make sure you are respectful of their creative process, and avoid micromanaging. Offer constructive criticism and be mindful of the artist's time and effort when requesting revisions. Upon completion of the illustrations and receipt of payment, don't forget to discuss their copyrights and usage rights with the artist. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to use the illustrations for your intended purpose. Finally, maintain a good rapport with the artist, as you never know when you may need their services again in the future. In summary, ordering illustrations from a freelance artist entails locating a suitable artist, having in-depth discussions about your expectations, agreeing on deadlines and payment terms, drafting a contract, maintaining open communication during the creative process, and addressing the issue of copyrights and usage rights upon completion of the project. By following these steps, you can create a productive relationship with a talented freelance artist and secure the illustrations that best fit your project's vision."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

The Netherlands is famous for its tulips, windmills, and wooden clogs, as well as its rich history in arts and science. The capital city is Amsterdam, while the seat of government is located in The Hague. The Netherlands also has a constitutional monarchy, with King Willem-Alexander as the current reigning monarch. Although Denmark and the Netherlands are separate countries, their close ties stem from their shared history as trading nations in the North and Baltic Sea regions. They are also both members of NATO and the European Union and have participated in a variety of initiatives and exchanges within those organizations. As you mentioned in your summary, both countries have embassies in each other's capital city, and members of their respective royal families have received honors and recognition from one another. In conclusion, Denmark and the Netherlands are not the same country, but they do have a friendly and close relationship as evidenced by their diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties. Both countries have their own unique governmental systems and national identity, as well as a shared history as significant trading powers in Europe."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize the following: Place the bank behind you so no one can reach it. This will make them give you the money first. Every so often, instead of putting the money in the bank, slip it underneath you. Then, secretly take it out, and put it in your stash of money. Alternatively, you could take money from another Monopoly game and slowly add it to the pile throughout the game when no one is looking. However, be sure to mark these to distinguish it between the other notes. If you know that you will be playing Monopoly in a few hours, get to the game box, and slip out a bill from each denomination. Then, put the game back, and keep the money to use for the game. During the game, you can add the bills to your money pile, and no one will ever know. Make sure that you keep your money pile messy when you add to it, so that it is not obvious that you have an extra 500 bill. That is the bill that people may notice more easily. Any chance you have to steal a few bills from the bank, or from another player, take it. Act like you are busy on your phone, or distracted with something other than the game right after you do it to deter any suspicion. Instead of keeping your money organized, and neatly piled by denomination, keep it all together, and out of order. It is common for players to want to keep their money nice and orderly, but if you leave it messy, it will be easier to steal some money occasionally. Summary:","completion":"The text describes various underhanded strategies to amass a larger sum of money during a game of Monopoly. Some tactics include manipulating the location of the bank, clandestinely slipping money underneath your seat, adding money from another Monopoly game, and pilfering a few bills from each denomination ahead of time.

Write highlights for this article: Norwich produced an astonishing second-half fightback to stun Cardiff and claim a 4-2 victory at Cardiff City Stadium. The Canaries, unbeaten since their opening day defeat at Wolves, were awful during the first half and deservedly trailed to goals from Joe Ralls and Aron Gunnarsson. But quickfire strikes from Martin Olsson and Wes Hoolahan levelled matters early in the second half, before Michael Turner and substitute Cameron Jerome finished the job. Norwich's second-half fightback saw the Canaries claw back from a two-goal deficit to win 4-2. Four goals in Norwich's second-half fightback saw the Canaries win 4-2 against Cardiff City. Cardiff: Marshall, Brayford, Connolly, Morrison, Fabio (John 46), Ralls, Gunnarsson, Whittingham, Pilkington (Adeyemi 69), Jones (Maynard 69), Macheda. Subs (not used): Cala, Le Fondre, Moller Daehli, Moore. Bookings: Ralls. Goals: Ralls (4), Gunnarsson (22) Norwich: Ruddy, Martin, Turner, Hooiveld, Olsson, Tettey, Johnson, Lafferty (Jerome 46), Hoolahan (O'Neil 84), Redmond (Garrido 88), Grabban. Subs (not used): Odjidja-Ofoe, Whittaker, Murphy, Rudd,. Bookings: Lafferty, Turner. Goals: Olsson (54), Hoolahan (58), Turner (71), Jerome (87) Such an outcome had looked highly unlikely as Cardiff, challenged to prove their Championship title credentials by manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, raced out of the traps. Inside a minute Kenwyne Jones had seen his goalwards glancing header hacked clear, but there was no reprieve for Norwich in the fourth minute. Ralls seized on Turner's loose pass and drove beyond Alex Tettey to send a left-footed drive into the bottom corner. It was the young midfielder's second league goal for the Bluebirds, almost three years after his first. The visitors were all at sea although Kyle Lafferty almost levelled with a curling strike which David Marshall did well to punch away to safety. Norwich fell further behind in the 22nd minute. Jones played in Anthony Pilkington down the right, and his cross was expertly tucked home by Gunnarsson. Having dominated the opening half an hour Cardiff sowed the seeds of their own downfall by surrendering the initiative during the final 15 minutes of the half and, aside from one excellent John Ruddy stop to deny Federico Macheda's volley, they were not to regain it. Cardiff's Aron Gunnarsson doubles Cardiff's lead in the first half as Norwich struggled to get a foothold. Cardiff's Aron Gunnarsson runs away in celebration after doubling Cardiff's lead over a frustrated Norwich side. Cardiff's Aron Gunnarsson is joined by Anthony Pilkington as the pair celebrate going 2-0 up. Cardiff let their 2-0 lead from the first half slip as a disastrous second 45 minutes saw Norwich net four times. The loss of Fabio to injury weakened the left-side of the Cardiff defence, with Declan John on in his place, and Norwich took full advantage. Firstly Hoolahan was given far too much room to get a ball into Lewis Grabban in the 54th minute. The in-form striker could not turn Sean Morrison but the ball fell kindly for Olsson to slot home from close range, on the Swede's return to the side after his ban for pushing referee Simon Hooper. Four minutes later Norwich were level. Nathan Redmond evaded Ralls and John to deliver a pinpoint cross for Jerome to power a header straight at Marshall, who could do nothing as Hoolahan gleefully dispatched the follow-up. Cardiff were rocked and they fell behind with 19 minutes to play. Tettey found space down the Norwich right and Russell Martin's mis-hit shot was turned in by Turner as Marshall appealed in vain for offside. The Bluebirds responded with Whittingham twice working Ruddy, and Turner being fortunate to only receive a booking after bringing down Nicky Maynard with the substitute through on goal. But former Cardiff striker Cameron Jerome put the result beyond doubt three minutes from time. Splintering the hosts' offside trap to round Marshall before tucking home. Neil Adams celebrates Norwich's 4-2 win at the end of the game after clawing back from 2-0 down at half time. Highlights:","completion":"In a soccer game, Norwich had an amazing comeback in the second half to win 4-2 against Cardiff. In the beginning, Cardiff was winning with two goals by Joe Ralls and Aron Gunnarsson. However, Norwich players, Martin Olsson, Wes Hoolahan, Michael Turner, and Cameron Jerome, each scored a goal in the second half, making Norwich win the game!

Growing up on a farm near St. Paul, L. Mark Bailey didn't dream of becoming a judge. Even when he graduated from North Decatur High School in 1975, sitting on the bench someday seemed more like a leisurely activity than a career. Somewhere along the line, all of that changed.

After several years of private practice from 1982-90, he became the judge of Decatur County Court for a year. The Indiana legislature renamed that judgeship and Bailey was tabbed Decatur Superior Court judge from 1992-98, winning reelection twice. From there, his career continued on the fast track and Bailey was appointed by Gov. Frank O'Bannon to sit on the Indiana Court of Appeals First District, where he works today. Despite his quick climb up the legal ladder, Bailey has always found time to help out in causes he feels strongly about. It was for his dedication to the law and the people that are affected by it that he was recently recognized. The Indiana Pro Bono Commission hosted its annual celebration event, the Randall T. Shepard Dinner, at French Lick Springs Spa in October. More than 100 judges, lawyers and dignitaries were present for the gathering. One of the highlights of the event was the presentation of the first-ever Randall T. Shepard award for excellence in pro bono work.

Solve this instance: Background Paragraph: Collision theory tells us that molecules need to collide in order for a reaction to take place. All else being equal, anything that increases the frequency of collisions would also increase the rate of reaction. One way to do this is to increase the concentrations of one or more of the reactants. Using a real world example, a busy freeway will experience much more frequent car collisions than a fairly empty neighborhood street. Similarly, forcing more randomly moving molecules into the same amount of space will cause an increased number of collisions over a given length of time, providing the reactants with more opportunities to transform into products. Story: Rob wanted to learn more about collision theory. For that, he conducted two tests, test A and test B. In test A he used lower concentration of reactants. In test B he used higher concentration of reactants. Now, he needs to know about the science behind these tests.

Shortly after, the Iron Giant wanders off into the mainland. Nine-year-old Hogarth Hughes follows a trail of the forest's destruction and frees the robot, who is stuck in the power cables of an electrical substation. After being rescued by and befriended by Hogarth, the Giant follows him back to his house, where he lives with his widowed mother Annie. Upon their return, the Giant attempts to eat the rails off the ties of the nearby railroad tracks. Alarmed by the sound of an oncoming train, Hogarth tells the giant to repair the tracks. The Giant attempts this, but takes too long, causing the train to collide with his head. Hogarth hides the damaged robot in their barn where he discovers the robot is self repairing.Later that night, Hogarth returns to the barn with a stack of comic books to read to the Giant. The Giant is impressed with Superman, but distressed when he discovers a comic about an evil robot; Hogarth tells the Giant that he can be \\"who you choose to be\\". Investigating the destroyed substation, U.S. government agent Kent Mansley discovers evidence of the Giant and decides to continue his inquiries in nearby Rockwell. Finding a BB gun Hogarth left near the substation the night he found the Giant, Mansley takes up a room for rent at Hogarth's home and trails the boy to learn more. He is paranoid about an alien invasion and alerts the U.S. Army to the possible presence of the Giant. Worried that they will get caught, Hogarth evades Mansley and takes the Giant to beatnik artist Dean McCoppin, who passes off the robot as one of his works of scrap-metal art when Mansley and Lieutenant General Guy Rogard investigate. Once Mansley and Rogard are gone, Hogarth plays with the Giant using a toy gun, but inadvertently causes the Giant to activate a defence mechanism.

A:","completion":"After reading the given review, it appears that the chances of buying the product would likely decrease. Several factors from the review contribute to this decision: 1. The review title, \\"Unexpected disappointment,\\" immediately sets a negative tone, indicating that the reviewer had high hopes for the book but ultimately was let down. 2. The reviewer mentions difficulty in following the characters. This could indicate a lack of proper development or character depth, making it challenging for a reader to engage with and understand the personalities and motivations of the protagonists. 3. The hero and heroine's relationship is described as unconvincing in terms of love and romance. A strong, believable connection between these central characters is often crucial in novels focusing on relationships, and this lack of chemistry could affect a reader's satisfaction with the overall story. 4. The reviewer requests \\"more involvement or romance between the couple,\\" which may signal that the book's romantic aspects were unsatisfactory or disappointingly scarce.

Is it possible to conclude that \\"A person is holding two newborn puppies.\\" if \\"A person choosing which puppy they want.\\"?","completion":"To conclude that \\"A person is holding two newborn puppies\\" based on the statement \\"A person is choosing which puppy they want,\\" one must consider the context, clues, and assumptions that can be drawn from the given statement. It is not necessarily guaranteed that the person is holding two newborn puppies based on the given statement; however, certain scenarios could suggest this possibility. Let's analyze the factors that influence this conclusion: 1. Context: If the statement is made in a context where the person is at a pet store or an animal shelter, it increases the likelihood that the individual is selecting a puppy to adopt or purchase. This context, however, still doesn't assure that they are holding two newborn puppies. 2. Clues: The statement itself doesn't provide any direct clues about the person holding the puppies. It only implies that they are making a decision between two options. The puppies could be within their sight or separate from them, and not necessarily in their hands. 3. Assumptions: One could assume that, in order to make a choice between the puppies, the person might want to hold them to compare factors such as size, temperament, and overall health. In this case, it would be a reasonable assumption that the person could be holding the puppies to evaluate them closely. Still, this assumption doesn't provide definitive proof that the person is holding the newborn puppies. 4. Alternative scenarios: There are scenarios where the person could be choosing which puppy they want without holding them. For example, they could be observing them from a distance, perhaps behind a glass wall, or even making their decision based on pictures or videos. In these cases, the conclusion that the person is holding two newborn puppies would be incorrect. 5. Interpretation: The given statement could be interpreted differently by different individuals. Some might envision the person holding and interacting with the puppies while making their decision, while others may imagine the person observing the puppies from a distance. The interpretation of the statement may influence the conclusion one draws from it. In conclusion, it is not possible to definitively conclude that \\"A person is holding two newborn puppies\\" based solely on the statement \\"A person is choosing which puppy they want.\\" There are numerous factors that shade the interpretation of this statement, and alternative scenarios exist in which the person may not hold the puppies while making their decision. One might assume that the person could be holding the puppies to evaluate them closely, but this assumption does not provide a solid foundation for the conclusion."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: Bob Clampett's 'An Itch in Time' milks seven minutes of crazy action out of a very small premise. Elmer Fudd tells his dog that if he scratches himself just once more that he will be given a dreaded bath. Unfortunately for the dog, a relentless flea makes it all but impossible to stop from scratching. The cartoon switches between the flea's progress inside the dog's fur and the dog's desperate attempts to cope with it. In a great sequence that really captures the frustration of an itch that can't be scratched, the dog changes colour from brown to blue to red to polka dotted to plaid! It sounds ludicrously surreal but it perfectly evokes the indescribable feeling of an itch in a way only Clampett could. There are several other elements which make 'An Itch in Time' pure Clampett. There's the grotesque concept itself, which leads to some graphic scenes of the flea munching on the dog's flesh. There's the unrestrained violence that rears its head in any scene featuring the cat. Most notably, there's the dirty jokes including a huge shot of the dog's behind which causes the flea to wolf-whistle and a hysterical sequence in which the dog attempts to scratch himself by dragging his backside along the floor. He momentarily breaks off to address the audience: \\"Hey, I better cut this out. I may get to like it\\"! With a very limited concept, Clampett manages to make 'An Itch in Time' a unique, minutiae-based cartoon. Like an early episode of 'Seinfeld', 'An Itch in Time' is practically about nothing but very funny with it.","completion":"The sentiment of this review is positive and happy!

In October, MacDonald introduced Thomson to Dr. James MacCallum. A frequent visitor to the Ontario Society of Artists' (OSA) exhibitions, MacCallum was admitted to the Arts and Letters Club in January 1912. There, he met artists such as John William Beatty, Arthur Heming, MacDonald and Harris. MacCallum eventually persuaded Thomson to leave Rous and Mann and start a painting career. In October 1913, MacCallum introduced Thomson to A. Y. Jackson, later a founder of the Group of Seven. MacCallum recognized Thomson's and Jackson's talents and offered to cover their expenses for one year if they committed themselves to painting full time. MacCallum and Jackson both encouraged Thomson to \\"take up painting seriously, [but] he showed no enthusiasm. The chances of earning a livelihood by it did not appear to him promising. He was sensitive and independent, and feared he might become an object of patronage.\\" MacCallum wrote that when he first saw Thomson's sketches, he recognized their \\"truthfulness, their feeling and their sympathy with the grim fascinating northland ... they made me feel that the North had gripped Thomson as it had gripped me since I was eleven when I first sailed and paddled through its silent places.\\" He described Thomson's paintings as \\"dark, muddy in colour, tight and not wanting in technical defects\\".

American Airlines Flight 11: FAA Awareness. Although the Boston Center air traffic controller realized at an early stage that there was something wrong with American 11, he did not immediately interpret the plane's failure to respond as a sign that it had been hijacked. At 8:14, when the flight failed to heed his instruction to climb to 35,000 feet, the controller repeatedly tried to raise the flight. He reached out to the pilot on the emergency frequency. Though there was no response, he kept trying to contact the aircraft. At 8:21, American 11 turned off its transponder, immediately degrading the information available about the aircraft. The controller told his supervisor that he thought something was seriously wrong with the plane, although neither suspected a hijacking. The supervisor instructed the controller to follow standard procedures for handling a \\"no radio\\" aircraft. The controller checked to see if American Airlines could establish communication with American 11. He became even more concerned as its route changed, moving into another sector's airspace. Controllers immediately began to move aircraft out of its path, and asked other aircraft in the vicinity to look for American 11. At 8:24:38, the following transmission came from American 11: American 11: We have some planes. Just stay quiet, and you'll be okay. We are returning to the airport. The controller only heard something unintelligible; he did not hear the specific words \\"we have some planes.\\" The next transmission came seconds later: American 11: Nobody move.

We have the equation: 18*p + 31*p - 2670 = -40*p First, let's add the \\"p\\" terms on the left side of the equation: (18*p + 31*p) which is equal to 49*p: So, the equation becomes: 49*p - 2670 = -40*p Now, we need to move the -40*p from the right side to the left side. We do that by adding 40*p to both sides of the equation: 49*p - 2670 + 40*p = -40*p + 40*p This simplifies to: 89*p - 2670 = 0 Next, we need to get \\"p\\" all by itself.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] I am facing a new situation today: The fruit harvest was awesome this year, so Mary decided to experiment by candying some raspberries, apricots and apples. She didn't candy plums, raspberries and pears though. the candied fruit lasted longer, preserved their aroma and tasted delicious. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which of Mary's fruit are saturated with sugar, apples or plums? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, the fruit that is saturated with sugar in Mary's case would be the apples. Mary decided to candy raspberries, apricots, and apples, which involves placing the fruit in heated sugar syrup. The syrup absorbs the moisture from within the fruit, ultimately preserving and saturating it with sugar. This process helps maintain the fruit's quality for a year, as well as preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms. Since Mary chose not to candy plums, raspberries, and pears, these fruits would not be saturated with sugar. Candied fruit, also referred to as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has a long history dating back to the 14th century. The preservation technique typically involves using whole fruit, smaller pieces, or peels that are immersed in heated sugar syrup. Depending on the type and size of the fruit, the preservation process can take anywhere from a few days to several months. During this time, the sugar syrup replaces the fruit's natural moisture, thereby preserving it and preventing spoilage due to the unwelcoming osmotic pressure created by the sugar saturation. In the new situation, Mary takes advantage of the successful fruit harvest and experiments with candying raspberries, apricots, and apples. As a result, the candied fruit lasts longer, retains its aroma, and tastes delicious. When evaluating the saturation of sugar in apples and plums, it is evident that the apples are the fruit saturated with sugar, considering Mary's choice to candy them using the heated sugar syrup technique. On the other hand, plums were not candied; thus, they are not saturated with sugar."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is customary for Jewish men to wear a yarmulke when attending religious services, studying Torah, or engaging in prayer. Hence, a person might wear his yarmulke when going to a synagogue, as this is the most suitable option among the given choices. A synagogue is a place of worship and community gathering for Jewish people, where they come together to pray, study, and celebrate various religious events and milestones.

The other options provided do not pertain directly to religious observance or Jewish customs: A. Demonstration: While it is possible that a person might choose to wear a yarmulke at a demonstration to express their religious or cultural identity, it is not specifically tied to the event's purpose and is not considered a most suitable option. B. Concert: Similarly, wearing a yarmulke at a concert would not be directly related to the event or indicate any specific religious observance, making it a less suitable choice. C.

It was created to standardize JavaScript, so as to foster multiple independent implementations. ECMAScript has remained the best-known implementation of JavaScript since the standard was first published, with other well-known implementations including JScript and ActionScript. Coders commonly use ECMAScript for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web, and it is increasingly being used for writing server applications and services using Node.js. The ECMAScript specification is a standardized specification of a scripting language developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape; initially it was named Mocha, later LiveScript, and finally JavaScript. In December 1995, Sun Microsystems and Netscape announced JavaScript in a press release. In March 1996, Netscape Navigator 2.0 was released, featuring support for JavaScript. Owing to the widespread success of JavaScript as a client-side scripting language for Web pages, Microsoft developed a compatible dialect of the language, naming it JScript to avoid trademark issues. JScript added new date methods to alleviate the Year 2000 problem caused by the JavaScript methods that were based on the Java \\"Date\\" class. JScript was included in Internet Explorer 3.0, released in August 1996. Netscape delivered JavaScript to Ecma International for standardization and the work on the specification, ECMA-262, began in November 1996. The first edition of ECMA-262 was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly in June 1997. Several editions of the language standard have been published since then. The name \\"ECMAScript\\" was a compromise between the organizations involved in standardizing the language, especially Netscape and Microsoft, whose disputes dominated the early standards sessions.

Movie plot title: Mrs. Miniver Movie plot: Kay Miniver (Greer Garson) and her family live a comfortable life at a house called 'Starlings' in Belham, a fictional village outside London. The house has a large garden, with a private landing stage on the River Thames at which is moored a motorboat belonging to her devoted husband Clem (Walter Pidgeon), a successful architect. They have three children: the youngsters Toby (Christopher Severn) and Judy (Clare Sandars) and an older son Vin (Richard Ney) a student at Oxford University. They have live-in staff: Gladys (Brenda Forbes) the housemaid and Ada (Marie De Becker) the cook. As World War II looms, Vin returns from the university and meets Carol Beldon (Teresa Wright), granddaughter of Lady Beldon (Dame May Whitty) from nearby Beldon Hall. Despite initial disagreementsâmainly contrasting Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences with Carol's practical altruismâthey fall in love. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home, after his younger brother prods him to give a less romantic but more honest proposal. As the war comes closer to home, Vin feels he must \\"do his bit\\" and enlists in the Royal Air Force, qualifying as a fighter pilot. He is posted to a base near to his parents' home and is able to signal his safe return from operations to his parents by cutting his engines briefly as he flies over the house. Together with other boat owners, Clem volunteers to take his motorboat to assist in the Dunkirk evacuation. Early one morning, Kay unable to sleep as Clem is still away, wanders down to the landing stage. She is startled to discover a wounded German pilot (Helmut Dantine) hiding in her garden, and he takes her at gunpoint. Demanding food and a coat, the pilot aggressively asserts that the Third Reich will mercilessly overcome its enemies. She feeds him, calmly disarms him when he collapses, and then calls the police.

Here are possible answers to this question: - go to church - speak to god - praise god - kneel - sincere I believe the correct choice is \\"speak to god\\", here's why: The answer is:","completion":"\\"Speak to God,\\" and here's why: Prayer is a significant aspect of every religious belief, as individuals connect with their higher power, often referred to as God. It serves as an essential way to develop a stronger relationship with the divine, find inner peace, seek guidance, and express gratitude. Prayer is not merely limited to a physical activity, but it encompasses a vast range of actions, such as speaking, listening, contemplating, and meditating. When you pray, even if you are paralyzed, the crucial part of the process is establishing a mental and spiritual connection with God, rather than focusing on physical movements or gestures. Given the available options: 1. Go to church - Although attending church can provide a supportive and spiritual atmosphere for prayer, it isn't the only place to pray. It might also be challenging for someone who is paralyzed to attend a religious gathering. Prayer can occur virtually anywhere and anytime. 2. Speak to God - This response is the most appropriate because it highlights the essence of prayer: connecting with God through dialogue. Even if an individual is paralyzed, they can still speak to God internally, sharing their thoughts, feelings, and aspirations without moving their body. 3. Praise God - Praising God is an essential part of worship and prayer, but it's not the only aspect. Prayer involves confessing one's sins, asking for guidance and help, expressing gratitude, and listening to God's responses. Therefore, this option is limited in its scope and may not fully address the question. 4. Kneel - Kneeling is a traditional posture for prayer but is not mandatory. Given that the question deals with praying while paralyzed, it's essential to consider other forms of prayer that don't require body movement. 5. Sincere - This term refers to the approach one should have during prayer rather than the act of praying itself. While it's crucial to be genuine when praying, sincerity alone doesn't answer the question of what one should do when praying. In conclusion, the most accurate answer to the question \\"What do you do when you pray, even if you are paralyzed?\\" is \\"Speak to God.\\" This option encapsulates the core of prayer, which is establishing a connection to God beyond physical limitations or barriers. Praying, either in silence or verbally, enables one to maintain a spiritual relationship with their higher power, fostering healing, growth, and resilience in the face of adversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Documents found in Roman's house indicate that the money has gone to an offshore account of which he denies any knowledge.Facing serious charges, suspended from the force and rejected by his friends, including Roenick's widow, a frustrated Roman storms into Niebaum's office and, in the chaos that follows, takes him and several others hostage, including his personal assistant Maggie (Fallon), police Commander Grant Frost (Rifkin) and two-bit con-man Rudy Timmons (Giamatti).With the building evacuated and placed under siege by police and FBI, Roman issues his conditions which include finding Roenick's informant and summoning police Lieutenant Chris Sabian (Spacey), another top negotiator.

The announcement comes days before President Donald Trump's new US travel ban comes into effect on Thursday. In a statement, the group said the \\"ability of all our members to equally enter this country is currently uncertain\\". The suspension includes short trips and all travel through US airports. The group has also scrapped a planned summer camping trip to California in favour of a different destination. Sarah Kiriliuk, national manager of marketing and communications for the Girl Guides of Canada, said the decision was \\"absolutely not\\" political but instead an operational decision made over a \\"general uncertainty\\" around Canada-US border travel. \\"Girl Guides is a microcosm of Canada,\\" she said. \\"We're diverse, we're multicultural. I don't want to speak to any one girl or situation, our main priority was making sure our girls who had been planning trips for up to a year sometimes weren't going to be turned away at the border because of one or more situations that were beyond their control.\\" Under the new US travel ban, all nationals from Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen will not be permitted to enter the US or be issued an immigrant or non-immigrant visa for a 90-day period. Ms Kiriliuk could not say how many members might have been barred from US entry under the new temporary ban, if any. \\"At Girl Guides of Canada, we know our members value the safe, inclusive and accepting space that Guiding provides,\\" the statement said. It went on: \\"These values are reflected in all we do, including the Girl Guide travel experiences we offer girls and women. This was a very difficult decision to make. We hope that members will appreciate this reflects our commitment to inclusivity and equal opportunities for all girls and women.\\" The Girl Guides of Canada has chapters in provinces across the country and some 70,000 members and 20,000 adult female volunteers. Any US visits already booked and paid for by regional Girl Guide chapters prior to the announcement would be reviewed on a \\"case-by-case\\" basis, Ms Kiriliuk said. Some Canadian schools have also cancelled trips to the US in the wake of the travel ban, including the Greater Essex County District School Board in south-western Ontario. According to figures provided by US Customs and Border Protection, the number of people being denied entry at the Canada-US boundary is roughly in line with previous years. But confusion during the first few days of the previous US travel ban, which was eventually blocked by a federal court, and a series of recent incidents of Canadians going public with their experience being turned away at the border has led to questions over whether people are facing tougher measures when entering the US.

Air Force Air Rescue Service at Ashiya Air Base, Japan, set out to rescue the survivors of a Japanese ship wrecked in a still-raging storm. As they fly to the site of the wreck, each man recalls a part of his past: Gregg remembers the avalanche caused in Europe when his H-19 Chickasaw helicopter came too close to a mountain. The avalanche subsequently buried alive the group of people whom he was attempting to rescue. The accident has since caused him to fear flying solo. Stevenson, deeply prejudiced against the Japanese, recalls the reason for his hatred: as a civilian pilot in the Philippines prior to World War II, he met and married Caroline Gordon. She and their infant son later died in a Japanese prison camp when they were refused medical supplies which were being saved for Japanese soldiers. Takashima, half-Polish (mother), half-Japanese (father), reminisces about his tragic love affair with Leila, an Algerian girl, when he was an Army paratrooper during World War II. He was unable to stop a bridge from being blown up, a bridge where Leila had run to look for him after learning that his unit was being withdrawn from town. Stevenson, Gregg and Takashima are the crew of the lead aircraft of a flight of two HU-16s dispatched to rescue the Japanese civilians at sea. When one HU-16 air rescue plane crashes while attempting to land in the treacherous seas, Stevenson refuses to jeopardize his plane for Japanese lives. At the last minute, however, he recalls Caroline's dying plea not to hate; he overcomes his prejudice. Takashima volunteered to parachute to the life rafts with rescue equipment. Stevenson and Gregg then land the plane at sea and rescue the survivors, but when Stevenson is injured in the landing, Gregg is forced to overcome his fear and handle the dangerous takeoff and the flight back to Ashiya. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that overcomes his prejudice?, what is it ?

What is the answer??","completion":"To solve the equation -6*p + 5*p - 2 = 0 for p, we will first combine the terms that include the variable p, and then isolate the variable to find its value. First, simplify the equation by combining the coefficients of the variable 'p': (-6 + 5) * p - 2 = 0 This can be simplified to: -1 * p - 2 = 0 Now, we will isolate the variable 'p'. To do this, we must remove the constant term from the equation. In this case, the constant term is -2. To remove it, add 2 to both sides: -1 * p - 2 + 2 = 0 + 2 This simplifies to: -1 * p = 2 Now that we have isolated p within the equation, we can solve for the variable 'p'. In this case, we have a coefficient of -1, so we need to divide by -1 to find the value of 'p': (-1 * p) / (-1) = 2 / (-1) This simplifies to: p = -2 So, the solution to the equation -6*p + 5*p - 2 = 0 is p = -2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This proficiency likely stemmed from more extensive training, practice, and inherent talent, which all contributed to his enhanced ability to consistently hit targets with remarkable precision. (i) One significant reason Craig didn't need to adjust for hand shaking was his exceptional control over his body and muscle movements. Through rigorous training, he had managed to develop impressive muscular strength in his arms and upper body. This allowed him to maintain a stable and continuous aim while holding the rifle, minimizing any involuntary shaking that could impact his performance. Additionally, he had acquired advanced breathing techniques which indirectly contributed to his steadiness. By controlling his breaths and following a pattern of inhaling and exhaling, Craig successfully synchronized his respiratory actions with the natural rhythm of his body, further reducing any potential shakiness in hand. (ii) On the other hand, Jason didn't need to adjust for hand shaking because he had found alternative ways to compensate for his lack of rifle firing skills. While not as proficient as Craig, Jason still managed to achieve reasonable accuracy by relying on various techniques such as using a tripod or other types of supports to provide a stable shooting position. He also experimented with different types of scopes and other attachments that could enhance his targeting and aiming capabilities. However, despite these efforts, Jason was still overshadowed by Craig's superior skills, which originated from his innate talent and dedication to mastering the art of rifle firing.

Step 1: Fluid and waste enter the kidneys. - Grease is not typically present in the bloodstream in large amounts, but if we assume an increase in grease, there might be some effect on fluid and waste entering the kidneys. Step 2: A processing moment in the kidneys let waste and fluid pass. - Grease could potentially alter the filtration process in the kidneys, making it more difficult for waste and fluid to pass through. Step 3: Prevents larger molecules to pass. - If grease is present in large amounts, it could interfere with the kidney's ability to prevent large molecules from passing through the filtration membrane. This might lead to unwanted particles, such as proteins, being lost in the urine. Step 4: Fluid goes back to the bloodstream. - If the presence of grease affects filtration efficiency, then fluid might not be reabsorbed into the bloodstream as efficiently, potentially leading to imbalances in the blood. Step 5: Bad waste is removed. - The presence of grease could affect the kidney's ability to remove waste fully, since the filtration process might not be as efficient.

News article: Review: Pianist Benjamin Grosvenor at Longy School Tuesday CAMBRIDGE — Benjamin Grosvenor called his first recording “This & That,” and that title could have applied to the Celebrity Series recital the 21-year-old British pianist gave Tuesday evening at Longy School of Music. Mendelssohn’s Andante & Rondo capriccioso, Schubert’s G-flat Impromptu, and Schumann’s “Humoreske” were followed, after intermission, by Frederic Mompou’s “Paisajes,” two of Nikolai Medtner’s 38 skazki, Ravel’s “Valses nobles et sentimentales” in the original piano version, and Liszt’s Gounod paraphrase “Valse de Faust.” It was a geographically diverse program, from Catalonia to Russia, of pieces one hardly ever hears, and it attested to Grosvenor’s range. The performance, moreover, attested to his considerable gifts. He possesses a forthright touch, a firm sense of line, a big dynamic range, and a technique that made even the finger-busting Liszt sound like child’s play. What he doesn’t yet have is a distinctive musical personality. The Mendelssohn and the Schubert both received sensitive readings that never made them sound like salon pieces. But they were cautiously shaped, and the Mendelssohn could have been more melting, the Schubert — particularly that glorious opening melody — more rapt. “Humoreske” is one of Schumann’s greatest piano works, and one of his least played. He told his future wife, Clara, that he was “laughing and crying” when he wrote it, and the piece, with its many brief sections, is a challenge to integrate. Here the opening “Einfach” section was careful, almost static, and later “Einfach and zart” was restless rather than simple and tender. Grosvenor did embody the elusive innerness of “Innig,” but the extroverted moments of the piece were earnest and stormy; the eccentric humor of Schumann’s favorite authors, Jean Paul and E.T.A. Hoffmann, escaped him. “Valses nobles et sentimentales” was a bigger disappointment, neither noble nor sentimental but heavy-handed — hammer-like at times — and hard-toned, with little of Ravel’s bittersweet gaiety or charm or wit. At times Grosvenor seemed to be playing the piano rather than the music. And though the programming of Mompou’s three landscape pieces and Medtner’s two folk tales was imaginative, they were little more than pleasant interludes. The Liszt, however, found Grosvenor in his element, thumping out the waltz, skipping and sighing, tossing off pearly scales and trills and rippling glissandos. It made me wish he had programmed Liszt’s B-minor Sonata. As encores, he offered the Godowsky arrangement of Isaac Albéniz’s “Tango” and Morton Gould’s “Boogie Woogie Etude.” There’s no question about his ability to play the piano, or to entertain. Perhaps for a 21-year-old that’s enough. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The most important parts of this news article are as follows: 1.

He occasionally sang lead vocals, usually for one song on an album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\" and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s. - A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music. Ballads derive from the medieval French \\"chanson balladée\\" or \\"ballade\\", which were originally \\"danced songs\\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa. Ballads are 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables. - The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s. - Skiffle is a music genre with jazz, blues, folk and American folk influences, usually using homemade or improvised instruments. Originating as a term in the United States in the first half of the 20th century, it became popular again in the UK in the 1950s, where it was associated with artists such as Lonnie Donegan, The Vipers Skiffle Group, Ken Colyer and Chas McDevitt. Skiffle played a major part in beginning the careers of later eminent jazz, pop, blues, folk and rock musicians and has been seen as a critical stepping stone to the second British folk revival, blues boom and British Invasion of the US popular music scene. - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards. - George Harrison, (25 February 1943 29 November 2001) was an English guitarist, singer, songwriter, and music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Often referred to as \\"the quiet Beatle\\", Harrison embraced Hindu mythology and helped broaden the horizons of his fellow Beatles as well as their Western audience by incorporating Indian instrumentation in their music. Although most of the Beatles' songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \\"Taxman\\", \\"Within You Without You\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"Something\\", the last of which became the Beatles' second-most covered song. - Liverpool, in North West England, is a major city and metropolitan borough with an estimated population of 478,580 in 2015 within the City of Liverpool. Liverpool and its surrounding areas form the fifth largest metropolitan area in the UK, with an estimated population of over 2.24 million in 2011. The local authority is Liverpool City Council, which is the most populous local government district within the metropolitan county of Merseyside and the largest within the Liverpool City Region. - Sir James Paul McCartney, (born 18 June 1942) is an English singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and composer. With John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, he gained worldwide fame with the rock band the Beatles, largely considered the most popular and influential group in the history of pop music. His songwriting partnership with Lennon is the most celebrated of the post-war era. After the band's break-up, he pursued a solo career and formed the band Wings with his first wife, Linda, and Denny Laine. - The counterculture of the 1960s refers to an anti-establishment cultural phenomenon that developed first in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) and then spread throughout much of the Western world between the early 1960s and the mid-1970s, with London, New York City, and San Francisco being hotbeds of early countercultural activity. The aggregate movement gained momentum as the American Civil Rights Movement continued to grow, and became revolutionary with the expansion of the US government's extensive military intervention in Vietnam. As the 1960s progressed, widespread social tensions also developed concerning other issues, and tended to flow along generational lines regarding human sexuality, women's rights, traditional modes of authority, experimentation with psychoactive drugs, and differing interpretations of the American Dream. Many key movements related to these issues were born, catalyzed, or advanced within the counterculture of the 1960s. - \\"Beatlemania\\" is a term that originated and was coined during the early 1960s to describe the intense fan frenzy directed towards the English rock band the Beatles. The phenomenon began in 1963 and continued past the group's break-up in 1970, despite the band ceasing public performances in 1966. - The Beatles ' Hits EP was released 6 September 1963 . It is The Beatles second British EP and was only released in mono , with the catalogue number Parlophone GEP 8880 . This EP can be seen as an early example of a greatest hits release . It was also released in Australia and New Zealand . - John Winston Ono Lennon, (born John Winston Lennon; 9 October 19408 December 1980) was an English singer and songwriter who co-founded the Beatles, the most commercially successful band in the history of popular music.

With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased. The playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal; this also reduces the high frequency noise. Thus more music will fit on the record, and noise is reduced.\\"?

Then God allowed Satan to confront Adam Satan got to Adam through his wife Satan subtly deceived Eve into DISBELIEVING what God had taught them Adam followed her in choosing rebellion and rejecting Gods rule and government over them","completion":"\\"Then, God allowed Satan to confront Adam. Satan got to Adam through his wife. Satan subtly deceived Eve into disbelieving what God had taught them. Adam followed her in choosing rebellion and rejecting God's rule and government over them.\\" This revised version utilizes proper punctuation to break the sentence into comprehensible pieces. Here's a breakdown of the changes with explanations for clarity: 1) \\"Then, God allowed Satan to confront Adam.\\": The comma after 'then' is to indicate a pause before moving to the next part of the sentence, which gives clarity in reading and understanding. The full stop indicates the end of that particular thought or idea. 2) \\"Satan got to Adam through his wife.\\": A new sentence has been started here to depict a new occurrence. The full stop again represents the completion of the mentioned action. 3) \\"Satan subtly deceived Eve into disbelieving what God had taught them.\\": Another sentence portraying a different act conducted by Satan. The use of full stop here is again to signify the ending of the event discussed. 4) \\"Adam followed her in choosing rebellion and rejecting God's rule and government over them.\\": This last sentence notes another distinct happening following the previous events. It finishes off the original long sentence with the necessary event of Adam's rebellion and his rejection of God's rule. The full stop is used to mark the end of the thought. Moreover, proper use of an apostrophe has been applied in the term \\"God's rule\\" which denotes possession.

Please answer the following question: Question: what is he attracted by? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Gigot Context: Gigot (Gleason) is a mute Frenchman living in a cellar in the MÃ©nilmontant district of Paris in the 1920s. He ekes out a hand-to-mouth existence as a janitor at his landlady's apartment building. He is routinely treated with condescension by neighbors and often is made the butt of practical jokes. However, he is a decent and kindhearted fellow, traits not unnoticed by children and the animals he often feeds. Gigot has one unusual predilection: he is attracted by funeral processions and finds himself attending, whether or not he ever knew the departed. He can't help but cry along with all the other mourners. After being abused by locals at a pub, he chances upon a woman, Colette (Katherine Kath), and her 6-year-old daughter Nicole (Diane Gardner), huddled in a doorway trying to stay dry. He takes them to his dingy basement abode, gives them what food and drink he has, a bed to sleep in, and shelter from the rain. Colette is suspicious but is so exhausted that she accepts. Gigot gleefully dotes upon Nicole. Gigot is astonished to discover she is ignorant of what a church is, completely unaware of God. Nicole points to a crucifix and asks about it. The mute attempts to act out the story of Christ, beginning with Mary cradling the baby Jesus, from childhood through to the horror of crucifixion. Gigot rails at this Christ who has seemingly left him so inadequate. Nicole cries a single tear for him, then blows a reassuring kiss of love to the Christ upon the Cross. Gigot entertains the little girl by dancing to his old gramophone, and by dressing as a waiter to feed his pet mouse. He is very protective, running alongside her on a merry-go-round to make sure she doesn't fall off. He also intervenes to protect Colette's honor while she is in the act of soliciting a john on a park bench near the merry-go-round. Gigot is trounced by the frustrated man for his trouble. Furious over his interference with her \\"activities,\\" Colette threatens to bolt with Nicole unless Gigot can provide her a life with a \\"man of means.\\"...

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"To address each question, let's go through the steps one by one: 1. How do I stop worrying about what others think of me? Step 1: Recognize that worrying about others' opinions is a common human behavior, but ultimately, it's your opinion of yourself that matters the most. Step 2: Develop your self-confidence and self-esteem. This can be achieved by focusing on your strengths, intrinsic worth, and self-growth. Step 3: Surround yourself with positive, supportive people. Build a circle of friends and relatives who encourage and uplift you, rather than those who bring you down. Step 4: Accept that you cannot control others' thoughts and opinions. People will always have differing perspectives, and it's impossible to please everyone. Step 5: Practice setting boundaries by not allowing others' opinions to influence your decisions or emotions. Step 6: Focus on your values and goals. Prioritize your personal values and aspirations over others' opinions. Step 7: Be mindful and present. Redirect your attention to the present moment and avoid overthinking or dwelling on others' thoughts. 2. Should I ever care what people think of me? In certain contexts, it can be helpful to consider the opinions of others, such as when receiving feedback or constructive criticism from trusted individuals. This information can contribute to personal growth and development. However, the key is to know when to take someone's opinion into account and when it's not relevant or helpful. As for the final question, \\"Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?\\", they are related but distinct. The first question focuses on strategies to stop worrying about others' opinions, while the second weighs the importance of others' opinions and discusses when to consider them.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - Canadian Idol was a Canadian reality television competition show which aired on CTV, based on the British show \\"Pop Idol\\". The show was a competition to find the most talented young singer in Canada, and was hosted by Ben Mulroney. Jon Dore was the \\"roving reporter\\" for the first three seasons (appearing in comedy skits throughout the show). Elena Juatco (a season 2 contestant) assumed the role for season four, Dave Kerr had the role in season five and Jully Black in season six. - Pop Idol is a British television music competition created by Simon Fuller which ran on ITV from 2001 to 2003. The aim of the show was to decide the best new young pop singer (or \\"pop idol\\") in the UK based on viewer voting and participation. Two series were broadcastone in 20012002 and a second in 2003. \\"Pop Idol\\" was subsequently put on an indefinite hiatus after series judge Simon Cowell announced the launch of \\"The X Factor\\" in the UK in April 2004. - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Tyler Hamilton is a pop singer best known for placing seventh in the first season of Canadian Idol . He is also a member of the classical music group \`\` Due Voci . '' The group has recently released their first studio album in June 2010 . - Blues is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.

Write a title for this article: By Claudine Beaumont Published: 10:05AM BST 23 Jul 2009 Windows 7 hits the shops on October 22, but is already flying off the shelves Snow Leopard launches September and Apple hopes that the OS will appeal to the growing number of converts who are swapping their Windows PCs for Macs Microsoft and Apple will go head-to-head this autumn, when they both launch new computer operating systems. Microsoft’s new software, Windows 7, hits the shops on October 22, but is already flying off the shelves – so many people tried to pre-order the operating system on launch day that it crashed the Microsoft website. Apple, meanwhile, releases Snow Leopard in September, and hopes that the latest version of OS X will appeal to the growing number of converts who are swapping their Windows PCs for Macs – Apple sold almost 10 million Macs last year, its highest ever figure. Here, we take a close look at some of the key features of both Windows 7 and Snow Leopard to see how they measure up: Windows 7 Released: October 22 Minimum system requirements: 1GHz 32-bit processor; 1GB RAM; 16GB available hard disk space; DirectX9 graphics device Windows 7, the successor to the highly unpopular Vista operating system, is aimed at existing Windows users as well as those looking to buy a new computer. Existing users will be able to upgrade from Windows XP or Windows Vista to Windows 7, and enjoy faster performance and more secure web browsing. Desktop: The Windows 7 desktop is similar in look and feel to Windows Vista, but boasts some handy new tools to help users work more efficiently. Aero Peek turns all of the open windows and folders on your desktop translucent, allowing you to see what you’re working on, and switch quickly to the document or program you need. The addition of Jump Lists makes it really easy to access the songs, pictures or favourite websites you visit every day. You can “pin” items, such as videos or music, to the Jump List, rather like a virtual corkboard, and even use the Jump List to access common shortcuts, such as writing a new email message or creating a blank Word document. Home networking: Windows 7 has been designed with multiple users in mind – Microsoft understands that a single household may have multiple computer users, who may want to be able to quickly and easily share documents between machines without having to transfer them via USB sticks or go through complex procedures to copy the files to a communal space. The new HomeGroup function gives one-click sharing of files and folders between PCs on the same network. It’s all password-protected too, so you have control over what areas of your computer other people can and cannot access. Performance: This is one area where Windows 7 knocks the spots off its predecessor, Vista. The whole operating system has been turbo-charged to help users do what they want more quickly. That means your computer will boot up faster and connect to a Wi-Fi network more quickly; searching for files and documents is easier, and results will be delivered more quickly, and grouped in to helpful categories to make it simple to find what you need; Windows 7 is also less processor-hungry than Vista, because it has been tweaked to only run the programs and services you need, when you need them – for example, it won’t waste time switching on your computer’s Bluetooth function if it knows you’re not using a Bluetooth device. If you’re a laptop user, you’ll also appreciate Windows 7’s new power-management tools, which could help you to conserve your computer’s battery life. There’s also support for touchscreen interfaces, so if you’re using a computer with a touch-screen monitor, you can use your fingers, as well as a mouse, to access all your important files, and surf the web. Released: September, date to be confirmed Minimum system requirements: Mac computer with Intel processor; 1GB memory; 5GB free disk space Snow Leopard is the follow-up to Leopard, and, as the name suggests, Apple sees this new operating system as an iterative improvement rather than a complete overhaul. Snow Leopard tweaks many of the already excellent features found in Leopard, bringing users a more nimble, reliable operating system with enough neat new tricks up its sleeves to persuade most Mac users to upgrade, and which may even persuade those looking to buy a new computer to choose a Mac rather than a PC. Desktop: Snow Leopard is very similar in look and feel to Leopard – indeed, many of the improvements are “under the hood”, rather than cosmetic. Finder, the search tool that allows you to find files and documents stored on your computer, has been simplified and streamlined, making it even easier to find what you’re looking for. The iTunes-style Finder window remains a pleasure to use, even allowing you to preview video clips, songs or browse documents directly within Finder, rather than having to open up a video- or document-editing program first. The Stacks feature enables users to quickly access files and folders at the touch of a button. Home networking: Macs have always made it easy to share files and folders on computers using the same network through its Bonjour software. Enhancements to this tool in Snow Leopard now means your Mac can bee in sleep mode, yet continue to share files and folders across the network, waking from its slumber when needed, and dozing off again when it’s not. Logging on to a wireless network also takes less time, meaning you can be up and running more quickly. Automatically backing up your hard drive using the Time Machine function also takes less time, as does restoring your computer to its former glory if you do delete something by accident. Performance: Snow Leopard can boot up and shut down a Mac almost twice as quickly as a machine running Leopard. Installing the new operating system will also take up less than half the disk space Leopard used, giving users back around 6GB of storage – enough room for thousands more songs and photos. Which one should you buy?: Both operating systems have much to recommend them. Windows 7 is the operating system Windows Vista should have been – slicker, faster and more reliable, as well as easier to use. If you already own a Windows PC and want to be able to do more than just surf the internet and send the odd email, you should definitely invest in Windows 7 and reap the benefits of its innovative new features. Snow Leopard, by Apple’s own admission, represents evolution rather than revolution. For existing Leopard users who are happy with the current speed and performance of their machine, there is little need to upgrade to Snow Leopard. But for Apple power users, for whom every bit and byte counts, the improvements in speed, efficiency and the installation footprint will make Snow Leopard an even more compelling purchase.

What might be the first step of the process? A:","completion":"The first step of the digestive process is the consumption of food, which involves taking a bite of food and chewing it. Chewing, also known as mastication, helps break down the food into smaller pieces, increasing the surface area for enzymes in saliva to act upon. Saliva, produced by the salivary glands, contains the enzyme amylase, which starts the breakdown of carbohydrates in the food. As food is being chewed, it is mixed with saliva to form a soft mass called a bolus. The tongue helps to position the bolus and mix it with saliva. Once the bolus is formed, it is then swallowed and travels down the esophagus - a muscular tube connecting the mouth to the stomach. Swallowing is facilitated by a coordinated series of muscular contractions known as peristalsis, which propel the bolus through the esophagus and into the stomach. In the stomach, the food is mixed with gastric juices containing hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes, such as pepsin, to further break down the food into a semi-liquid state called chyme. The acidic environment in the stomach not only aids in the digestion process but also helps kill off harmful bacteria that may have entered along with the food. At this point, the chyme is released gradually into the small intestine where the majority of nutrient absorption takes place. The small intestine is lined with finger-like projections called villi, which increase the surface area for absorption. Here, enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the liver break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into their constituent components, such as glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids. These components are then absorbed into the bloodstream. As the remaining material (now mostly waste) passes from the small intestine into the large intestine, water and electrolytes are absorbed by the body. The large intestine also harbors beneficial gut bacteria, which further break down and process the remaining waste material. Finally, the waste is compacted and stored in the rectum, before being expelled from the body through the anus during a bowel movement. In summary, the first step of the digestive process is the consumption of food, followed by chewing and mixing it with saliva to break it down into smaller pieces and initiate the process of digestion with the help of enzymes in saliva."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: The mental gland pheromone of male Plethodon salamanders contains two main protein components: a 22 kDa protein named Plethodon Receptivity Factor (PRF) and a 7 kDa protein named Plethodon Modulating Factor (PMF), respectively. Each protein component individually has opposing effects on female courtship behavior, with PRF shortening and PMF lengthening courtship.

The agmatine-uptake technique was used to visualize chemosensory neurons that were activated by each protein component individually.', 'Vomeronasal neurons exposed to agmatine in saline did not demonstrate significant labeling. However, a population of vomeronasal neurons was labeled following exposure to either PRF or PMF. When expressed as a percent of control level labeled cells, PRF labeled more neurons than did PMF.

What is the answer for the question: What are the full names of the people Koch suspects is responsible for Blayden turning up dead? from the following article ? Johnny O'Clock is a junior partner in a posh casino with Guido Marchettis. Complicating their longtime working relationship is Guido's wife Nelle, who is still in love with former boyfriend Johnny. She gives Johnny an expensive custom pocket watch, the twin of a birthday present she gave her husband, except Johnny's has a romantic engraving on the back. Johnny gives the watch, along with a rejection note, to Harriet Hobson, a hat-check girl at the casino, to return to Nelle. Harriet, however, apparently commits suicide using gas. Her sister Nancy shows up to find out what happened. She becomes attracted to Johnny. They eventually learn from Police Inspector Koch that Harriet was killed by poison. Harriet was dating Chuck Blayden, a crooked cop who is trying to persuade Guido to let him take Johnny's place. When Blayden also turns up dead, Koch suspects that either Johnny or Marchettis is responsible. Though Johnny tries to resist, little by little, he falls for Nancy. When Koch shows both Johnny and Marchettis Johnny's watch and note, Johnny tells Nancy their relationship is through and takes her to the airport. As he is driving away, however, he narrowly survives a drive-by shooting, and Nancy realizes he was only trying to protect her. She refuses to leave him. Johnny decides to flee to South America with Nancy, but not before brazenly cashing in his share of the casino. Marchettis pulls out a gun when Johnny's back is turned. They shoot it out; Marchettis is killed and Johnny wounded. Afterward, Nelle offers to testify it was self-defense, but only if he will come back to her. He refuses, so she tells Koch it was cold-blooded murder. Johnny's first instinct is to run away, but Nancy convinces him to give himself up.

As she grew up, her love for art only intensified, with more and more people admiring her work. She was happiest when she could share her art with others and see their faces light up as they experienced the emotions she portrayed in her paintings. After finishing college, Emma moved to a small town with the hope of starting her art career. She rented a tiny studio on Main Street and began selling her paintings to the town's residents. However, she soon realized that the town was not as enthusiastic about her artwork as she had hoped. People admired her talent, but they didn't seem to appreciate the depth of her work. One day, as Emma was walking back to her studio, she noticed an abandoned theater on the edge of town. The building had been vacant for years, its elegant facade hidden beneath layers of dust and grime. Curiosity piqued, Emma decided to explore the theater. As she stepped inside, she was amazed by the beauty of the place. The theater had been neglected, but there was still a sense of elegance and grandeur in the worn-out velvet seats, the tarnished chandelier, and the faded murals on the walls. Emma couldn't help but imagine the performers who had once graced the stage and the delighted audience that must have filled the seats. It was then that an idea began to form in her mind. If the people of the town couldn't appreciate her art in a traditional gallery setting, why not bring her art to life in a more theatrical setting? Excited, she began to imagine how she could transform the old theater into a living gallery. Over the next few months, Emma worked tirelessly to restore the theater. She cleaned and decorated every inch of the building, using her artistic talent to bring new life to the faded murals and ornate details.

The expedition, whose arrival had caused such excitement in Mexico, was commanded by Hernando Cortez, a man who united in his person all the gifts requisite for a great leader of men. He possessed a handsome person, great strength and skill at arms, extraordinary courage and daring, singular powers of conciliation and of bringing others to his way of thinking, pleasing and courteous demeanor, a careless and easy manner which concealed great sagacity and wisdom, an inexhaustible flow of spirits, and an iron determination. Born in Estremadura in 1485, of an ancient and respectable family, he was--like many others who have distinguished themselves as great soldiers--while at school and college remarkable rather for mischievous freaks, and disregard of authority, than for love of learning. At the age of seventeen he had exhausted his parents' patience, and was on the point of starting with the expedition of Ovando, the successor to Columbus, when he so injured himself by a fall, incurred in one of his wild escapades, that he was unable to sail with it. Two years later, however, he went out in a merchant vessel to the Indies. On reaching Hispaniola Ovando, who was governor of the island, received him kindly, and gave him a grant of land and a number of Indians to till it. The quiet life of the planter, however, little suited the restless young fellow; and after taking part in several military expeditions against insurgent natives, under the command of Diego Velasquez, he sailed in 1511, with that officer, to undertake the conquest of Cuba. Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. Who was the leader of the expedition? 2. What made him such a good leader? 3. What type of gifts? 4.

The factory is highly automated and designed to shift flexibly to produce many different kinds of chips to suit demand. \\"The diversity is the big difference with this plant,\\" said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a research firm. \\"It gives IBM the capability to make so many different kinds of custom chips, and the world is going to custom chips.\\" The 140,000-square-foot plant is a testament to advanced manufacturing technology. The 300-millimeter silicon wafers -- about the size of a standard pizza -- are shuttled around the facility in enclosed plastic pods, which ride on overhead tracks. They drop down from wires automatically into machines, sheathed in stainless steel and glass, for each stage of processing and fabrication. Throughout the 500 processing steps, which typically last 20 days, the wafers are not touched by human hands. The circuits etched into the chips are less than one thousandth the width of a human hair. Human operators are there to monitor the systems, catch errors and fine-tune the production process for maximum efficiency. Because each of the hundreds of processing machines is self-enclosed, and essentially airtight, the uniforms operators wear are less constricting than in the previous generation of chip plants, which looked like space suits. The operators at the East Fishkill factory wear light nylon uniforms, light blue shoe coverings and translucent hair nets made of paper. They look more like workers in a bakery.

Specifically, individuals with physical disabilities that are determined to be 50% or less are entitled to use selected services with a 15% discount on their monthly fee package. On the other hand, a person with a physical disability of more than 50%, up to 30% of the regular monthly fee package will be discounted. In simpler terms, it means that there is a two-tier system in place for individuals with physical disabilities to receive discounts on selected services they utilize. The discount is determined based on the severity of the individual's physical disability. Let's break it down further: 1. Tier 1: Individuals with a physical disability that is determined as 50% or less are eligible for a 15% discount on their monthly fee package. This means that if the usual monthly fee for the service is 100, for example, the person would only pay 85 (100 - 15%). 2. Tier 2: Individuals with a physical disability that is determined as more than 50% are eligible for a 30% discount on their monthly fee package. Using the same example, if the usual monthly fee for the service is 100, the person would only pay 70 (100 - 30%). These discounts are meant to provide some financial relief to people with physical disabilities who rely on certain services, as they may encounter higher living costs and additional expenses due to their disability.

If a farmer learned better farming techniques, they could expect to produce more or less food? Answer:","completion":"If a farmer learns and adopts better farming techniques and implements advanced machines, they can undoubtedly expect to produce more food. The increase in food production can be attributed to several factors, which stem from the usage of innovative farming methods, technological advancements, and efficient distribution networks. Here, we will examine how these improvements lead to increased food supply, and the impact they have on farming as a whole. 1. Improved Soil Management: By understanding and implementing better soil management practices, farmers can improve the health and fertility of their soil. Techniques such as crop rotation, cover cropping, and conservation tillage help maintain soil fertility and structure, thus allowing plants to grow more efficiently and produce higher yields. 2. Advanced Farming Equipment: Innovations in farming machinery and equipment, such as GPS enabled tractors, combine harvesters, seeders, and tillers, have allowed farmers to work more efficiently, covering larger areas in a shorter amount of time. As a result, farmers can cultivate more land, leading to an increased overall food supply. 3. Precision Agriculture: The integration of cutting-edge technology, such as drones, sensors, and satellite imagery, helps farmers in making more informed decisions about their land and crops. Precision agriculture enables farmers to monitor soil conditions, crop health, and weather patterns, thereby allowing them to make precise decisions on their fertilizer, water, and pesticide applications. This, in turn, leads to improved plant growth, higher yields, and a reduction in wasted resources. 4. Genetic Modification and Plant Breeding: Genetic modification and selective breeding practices have led to the development of crop varieties that are more resistant to pests, diseases, and adverse environmental conditions, such as drought or extreme temperatures. This increased resistance ensures that more plants within a crop survive, leading to higher overall food production. 5. Integrated Pest Management: Implementing integrated pest management strategies focused on preventing pest populations from reaching significant levels allows farmers to use fewer chemical pesticides. This, in turn, leads to healthier crops and increased food production. 6. Sustainable Farming Practices: By adopting sustainable farming methods, such as agroforestry, integrated livestock-farming systems, and organic agriculture, farmers can improve their land's overall health and fertility while increasing crop yields. These practices not only contribute to an improved environment but also lead to long-lasting food production systems capable of meeting the growing global population's demands. 7. Efficient Distribution Networks: Better farming techniques have enabled food producers to create stronger connections with local, regional, and global distribution networks. These networks ensure that crops are effectively transported and distributed, reducing food waste and making a more extensive range of products accessible to a wider range of consumers. In conclusion, a farmer who learns and embraces better farming techniques can confidently expect to produce more food. By harnessing advancements in soil management practices, agricultural machinery, technology, plant breeding, pest management, and sustainable farming practices, farmers can optimize their production levels and contribute significantly to addressing food security challenges. Furthermore, these developments also have positive ripple effects on the environment, distribution networks, and ultimately the global population, leading to a more sustainable and secure food system for all."},{"prompt":"Question: Read the following article and select the best answer.

Nadia Murad Basee and Lamiya Aji Bashar were among thousands of Yazidi girls and women abducted by IS militants and forced into sexual slavery in 2014. But both survived and now campaign for the Yazidi community. The freedom of thought prize is awarded annually in memory of Andrei Sakharov, a Soviet scientist and dissident. The two women were nominated by the liberal Alde group in the European Parliament. Group leader Guy Verhofstadt described them as \\"inspirational women who have shown incredible bravery and humanity in the face of despicable brutality\\". European Parliament President Martin Schulz said it was \\"a very symbolic and significant decision to support these two survivors who came to Europe as refugees\\". He went on: \\"We as [the] European parliament are now supporting them in their fight for, not only the dignity we have to grant to everybody, but also for their fight to give testimony as a witness to these atrocities.\\" Tens of thousands of Yazidis were forced to flee their homes after IS fighters took the northern Iraqi town of Sinjar in August 2014. Thousands of women and girls were treated as \\"spoils of war\\" and openly sold in slave markets to IS militants. They were separated from the men and boys, many of whom were shot dead. Ms Murad was 19 when she was abducted from her home in the village of Kocho, near Sinjar, and taken to Mosul, where she was tortured and raped. She later managed to flee, but she lost six brothers and her mother in the Sinjar assault. Ms Bashar, also from Kocho, attempted to flee her captors several times during her 20 months in captivity before she finally succeeded. She was just 16 when she was abducted. Yazidis, whose religion includes elements of several faiths, are considered infidels by IS. The UN says IS committed genocide against Yazidis in Iraq and Syria in a premeditated attempt to exterminate an entire community of 400,000 people. A number of Yazidi mass graves were discovered north of Sinjar mountain after Kurdish forces retook the town in November 2015. Since her escape, Ms Murad has become a prominent advocate in highlighting the plight of the Yazidis in the region. Other finalists for the Sakharov prize included Crimean Tatar activist Mustafa Dzhemilev and exiled Turkish journalist Can Dundar. Last year's winner was Saudi blogger Raif Badawi, who is currently serving a 10-year prison sentence which includes 1,000 lashes for \\"insulting Islam\\" online.

Spoiling children would be like adding too much sugar to the cookie dough, making it too sweet. The question asks if schools add different amounts of sugar to boys and girls. 2.

Competition between international universities is heating up, as China grows as one of the largest exporters of students aiming to study abroad. \\"Lots of universities are becoming more and more aggressive to attract Chinese students. Every day I receive contacts from universities in the US expressing the desire to come to China to recruit students,\\" said Frank Joseph, a commercial officer from embassy of the United States. One key reason why more Chinese students are able to study abroad is the economy: With China's boom within the past decade, more families have the financial wherewithal to send their children to international universities. There will be a total of 200,000 family-funded Chinese students studying overseas in 2009, up 20 percent from last year, said Wu Zaofeng, deputy secretary general of China Education Association for International Exchange. International institutions, Joseph said, are also facing increasingly tough financial situation with a shortage of domestic students and a drop in government subsidies . Students, especially in the US are paying high tuition fees and living expenses. Chinese students with money to spend, according to experts, can fill up the gap. Students on average spend 150,000 yuan to 200,000 yuan every year studying in US, according to statistics from the US Institute of International Education.

Petty was born October 20, 1950, in Gainesville, Florida, the first of two sons of Kitty (nee Avery), a local tax office worker, and Earl Petty, who worked in a grocery store. He had a brother, Bruce, who was seven years younger. His interest in rock and roll music began at age ten when he met Elvis Presley. In the summer of 1961, his uncle was working on the set of Presley's film Follow That Dream, in nearby Ocala, and invited Petty to watch the shoot. Petty's first appearance in film took place in 1978, when he had a cameo in FM. He later had a small part in 1987's Made in Heaven and appeared in several episodes of It's Garry Shandling's Show between 1987 and 1990, playing himself as one of Garry Shandling's neighbors. Petty was also featured in Shandling's other show, The Larry Sanders Show, as one of the Story within a story final guests. In the episode, Petty gets bumped from the show and nearly comes to blows with Greg Kinnear. Petty appeared in the 1997 film The Postman, directed by and starring Kevin Costner, as the Bridge City Mayor (from the dialogue it is implied that he is playing a future history version of himself).

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Many countries issued such numbers for a singular purpose, but over time, they become a de facto national identification number. For example, the United States developed its Social Security number (SSN) system as a means of organizing disbursing of Social Security benefits. However, due to function creep, the number has become used for other purposes to the point where it is almost essential to have one to, among other things, open a bank account, obtain a credit card, or drive a car. Although some countries are required to collect Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) information for overseas payment procedures, some countries, like the US, are not required to collect other nations' TIN if other requirements are met, such as date of birth. Authorities use databases and they need a unique identifier in order to be that data actually refer to the searched person. In countries where there is no established nationwide number, authorities need to create their own number for each person, though there is a risk of mismatching people. What's the best answer to this question: is it legal to use a social security number for identification? OPT: I. no. II. yes....A:","completion":"The best answer to the question of whether it is legal to use a Social Security number (SSN) for identification is complex and depends on the context in which it is being used. In the United States, the original intention of the SSN was to track an individual's earnings and benefits under the Social Security program. Over time, the SSN has become a de facto national identification number used by government agencies, financial institutions, and other organizations for a wide range of purposes. It is legal for government agencies and certain private entities to use SSNs for identification purposes, but there are specific guidelines and restrictions surrounding its usage. I. Yes - Legal: 1. Government agencies: Federal, state, and local government agencies are allowed to use SSNs for identification purposes. For many government transactions, individuals are often required to provide their SSN, such as for obtaining a driver's license, applying for a passport, or filing a tax return. 2. Financial institutions: Banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions are permitted to use SSNs to verify the identity of customers, comply with tax regulations, and prevent fraud. Under the USA PATRIOT Act, financial institutions are required to obtain, verify, and record the information that identifies individuals opening an account, which often includes the SSN. 3. Credit reporting agencies: Credit reporting agencies, such as Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion, use SSNs to track an individual's credit history and generate credit reports. II. No - Illegal: 1. General businesses: Businesses are restricted in their use of SSNs for identification. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has guidelines in place that discourage businesses from using SSNs as a primary identifier. SSNs should only be collected and used if it's necessary for a specific purpose, such as for tax reporting or employment verification. 2. Privacy concerns & identity theft: The widespread use of SSNs has raised privacy concerns and increased the risk of identity theft. Consequently, there are federal and state laws that regulate the use, disclosure, and safeguarding of SSNs. For example, under the Privacy Act of 1974, it is generally unlawful for a government agency to deny a benefit or service if an individual refuses to disclose their SSN unless required by federal law. In summary, whether it is legal to use a Social Security number for identification depends on the context and the organization involved. Government agencies, financial institutions, and credit reporting agencies can legally use SSNs for identification purposes. However, restrictions apply to general businesses, and privacy concerns have led to the adoption of laws and regulations that limit the use and disclosure of SSNs."},{"prompt":"Facts: - monarch: george vi george vi elizabeth ii elizabeth ii - predecessor: sir vincent glenday none -lrb- new office -rrb- philip mitchell sir john nicoll -lrb- acting -rrb- - birth date: 8 june 1907 - order: acting acting 9th 1st - death date: 19 february 1987 - spouse: janet death -rrb- grace austin -lrb- 1939 -- 1976 , her - office: governor governor of western nigeria of fiji governor of fiji resident of zanzibar - term end: 4 may 1944 1 january 1945 1954 july 1960 - name: john dalzell rankine - premier: obafemi awolowo samuel akintola - successor: sir henry steven potter sir adesoji aderemi john nicoll -lrb- acting -rrb- sir alexander grantham - nationality: british - occupation: colonial administrator - alma mater: exeter college , oxford - namedata: khalifa bin harub - blankname: sultan of zanzibar - children: 1 daughter - term start: 12 1954 january 1944 23 october 1944 1952 1 october Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of john rankine -lrb- governor -rrb- .

Generate a question about the following movie plot: In Rome, in the 1980s, famous Italian film director Salvatore Di Vita returns home late one evening, where his girlfriend sleepily tells him that his mother called to say someone named Alfredo has died. Salvatore obviously shies from committed relationships and has not been to his home village of Giancaldo, Sicily in 30 years. As his girlfriend asks him who Alfredo is, Salvatore flashes back to his childhood. It is a few years after World War II. Six-year-old Salvatore is the mischievous, intelligent son of a war widow. Nicknamed Toto, he discovers a love for films and spends every free moment at the movie house Cinema Paradiso. Although they initially start off on tense terms, he develops a friendship with the fatherly projectionist, Alfredo, who takes a shine to the young boy and often lets him watch movies from the projection booth. During the shows, the audience can be heard booing when there are missing sections, causing the films to suddenly jump, bypassing a critical romantic kiss or embrace. The local priest had ordered these sections censored, and the deleted scenes are piled on the projection room floor. At first, Alfredo considers Toto a bit of a pest, but eventually he teaches Salvatore to operate the film projector. The montage ends as the movie house catches fire (highly flammable nitrate film was in routine use at the time) as Alfredo was projecting The Firemen of ViggiÃ¹ after hours, on the wall of a nearby house. Salvatore saves Alfredo's life, but not before some film reels explode in Alfredo's face, leaving him permanently blind. The Cinema Paradiso is rebuilt by a town citizen, Ciccio, who invests his football lottery winnings. Salvatore, still a child, is hired as the new projectionist, as he is the only person who knows how to run the machines.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? creep the living hell out of you","completion":"To determine the sentiment of the movie review sentence \\"creep the living hell out of you,\\" we need to analyze the words used and the context in which they are presented. The sentence indicates a strong emotional reaction to the movie, particularly because of the phrase \\"the living hell.\\" It suggests that the movie has a powerful and potentially disturbing effect on the viewer. By using the word \\"creep,\\" which is often associated with a sense of fear, discomfort, or unease, the reviewer conveys that the movie has a high impact in terms of creating suspense or terror. In the context of a movie review, this sentence could be interpreted in two different ways: 1) Positive sentiment: If the movie is intended to be a horror, thriller, or suspense film, the sentence may reflect a positive sentiment. The reviewer might be praising the movie's ability to evoke fear and unease, as that is usually the goal of these genres. In this case, the sentence could be seen as a testament to the movie's effectiveness in achieving its objective, ultimately leaving a lasting impression on the audience. 2) Negative sentiment: On the other hand, if the movie being reviewed is not intended to provoke fear or unease, the sentence could reflect a negative sentiment. It would mean that the movie unintentionally instills a sense of discomfort or dread in the viewer, which could indicate poor execution, inappropriate content, or a lack of cohesive storytelling. In this context, the sentence might express disappointment in the movie's inability to deliver on its intended genre or theme. In conclusion, the sentiment of the movie review sentence \\"creep the living hell out of you\\" largely depends on the movie's genre and context. For a horror, thriller, or suspense film, the sentiment could be considered positive, as it highlights the movie's ability to evoke strong emotional reactions. However, for a movie that isn't intended to provoke fear or unease, the sentiment could be negative, as it suggests that the movie has failed to deliver on its objectives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

South Slavic dialects historically formed a continuum. The turbulent history of the area, particularly due to expansion of the Ottoman Empire, resulted in a patchwork of dialectal and religious differences. Due to population migrations, Shtokavian became the most widespread in the western Balkans, intruding westwards into the area previously occupied by Chakavian and Kajkavian (which further blend into Slovenian in the northwest). Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs differ in religion and were historically often part of different cultural circles, although a large part of the nations have lived side by side under foreign overlords. During that period, the language was referred to under a variety of names, such as \\"Slavic\\", \\"Illyrian\\", or according to region, \\"Bosnian\\", \\"Serbian\\" and \\"Croatian\\", the latter often in combination with \\"Slavonian\\" or \\"Dalmatian\\". Serbo-Croatian was standardized in the mid-19th-century Vienna Literary Agreement by Croatian and Serbian writers and philologists, decades before a Yugoslav state was established. From the very beginning, there were slightly different literary Serbian and Croatian standards, although both were based on the same Shtokavian subdialect, Eastern Herzegovinian. In the 20th century, Serbo-Croatian served as the official language of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (when it was called \\"Serbo-Croato-Slovenian\\"), and later as one of the official languages of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The breakup of Yugoslavia affected language attitudes, so that social conceptions of the language separated on ethnic and political lines. Since the breakup of Yugoslavia, Bosnian has likewise been established as an official standard in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and there is an ongoing movement to codify a separate Montenegrin standard. Serbo-Croatian thus generally goes by the ethnic names Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, and sometimes Montenegrin and Bunjevac. Answer the following questions: 1.

Aubrey Drake Graham was born on October 24, 1986, in Toronto, Ontario. His father, Dennis Graham, is an African American and a practising Catholic from Memphis, Tennessee, and worked as a drummer, performing alongside country musician Jerry Lee Lewis. Bass guitarist Larry Graham and the late songwriter Teenie Hodges are his paternal uncles. Drake's mother, Sandi Graham (nee Sher), is an Ashkenazi Jewish Canadian who worked as an English teacher and florist. After becoming musically inspired by Jay Z and Clipse, Drake self-released his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement, in 2006. The mixtape featured Trey Songz and Lupe Fiasco, and included vast production from Canadian producers Boi-1da, and Frank Dukes. When asked about the mixtape, Drake described the project as \\"pretty straightforward, radio friendly, [and] not much content to it.\\" The mixtape was released for sale only, and confirmed to have sold over 6,000 copies. In 2007, he released his second mixtape, Comeback Season. Released from his recently founded October's Very Own label, it spawned the single \\"Replacement Girl\\", featuring Trey Songz. The song made Drake become the first ever unsigned Canadian rapper to have his music video featured on BET, with \\"Replacement Girl\\" being featured on the channel's \\"New Joint of the Day\\" segment on April 30, 2007. The song also saw Drake sample \\"Man of the Year\\" by Brisco, Flo Rida and Lil Wayne, retaining Lil Wayne's verse, and adjoined his own to the song's earlier half. This caused Jas Prince to gift Lil Wayne the song, which prompted the rapper to invite Drake to Houston in order to join his Tha Carter III tour. Throughout the duration of the tour, Drake and Lil Wayne recorded multiple songs together, including \\"Ransom\\", \\"I Want This Forever\\", and a remix to \\"Brand New\\". Despite the collaborations between the duo, Drake was yet to be signed by Young Money Entertainment. In 2009, Drake released his third mixtape, So Far Gone. It was made available for free download through his OVO blog website, and featured Lil Wayne, Trey Songz, Omarion, Lloyd, and Bun B. It received over 2,000 downloads in the first 2 hours of release, finding mainstream commercial success due to the singles \\"Best I Ever Had\\" and \\"Successful\\", both gaining Gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with the former also peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. This prompted the mixtape's re-release as an EP, featuring only four songs from the original, as well as the additions of the songs \\"I'm Goin' In\\" and \\"Fear\\". It debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, and won the Rap Recording of the Year at the 2010 Juno Awards. Due to the success of the mixtape, Drake was the subject of a bidding war from various labels, often reported as \\"one of the biggest bidding wars ever\\". Despite this, Drake was rumoured to have secured a recording contract with Young Money Entertainment on June 29, 2009. This was later confirmed following a planned lawsuit from Young Money, in conjunction with Drake, against an unauthorized album entitled The Girls Love Drake, which was released on iTunes under dubious means. Drake then joined the rest of the label's roster the America's Most Wanted Tour in July 2009. However, during a performance of \\"Best I Ever Had\\" in Camden, New Jersey, Drake fell on stage, and tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee.

Answer:","completion":"The shared aspect between \\"Finding Nemo\\" and \\"Melody Time\\" is that both films utilize animation as a storytelling medium. While the technologies used in creating the animations differ, with \\"Finding Nemo\\" primarily relying on computer-generated imagery (CGI) and \\"Melody Time\\" using traditional hand-drawn animation techniques, the end result is still a form of animated storytelling that serves to entertain and engage audiences. \\"Finding Nemo\\" (2003) is a computer-animated film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. The movie features state-of-the-art three-dimensional (3D) computer-generated graphics, which greatly enhance the underwater world of the storyline.

Context: No grades (ever), no sitting down at desks, and harnessing student boredom as a motivator to create and explore might seem an odd recipe for academic success and entry to university, but that is exactly what one of Scotland's newest schools is attempting to do. Drumdruan Upper School was created a few years ago by Scottish actress Tilda Swinton, star of many a Hollywood blockbuster and forever in my mind the terrifying Witch in the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The school extends a Steiner education beyond the age of 14, and takes students through to their University years. The Observer has published a fascinating and detailed account of some of the recipe that makes this a special place and, above all, has bowled over the traditionally conservative schools inspectorate: That is not what happened: the inspectors sat in the classes and watched the students. And if you watch the students at Drumduan, you soon notice they are confident, articulate, highly motivated and respectful. These are, in fact, the words used by the inspectors in their subsequent report. You might even believe the students at Drumduan wanted to be there. The inspectors clearly felt so, but it was when they had retired to an office to confer that Krzysztof, a master of the spontaneous gesture, delivered the coup de grace. He sang to them. Music is something of a hallmark at Drumduan, where children participate in regular workshops – often on instruments like a wheelie bin – and start each day singing in four-part harmonies. “We were rehearsing in another room, and I said: ‘This song is terrific, we have to show these inspectors,’” Krzysztof recalls. “So we burst into their office – they were a bit alarmed – and I said: ‘I’m sorry, we’ve just got to sing this song to you.’” The song was “Media Vita”, a medieval score of haunting beauty that reduced the inspectors to tears, according to Krzysztof. Bowled over by their praise – he is a man whose emotions are close to the surface – Krzysztof asked if he could give them a hug, probably a... Question: Why did they sing to the inspectors?

Which cabinet minister is MP for Chingford and Woodford Green?","completion":"The Member of Parliament (MP) for Chingford and Woodford Green is Iain Duncan Smith. He represents the Conservative Party and has held the seat since its creation in 1997. However, he is no longer a Cabinet Minister. Iain Duncan Smith is a prominent figure in UK politics, particularly within the Conservative Party. Born on 9th April 1954, he has been involved in politics for a significant part of his life. His political career began in earnest when he was elected as the MP for Chingford in 1992, succeeding the former Prime Minister Winston Churchill. In 2001, after nearly a decade in the House of Commons, Duncan Smith was elected as the leader of the Conservative Party. His leadership spanned two years, ending in 2003 when he was succeeded by Michael Howard. Despite the relatively short term as party leader, his influence within the party persisted. From 2010 to 2016, Duncan Smith served in the Cabinet as the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. During his tenure, he oversaw significant changes to welfare policy, including the implementation of the Universal Credit system. However, his reforms were often met with controversy and criticism, with opponents arguing that they disproportionately affected the country's most vulnerable people. Duncan Smith resigned from his Cabinet post in 2016, citing concerns over proposed cuts to disability benefits. Since then, he has continued to represent his constituents in Chingford and Woodford Green, serving on several parliamentary committees and maintaining an active involvement in political discourse. In summary, while Iain Duncan Smith is indeed the MP for Chingford and Woodford Green, he currently does not hold a position within the Cabinet. However, his significant influence on national policies and party politics underline his status as a key figure in UK politics."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 4: Umenyiora's reaction and response Discuss how Umenyiora responded to McCoy's criticism and why he labeled it as \\"unforgivable.\\" Umenyiora's reaction and response: In his recent interview, Umenyiora called out McCoy's comments as \\"unforgivable,\\" explaining that he feels the running back crossed a line by publicly attacking him during a sensitive contract negotiation process. Umenyiora believes that there are boundaries within the league that shouldn't be crossed, and McCoy's personal attack on his character was a violation of that unwritten code. Step 5: Effects on the rivalry and possible outcomes Discuss how this latest incident between Umenyiora and McCoy affects the rivalry between the Giants and the Eagles, and speculate on potential resolutions or consequences. Effects on the rivalry and possible outcomes: This latest exchange between Umenyiora and McCoy is sure to add more intensity to the already fierce rivalry between the New York Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles.

As Umenyiora deems McCoy's criticism \\"unforgivable,\\" the conflict adds another layer to the storied Giants-Eagles rivalry, making it a must-watch matchup for NFL fans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: The CIA was responsible for more than half of all UFO sightings in the late 1950s and most of the 1960s — but those weren’t little green men flying high in the sky, they were spies. For years, the CIA secretly flew its famous U-2 spy plane at altitudes of 60,000 feet or more above countries like the Soviet Union. Since no one believed manned flight was possible at such heights, many who spotted the planes believed they were seeing UFOs. The spy agency did nothing at the time to disabuse them of the notion. That’s one of the most intriguing takeaways in the document that the Central Intelligence Agency said was its most-read in 2014. Titled “The CIA and the U-2 Program, 1954-1974,” the document details 20 years of the agency’s now infamous spy plane. A U-2 flown by the CIA’s Francis Gary Powers, of course, was shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960. Alongside posts revealing that pigeon-camera missions are still classified; the true story behind the story that led to the hit film “Argo;” and others that made up the CIA’s best of 2014 list, the U-2 document, which detailed how large numbers of pilots mistook the secret spy planes for unidentified flying objects, topped a list providing a rare — albeit limited — view into the inner workings of an agency under fire recently for its alleged use of torture. Over the last few days, the CIA has been tweeting out links to its top ten most-read “BestOf2014” documents. Today, it confessed that “Reports of unusual activity in the skies in the ’50s? It was us.” High-altitude testing of the U-2…led to an unexpected side effect — a tremendous increase in reports of unidentified flying objects,” the CIA wrote in the document, which it wrote in 1998. “In the mid-1950s, most commercial airliners flew at altitudes between 10,000 and 20,000 feet and [many] military aircraft…operated at altitudes below 40,000 feet. Consequently, once U-2s started flying at altitudes above 60,000 feet, air-traffic controllers began receiving increasing numbers of UFO reports.” Added the document, the CIA cross-referenced UFO sightings to U-2 flight logs. “This enabled the investigators to eliminate the majority of the UFO reports,” the CIA wrote, “although they could not reveal to the letter writers the true cause of the UFO sightings.” Pigeon camera missions The CIA’s full 2014 top-ten list covers a wide variety of topics, including a 90th birthday wish to former U.S. President (and former CIA director) George H.W. Bush; the fact that the spy agency created a line of china for a fake airline during the Cold War; and an innovative system for rescuing soldiers and downed airmen from hostile territory, known as Skyhook. Amusingly, the list also admits that the CIA used to conduct surveillance by strapping special cameras to the breasts of pigeons, and that “details of pigeon missions are still classified.” Still, the CIA allowed that its Office of Research and Development had built a camera that could be strapped to the birds’ bodies, and then, “with the camera running, the bird would fly over a target on its return home. Being a common species, the pigeon concealed its role as an intelligence-collection platform among the activities of thousands of other birds. Pigeon imagery was taken within hundreds of feet of the targets, so it was much more detailed than imagery from other…platforms.” One can hardly read about the missions without thinking about other great moments in pigeon history — such as Google’s 2002 April Fools’ Day joke, Pigeonrank, said to be a new system for accurately ranking search results. Day in the life of a CIA Operations Center Officer Sadly, the CIA did not take the opportunity to be forthcoming about its inner workings to actually be all that forthcoming. The number two item on the list, a look at a typical day of a CIA Operations Center Officer, sounds promising, and offers a few juicy tidbits, but ultimately leaves one wanting more. Still, readers probably don’t expect the agency to pull back its kimono too much, and so most likely won’t be too disappointed by what they find. And those tidbits can be fun, and even informative. Operations Center officers provide the agency’s leaders 24/7 alerts on crucial national security issues and global crises. “While many CIA officers become subject matter experts on specific topics,” the document explains, “Ops Center officers address world-wide political, military and economic issues daily, and they use a wide range of analytic and operational knowledge to support the Agency’s mission at home and abroad.” More tellingly, the article hints at the career path someone wanting to be an Ops Center officer might want to follow. “Bradley,” the officer profiled in the document, earned a double major in world religions and politics and government, as well as a minor in national security studies, and subsequently worked simultaneously as a police officer and dispatcher, a resort manager, as the executive direction of a national security think tank, as a newspaper columnist, and as a freelance marketing consultant. As if that wasn’t enough, he then went to graduate school. Finally, he went to work at the CIA’s Center for Studies in Intelligence, where he interviewed 9/11 Commission and Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission participants about how they worked with the CIA. In the end, though, there’s nothing in the agency’s top-ten list quite as intriguing as the gleam-in-the-eye acknowledgement that it was for year responsible for greater than half of the world’s UFO sightings. One can only wonder whether the camera-toting pigeons were also once-upon-a-time considered UFOs by those who happened to catch a glimpse of something no one would tell the truth about for years. ||||| People from nearly every country share information with CIA, and new individuals contact us daily.

The report shows the investigators from Project BLUE BOOK, the Air Force program tasked with investigating UFO reports, attempted to explain UFO sightings by linking them to natural phenomena. Investigators regularly called the CIA's project staff in Washington to check the reported UFO sightings against the U2's flight logs.

Possible answers: stressed and tired, ready to work overtime, that it might be time to change jobs A:","completion":"From the information given about Skylar's situation, feeling \\"stressed and tired\\" is the most likely emotion she would experience. It is mentioned that Skylar has been bogged down with work, which indicates an excess of tasks and responsibilities. This overwhelming workload can significantly increase a person's stress levels. Constantly dealing with numerous tasks without enough rest may lead to emotional and physical exhaustion, which is otherwise known as feeling 'tired.' Furthermore, the fact that she wishes for a vacation implies that Skylar is longing for a break from her current work environment and routines. Holidays are usually desired when one feels tired or overworked, implying that a period of rest and relaxation is necessary to recharge. On the other hand, if she were feeling ready to work overtime, she would likely not be thinking about vacations, but rather about how she could manage her workload more efficiently or put in extra hours to get everything done. The idea that Skylar may think it's time to change jobs is plausible but seems to be a more drastic response. She may consider seeking other professional opportunities if she perceives her current role as perpetually demanding, with no room for breaks. Generally, the idea of changing jobs originates from consistent discontent with one's work situation. However, as per the context given, Skylar wishes for a vacation, implying that she wants a temporary break from work, not necessarily a complete change of employment. Therefore, given Skylar’s situation as conveyed, her likely feeling of being 'stressed and tired’ can be attributed to her burdening workload and her longing for a vacation. This elevated stress and tiredness do not necessarily mean she is ready to change jobs, but rather that she is in urgent need of some time off to decompress and revitalize. That said, it's also essential to understand that feelings are complex and can be multi-faceted. While the stressed and tired inference appears accurate given the context, her emotions could also be layered with other sentiments not explicitly addressed here, such as frustration, anxiety, or even ambition and determination."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Corbett's autobiography \\"The Roar of the Crowd\\" was the starting point of this lively and well-remembered fictionalized biography. The author was heavyweight champion of the world, succeeding John L. Sullivan, before the turn of the century. The events of the narrative depict Corbett as a brash but likable and intelligent young man whose conquest of the world of boxing and social prejudice in his time, when he was considered merely the son of Irish immigrants, a lowly bank teller and a nobody surprised everyone. It took him several hours of exciting and often amusing screen-time to prove his compeers were wrong. He is an bank teller when the film opens, but he somehow wangles an invitation to a sporting club for the well-to-do. He falls in love with a beautiful but snobbish girl, with whom he always seems to be quarreling, and he lives at home with a brawling clan of Corbetts who seem to fight with one another as often as with others. When he defeats the club's best and a professional fighter borough in to embarrass him, he finally decides to become famous by fighting. he sets out on the road with his friend, who acts as manager and trainer, and despite a few near setbacks, he wins all his bouts and attracts attention. Coming home to pursue his girl again, he contrives to annoy the Boston Strongboy, mighty John L. Sullivan, who enters bars and claims he can \\"lick any man in the world\\". Few believe he can win a bout against Sullivan, but Corbett, dubbed \\"Gentleman Jim\\" for his gracious manners and patrician appearance surprises everyone by moving, dancing out of range, and negating the furious Sullivan's power. The film's finest scene perhaps comes when a beaten Sullivan comes to congratulate Corbett. The new champion rises to the moment, tells Sullivan a few years before it might have been different, and shows him nothing but admiration and respect.

The films is attractive and has a consistent style without being flashy. The script was written by veteran Horace McCoy and Vincent Lawrence from the Corbett novel. Sidney Hickox did the cinematography, with period set decorations by Clarence Steensen and art direction by Ted Smith. Heinz Roemheld did the music and Milo Anderson the gowns. The film was ably directed by action-film specialist Raoul Walsh. Flynn also liked working with Walsh but did not care for the other director he worked for most often, Michael Curtiz.

The Crew's house by the cemetery was less than half a mile from where they'd last seen Winston. Walking, it might've taken ten minutes to get there, but on Chloe's Vespa it was a hair-raising three-minute ride away. When they got there, Paul saw no sign of either Winston or Lily, so he assumed they were still inside the rundown shack that passed for a gallery. They parked a block away and approached at a brisk walk, Paul almost jogging to keep up with Chloe's excited strides. Winston was Chloe's mentor in what they referred to as \\"The Life,\\" this being a euphemism for a whole range of different activities, groups and lifestyles that fell under the general category of living underground and off the information grid. Paul, after defrauding his former partners and then running afoul of the law in a very public way, had been living The Life for almost a year and a half now. Chloe, as near as he could tell, had been doing it for almost a decade. Winston had started in the late '60s as a 16-year-old member of the notorious Weather Underground. He not only led his own Crew, he was also in contact with dozens, maybe scores of other such groups all over the world, including Chloe and Paul's little Crew of four. On top of all that, he'd once taken a couple bullets while helping Paul out, so, like Chloe, Paul had a soft spot in his heart for the old man. They hadn't seen him since that bloody night, but Chloe had been in communication with him off and on over the last sixteen months. Winston and his Crew were old school and didn't trust much in the way of electronic communications. Mostly it had been encoded, hand-delivered letters and arcane classified ads in various newspapers. Chloe found this particular breed of paranoia on Winston's part annoying, but Paul admired it.

Why not a picture of Tim Pawlenty with an unbuttoned shirt relaxing on a couch in the Twin Cities? It should be noted (and Brody acknowledge this): Palin posed for these photos. Granted, it was for a different magazine, but it isn’t like these were private photos that Newsweek acquired. In regards to those specific politicians listed by Brody, I cannot speak (and indeed, do not want to see such photos myself). However, the comment immediately brought to mind the following: Oh, and there’s this” Source for the Washingtonian cover: HuffPo Surely all of this is about, above all else, selling magazines as well as simply part of our current media environment, rather than some specific manifestation of bias, yes?

They have accomplished being biased and sexist at the same time. Quite a feat. This cover has got to be a new low right? They don't use a photo of Palin on the campaign trail. No instead they take the sexy Runners World photo. Yes she posed for it but don't tell me they didn't purposely use that photo to make a point? I predict this cover will become a bigger story over the next 24-48 hours and let's face it. This isn't JUST about media bias. This cover should be insulting to women politicians. Where's the sexy photo of Mitt Romney? Why not a picture of Tim Pawlenty with an unbuttoned shirt relaxing on a couch in the Twin Cities? By the way, where's the Newsweek headline that says, \\"Going Rogue and Going Places?\\" No instead we get Newsweek covers throughout the years like this one: Conservative women are portrayed as nuts and dopey. Liberal women are heroes for the next generation. Oy-vey. Someone get me a sedative. ||||| Here’s an interesting read from David Brody on a point we have not seen mentioned elsewhwere. This week, we were so thrilled to see Time use a decent photo of Hillary Clinton on its cover that we didn’t stop to look at the photo Newsweek (or is that Newsweak?) used of Sarah Palin for the “How Do You Solve A Problem Like Sarah?” issue. For starters, Sarah Palin’s not a problem. If she wants it, the woman’s the 45th President of the United States, barring any decision by Hillary Clinton to take that title for herself. Newsweek lifted a photo taken of Palin, an avid runner, for the fitness magazine Runners World — on whose cover the photo was appropriate — and used it in a political magazine — on whose cover it is not appropriate — to subtlely belittle Palin. As Brody notes, it’s the rare feat of being biased and sexist at the same time. We want to speak directly to conservatives for a minute here: do not allow the Leftist media, which is acting on orders from the White House itself, to convince you Sarah Palin is not your candidate in 2012. They are going to do everything they can think of for the next three years to tell you “Palin is too polarizing”, “Palin’s looks are an issue”, “Palin is crazy”, “Palin is unqualified”, etc. You realize the same nonsense has been done to Hillary Clinton for the last twenty years, especially that polarizing part. For Clinton, being older than Palin, she never endured the “too pretty to be taken seriously” attacks Palin gets (instead, Hillary has always been insulted over her weight, her body type, and her facial expressions). The MSM will continue to tear up female candidates for office because unlike attacks on black people because of their skin color, attacks on politicians because of their gender are not only accepted, but encouraged. ”Heh, heh, heh, that cover’s a good one. Way to hit that Palin, we just hate her so much,” somewhere the collective MSM Sausagefest seems to be saying. Americans, please stop buying Newsweek. Stop buying TIME while you are at it, even if the cover of Clinton is decent this week. Republicans, please start calling out misogyny and sexism wherever you see it because — even when it’s happening to Hillary Clinton or someone else you don’t typically support. You know why? 51% of the population is female. Democrats take women for granted, in the Camille Paglia/Gloria Steinem mindset that thinking women all have to agree with the Liberal cause and default vote Dem. Well, let us assure you, many women have strong FEELINGS while doing their thinking…and if the Republican party became the party that’s known for standing up for women and shouting sexism and misogyny down, women will start to rethink their loyalty to Democrats in 2010 and 2012. Just like with the LGBTQ community, cultural voting traditions are so deep for some people that you might not ever get them to vote GOP, but you might get people — people like us here are HillBuzz — to become so disgusted with how the Democrat Party operates that we move away from our dyed in the wool labels and start seeing us as Independents. Sexism and misogyny in the media is a wedge that could drive enough female voters to Independent status to cost Dems Congress next year and the White House in 2012. If Palin does indeed decide to run for president as we believe she will, the MSM will ratchet all of this nonsense up 100-fold to destroy her. We pledge here today that we will continue to do everything we can to stand up for her. Will you join us? Will you also stand with us when they pull this stuff on Hillary Clinton? What about Michelle Bachmann? What about Martha Coakley, Meg Whitman, Kirsten Gillibrand, Carly Fiorina, Sue Lowden, etc.? What’s happening is that a whole new generation of female politician is rising to prominence without kissing the ring of Gloria Steinem and the Leftist Feminist Brigade. That causes immense jealousy. Urban elitist women don’t like anyone who hasn’t been swimming in the same waters as them, and women like Steinem and Paglia don’t like any woman to be more successful or influential than the two of them think they themselves are. The only women they like are ones they can say, “Oh, she’d be nothing without me. I MADE her. She’s only where she is because I gave her my blessing.” Those are narcissists in feminists’ clothing. If an article’s about a female politician setting out to promote a book that she’s written, photos of her dressed in running gear are not appropriate. Would they run a photo of Mitt Romney in a Speedo or Mike Huckabee wearing his Halloween costume in an article about their thoughts on policy? No. But, that’s because Newsweek wants Romney, Huckabee, Charlie Crist, Tim Pawlenty, or John Huntsman to be the GOP nominee in 2012. They don’t want Sarah. Because Sarah would win. So they have to do everything possible to destroy her every day so they can beat her into submission and convince her not even to run. Sarah, if you’re listening, RUN, GOVERNOR, RUN! ||||| The seed for this crawl was a list of every host in the Wayback Machine This crawl was run at a level 1 (URLs including their embeds, plus the URLs of all outbound links including their embeds) The WARC files associated with this crawl are not currently available to the general public. |||||","completion":"The Newsweek cover featuring Sarah Palin sparked discussion and criticism due to its perceived bias and sexist nature. The cover in question showed Palin in a photoshoot meant for a fitness magazine, Runner's World, with her posing in running gear. Critics argued that the cover was inappropriate for a political magazine and subtly belittled Palin. CBN's David Brody was among the dissenters, asking why Newsweek didn't use similar photos for male politicians like Mitt Romney or Tim Pawlenty. While Palin did pose for the photo in question, critics alleged that Newsweek intentionally chose the image to make a point about her. They believed the use of this image should be considered insulting to women politicians, as it was a stark contrast to the images used for male politicians. The controversy surrounding the cover highlights the ongoing issue of sexism and media bias in the portrayal of female politicians. Despite the backlash, some people tried to justify Newsweek's choice, as the magazine's primary goal is to sell copies. In this context, the cover could be interpreted as a part of the current media environment, where sensationalism often trumps substance. However, the broader issue of sexism and bias in the media remains essential to address. It is important for readers and viewers to be aware of blatant and subtle biases in the media. Female politicians from all political backgrounds, including Hillary Clinton and Michelle Bachmann, have experienced biased or sexist portrayals in the media. In order to promote equality and fairness in the media, people should recognize and call out instances of sexism and misogyny whenever they arise. This goes beyond party lines, as women make up 51% of the population, and support for women candidates can potentially shape the political landscape in future elections."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Jyoti Amge, an Indian girl, is the world's smallest woman.

They discussed the pros and cons of each option, taking into consideration factors such as location, budget, size, and amenities. Now, let's analyze each possibility: Option 1: Eric took the basement apartment that was available. After several discussions, Eric and Craig decided that Eric would take the available basement apartment. This decision was based on both the affordability and the temperament of Eric. As he works in tech and spends most of his time indoors, he didn't mind not having immediate access to a garden for relaxation. The basement apartment also met his budget constraints and offered the added benefit of staying cooler during the summer months, which appealed to Eric. In addition, since the apartment was in a desirable location, Eric believed he could make some modifications to it, such as adding personal and creative touches to make it feel more welcoming. Furthermore, Eric thought he could also install a small indoor garden – complete with artificial lights and low maintenance plants –- to create a more relaxing atmosphere in the space. This way, he could still incorporate a some greenery into his living area, despite being in a basement apartment. Option 2: Craig took the basement apartment that was available. Alternatively, Craig could decide to take the available basement apartment, even though his preference was for a garden apartment. This could occur if the situation forced them to make a quick decision and there were no other available options within their budget. In this case, Craig would need to adapt to the basement apartment's characteristics, finding ways to compensate for the lack of outdoor space. He might choose to add more indoor plants to create a natural atmosphere, invest in an air purifier to maintain good air quality, or search for apartment complexes with shared garden areas to satisfy his desire for outdoor living. The decision to settle for a basement apartment would also entail a commitment from Craig to actively seek ways to spend more time outdoors, such as visiting nearby parks, taking breaks from work at nearby green spaces, or participating in community gardening initiatives. In conclusion, whether Eric took the basement apartment that was available or Craig took the basement apartment that was available, both scenarios would require them to adjust their expectations and find ways to maximize the benefits of their living situations. Ultimately, this experience would teach them the importance of flexibility, compromise, and making the best out of the circumstances presented to them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Neurons are specialized cells that are capable of sending electrical as well as chemical signals. Most neurons contain dendrites, which receive these signals, and axons that send signals to other neurons or tissues. Glia are non-neuronal cells in the nervous system that support neuronal development and signaling. There are several types of glia that serve different functions. Neurons have a resting potential across their membranes and when they are stimulated by a strong enough signal from another neuron an action potential may carry an electrochemical signal along the neuron to a synapse with another neuron. Neurotransmitters carry signals across synapses to initiate a response in another neuron. The vertebrate central nervous system contains the brain and the spinal cord, which are covered and protected by three meninges. The brain contains structurally and functionally defined regions. In mammals, these include the cortex (which can be broken down into four primary functional lobes: frontal, temporal, occipital, and parietal), basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, limbic system, cerebellum, and brainstem—although structures in some of these designations overlap. While functions may be primarily localized to one structure in the brain, most complex functions, like language and sleep, involve neurons in multiple brain regions. The spinal cord is the information superhighway that connects the brain with the rest of the body through its connections with peripheral nerves. It transmits sensory and motor input and also controls motor reflexes. The peripheral nervous system contains both the autonomic and sensory-somatic nervous systems. The autonomic nervous system provides unconscious control over visceral functions and has two divisions: the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The sympathetic nervous system is activated in stressful situations to prepare the animal for a “fight-orflight” response. The parasympathetic nervous...

She understands the importance of consistency and texture in the final product, and wants to ensure that each batter is mixed thoroughly and evenly. By paying close attention to the blending process, she is also able to detect if the consistency is right, if the color suggests that the ingredients are well-incorporated, and if there are any lumps or air pockets that need to be addressed before baking. She begins by turning off the mixer, then carefully-removing the mixing bowl containing the first batter. She uses a rubber spatula to scrape the sides of the bowl and gently fold any unincorporated ingredients back into the batter. This not only ensures a homogenous mixture but also promotes a lighter, more delicate texture in the final baked goods. She periodically checks the consistency of the batter, looking for a smooth, velvety texture without any lumps. As the woman continues working on each batter one by one, she also considers the different flavors and components that each batter will contribute to the final dish. Some of the batters may have special ingredients like nuts, fruits, or chocolate chips, and it's essential that these elements are distributed evenly throughout the batter for consistent flavor and texture. Once she is satisfied with the consistency and texture of each batter, she moves on to prepare the cake pans or baking sheets needed for the next step of the baking process. Depending on the specific recipe, this could involve greasing and flouring cake pans, lining baking sheets with parchment paper, or prepping other specialized bakeware. By ensuring that each batter is thoroughly mixed, and taking her time with each one, the woman is well on her way to creating a delicious, high-quality baked good that's sure to impress her friends and family. Her attention to detail and commitment to excellence will be evident in the final results, as each cake, cookie, or pastry is a testament to her skill and dedication in the kitchen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

So Preston forges a million dollar check via his computer and comes back only to be escorted to the banker thinking that he's juice he gives Preston the money but the real juice came and realized they been duped by a kid! So Preston buys a mansion under the name Macintosh gets a limo driver who says unfunny jokes and goes on a epic shopping spree then he spots Shea and talks about opening his account kid you're loaded and you're talking about opening an account? We soon realized Shea is actually an FBI agent tracking down quigley and his two other accomplice's then he told his cheapy dad he's got a job working for Mr Macintosh and spends the day riding go karts playng vr games and hanging out with his limo driver buddy then he goes out on a date with Shea in a fancy restaurant what a 10 year old wining and dining a 20 something FBI agent?

The coalition commenced hostilities in January 1991, resulting in a decisive victory for the U.S. led coalition forces, which drove Iraqi forces out of Kuwait with minimal coalition deaths. Despite the low death toll, over 180,000 US veterans would later be classified as \\"permanently disabled\\" according to the US Department of Veterans Affairs (see Gulf War Syndrome).

Bountiful food sources might have made Malaysia an inviting place for the contemporaries of Java Man — in 230,000 b.c. But thus far, the country's earliest traces of homo sapiens, found in the Niah Caves of northern Sarawak, are fragments of a skull dating to 40,000 b.c. On the peninsula, the oldest human-related relics (10,000 b.c. ) are Stone Age tools of the Negritos. These small, dark Melanesians are related in type to Australian aborigines and are confined today to the forests of the northern highlands. By 2,000 b.c. , these timid, gentle nomads hunting with bow and arrow were driven back from the coasts by waves of sturdy immigrants arriving in outrigger canoes equipped with sails. Mongolians from South China and Polynesian and Malay peoples from the Philippines and the Indonesian islands settled along the rivers of the peninsula and northern Borneo. They practiced a slash-and-burn agriculture of yams and millet, a technique that exhausted the soil and imposed a semi-nomadic existence from one jungle clearing to another. Families lived in wooden longhouses like those still to be seen today among the Iban peoples of Sarawak. Another unit was added on to the communal dwelling each time a marriage created a new family. Other tough migrants from the South Seas settled along the coasts — sailors, fishermen, traders (for the most part pirates) — known euphemistically as orang laut (sea people).

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Press a hot water bottle against your forehead for a few minutes to make it feel warm to the touch. Alternatively, use a heating pad on a low setting to warm your forehead, but make sure you put something between your face and the heating pad, such as a towel. You don't want to burn yourself! When someone comes in to check on you and feels your forehead, it’ll be warm enough that they’ll think you have a fever. The hot water bottle trick is a classic one when faking a fever, and has been used for decades with great success. Spicy foods, like jalapeños, chiles, or peppers, can actually increase your body temperature. If you have something like this on hand, eat a little bit to raise your temperature naturally. Don’t overdo it, though—you don’t want to get sick or be in serious pain from eating something too spicy! If you overdo it and eat something too spicy, drink some milk. This will help mitigate some of that heat. Another great option to try is a bowl of curry. Try eating that for lunch before faking your symptoms. The simplest thing to do is to cover your head with a blanket for a few minutes. The reflected heat will make you look flushed, as well as increase the temperature of your forehead. Alternatively, do some exercises, like jumping jacks or jogging in place, to make your face flushed. The added rosiness to your skin will make the fever act more believable. Run a washcloth under warm water for a few minutes. Once it's warm, place it over your face, leave it there for a few minutes, then take it off. Alternatively, spritz your face with a fine mist from a spray bottle full of water, instead. Make sure your face isn’t soaked—you only want the appearance of sweaty, clammy skin.

The librarian wanted to put the books on the shelves but they weren't able to hold them because the","completion":"shelves were old and unstable, threatening to collapse under the weight of any more books. The librarian needed to find a solution quickly, as the books were piling up, making it increasingly difficult for patrons to navigate the library. Step 1: Assess the situation The librarian carefully inspected the shelves to determine the extent of the damage and identified which ones needed immediate attention. They noticed that some shelves were barely hanging on by their brackets, while others had missing or broken support beams. Step 2: Prioritize tasks The librarian decided to prioritize fixing the most unstable shelves first to prevent any potential accidents. They also considered which sections of the library were frequented the most, and decided to focus on those areas to minimize disruption to patrons. Step 3: Gather materials and tools To fix the shelves, the librarian needed some basic tools, such as a hammer, nails, a level, and additional wooden support beams. They went to the storage room and collected the necessary items, then returned to the damaged shelves. Step 4: Repair the shelves The librarian began by removing any books already on the unstable shelves to prevent further strain on them. Next, they reinforced the shelves with additional support beams, secured them with nails, and ensured that each shelf was level. The librarian paid close attention to detail, ensuring that each repair was sturdy and made to last. Step 5: Test the shelves Before placing any books back onto the shelves, the librarian placed a few heavy objects on them to test their stability. This would confirm whether the repairs were sufficient and whether the shelves could now safely support the weight of the books. After each shelf passed the stability test, the librarian proceeded to put the books back in their respective places. Step 6: Communicate with library patrons The librarian posted signs around the library to inform patrons of the ongoing repair work and asked for their patience and cooperation during this time. They also encouraged patrons to report any other damaged or unstable shelves they discovered so that these could be added to the repair list. Step 7: Plan for future maintenance To prevent this issue from reoccurring, the librarian decided to implement a regular maintenance schedule for checking and repairing library shelves. This would involve quarterly inspections and timely repairs to ensure that the shelves remained in good condition and able to support the books. As the librarian completed the repairs, they took great pride in knowing that they had restored the library to a safer, more functional environment for all patrons to enjoy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate this to English?","completion":"Considering the important prerequisite in question, it involves introducing a joint, state-level command and control structure to the BH Armed Forces. In this context, the key prerequisite mentioned refers to the establishment of a unified command and control system within the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH). This would require the integration of military units and personnel at a state level, rather than their operating independently or in a fragmented manner. The proposed joint command and control structure would be aimed at improving overall coordination, unified decision-making, and efficient resource management, which subsequently could enhance the effectiveness and capabilities of the BH Armed Forces. The command and control structure is a vital component for any military organization responsible for coordinating its armed forces' efforts to accomplish missions and tasks. In the case of the BH Armed Forces, the implementation of such a system would likely include elements such as centralized decision-making authority, effective communication channels, and hierarchical organization to ensure that all military units are working together towards common goals. This collaborative approach would also help to establish clearer lines of authority, maintain operational transparency, and streamline the process of plan implementation for various military operations. To achieve this state-level command and control structure, the BH Armed Forces would need to undertake significant reforms and restructuring. This transformation could involve merging existing military formations and personnel from different branches, as well as establishing a more comprehensive system of education and training for officers and soldiers. By committing to these changes, the BH Armed Forces would be better positioned to address new and emerging security threats, work effectively with regional and international partners, and contribute to the maintenance of regional peace and stability. In conclusion, the introduction of a joint, state-level command and control structure is an essential prerequisite to bolster the capabilities of the BH Armed Forces. By increasing the level of coordination and cooperation among military units and personnel, the BH Armed Forces can promote a more efficient and effective response to both domestic and international challenges and ultimately become a stronger and more unified force."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: - it is more dense than cool air - It contains hydrogen - it is less flourishing than cool air - it is less dense than cool air A: A:","completion":"Warm air rises higher in the troposphere primarily due to the fact that it is less dense than cool air. This can be explained through an understanding of the basic principles of buoyancy, the behavior of gases, and the structure of Earth's atmosphere. 1. Buoyancy: According to the principle of buoyancy, an object (or in this case, a parcel of air) will tend to rise if it is less dense than the surrounding medium because buoyancy is the force that opposes the weight of the object. In the case of warm air, it expands and becomes less dense due to the increased kinetic energy of its molecules. In contrast, cool air is more compressed and dense, so warm air will rise above the denser cool air when these two air masses meet, creating a buoyant force that pushes the warm air upwards. 2. Gas behavior: Understanding the behavior of gases in relation to temperature can also provide insight into why warm air rises. The ideal gas law states that the pressure of a gas is proportional to its temperature (in Kelvin) and the volume it occupies. When the temperature of a gas increases, the volume of the gas also increases if the pressure is held constant. The increased volume means that there are fewer gas molecules per unit volume, which results in a lower density. As warm air has a higher temperature than cool air, it becomes less dense and is more likely to rise due to buoyancy. 3. Troposphere: The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere, extending from the surface to an altitude of approximately 7-20 kilometers, depending on the location. Temperature decreases with altitude in the troposphere, primarily due to the absorption of solar radiation by the Earth's surface. When warm air at the surface encounters the cooler air aloft, it rises because of its lesser density. As warm air rises, it cools and expands, potentially reaching its condensation point and forming clouds. This process, known as convection, is a key driver of weather systems in the troposphere. In conclusion, warm air rises higher in the troposphere due to its lower density compared to cool air. This phenomenon is fundamental to understanding buoyancy, gas behavior, and weather patterns in the Earth's troposphere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question: Which is a constituency in Lincolnshire that was served by Sir Richard Winfrey as a member of Parliament from 1923-1924? The answer is:","completion":"The constituency in Lincolnshire that was served by Sir Richard Winfrey as a member of Parliament from 1923-1924 is the Gainsborough division. Sir Richard Winfrey was a British newspaper publisher, businessman, and Liberal Party politician who was born on November 5, 1858, in Spalding, Lincolnshire, and died on April 11, 1944. He came from humble beginnings; his father was a farmer and fruit grower, and Winfrey himself initially worked as an apprentice printer. His career took off when he started acquiring newspapers, eventually owning a chain of over 60 newspapers in the Lincolnshire, Norfolk, and Cambridgeshire areas. Sir Richard Winfrey entered into parliamentary politics in 1906 when he contested the South West Norfolk seat as a Liberal Party candidate. He failed to win the election, but he persisted and, in 1910, achieved success by winning the seat for the constituency of South West Norfolk. In 1923, Sir Richard Winfrey was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for the Gainsborough division in Lincolnshire. Gainsborough is a market town in the West Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, and during the time of Winfrey's political career, it was a rural and agricultural area. During his tenure as an MP for Gainsborough, Sir Richard Winfrey was an advocate for rural issues and the development of agriculture. He was particularly interested in supporting farmers and farmworkers, improving living and working conditions in rural areas, and promoting smallholdings, land settlement, and reclamation schemes. In addition to his agricultural interests, he was also concerned with educational reforms and the welfare of the elderly. Sir Richard Winfrey's time representing Gainsborough was brief, as he only served from 1923 to 1924. However, his contributions and efforts as a Member of Parliament for both the Gainsborough division and South West Norfolk had a lasting impact on the communities he represented. His dedication to the well-being of his constituents and the issues that he considered most important – agriculture, land settlement, and social welfare – became defining aspects of his political career. In conclusion, the constituency in Lincolnshire that was served by Sir Richard Winfrey as a Member of Parliament from 1923-1924 was the Gainsborough division. His commitment to improving agricultural practices, rural living conditions, and social welfare made a lasting impression on the region and its inhabitants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: People are passing by a fat person sitting on a bench. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"Given the premise, we cannot definitively conclude the hypothesis, as there is not enough information to directly support the hypothesis. The premise only provides information about an overweight person sitting on a bench reading a magazine, but no information is given regarding other people passing by this person. However, while the hypothesis might not necessarily be concluded from the premise, it is not implausible to imagine a scenario where the hypothesis could be true. The premise describes a situation where an overweight individual is on a bench, reading a magazine. Since benches are typically located in public spaces such as parks, streets, or shopping centers, it is likely that there would be people passing by the overweight person in such locations. The hypothesis suggests that people are passing by a fat person sitting on a bench, which is entirely possible in real-life situations. Depending on the context of the story or the background information provided, the hypothesis could be consistent with the premise, but it cannot be concluded solely based on the information presented in the premise. It is important to note that the premise does not mention any details about the place or surroundings of the bench. It is possible that the bench is located in a secluded area where no one else is around, or it could be in a busy area with heavy foot traffic. The exact scenario would be necessary to either confirm or refute the hypothesis. To make a solid connection between the premise and the hypothesis, additional information about the situation would be required. For example, if the premise also mentioned that this scene took place in a popular park on a sunny day, then it would be more likely to conclude the hypothesis that people are passing by the overweight person. However, in the absence of this context, the hypothesis cannot be conclusively derived from the premise provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Rama Rao came to power defeating the Indian National Congress. He praised the Naxalites for their patriotism before the elections. After coming to power, he demonstrated no significant change in government policy towards the revolutionary movement. Particularly after he was elected for a second time in 1985, his government put all its efforts to suppress the Naxalite movement in the state. Varavara Rao too was subjected to severe repression during this time. Six cases were foisted against him in 1985 alone. In July that year, along with functionaries of other people's organisations, he undertook an all India tour to make the people aware of the repression that was going on in Andhra Pradesh. After visiting Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, New Delhi and Tamil Nadu, Varavara Rao returned to Andhra Pradesh in September to attend court cases. Dr. Ramanatham, a pediatrician and civil liberties activist was a close friend of Varavara Rao. While killing Dr. Ramanatham, and on several other occasions, police openly declared that killing Varavara Rao was their aim. With his life at risk, Varavara Rao could not discharge his duties as Secretary of Virasam and spokesperson of revolutionary literary movement. He was not able to move freely in Andhra Pradesh. Warangal has become a forbidden place for him. Armed and unarmed ruffians and police in civil clothes attacked his house on several occasions. Persecution against his friends in the movement was also mounted. Taking into consideration all these developments, Varavara Rao chose to cancel his bail in Secunderabad Conspiracy Case. On his request, his bail was cancelled and he was sent to jail on 26 December 1985.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What's the surname of the person who tries to drown someone? Long ago, a young Plains warrior is tested by being the target of three different weapons. Centuries later, Ernest P. Worrell works as a maintenance man at Kamp Kikakee but hopes to become a counselor. He quickly becomes a valuable addition to the staff, skilled at Plains Indian Sign Language, used by Kikakee's owner, Chief St. Cloud. A small group of juvenile delinquents, the Second Chancers, come to Kikakee. Head Counselor Tipton assigns Kikakee's most experienced counselor, Ross Stennis, to be the boys' counselor. Stennis is unhappy with this assignment, and he treats the boys harshly. After he goes too far by intentionally causing Moustafa Jones, the smallest boy in the group, to nearly drown in the lake during swimming, only for Moustafa to be rescued by Ernest, the boys retaliate against Stennis's cruelty by toppling his lifeguard perch into the lake, badly injuring Stennis's leg in the process. Since Stennis is no longer able to perform his duties as a counselor and Kikakee is already shorthanded, Tipton offers Stennis's position to Ernest. The Second Chancers initially give Ernest trouble, but they start to show respect during a campfire session when Nurse St. Cloud translates her grandfather's description of the warrior initiation ritual for his tribe. The initiate must hold still while a knife, a stone hatchet, and an arrow are thrown or shot at him. The courage of the young warrior apparently alters the course of each weapon to prevent it from striking him. The Second Chancers build a tepee only to find it burned. They fight Pennington, one of the regular campers, because he was responsible. Tipton is poised to expel them, but Ernest convinces him otherwise. The answer is:","completion":"Stennis. Ross Stennis is the person who tries to drown someone, specifically Moustafa Jones, in the lake during swimming. This cruel act ultimately leads to the Second Chancers retaliating against him by toppling his lifeguard perch into the lake, causing an injury to his leg.

He stabs her in the eye and hacks her leg off with a machete, bagging the leg before he leaves. At the police station the next day, detective Pete Thornton investigates the killing, noting that it is the latest in a series of four murders by a homicidal maniac who has yet to leave any clues. The police chief advises him to continue to pursue the case. At Fuad Ramses Catering store, wealthy socialite Dorothy Fremont arrives, where she arranges for Fuad to cater a party for her daughter Suzette. Fuad agrees and tells Mrs. Fremont that the Egyptian feast that he is preparing has not been served for over 5,000 years. Mrs. Fremont wants the catering done in two weeks, and Fuad assures her that he will have enough time to procure the last of his needed ingredients. After Mrs. Fremont leaves, Fuad ventures to the back storage room where he has displayed a large gold statue of his \\"Egyptian goddess\\" Ishtar. Fuad is preparing a \\"blood feast\\" â a huge vat containing the dead women's body parts â that will ensure the goddess's resurrection.

It was prettily furnished in white, with white curtains, and toilet-table articles in ivory to match. A glance round the room convinced Rolfe that it was impossible for a man to secrete himself in it. The door of the wardrobe had been flung open by the inspector, and the dresses and other articles of feminine apparel it contained flung out on the floor. There was no other hiding-place possible, except beneath the bed, and the ruthless hand of the inspector had torn off the white muslin bed hangings, revealing emptiness underneath. Rolfe went out into the hall again, and entered the room next the bedroom. This apartment was apparently used as a dining-room, for it contained a large table, a few chairs, a small sideboard, a spirit-stand, a case of books and ornaments, and two small oak presses. Plainly, there was no place in it where a man could hide himself. The next room was the bathroom, which was also empty.

Let us take a closer look at the issues present in the sentence and suggest an alternative, linguistically acceptable version. Sentence: \\"Is the boy who holding the plate can see the girl?\\" Issues: 1. Relative clause construction: The sentence employs a relative clause \\"who holding the plate\\" to provide additional information about the boy. However, the verb \\"holding\\" should be preceded by the auxiliary verb \\"is\\" to form the appropriate present continuous tense. 2. Word order: The interrogative structure of the sentence is incorrect. In English, we typically use an auxiliary verb (like \\"do,\\" \\"is,\\" \\"are,\\" \\"can,\\" etc.) before the subject in question-form sentences. However, in the given sentence, the word order is reversed, putting \\"can\\" after the subject \\"the boy.\\" Linguistically acceptable version: \\"Can the boy who is holding the plate see the girl?\\" This corrected version uses the appropriate auxiliary verb \\"is\\" in the relative clause and reorders the auxiliary verb \\"Can\\" to create a proper interrogative sentence structure.

Article: I think it is safe to say that snakes are not popular among most people. It would be hard to find a person who is neutral ,or simply doesn't care one way or the other. What I wonder is why something even without legs causes such great fear. Snakes are quite useful, but that doesn't seem to matter. Snakes help control the population of mice. Without snakes, perhaps we would find mice everywhere. Most of us, however, would rather see a mouse than a snake. The poison argument is a strong one. Some snakes are poisonous, and this causes people's death. However, the poisonous snakes are only a small number. We can't say all the snakes are bad just because of a few dangerous ones. And what do we do with the people who really like snakes? They like snakes even more strongly than we dislike them. These people learn about them, find them out, and watch them carefully. Why? The only reason I can think of is that these people are open-minded. They are able to put aside differences and welcome the snake as a friend. Whatever the reason for our like or dislike, snakes do something good in the circle of life. They would prefer to be left alone, and that is what we should do. If you're lucky, you might not run across more than a few of them in a lifetime. That would be fine with most of us. Question: Although some snakes are poisonous, _ .

Choices: - the colon - the urinary liver - the small intestine - the urinary bladder A:","completion":"The correct answer is the urinary bladder. The urinary bladder is a sac-like organ that serves as a storage unit for urine in the body. It is a hollow, muscular organ located in the lower pelvic region, just behind the pubic bone. The bladder's primary function is to collect and temporarily store urine before it is excreted through the urethra during urination. The other choices mentioned are not directly involved in storing or managing urine: - The colon (large intestine) is a part of the digestive system which is responsible for absorbing water from undigested food and passing the remaining solid waste to the rectum for eventual elimination. It is not involved in urine production or storage. - The term \\"urinary liver\\" is not recognized in the medical field. The liver is a large organ that is responsible for a wide range of bodily functions, including producing bile to aid in digestion, breaking down toxins, and regulating various chemical levels in the body. It does not store or process urine. - The small intestine is another important part of the digestive system. It is where most of the nutrients from ingested food are absorbed. The small intestine measures about 20 feet in length and is divided into three sections: the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. It receives partially digested food from the stomach and continues to break it down using enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the liver. Like the colon, this organ is not involved in urine production or storage. In conclusion, the urinary bladder is the sac-like organ that stores urine before it is excreted from the body. Its muscular walls are capable of stretching to accommodate the increasing volume of urine, and it is an essential component of the urinary system, which also includes the kidneys, ureters, and urethra."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. the minimum arctic sea ice extent in september is largely affected by three conditions: 1) the ice thickness in the early spring, 2) the beginning of the melt season, and 3) the weather during spring and summer. Write the above sentence using proper case.","completion":"The minimum Arctic sea ice extent in September is largely affected by three conditions: 1) the ice thickness in the early Spring, 2) the beginning of the melt season, and 3) the weather during Spring and Summer. In more detail, the minimum Arctic sea ice extent plays a crucial role in understanding climate change, as well as for navigation purposes and the Arctic ecosystem. The three conditions mentioned in the prompt significantly contribute to the fluctuations in this minimum extent. 1) Ice Thickness in Early Spring: The thickness of the ice in the early months of Spring sets the foundation for how much ice will eventually melt during the warmer months. Thinner ice is more prone to quick melting, whereas thicker ice inhibits the melt rate. Ice thickness in the early Spring is affected by a combination of factors such as air and ocean temperatures, wind patterns, and accumulation from the previous winter. Greater ice thickness provides insulation and reduces heat transfer between the ocean and atmosphere, thus delaying the onset of the melting season. 2) Beginning of the Melt Season: The initiation of the melt season is another important factor affecting the minimum Arctic sea ice extent in September. The earlier the melt season starts, the longer the ice has to melt, resulting in a larger extent of ice loss by the end of summer. The timing of the melt season is influenced by factors such as temperature, solar radiation, and the presence of melt ponds on the sea ice surface. Melt ponds, which are shallow pools of melted water, can change the ice's reflectivity, also known as its albedo, causing it to absorb more sunlight and expedite melting. 3) Weather During Spring and Summer: The weather conditions experienced in the Arctic throughout Spring and Summer also play a crucial role in determining the minimum extent of sea ice in September. Factors such as air temperature, wind patterns, and cloud cover can all contribute to the ice melting and extent. Warmer air temperatures can cause the ice to melt faster, whereas persistent winds can either break up the ice or push it into thicker ice packs. Cloud cover can either help slow down ice melting by reducing the amount of solar radiation reaching the surface or have a cooling effect by reflecting sunlight back into space. The weather during these crucial melting months naturally influences the ice extent, playing a part in the variations seen from year to year. By taking these three conditions into account and considering their interplay, researchers and scientists can better predict and understand the continuous changes in the minimum Arctic sea ice extent in September. This information is valuable not only for understanding the realities of climate change but also for addressing its impacts on the Arctic ecosystem, wildlife, and local communities that depend on a stable habitat and conditions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This text is missing some spaces, please add them: Allthecapitalreceivedbythebusinesseshavetoyieldaprofitinoneortheotherway.","completion":"All the capital received by the businesses have to yield a profit in one or the other way. Capital is the lifeblood of any business, as it is the foundation upon which growth, expansion, and success are built. When businesses receive capital, whether it is through investments, loans, or internally generated funds, they are expected to use that capital to generate a profit over time. This can be achieved through various means, such as innovation, productivity improvements, marketing, and cutting operational costs. Ultimately, businesses must ensure that the capital they receive yields a return, as this is essential for their long term viability. There are several ways in which businesses can use the capital they receive to generate profit, and these strategies can be broadly categorized into two main approaches: revenue generation and cost reduction. Here is a detailed look at both these strategies: 1. Revenue Generation: Revenue generation is the process of earning income from the sale of goods or services to customers. There are several ways businesses can increase their revenue generation capabilities, and some common approaches include: a. Expanding the product or service offerings: By introducing new products or services, businesses can attract new customers and drive additional sales from existing customers, thereby increasing their revenue. b. Expanding market presence: Businesses can expand into new markets or regions, thereby reaching out to a larger customer base. This strategy enables businesses to benefit from increased sales and associated profits. c. Innovating and improving existing products or services: By continuously enhancing their offerings, businesses can stay ahead of the competition and retain customer loyalty, helping drive increased sales and revenues. d. Implementing effective marketing strategies: Through targeted marketing efforts, businesses can increase brand awareness and make their products or services more appealing to their target audience, ultimately leading to increased sales and revenues. e. Developing strategic partnerships and alliances: By collaborating with other businesses, companies can expand their service offerings, access to new markets, or share resources, thereby driving incremental revenue for both parties. 2. Cost Reduction: Reducing costs is another key strategy businesses can deploy to increase their profitability. By lowering their operational expenses and input costs, businesses can improve their overall margins, allowing them to retain a greater share of the revenues they generate. Some common cost reduction approaches include: a. Improving operational efficiency: By streamlining operations and enhancing productivity through technology adoption or process improvements, businesses can minimize operational costs and waste. b. Reducing supply chain expenses: By strategically partnering with suppliers or adopting a more efficient inventory management system, businesses can cut down on procurement or raw material expenses. c. Optimizing human resource management: By managing labor costs effectively, such as hiring temporary employees or outsourcing non-core operations, businesses can lower their operational expenses. d. Lowering marketing costs: By utilizing cost-efficient marketing tools such as digital channels, social media, or influencer marketing, businesses can reduce their marketing expenses while reaching their desired target audience. e. Implementing energy efficiency measures: By adopting green practices and efficient energy usage, businesses can minimize their utility expenses and generate savings that contribute to their profitability. In conclusion, businesses should actively deploy strategies to ensure that the capital they receive yields a profit, as this is fundamental to their long-term success. By adopting revenue generation and cost reduction strategies, businesses can effectively harness capital to drive growth and expansion, ultimately creating value for their shareholders and stakeholders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This phrase specifies that the woman is wearing a brown dress. 3. \\"Jumps off\\": The main action being described in the statement relates to the woman 'jumping off'. This indicates that the lady is performing a “jumping” action, which involves propelling oneself into the air. 4. \\"Some stairs\\": This provides information about the location where the action is being carried out. The woman is jumping off a set of stairs, indicating that she is at an elevated height compared to her immediate surroundings. 5. \\"Outside a building\\": This gives us more contextual information about the woman's location. The statement clarifies that this instance of her jumping off the stairs is happening outside a building rather than inside. To recap, the given statement shares details about a female subject, her appearance, her action, and the specifics of her location. We can, therefore, focus on the essential part of the sentence - \\"A woman is jumping.\\" With all the information provided in the sentence, we can justifiably and accurately conclude that \\"A woman is jumping.\\" The additional components of the statement – her attire, her exact location, and the fact that she is outside a building – simply serve to provide a more detailed picture of the entire scene and circumstances."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","completion":"Title: Feature-Rich and Intuitive, Just Needs Some Tweaks Review: I've been using the com.github.wdkapps.fillup app for a few weeks now, and overall, I've found it to be a valuable and reliable tool. There's a lot to appreciate about the app, and I'll break down my thoughts step-by-step. Step 1: Evaluating the User Interface The user interface is visually appealing and straightforward, which makes it easy to navigate. Icons and buttons are well-placed and responsive. I really appreciate the ease with which I can input data and access features. However, there is some room for improvement with better organization of menus. Step 2: Assessing App Functionality The app does an excellent job of tracking fuel consumption and expenses, with options to display information in different units and a variety of charts and graphs. The reminders for maintenance tasks are a useful feature as well. There's a wealth of data available, and it's clear that a lot of thought went into the design of the app. Step 3: Evaluating Performance and Reliability In terms of performance, the app runs smoothly and doesn't drain the battery. However, I have encountered a few minor bugs while using it. These hiccups were mostly related to data syncing, but the issues were resolved after a short period. I hope the developers can iron out these problems in future updates. Step 4: Assessing Customer Support Customer support is crucial for any app, and I found that the developers were responsive through their support channels. They addressed my queries and provided timely updates. However, I'd appreciate a more detailed FAQ section on their website and within the app to empower users to find solutions independently. In conclusion, the com.github.wdkapps.fillup app offers a robust set of features and impressive ease of use, making it a valuable tool for keeping track of vehicle expenses and fuel consumption. A few minor bugs and some areas in need of improvement led me to give the app a 4-star rating. With continued updates and attention to user feedback, I have no doubt that this app could easily reach a 5-star rating in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

She seeks shelter there, only to find another pack of zombies.

The group is divided over what their next course of action should be. Harry believes everyone should retreat to the cellar and barricade the door to wait for the authorities. Ben thinks the cellar is a \\"death trap\\" and that they would be better served fortifying the house, which at least has alternate escape routes, and Barbara suggests that the group should simply leave the house on foot after she notices the zombies' limited mobility.

Information: - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea. - Sweyn Forkbeard (Old Norse: \\"Sveinn Tjúguskegg\\"; Danish: \\"Svend Tveskæg\\"; 960 3 February 1014) was king of Denmark, England, and parts of Norway. His name appears as Swegen in the \\"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\\". He was the son of King Harald Bluetooth of Denmark, and the father of Cnut the Great. - The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is a collection of annals in Old English chronicling the history of the Anglo-Saxons. The original manuscript of the \\"Chronicle\\" was created late in the 9th century, probably in Wessex, during the reign of Alfred the Great. Multiple copies were made of that one original and then distributed to monasteries across England, where they were independently updated. In one case, the \\"Chronicle\\" was still being actively updated in 1154. - Harald II of Denmark ( died 1018 ) was King of Denmark from 1014 until his death in 1018 . He was the eldest son of Sweyn Forkbeard and Gunhild of Wenden , and was regent while his father was fighting Ethelred the Unready in England . He inherited the Danish throne in 1014 , and held it while his brother , the later king Cnut the Great conquered England . After his death in 1018 , he was succeeded by Cnut the Great . Little detail is known about Harald II. - Gunhilda of Wenden was a semi-legendary Polish or other Slavic princess and Danish Viking age queen consort, the supposed spouse of 10th-century King Sweyn I of Denmark (9861014). - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea. - The Viking Age is the period from late 8th century to mid 11th century in European history, especially Northern European and Scandinavian history, following the Germanic Iron Age. It is the period of history when Scandinavian Norsemen explored Europe by its seas and rivers for trade, raids, colonisation and conquest. In this period, the Norsemen settled in Norse Greenland, Newfoundland, and present-day Faroe Islands, Iceland, Norway, Scotland, England, Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany, Ukraine, Russia, and Turkey. Though Viking travellers and colonists were seen at many points in history as brutal raiders, many historical documents suggest that their invasion of other countries was retaliation in response to the encroachment upon tribal lands by Christian missionaries, and perhaps by the Saxon Wars prosecuted by Charlemagne and his kin to the south, or, were motivated by overpopulation, trade inequities, and the lack of viable farmland in their homeland. Information about the Viking Age is drawn largely from what was written about the Vikings by their enemies, and primary sources of archaeology, supplied with secondary sources like the Icelandic Sagas. - King Cnut the Great (Old Norse: \\"Knútr inn ríki\\"; c. 995 12 November 1035), also known as Canute, was King of Denmark, England, and Norway, together often referred to as the Anglo-Scandinavian or North Sea Empire. After his death, the deaths of his heirs within a decade, and the Norman conquest of England in 1066, his legacy was mostly forgotten. The medieval historian Norman Cantor stated that he was \\"the most effective king in Anglo-Saxon history\\", although Cnut himself was Danish and not a Briton or Anglo-Saxon.

Would project B have reduced or enlarged data volume than porject C? Bob works for a data storage company. He has now three projects, project A, project B, and project C, simultaneously going on. All of them involves storing XML data. Project A has small volume of data, but project B and project C has large volume of data. He applied Fast Infoset format for project B, but didn't apply that format for project C. Hint: Storing large volumes of data – When storing XML to either file or database, the volume of data a system produces can often exceed reasonable limits, with a number of detriments: the access times go up as more data is read, CPU load goes up as XML data takes more power to process, and storage costs go up. By storing XML data in Fast Infoset format, data volume may be reduced by as much as 80 percent.","completion":"Based on the given paragraph, project B would have a reduced data volume compared to project C. The reason for this is the implementation of the Fast Infoset format for project B. Both project B and project C involve large volumes of XML data. However, the use of Fast Infoset format for project B significantly decreases its data volume. According to the hint provided, Fast Infoset can reduce data volume by as much as 80 percent. When storing XML data, the volume of data can often exceed reasonable limits, which results in increased access times, CPU load, and storage costs. By utilizing Fast Infoset format for project B, Bob effectively mitigates these challenges that come with handling large volumes of data. As project C does not implement the Fast Infoset format, it would not benefit from the same data volume reduction as project B. In conclusion, project B would have a reduced data volume in comparison to project C due to the application of the Fast Infoset format. This format helps address the challenges that come with managing large volumes of XML data, such as increased access times, CPU load, and storage costs, making project B more efficient in terms of data storage and processing."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is common for parents to be concerned when they notice a sudden change in their child's behavior, and in this case, the mother would likely be curious to know what caused the shift in his attitude toward studying. There could be several factors contributing to Little Johnny's newfound dedication to hitting the books. It is possible that he had a motivational trigger, such as a goal he wants to achieve or a desire to improve his grades. It could also be that he has developed an interest in a particular subject or discovered a new learning strategy that has made studying more enjoyable and effective for him.

The Gibson Les Paul, the most iconic and popular model, remains a sought-after instrument by professional guitarists and aspiring musicians alike. Another groundbreaking contribution from Les Paul was the introduction of multitrack recording, which enabled musicians and producers to create more complex and polished recordings than ever before. Before multitrack recording, artists were forced to record all of their instruments and vocals simultaneously, limiting their creative control. With the development of this stellar recording technique, musicians gained the ability to overdub and layer recordings – ultimately transforming the music production process and shaping the modern sound we know today. During the early '50s, Les Paul, along with his then-wife Mary Ford, achieved remarkable success on the charts. Their unique blend of smooth vocal harmonies and intricate guitar playing produced several hits, including \\"How High the Moon,\\" \\"Vaya con Dios,\\" and \\"Mockin' Bird Hill.\\" The duo captured the hearts of audiences and listeners throughout the world, creating an unforgettable partnership and an unmatched sound that persists as an influence on contemporary musicians. Legendary blues musician B.B. King fittingly described Les Paul as \\"the founding father of modern music.\\" Indeed, Paul's innovations as a guitarist, engineer, producer, and performer have transcended genre boundaries and inspired countless artists across the musical spectrum. His invaluable contributions to the world of music continue to resonate with guitarists, producers, and fans alike, serving as a testament to his brilliant mind and remarkable talent. Though Les Paul is no longer with us, the legacy he leaves behind will echo through the halls of music history forever. His inventive spirit, relentless pursuit of excellence, and unparalleled musicianship set the foundation for the contemporary sounds and techniques embraced by musicians worldwide. Les Paul's life and career serve as a reminder that passion, creativity, and innovation are the cornerstones of transformative music – and, in his memory, we should all strive to uphold these values as we continue to explore and redefine the boundaries of sound and art."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

No Doubt is an American ska band from Anaheim, California, that formed in 1986. Since 1994, the group has consisted of vocalist Gwen Stefani, bassist and keyboardist Tony Kanal, guitarist and keyboardist Tom Dumont, and drummer Adrian Young. Since the mid-1990s in live performances and the studio, they have been supported by keyboardist and trombonist Gabrial McNair and keyboardist and trumpeter Stephen Bradley. The ska sound of their song, \\"Trapped in a Box\\" (1992), that was featured on their first album The band began work on its next album the next year, but Interscope rejected much of its material, and the band was paired with producer Matthew Wilder. Eric did not like to relinquish creative control to someone outside the band and eventually stopped recording and rehearsing. He left No Doubt in 1994 to resume an animation career with the cartoon TV series The Simpsons. Kanal then ended his seven-year relationship with Gwen, saying that he needed \\"space.\\" Unsure of what to do with the band, Interscope sublicensed the project to Trauma Records in 1993. No Doubt released The Beacon Street Collection, consisting of outtakes from its previous recording sessions, that year on its own label, Beacon Street Records. Mixing 1980s punk rock and some grunge influences into the band's sound, the album contains a rawer sound than No Doubt, and it sold more than three times as many copies as its predecessor. Later that year, the label released Tragic Kingdom, much of which dealt with the relationship between Tony Kanal and Gwen Stefani. The release of 1995's Tragic Kingdom and the single \\"Just a Girl\\" allowed the group to achieve mainstream commercial success. No Doubt began touring in support of the album late that year, and it grew into a 27-month international tour. In 1996, the second single, \\"Spiderwebs\\", was successful, and \\"Don't Speak\\", a ballad written by Gwen and Eric Stefani about Gwen and Kanal's break-up, was released as the third single and broke the previous record when it topped the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay for sixteen weeks. No Doubt was nominated for two Grammy Awards for Best New Artist and Best Rock Album at the 1997 Grammy Awards. By the end of the year, half of the songs on Tragic Kingdom had been released as singles, and the album was certified eight times platinum. Later, they were nominated for two more Grammys for Song of the Year and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, both for \\"Don't Speak\\". The Recording Industry Association of America certified the album diamond in February 1999, and with worldwide sales of sixteen million, it is one of the best-selling albums in history. The band's self-titled debut album began selling copies again off of the success of Tragic Kingdom and reached total sales of over a quarter of a million copies. The album's release fueled a dispute between Trauma and Interscope Records over No Doubt's recording contract. Trauma sued for US100 million for breach of contract, fraud, and extortion and sought to have its joint venture agreement ended, claiming that Interscope had reneged on its contract after the band had become more successful than expected. No Doubt had previously stated that it had switched to Trauma Records and that the transition was \\"really great...because now we have the attention and the focus of a small indie label.\\" The case was settled out of court with a 3 million payment.","completion":"This text is about the American ska band, No Doubt."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the following sentence linguistically acceptable? Ellen conferred to Helen.","completion":"The sentence \\"Ellen conferred to Helen\\" is not entirely linguistically acceptable. The verb \\"confer\\" requires the preposition \\"with\\" instead of \\"to\\" to convey the appropriate meaning, making the correct sentence \\"Ellen conferred with Helen.\\" There are a few reasons behind this, which I'll explain in detail below. First of all, let's examine the verb \\"confer.\\" The word \\"confer\\" is used when someone is discussing or consulting with another person, typically to exchange ideas, opinions, or advice. In some cases, it can also mean to grant or bestow an honor, degree, or favor. The verb \\"confer\\" is a transitive verb, meaning that it usually requires a direct object or the presence of an object introduced by a preposition. The choice of prepositions in the English language can often be unpredictable and arbitrary. However, in the case of \\"confer,\\" the preposition \\"with\\" is commonly used. \\"With\\" is generally used to indicate the involvement or association of more than one person. Therefore, \\"confer with\\" usually means to have a discussion or consultation in which several parties share perspectives and seek a common understanding or solution. When you use the preposition \\"to\\" in the sentence, it indicates the direction of the action or movement, which doesn't fit the definition of \\"confer.\\" It suggests that one person is doing something to another person, but \\"confer\\" implies a mutual exchange between individuals. Now, let's look at the corrected sentence: \\"Ellen conferred with Helen.\\" In this sentence, the use of the preposition \\"with\\" represents the mutual exchange of information, ideas, or opinions between Ellen and Helen. It is more suitable than \\"to\\" in conveying the intended meaning correctly. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Ellen conferred to Helen\\" is not linguistically acceptable because of the improper use of the preposition \\"to.\\" The correct sentence should be \\"Ellen conferred with Helen.\\" By using the appropriate preposition \\"with,\\" the sentence accurately reflects the meaning of the verb \\"confer\\" and adheres to the conventions of the English language."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: - change and energy - energy and motion - force and matter - matter and energy A: A:","completion":"The most basic concepts in the field of physical science are matter and energy. This information can be found in the given paragraph which states, \\"Matter and energy are the most basic concepts in physical science.\\" Matter refers to anything that has mass and occupies space. It is a generalized term for the substance of which all observable physical objects are composed. Matter is typically classified into three common states, namely solid, liquid, and gas. Furthermore, matter can undergo phase transitions, such as melting, freezing, evaporation, and condensation, when exposed to varying temperatures and pressures. It can also be broken down into its fundamental building blocks, including atoms, subatomic particles like electrons, protons, and neutrons, and even smaller particles like quarks. Energy, on the other hand, is defined as the capacity to do work or transfer heat. It exists in various forms, such as kinetic energy (the energy of motion), potential energy (the energy stored due to an object's position or configuration), thermal energy (heat), chemical energy (as a result of chemical reactions), and electromagnetic energy (including light, radio waves, and other forms of electromagnetic radiation). Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, according to the law of conservation of energy, but it can be converted from one form to another. Physical science is the systematic study of the inorganic world, as distinct from the study of the organic world (which is the province of biological science). Physical science is often subdivided into various branches, including physics, chemistry, astronomy, and earth science, all of which study different aspects of matter and energy in various contexts. In summary, the most basic concepts in the field of physical science are matter and energy. An understanding of these fundamental principles allows scientists to explore the complex interactions and relationships between different physical systems at multiple scales, from subatomic particles to the largest celestial structures in the universe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information: - The wood frog (\\"Lithobates sylvaticus\\" or \\"Rana sylvatica\\") has a broad distribution over North America, extending from the southern Appalachians to the boreal forest with several notable disjunct populations including lowland eastern North Carolina. The wood frog has garnered attention by biologists over the last century because of its freeze tolerance, relatively great degree of terrestrialism (for a ranid), interesting habitat associations (peat bogs, vernal pools, uplands), and relatively long-range movements. The ecology and conservation of the wood frog has attracted research attention in recent years because they are often considered \\"obligate\\" breeders in ephemeral wetlands (sometimes called \\"vernal pools\\") that are themselves more imperiled than the species that breed in them. The wood frog has been proposed to be the official state amphibian of New York. - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - The true frogs, family Ranidae, have the widest distribution of any frog family. They are abundant throughout most of the world, occurring on all continents except Antarctica. The true frogs are present in North America, northern South America, Europe, Asia, Madagascar, Africa, and from the East Indies to New Guinea; the species native to Australiathe Australian wood frog (\\"Hylarana daemelii\\")is restricted to the far north. - The Australian wood frog (\\"Hylarana daemeli\\"), locally simply known as the wood frog, is the only species from the family Ranidae found in Australia. The species is restricted to the rainforest of northern Queensland, the eastern border of Arnhem Land, in the Northern Territory, and much of New Guinea. Long placed in the \\"wastebin genus\\" \\"Rana\\", it is now in \\"Hylarana\\" together with such species as the common green frog of Southeast Asia. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats. - The southern leopard frog ( Rana sphenocephala ) is a species of mostly aquatic true frog , found in the south - eastern third of the United States . There are two accepted subspecies . - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction.

Albrecht Durer (/'dU@r@r, 'djU@r@r/; German: ['albRect 'dy:Ra]; 21 May 1471 - 6 April 1528) was a painter, printmaker and theorist of the German Renaissance. Born in Nuremberg, Durer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties, due to his high-quality woodcut prints. He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci, and from 1512 he was patronized by emperor Maximilian I. His vast body of work includes engravings, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, watercolours and books. The woodcuts, such as the Apocalypse series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work. His well-known engravings include the Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514) and Melencolia I (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium. Durer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance. This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, perspective and ideal proportions.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: London Dreams, directed by Vipul Shah, is a frustratingly foolish film about foolish people. It's the kind of film whose central conflict could be instantly resolved if the characters concerned simply sat down and had a chat. Ajay Devgan plays Arjun, an aspiring pop-artiste obsessed with performing before a cheering crowd at London's Wembley Stadium. He becomes jealous of his devoted best friend and band-mate Manu, played by Salman Khan, who is evidently more talented than him, but nowhere near as focused or ambitious. Arjun decides to sabotage Manu when the latter's popularity threatens to outshine his own. Now here's where a heart-to-heart might have helped. Had Arjun explained what this Wembley fixation meant to him, Manu would have graciously backed off and let Arjun fulfill his childhood dream, and we'd have been spared the agony of watching the rest of this uninspiring drivel. But director Vipul Shah and his writers are in no mood to do us any favours. London Dreams is packed with unintentionally hilarious gems like that back-story involving Arjun's grandpa who committed suicide out of shame for getting stage-fright at a packed Wembley concert. Or the ridiculous incident at a show where Manu must take over vocal responsibilities after a blast of confetti practically chokes Arjun into silence. The idiocy, however, doesn't end there. In his attempts to shame Manu publicly, Arjun uses his connections to get Manu hooked onto drugs. A buxom groupie urges Manu to down a couple of tequila shots with her but replaces his salt with cocaine. Before you know it, Manu has acquired quite the appetite for the addictive white powder, practically chomping it down like dinner. If that isn't silly enough, there's a crude scene later in which Manu chases after the said girl to find out who she's been taking orders from. The pursuit ends in a dark London alley where the girl gets down on her knees pretending to do the unmentionable so as to mislead Manu's girlfriend who's been secretly following after them. Wait, there's more! Expect to howl hysterically when Arjun snaps off his belt and whips himself mercilessly to banish all thoughts of romance or lust towards the band's lead dancer Priya (played by Asin) because nothing and no one must distract him from his musical goals. Too generously inspired by Milos Forman's Amadeus for it to merit any comparison with last year's Rock On!, Vipul Shah's latest is a clunky melodrama that's as loosely directed as it is scripted. The film goes for broad humor, over-the-top emotions, and basically chooses loudness over subtlety. That works for Manu's character, with Salman Khan playing him all loutish and lovable, but in the case of Arjun, Ajay Devgan comes off too passive with a performance that is mostly internalised. When Arjun does reach boiling point however, it results in an awkward pre-climax scene in which he lectures a packed concert hall and is understandably pelted with plastic bottles as punishment. Of the remaining cast, there's not a kind word I can say for Asin, who practically lit up Ghajini with her ebullient charm, but disappoints here with unnecessary over-acting in a thankless role. Ranvijay Singh and Aditya Roy Kapur, reduced to mere sidekicks in the band, show up at regular intervals, usually to utter some inane dialogue like, \\"We'll rock it dude!\\" For its dim-witted writing and sloppy direction, London Dreams is ultimately a tiresome watch. If you must, watch it for Salman Khan who's turned buffoonery into a bonafide acting style. It's the only thing that'll make you smile in this sad, sad film.","completion":"The sentiment of the given review can be categorized as largely negative.

It was coming up on Mother's Day, and he usually tried to go back home, but this time he was too tired. He was in a small town outside of Little Rock when he drove by a flower shop. He decided to send his mother some roses. He went into the shop and saw a young man talking to the florist. \\"How many roses can I get for six dollars, ma'am?\\" the boy asked. The florist tried to explain that roses were expensive. Maybe he should be happy with carnations . \\"No, I have to have roses,\\" he said, \\"My mom was sick so much last year and I had little time with her. It has to be red roses, 'cause that's her favourite.\\" The florist shook her head. John was touched by the boy, who wanted to get those roses so badly. John looked at the florist and silently mouthed that he would pay for the boy's roses. Then the florist said, \\"Ok, I will give you a dozen red roses for your six dollars.\\" The young man almost jumped into the air. He took the flowers and ran from the store. It was worth the extra thirty-five dollars just to see that kind of excitement.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"the production of heat. Shivering occurs when many muscles contract a little bit all at once due to involuntary contractions. This physiological response is primarily caused by a drop in body temperature, which can be triggered by various factors such as exposure to cold environments, fever, or underlying medical conditions. The primary purpose of shivering is to conserve and generate heat to maintain the optimal core body temperature, ensuring the normal functioning of various physiological processes. When muscles contract, they utilize energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). During muscle contractions, chemical bonds in ATP molecules are broken, releasing energy that is transformed into mechanical work and heat. In the case of shivering, many small contractions occur simultaneously in several muscle groups across the body. Because of the sheer number of contractions, the overall heat production increases, ultimately offsetting the heat loss experienced due to the drop in body temperature. The other provided answer choices are not directly related to the phenomenon of shivering and the associated muscle contractions. Production of cells, preventing heat transfer, keeping body heat, recovery time from fatigue, production of cold, and production of skin do not accurately describe the outcome of multiple minor muscle contractions.

Terrier was a simple man, with a heart of gold and the courage of lion. Life had always been an adventure for him, full of excitement and unpredictability. But, amidst it all, there was one constant, his enchanting love, Annie. Annie, with her sparkling eyes and radiant smile, was a woman of grace and charm. They had grown up together in this little corner of the world and their love story was just as beautiful as the surroundings they lived in. But as Terrier was falling deeper and deeper in love with Annie, something far more colossal was happening in their country. A civil war had erupted, tearing the country apart. Homes were turned into battlefields, the laughter of children drowned in the echoes of gunshots. Children were forced to grow up too soon, and adults were pushed to their extreme limits. The civilians were suffering but amid the burning fire and deafening shelling, some entities continued to prosper, oblivious to the pain of the common people. Large multinational mining companies, with their vast resources and global reach, continued to exploit the country's rich mineral resources. They remained detached from the reality of civil unrest and political instability. They stripped the land of its natural gifts, making profits while contributing little to the suffering society. As the country burned in the flames of war, a cunning and ambitious man named Cox saw an opportunity amongst the turmoil. An old acquaintance of Terrier, he had taken a different path in life. Convincing some influential people in the Pentagon, Cox had managed to form a large international security firm. Offering their services back to the Pentagon, he swiftly grew his enterprise into a formidable force. His teams quickly gained a reputation for their ruthlessness and efficiency. However, their predatory nature soon had them cross paths with Terrier. To Cox, Terrier was a problem that needed to be eliminated, a rebel that kept fueling the fire of resistance. While their motive remained obscure, one thing was certain – they wouldn’t stop until they had Terrier. In a deadly game of cat and mouse, Terrier found himself on the run. His tranquility was disrupted, his peace shattered. The love of his life, Annie, and his friends fell into the crosshairs of Cox’s merciless hit team. The town where Terrier had once found peace and love was now a hunting ground for ruthless killers. The once serene streets, overwhelmed with fear and violence. Would Terrier be able to save his friends and his beloved Annie from this savage threat? Only time would tell."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the name of the album released in 1994 by the band from Athens, Georgia?, using the article: R.E.M. was an American rock band from Athens, Georgia, formed in 1980 by drummer Bill Berry, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist/backing vocalist Mike Mills, and lead vocalist Michael Stipe. One of the first alternative rock bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style, Stipe's distinctive vocal quality and obscure lyrics, Mills' melodic basslines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical style of drumming. R.E.M. released its first single—\\"Radio Free Europe\\"—in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, Murmur, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single \\"The One I Love\\". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide. By the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as a pioneer of the genre. The band then released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound and catapulted it to international fame. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound, but still continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. Its 1996 release, New Adventures in Hi-Fi, though critically acclaimed, fared worse commercially than its predecessors. The following year, Bill..., what would be the answer ?

Is it true that can birds fly if their wings are clipped based on the following text? A 'light' symmetrical wing-clip will allow a bird to fly down and land safely while indoors. However such a clip may not prevent the bird from flying when outdoors, since lift is generated in proportion to wind speed. Many escaped birds which are recovered are found to have been clipped. So, while a light clip allows downward flight indoors, it does not prevent a bird gaining lift if it should escape outdoors. Conversely, a more severe clip will certainly render a bird flightless, but it increases the risk of injury if the bird falls and hits a hard surface. In addition to the physical effects of wing-clipping, there can be adverse behavioural effects. Birds use flight as an instinctive reflex action and as their first means of escaping any threat: they take to the air to fly upwards and away from the source of the threat; their fear then dissipates. Where this behaviour is prevented by wing-clipping, this innate reflex action is denied the bird, and its fear will not subside. This may cause behavioural problems for the afflicted bird. When a bird needs to reduce its speed during flight, it employs a 'reverse thrust' action by extending its wing at the wrist joint and using the drag of its primaries as air brakes. While the reduced function of the clipped bird's primaries prevent propulsion and therefore lift, this also reduces braking abilities, so clipped birds may crash-land at higher speeds than full-winged birds. Clipped birds should not be taken outdoors unrestrained, as even clipped birds have been known to fly away when spooked outdoors. Pick from: (A). no (B). yes","completion":"Based on the given text, the answer is (B). Yes, birds can fly if their wings are clipped, but their ability to fly depends on the extent of the wing-clip and the environmental conditions. The text mentions a \\"light\\" symmetrical wing-clip, which allows a bird to fly down and land safely while indoors. However, such a clip may not prevent the bird from gaining lift when outdoors, as lift is generated in proportion to wind speed. This is supported by the fact that many escaped birds that are recovered were found to be clipped. On the other hand, a more severe wing-clip will render a bird flightless, increasing the risk of injury if the bird falls and hits a hard surface. Clipped birds may also experience adverse behavioral effects due to their reduced ability to fly and escape threats, which could lead to behavioral problems. Another point considered is that clipped birds have reduced braking abilities during flight. This is because the primaries, which are responsible for propulsion and lift, are also used as air brakes. Therefore, clipped birds may crash-land at higher speeds than full-winged birds. The text also states that clipped birds should not be taken outdoors unrestrained, which implies that they may still have some flight capabilities even after being clipped. As a result, the answer to whether birds can fly if their wings are clipped is (B). Yes, they can, but their ability to fly and maneuver depends on the extent of the wing-clip and the environmental conditions in which they find themselves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please add punctuation to this: Moving captured funds as above former thieves and criminals turn into todays investors","completion":"\\"Moving captured funds, as above, former thieves and criminals turn into today's investors.\\" In the above sentence, a comma is used after the phrase \\"Moving captured funds\\" to separate it from the rest of the sentence. This makes the sentence read more fluently and makes the subject and its action (\\"Moving captured funds\\") clearer. Next, a comma is used again after \\"as above\\", providing a natural pause and again offering clarity for the reader. It's separating two distinct but related thoughts within the same sentence. Lastly, an apostrophe was used in the word \\"today's\\" to show possession: the investors belong to today, i.e., they are the investors of today. Without the apostrophe, \\"todays\\" would seem to be a noun or an adverb, which would not make sense in this context. Technically, the absence of the apostrophe would make the word incorrect in any context, since \\"today\\" is a noun, and cannot be pluralized or used as an adverb without some alteration. So the corrected sentence, \\"Moving captured funds, as above, former thieves and criminals turn into today's investors.\\" clearly tells us that the funds mentioned are being transferred or moved and, as mentioned previously (suggested by \\"as above\\"), this is causing or helping former thieves and criminals to turn into investors of the modern day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Chinese immigrants have played a significant role in the history of California, and there have been Chinese communities in Los Angeles since the late 19th century. Moreover, the fact that the Mann's Chinese Theater is an attraction for tourists indicates that it is an important landmark with a cultural significance that transcends the presence of actual Chinese people in the area. In conclusion, the presence of the Mann's Chinese Theater on Hollywood Boulevard is not enough to conclude that there are no Chinese people in the area of Hollywood and they never were. Instead, it demonstrates the influence of Chinese architectural design and culture on the iconic landscape of Hollywood."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

As the man continues to play, the sound of the bongos resonates through the air, drawing in a crowd of curious onlookers. They gather around the blindfolded man and start to record the incredible performance on their phones, sharing it across various social media platforms. Everyone in the crowd is in awe of the man's musical abilities, and some even start to dance along to the captivating rhythm he is creating. Just a few feet away from the blindfolded man, a small group of street musicians with acoustic guitars and percussion instruments notice the growing crowd. Intrigued by the unusual sight, they decide to move closer, bringing their instruments with them.

The reporter inquires about his background and the reason behind his blindfolded performance. The man goes on to explain how music has always been his passion, and how, as a visually impaired person, he harnesses his other senses to play the bongos with precision. He shares the story of his blindness from a young age and how it helped him develop his unique musical talents.

Question: SEOUL — North Korea’s recent threat to pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S. has added new urgency to South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s visit to Washington next Tuesday. President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors. Question: Why does Trump want North Korea to denuclearize?

Answer based on context: The Titans won their first game of the year, and Vince Young earned his first NFL win in a game against the Washington Redskins at FedExField. The Titans got on the board first as K Rob Bironas connected on a 32-yard field goal five minutes into the game. The Skins responded with a 10-yard touchdown run by RB Clinton Portis. On the first play of the second quarter, Skins QB Mark Brunell hit TE Chris Cooley with a 24-yard touchdown pass. Titans K Bironas converted a 26-yard field goal, and Young hit WR Brandon Jones with a 3-yard touchdown near the end of the first half, to pull the Titans to within one going into halftime. Titans RB Travis Henry rushed for a career-high 178 yards and scored on a 2-yard run in the third quarter. On the Skins next possession, Titans FB Casey Cramer blocked a Derrick Frost punt out of the end zone for a safety. Skins RB Portis ran for his second touchdown early in the fourth quarter, and Brunell hit WR Santana Moss for the two-point conversion to tie the game at 22. Titans K Bironas kicked a field goal from 30 yards out with 5 minutes left to give them a 25-22 lead. The Skins had one last chance but Brunell threw an interception to S Lamont Thompson to seal the deal for the Titans. With the win, the Titans went into their bye week at 1-5. How many yards longer was the first field goal relative to the first touchdown?","completion":"Okay, so the Titans got the first points in the game by kicking a field goal. This field goal was from 32 yards away. The next points came from the Skins, when their player, RB Clinton Portis, ran 10 yards to score a touchdown. To find out how many yards longer the first field goal was compared to the first touchdown, we just need to subtract the 10 yards from the touchdown from the 32 yards of the field goal. So, 32 yards (field goal) - 10 yards (touchdown) = 22 yards.

Answer choices: - orchids - fertile - peachleaf willow - In their leaves - photosynthesis - Most plants - an organism's body - swamp vegetation A:","completion":"To answer the question, let's break down the information step-by-step: 1. We know that the site of photosynthesis contains the green pigment chlorophyll. 2. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy (in the form of glucose) using chlorophyll. 3. The site of photosynthesis in plants is found within their leaves, specifically in the chloroplasts. Now, looking at the answer choices, we can eliminate the options that do not fit the context of the question: - Orchids: This is a specific type of plant, not a site where chlorophyll is located. - Fertile: This term is irrelevant to the location of chlorophyll. - Peachleaf willow: Another specific type of plant, not a site. - In their leaves: This is a correct location for the site of photosynthesis in plants. - Photosynthesis: This is the process itself, not the location where it takes place. - Most plants: While this statement is true, it does not accurately identify the specific site of chlorophyll. - An organism's body: This is too vague and broad of an answer. - Swamp vegetation: This again refers to specific plants, not the site of chlorophyll.

Sentence 1: He had made a most remarkable recovery, and Nema didn't even seem surprised. Sentence 2: He had only been injured just yesterday. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"The truth of the first sentence, stating that \\"He had made a most remarkable recovery, and Nema didn't even seem surprised,\\" provides information about an individual's healing process and the lack of surprise on Nema's part. The fact that this recovery is deemed \\"remarkable\\" suggests that it occurred faster or was more thorough than would normally be expected. The second sentence, \\"He had only been injured just yesterday,\\" provides additional context and information about the timeline of the individual's injury and recovery. This sentence conveys that the person in question suffered an injury a very short time ago – just yesterday. Now, evaluating the truth of the second sentence in light of the first sentence: 1. If the individual made a \\"most remarkable recovery,\\" it implies that their healing happened much faster than normal. Therefore, it is entirely possible that the person was indeed injured just yesterday, as mentioned in the second sentence, and still managed to recover remarkably within such a short time span. In this case, the second sentence is true. 2. On the other hand, the fact that the individual made a remarkable recovery does not necessarily mean that they were injured just yesterday. The first sentence does not give any specific information regarding the timeline of the injury. It could be the case that the person was injured a few days or weeks ago, but their recovery was still considered remarkable compared to the typical healing time for that kind of injury. In this case, the second sentence would not be true. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the first sentence alone, we cannot definitively determine whether the second sentence is true or false. Both possibilities exist: the injury might have happened just yesterday, or it may have happened a few days (or weeks) ago. The first sentence only provides information about the remarkable nature of the recovery and Nema's lack of surprise, without giving a specific timeline for the injury."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Its provincial capital is Halifax. Nova Scotia is Canada's second-smallest province, with an area of , including Cape Breton and another 3,800 coastal islands. As of 2011, the population was 921,727, making Nova Scotia the second most-densely populated province in Canada with almost . - Halifax Fairview is a former provincial electoral district in Nova Scotia, Canada which existed from 1993-2013. It elected one member of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly. In its last configuration, the electoral district included the communities of Fairview, Armdale, Cowie Hill, Fairmount and Kline Heights - all within the Halifax Regional Municipality. - The Nova Scotia New Democratic Party is a social-democratic provincial party in Nova Scotia, Canada. It is aligned with the federal New Democratic Party (NDP). It was founded as the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in 1932, and became the New Democratic Party in 1961. It became the governing party of Nova Scotia following the 2009 Nova Scotia election. It is the first New Democratic Party in Atlantic Canada to form a government. Much of the party's success prior to the 2009 election was based in the urban areas of the provincial capital, Halifax, however the party's support has grown to the rest of Nova Scotia. - Manitoba is a province at the longitudinal centre of Canada. It is one of the three prairie provinces (with Alberta and Saskatchewan) and Canada's fifth-most populous province with its estimated 1.3 million people. Manitoba covers with a widely varied landscape. The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west, the territories of Nunavut to the north, and Northwest Territories to the northwest, and the US states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south. - Atlantic Canada is the region of Canada comprising the four provinces located on the Atlantic coast, excluding Quebec: the three Maritime provinces New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia and the easternmost province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The population of the four Atlantic provinces in 2011 was about 2,300,000 on half a million km. - The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) (from 1955 the \\"\\") was a social-democratic and democratic socialist political party in Canada. The CCF was founded in 1932 in Calgary, Alberta, by a number of socialist, agrarian, co-operative, and labour groups, and the League for Social Reconstruction. In 1944, the CCF formed the first social-democratic government in North America when it was elected to form the provincial government in Saskatchewan. In 1961, the CCF was succeeded by the New Democratic Party (NDP). The full, but little used, name of the party was Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Farmer-Labour-Socialist). - Responsible government is a conception of a system of government that embodies the principle of parliamentary accountability, the foundation of the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy. Governments (the equivalent of the executive branch) in Westminster democracies are responsible to parliament rather than to the monarch, or, in a colonial context, to the imperial government, and in a republican context, to the president, either in full or in part. If the parliament is bicameral, then the government is responsible first to the parliament's lower house, which is more numerous, always directly elected and thus more representative than the upper house. Responsible government of parliamentary accountability manifests itself in several ways. Ministers account to Parliament for their decisions and for the performance of their departments. This requirement to make announcements and to answer questions in Parliament means that ministers have to have the privileges of the \\"floor\\" which are only granted to those who are members of either house of Parliament. Secondly, and most importantly, although ministers are officially appointed by the authority of the head of state and can theoretically be dismissed at the pleasure of the sovereign, they concurrently retain their office subject to their holding the confidence of the lower house of Parliament. When the lower house has passed a motion of no confidence in the government, the government must immediately resign or submit itself to the electorate in a new general election. - Graham Steele ( July 8 , 1964 , Winnipeg , Manitoba ) is a Canadian lawyer and former politician , having represented the constituency of Halifax Fairview in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 2001 - 2013 for the Nova Scotia New Democratic Party .

Q:Information: - Wigtown is a town and former royal burgh in Wigtownshire, of which it is the county town, within the Dumfries and Galloway region in Scotland. It lies east of Stranraer and south of Newton Stewart. It is well known today as \\"Scotland's National Book Town\\" with a high concentration of second-hand book shops. It has a population of about 1,000. - Wigtownshire , was a constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1708 to 1801 and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1918 . It was represented by one Member of Parliament . The first British general election in Wigtownshire was in 1708 . In 1707 -- 08 , members of the 1702 -- 1707 Parliament of Scotland were co-opted to serve in the 1st Parliament of Great Britain . See Scottish representatives to the 1st Parliament of Great Britain , for further details . In 1918 the Wigtownshire area was combined with Kirkcudbrightshire to form the Galloway constituency . - Dumfries and Galloway is one of 32 unitary council areas of Scotland and is located in the western Southern Uplands. It comprises the historic counties of Dumfriesshire, Stewartry of Kirkcudbright and Wigtownshire, the latter two of which are collectively known as Galloway. The administrative centre is the town of Dumfries. - The Parliament of Great Britain was formed in 1707 following the ratification of the Acts of Union by both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland. The Acts created a new unified Kingdom of Great Britain and dissolved the separate English and Scottish parliaments in favour of a single parliament, located in the former home of the English parliament in the Palace of Westminster, near the City of London. This lasted nearly a century, until the Acts of Union 1800 merged the separate British and Irish Parliaments into a single Parliament of the United Kingdom with effect from 1 January 1801. - Wigtownshire or the County of Wigtown is a registration county and lieutenancy area in south-west Scotland. Until 1975, Wigtownshire was one of the administrative counties used for local government purposes, and is now administered as part of the council area of Dumfries and Galloway. As a lieutenancy area, Wigtownshire has its own Lord Lieutenant, currently John Alexander Ross. - A registration county was, in Great Britain and Ireland, a statistical unit used for the registration of births, deaths and marriages and for the output of census information. In Scotland registration counties are used for land registration purposes. - Galloway (Gaelic: \\"Gall-Ghàidhealaibh\\"; Latin: \\"Gallovidia\\") is a region in southwestern Scotland comprising the counties of Wigtown and Kirkcudbright. - The Kingdom of Great Britain, officially Great Britain , was a sovereign state in western Europe from 1 May 1707 to 31 December 1800. The state came into being following the Treaty of Union in 1706, ratified by the Acts of Union 1707, which united the kingdoms of England and Scotland to form a single kingdom encompassing the whole island of Great Britain and its outlying islands. It did not include Ireland, which remained a separate realm. The unitary state was governed by a single parliament and government that was based in Westminster. The former kingdoms had been in personal union since James VI, King of Scots, became King of England and King of Ireland in 1603 following the death of Queen Elizabeth I, bringing about a \\"Union of the Crowns\\". Also after the accession of George I to the throne of Great Britain in 1714, the kingdom was in a personal union with the Electorate of Hanover. - A Member of Parliament (MP) is the representative of the voters to a parliament. In many countries with bicameral parliaments, this category includes specifically members of the lower house, as upper houses often have a different title. - The Parliament of England was the legislature of the Kingdom of England. In 1066, William of Normandy introduced what, in later centuries, became referred to as a feudal system, by which he sought the advice of a council of tenants-in-chief (a person who held land) and ecclesiastics before making laws. In 1215, the tenants-in-chief secured Magna Carta from King John, which established that the king may not levy or collect any taxes (except the feudal taxes to which they were hitherto accustomed), save with the consent of his royal council, which gradually developed into a parliament. - The City of Westminster is an Inner London borough which also holds city status. It occupies much of the central area of Greater London including most of the West End. It is to the west of and adjoining the ancient City of London, directly to the east of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, and its southern boundary is the River Thames. It was created with the 1965 establishment of Greater London. Upon creation, Westminster was awarded city status, which had been previously held by the smaller Metropolitan Borough of Westminster. - The 14 British Overseas Territories (BOT) are territories under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United Kingdom. They are those parts of the former British Empire that have not chosen independence or have voted to remain British territories. Most of the inhabited territories are internally self-governing, with the UK retaining responsibility for defence and foreign relations. The rest are either uninhabited or have a transitory population of military or scientific personnel. They share the British monarch (Elizabeth II) as head of state. - In modern politics and history, a parliament is a legislative, elected body of government. Generally a modern parliament has three functions: representing the electorate, making laws, and overseeing the government (\\"i.e.\\", hearings, inquiries). - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - The Parliament of Scotland, officially the Estates of Parliament, was the legislature of the Kingdom of Scotland. The parliament, like other such institutions, evolved during the Middle Ages from the king's council of bishops and earls. It is first identifiable as a parliament in 1235, during the reign of Alexander II, when it was described as a \\"colloquium\\" and already possessed a political and judicial role. By the early fourteenth century, the attendance of knights and freeholders had become important, and from 1326 commissioners from the burghs attended. Consisting of the \\"three estates\\" of clergy, nobility and the burghs sitting in a single chamber, the parliament gave consent for the raising of taxation and played an important role in the administration of justice, foreign policy, war, and all manner of other legislation. Parliamentary business was also carried out by \\"sister\\" institutions, such as General Councils or Convention of Estates. These could carry out much business also dealt with by parliament taxation, legislation and policy-making but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament. - The Parliament of the United Kingdom, commonly known as the UK Parliament or British Parliament, is the supreme legislative body in the United Kingdom, British Crown dependencies and British overseas territories. It alone possesses legislative supremacy and thereby ultimate power over all other political bodies in the UK and its territories. Its head is the Sovereign of the United Kingdom (currently Queen Elizabeth II) and its seat is the Palace of Westminster in the City of Westminster, London. - The Acts of Union 1800 (sometimes erroneously referred to as a single Act of Union 1801) united the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland (previously in personal union) to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with effect from 1 January 1801. Both Acts, though since amended, still remain in force in the United Kingdom, but have been repealed in the Republic of Ireland. - The City of London is a city and county within London. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders. The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster). - The Palace of Westminster is the meeting place of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the two houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Commonly known as the Houses of Parliament after its occupants, it is also known as the 'heart of British politics'. The Palace lies on the north bank of the River Thames in the City of Westminster, in central London.

El Mariachi is recruited by CIA agent Sheldon Jeffrey Sands to kill General Emiliano Marquez, a corrupt Mexican Army officer who has been hired by Mexican drug lord Armando Barillo to assassinate the President of Mexico and overthrow the government. Many years before, El Mariachi and his wife Carolina confronted Marquez in a shootout and wounded the general; in retaliation, Marquez took the lives of Carolina and their daughter in an ambush. In addition to El Mariachi, Sands persuades former FBI agent Jorge Ramírez to come out of retirement and kill Barillo, who had murdered his partner Archuleta in the past. Furthermore, AFN operative Ajedrez is assigned by Sands to tail Barillo. While monitoring Barillo's activities, Ramírez meets Billy Chambers, an American fugitive who has been living under the protection of Barillo, but can no longer stomach the horrible tasks he's been forced to carry out for him. Ramírez convinces Chambers he will provide him protection in exchange for getting closer to Barillo by tagging Chambers' pet chihuahua with a hidden microphone, and Chambers agrees to complete the deal by surrendering to U.S. authorities once Barillo has been taken down. Sands' assistant, Cucuy, originally hired to keep an eye on El Mariachi, instead tranquilizes El Mariachi and turns him over to Barillo, also offering to reveal the details of Sands's plan.

Our youngest child, Peter, was murdered on September 11, 2001, while attending a conference at Windows on the World at the World Trade Center. He was 25 years old when he died. When the towers fell, we were in France, on vacation to celebrate Steve's 60th birthday. Peter, our daughter, Jane, and our son Jeff and his wife, Tobey, had all been with us for a week before flying back to the U.S. on September 8. On the day of the attacks, we were terribly upset after hearing the news. But at first, we were not worried about our kids. Jeff and Tobey lived in Tulsa. Jane lived in D.C. but her job was nowhere near the Pentagon. Peter worked in midtown Manhattan for Bloomberg LP. But since he traveled throughout the city for his job, we became concerned. We desperately tried calling our kids but could not get a line out of France. It wasn't until late in the day that we learned from Jeff that \\"Pete was there.\\" The next day, Michael Bloomberg, who became mayor two months later, called to tell us that Pete was dead. My world stopped, and it still is totally out of kilter. News: Triple-amputee veteran gets 'smart' home on September 11. Not Peter! Pete was all laughter and sunshine and love. He wasn't uncomfortable kissing his mother or father in public, or hugging his sister for no reason at all. He and Jeff traveled to fun places and laughed and laughed. Not Peter -- he was too full of life. Our mark on this Earth is our children. After his death, we knew we had to leave a mark that Peter existed and the world would be a better place because he lived. In searching for a way to honor his life, we learned that 1 billion people, almost one sixth of humanity, have directly experienced torture, terrorism or mass violence. Victims are left with lifelong emotional wounds preventing them from leading productive lives. In sub-Saharan Africa, the incidence of traumatic depression and PTSD exceeds that of HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB combined. Peter loved life; he was compassionate and caring. There was nothing we could do for Pete, but returning survivors to life in his name was the perfect memorial. In March 2003, we created the Peter C. Alderman Foundation. People often ask: \\"Why are you dealing with traumatic depression and PTSD when there are so many greater problems in the world?\\" Our response is simple: Billions of philanthropic dollars go into fighting HIV/AIDS, malaria and poverty. But if people don't care whether they live or die, they will not follow through with their medication regimens, walk that extra mile for potable water or take advantage of microfinance. If you can restore hope, a person is less likely to strap on dynamite and kill innocent people. Opinion: 11 years after 9/11: Who are the terrorists? Our foundation started by training indigenous health workers, but we quickly learned that training by itself was not sufficient. We needed to provide a framework in which professionals could work. To that end, our foundation runs eight trauma clinics in Cambodia, Uganda, Liberia and Kenya. Establishing public-private partnerships with local governments, our foundation trains, supervises and pays its staff; the government provides clinic space, in-patient beds and psychotropic drugs. Our foundation's average annual cost per clinic is 30,000. More than 30,000 children have been abducted in Uganda, and many of our patients are child soldiers, like Patrick. He has been treated in our Kitgum clinic for two years. Now he no longer has nightmares or flashbacks. He can sleep through the night and hold down a job. He no longer thinks of suicide. He has even named his new baby after his counselor at the clinic. Our foundation sponsors an annual African training conference on traumatic depression. Watch: The Alderman's talk to CNNMoney. At July's fifth annual conference in Tanzania, attended by 500 mental health professionals from 22 countries, an imam from Somalia rose to say the opening prayer. He only spoke Arabic. When translated, we learned that he had said a prayer for Peter. Tears streamed down my face as I realized we were truly on the way to leaving that mark for Peter. The work has kept us functioning and given us a reason to get out of bed every day. Nothing can erase our pain, but our passion to leave a profound and indelible mark that Peter existed on this Earth has propelled us forward. Peter would be very proud of the foundation that bears his name. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Elizabeth Alderman and Stephen Alderman.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What concert tour did critics say was overproduced? from the following article ? Tonight (1984), another dance-oriented album, found Bowie collaborating with Tina Turner and, once again, Iggy Pop. It included a number of cover songs, among them the 1966 Beach Boys hit \\"God Only Knows\\". The album bore the transatlantic Top 10 hit \\"Blue Jean\\", itself the inspiration for a short film that won Bowie a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video, Jazzin' for Blue Jean. Bowie performed at Wembley Stadium in 1985 for Live Aid, a multi-venue benefit concert for Ethiopian famine relief. During the event, the video for a fundraising single was premiered, Bowie's duet with Mick Jagger. \\"Dancing in the Street\\" quickly went to number one on release. The same year, Bowie worked with the Pat Metheny Group to record \\"This Is Not America\\" for the soundtrack of The Falcon and the Snowman. Released as a single, the song became a Top 40 hit in the UK and US.Bowie was given a role in the 1986 film Absolute Beginners. It was poorly received by critics, but Bowie's theme song, also named \\"Absolute Beginners\\", rose to No. 2 in the UK charts. He also appeared as Jareth, the Goblin King, in the 1986 Jim Henson film Labyrinth, for which he wrote five songs. His final solo album of the decade was 1987's Never Let Me Down, where he ditched the light sound of his previous two albums, instead offering harder rock with an industrial/techno dance edge. Peaking at No. 6 in the UK, the album yielded the hits \\"Day-In, Day-Out\\" (his 60th single), \\"Time Will Crawl\\", and \\"Never Let Me Down\\". Bowie later described it as his \\"nadir\\", calling it \\"an awful album\\". Supporting Never Let Me Down, and preceded by nine promotional press shows, the 86-concert Glass Spider Tour commenced on 30 May. Bowie's backing band included Peter Frampton on lead guitar. Contemporary critics maligned the tour as overproduced, saying it pandered to the current stadium rock trends in its special effects and dancing, although years after the tour's conclusion, critics acknowledged that the tour influenced how other artists performed concerts, including...

With the rapid growth and consolidation of large railroad systems after 1870, union organizations sprang up, covering the entire nation. By 1901, 17 major railway brotherhoods were in operation; they generally worked amicably with management, which recognized their usefulness. Key unions included the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers , Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Division , the Order of Railway Conductors, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. Their main goal was building insurance and medical packages for their members, and negotiating bureaucratic work rules that favored their membership, such as seniority and grievance procedures. They were not members of the AFL, and fought off more radical rivals such as the Knights of Labor in the 1880s and the American Railroad Union in the 1890s. They consolidated their power in 1916, after threatening a national strike, by securing the Adamson Act, a federal law that provided 10 hours pay for an eight-hour day. At the end of World War I they promoted nationalization of the railroads, and conducted a national strike in 1919. Both programs failed, and the brotherhoods were largely stagnant in the 1920s.

Mike and Jeff are close friends. Their school is having a guessing game to guess how many gumballs are in a box. If they get the right amount they win 100. If they get close they get a 20 gift card.

OPT: [+] no [+] yes...I think the answer is","completion":"Yes, the provided answer is correct to an extent; however, it is not sufficiently detailed. To make an educated guess as to how many gumballs are in the box, an individual could take several factors into account. Here is a more comprehensive approach they might consider: 1. Determine the volume capacity of the box: The box has dimensions of 10\\" x 10\\" x 10\\". Multiplying these dimensions (10 * 10 * 10), you will get a maximum volume of 1000 cubic inches for the box. 2. Estimate the volume occupied by a single gumball: Each gumball has a diameter of 1 inch. To estimate the volume of a gumball, we can assume it has the shape of a sphere and apply the formula for the sphere's volume: (4/3) * π * r³. With a 1-inch diameter, the radius (r) would be 0.5 inches. The volume of a single gumball is approximately 0.524 cubic inches. 3. Assess the maximum gumballs the box could hold: Divide the box's volume (1000 cubic inches) by the volume of a single gumball (0.524 cubic inches) to yield an approximate maximum of 1,909 gumballs. 4. Estimate for loose packing: Since the gumballs are loosely packed in the box, there will be empty spaces. Generally, the densest packing of spheres in a box is about 74%, which means that about 26% of the space remains unoccupied. To account for this, you would multiply the total number of gumballs by 0.74, which comes out to approximately 1,412 gumballs. 5. Account for missing gumballs: Finally, consider that 100 people guessed and took one gumball each. This means that there are now 100 fewer gumballs in the box. Subtract the 100 gumballs from the previous estimate of 1,412 gumballs to arrive at a final educated guess of around 1,312 gumballs. This methodology provides a more detailed and accurate way to make an educated guess on the number of gumballs in the box."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Information: - Dara Singh (19 November 1928 12 July 2012) was an Indian professional wrestler, actor and politician. He started acting in 1952 and was the first sportsman to be nominated to the Rajya Sabha (upper house) of India. He worked as Hindi and Punjabi film producer, director and writer, and he acted in films and television. - An upper house, sometimes called a Senate, is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature (or one of three chambers of a tricameral legislature), the other chamber being the lower house. The house formally designated as the upper house is usually smaller, and often has more restricted power, than the lower house. Examples of upper houses in countries include the UK's House of Lords, Canada's Senate, India's Rajya Sabha, Russia's Federation Council, Ireland's Seanad, Germany's Bundesrat and the United States Senate. - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance. - Bhakti Mein Shakti is a 1978 Bollywood film directed by and starring Dara Singh . - A politician (from \\"politics\\" + \\"-ian\\", from the Greek title of Aristotle's book \\"Politika\\", meaning \\"Civic Affairs\\") is a person active in party politics, or a person holding or seeking office in government. In democratic countries, politicians seek elective positions within a government through elections or, at times, temporary appointment to replace politicians who have died, resigned or have been otherwise removed from office. In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues. Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of government. Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people. Broadly speaking, a \\"politician\\" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in any bureaucratic institution.

Title: Confidence Movie plot: A group of grifters rip off their latest mark and celebrate, while the de facto leader of the group, Jake Vig (Edward Burns) narrates about the art of the con. When one of the four grifters is found shot to death, the other three learn that the latest money they stole actually belonged to a local L.A. crime lord called The King (Dustin Hoffman). Jake meets The King, who proposes that the grifters now go to work for him and steal money from Morgan Price, a rival who now owns a bank. The sociopathic King leaves them little choice in the matter.Having no options, Jake gets to work on developing a new con; he enlists the aid of his two remaining partners, Gordo and Miles, and also convinces an independent con artist named Lilly (Rachel Weisz) to round out their foursome. Unfortunately, The King, a wiry, manic man who suffers from ADHD, demands that one of his men, Lupus, also work on the con. The con involves bribing a vice president at the bank into wiring money offshore. The plan hits a major snag when Special Agent Gunther Butan (Andy Garcia) shows up in L.A., looking to finally bust Jake, whom he has followed for years. Agent Butan quickly forces two corrupt LAPD detectives into switching their allegiance from Jake to him.After hearing about Butan's arrival in town, a nervous Jake pulls the plug on the whole con, and screams at Lilly - making her walk out on the group. Lupus gets Jake to reconsider nixing the con, hinting that The King will torture and kill the grifters if the plan falls short. The con is back on, though now without Lilly's help. The plan starts smoothly enough, and the bribed bank VP wires the money to Gordo in Belize. Gordo brings the money to Ontario Airport, but he is met at the airport by both Agent Butan as well as The King and his men, as both sides are after the 5 million in a duffle bag. Butan arrests The King and confiscates the money. Gordo, who had the money taken from him, is nowhere to be found. Lupus, thinking the King now has the money, reveals he was the one who killed...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: There are three main routes you should take once you feel that you have a book that is ready to go out into the world. Here they are: The traditional route. This involves submitting your book to an agent, and having the agent submit your work to publishing houses. Most people will tell you an agent is necessary for getting your work published through a publishing house. Submit your work directly to the publishing house. You can forgo the agent and go straight to the publishing house (the ones that are willing to look at unsolicited manuscripts, anyway). But without an agent, this is very, very difficult to do. Self-publish. Self-publishing your work will get your book out in the world, but it's unlikely that the book will give you the attention you may be looking for if you want to live the life of a true author. But if your goal is to just get your work out there, then this is a great option. You can self-publish through an online service, a vanity press, or even just completely DIY. Whether you want to submit your book to a publishing house or a literary agent, there are a few basic conventions you should follow. Your manuscript should be double-spaced, in a readable font such as Times New Roman, have an appropriate cover page, and have pages numbered with your last name and the title of the work. You can also look online for more information about how to format your manuscript. If you're submitting directly to a publishing house, each one may have slightly different instructions for how your manuscript should look. Don't just blindly submit to any agent who is open to reading solicited submissions. Use the Poets & Writers guide to agents or check out AgentQuery.com to find agents that are actively accepting new clients, open to and excited about work in your genre, and who are reported to actually respond to submissions. Your best bet is to check out agents who accept simultaneous submissions, so you can send out your book to 5 or so agents at a time instead of waiting six months from a fancy agent who never responds to you. To submit your work to an agent, you'll need to write a query letter, which will be a succinct cover letter that briefly describes the plot of your book, situates your book within the framework of the writer's market, and offers a few words of biographical information. Check each agent's submission guidelines. Some may only want to see the query letter first or may ask to see just the first two chapters. Don't send your manuscript to 20 agents at once. You may find that you get the same feedback over and over, which can help you make your work more exciting to agents. If you get rejected by an agent, you can't approach him again with the same book unless he asks for a revision, so make your chance count. The key word in this game is patience. It may be months before you hear back from an agent, so you will have to learn the art of waiting and avoid checking your email every three seconds if you don't want to go insane. Woohoo! An agent has written that he or she is in love with your book and wants you to sign with her. Do you sign a contract ASAP? Absolutely not. You talk to the agent, ask a lot of questions, discuss his or her vision of the book, and make sure that he or she is legitimate and committed to selling your work. A legitimate agent never asks for money up front and will only receive a cut of the profit if he or she can sell your book. If you get an offer from an agent, it is perfectly okay to let the other agents who have your manuscript know and to see if they have an offer to give you as well. You'll be surprised to hear how quickly they'll get back to you once they know someone really wants you. Talk to the agent on the phone, or even meet in person, if it's geographically possible. It will help to get a sense of his or her personality, and to know if you two click or not. You and your agent don't have to be best friends, but you do have to be able to share ideas. Your agent should be, well, at least a little aggressive. This is the trait that will help get your book sold. Your agent should also be well-connected and should have impressive records of sales so he or she will know where to send your book. Once you've signed with the right agent, you will work vigorously, sometimes for a year or two, to revise the novel until the agent thinks it is \\"saleable.\\" Then you'll prepare a package and the agent will take the book to the editors at different publishing houses, and you will hopefully get an offer from at least one of them. Sit back and wait for this stressful process to be over, and you will hopefully hear about a sale soon! If you get multiple offers, you and your agent will decide which is the best fit. Awesome, you signed with an editor at a publishing house! Get ready to see your book hit the shelves next week...not. Guess what's in store for you? Even more editing. The editor will have a vision for how the book will look, and you will also work on the small copyediting stuff too. This process will take a while too, usually at least a year between the time your book is sold and when it comes out. There will be other details to figure out, such as what your cover will look like, what blurbs you can get on the back of the book, and the people you acknowledge at the beginning or the end of the book. Once you have worked with the editor and your book is deemed ready, you will see your book out on sale and in the stores. You will have been given a release date, and it's likely that you've been counting down until the day when your book hits the stores and the virtual Amazon shelves. Grab a hold of the physical copy, twirl around, and celebrate yourself! But your work is just beginning.","completion":"The three main routes to take when you feel your book is ready to go out into the world are: 1.

Given the background: The trade-off theory of capital structure is the idea that a company chooses how much debt finance and how much equity finance to use by balancing the costs and benefits. The classical version of the hypothesis goes back to Kraus and Litzenberger[1] who considered a balance between the dead-weight costs of bankruptcy and the tax saving benefits of debt. Often agency costs are also included in the balance. This theory is often set up as a competitor theory to the pecking order theory of capital structure. A review of the literature is provided by Frank and Goyal.[2] An important purpose of the theory is to explain the fact that corporations usually are financed partly with debt and partly with equity. It states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, the tax benefits of debt and there is a cost of financing with debt, the costs of financial distress including bankruptcy costs of debt and non-bankruptcy costs (e.g. staff leaving, suppliers demanding disadvantageous payment terms, bondholder/stockholder infighting, etc.). The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm that is optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much debt and equity to use for financing. and the situation: Company X stopped taking on more debt, and decided to file for bankruptcy, while company Y, kept benefiting from the tax benefits of debt, having a lower debt level.

Three days earlier, Casillas had made his La Liga debut in a 2–2 draw against Athletic Bilbao at San Mamés Stadium.

Context: Muslim sects regarded as heretical, such as the Druze, Ismailis, Alevis, and Alawites, ranked below Jews and Christians. In 1514, Sultan Selim I, nicknamed \\"the Grim\\" because of his cruelty, ordered the massacre of 40,000 Anatolian Alevis (Qizilbash), whom he considered heretics, reportedly proclaiming that \\"the killing of one Alevi had as much otherworldly reward as killing 70 Christians.\\"[page needed] Selim was also responsible for an unprecedented and rapid expansion of the Ottoman Empire into the Middle East, especially through his conquest of the entire Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt, which included much of the region. With these conquests, Selim further solidified the Ottoman claim for being an Islamic caliphate, although Ottoman sultans had been claiming the title of caliph since the 14th century starting with Murad I (reigned 1362 to 1389). The caliphate would remain held by Ottoman sultans for the rest of the office's duration, which ended with its abolition on 3 March 1924 by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and the exile of the last caliph, Abdülmecid II, to France.

Vaslav Nijinsky (also Vatslav; Russian: Vatslav Fomich Nizhinskii; Russian: ['vatsl@f f@'mjitc njI'zinskjIj]; Polish: Waclaw Nizynski; 12 March 1889/1890 - 8 April 1950) was a ballet dancer and choreographer cited as the greatest male dancer of the early 20th century. Vaslav Nijinsky was born in 1889 or 1890 in Kiev, Russian Empire (now Ukraine), as Waclaw Nizynski, to ethnic Polish parents, touring dancers Tomasz Nizynski (b. 7 March 1862) and Eleonora Bereda (b. 28 December 1856). Nijinsky was christened in Warsaw. He identified himself as Polish although he grew up in the interior of Russia with his parents and he had difficulty speaking Polish. Eleanora, along with her two brothers and two sisters, was orphaned while still a child. She started to earn a living as an extra in Warsaw's Grand Theatre Ballet (Polish: Teatr Wielki), becoming a full member of the company at age thirteen. In 1868 her talent was spotted and she moved to Kiev as a solo dancer. Tomasz Nizynski also attended the Wielki Theatre school, becoming a soloist there. At age 18 he accepted a soloist contract with the Odessa Theatre. The two met, married in May 1884 and settled into a career with the traveling Setov opera company. Tomasz was premier danseur, and Eleanora a soloist. Eleanora continued to tour and dance while having three children, sons Stanislav Fomitch (b. 29 December 1886 in Tiflis) and Vaslav; and daughter Bronislava Fominitchna ('Bronia', b. 8 January 1891 in Minsk). She suffered from depression, which may have been a genetic vulnerability shared in a different form by her son Vaslav. Both boys received training from their father and appeared in an amateur Hopak production in Odessa in 1894. After Josef Setov died about 1894, the company disbanded. Thomas attempted to run his own company, but was not successful. He and his family became itinerant dancers, the children appearing in the Christmas show at Nizhny Novgorod. In 1897 Thomas and Eleanora separated after Thomas had fallen in love with another dancer, Rumiantseva, while touring in Finland. Eleanora moved to 20 Mokhovaya Street in St Petersburg with her children. She persuaded a friend from the Wielki Theatre, Victor Stanislas Gillert, who was at the time teaching at the Imperial Ballet School, to help get Vaslav into the school. He arranged for the noted teacher Enrico Cecchetti to sponsor the application. Bronia entered the school two years after Vaslav. Their older brother Stanislav had suffered a fall from a window when young and seemed to have suffered some brain damage. Vaslav and Bronia, just two years apart, became very close as they grew. As he got older, Stanislav became increasingly mentally unstable and would have fierce tantrums. He was admitted to an asylum for the insane in 1902. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Who were his parents?","completion":"Vaslav Nijinsky's parents were Tomasz Nizynski and Eleonora Bereda.

Write an article based on this \\"A man has died after an incident at a dairy farm in Aberdeenshire.\\"","completion":"Title: Fatal Incident at Aberdeenshire Dairy Farm Raises Concerns on Farm Safety Introduction A recent tragedy in Aberdeenshire has brought farming safety issues under the spotlight. A man died as a result of an undescribed incident at a dairy farm, prompting concerns about working conditions and safety standards in the agricultural sector. The following article delves into the potential causes of such incidents and the importance of ensuring appropriate safety measures are in place to protect farmers and their employees. Background Dairy farming is an essential component of the country's agricultural sector, producing milk, cheese, and other dairy products for domestic consumption and export. Aberdeenshire, known for its fertile land and thriving farming industries, is an ideal location for many dairy farms. However, this tragic incident has now brought concerns of safety into focus as the community mourns the loss of one of its own. Common Causes of Farm Accidents The causes of accidents that occur on dairy farms are diverse and sometimes unpredictable. Some of the most common reasons for these incidents include the following: 1. Heavy machinery: Operating heavy agricultural equipment comes with a high level of inherent risk. Safety mechanisms may fail, causing injury or even fatal accidents, particularly when such machinery is inadequately maintained or operated incorrectly. Furthermore, workers could be accidentally trapped, pinned, or struck by these machines. 2. Livestock handling: Working closely with large animals such as dairy cows also brings challenges. Animals can become aggressive or threatened, which may lead to farmworkers becoming injured due to kicks, crush injuries, or animal attacks. 3. Confined spaces: Dairy farms often involve working in confined spaces like inside grain silos or fermentation pits, which pose risks of suffocation, gas exposure, and falling. Proper training and safety guidelines must be applied in such environments to prevent tragic accidents. 4. Chemical exposure: The handling of chemicals such as pesticides or fertilizers can lead to acute poisoning, burns, or long-term health effects if not managed correctly. Workers must be educated on the safe storage and usage of these substances. 5. Fatigue and human error: Long hours, stress, and the physically demanding nature of farming work may lead to exhaustion, which, in turn, affects workers' capacity for decision-making, attention, and coordination. This can contribute to accidents that may have been preventable. Safety Measures and Education To reduce the frequency and severity of farm accidents, appropriate safety measures must be put in place, and farm owners must prioritize the well-being and safety of workers. Some essential safety practices include: 1. Education and training: All workers should be adequately trained in the correct operation of machinery, livestock handling, and safe practices around chemicals. Ongoing training and refresher courses should be implemented to ensure workers maintain a high level of safety competence. 2. Proper maintenance: Equipment should be regularly checked, maintained, and replaced when necessary. This not only prevents accidents due to malfunction or failure but also enhances the efficiency and productivity of farm operations. 3. Supervision and communication: A strong line of communication between management and workers is crucial for maintaining a safe environment. Responsibilities should be outlined clearly, and workers should feel comfortable reporting concerns around safety hazards. Conclusion The tragic death of a man at an Aberdeenshire dairy farm serves as a solemn reminder of the possible perils workers face daily in the agricultural sector. It is paramount to understand the risks associated with farm work and implement comprehensive safety measures in order to protect workers and prevent future incidents. By cultivating a safety-first mindset on the farm, the agricultural sector can strive toward a future where tragedies like this can be significantly reduced or even eliminated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: SEOUL — South Korean Foreign Minister Kang, Kyung-wha said on Wednesday that the U.S. and South Korea jointly made the decision to suspend combined military exercises scheduled for August, but would not confirm if her government was given advanced notice before U.S. President Trump announced his intention to cancel the drills, after he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12. “We have made it clear that this is a goodwill gesture to strengthen the dialogue momentum at this point, but they are not irreversible. They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site. North Korea has long called for the end of these joint military exercises that it says are offensive “rehearsals for war.” In the past U.S. officials refused to suspend the joint drills, that they defended as defensive in nature... How did President Trump enjoy his time in Singapore for the summit? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. He wish he could have stayed longer B. His visit was less than ideal C. not enough information D. He had a productive visit The answer is:","completion":"C. not enough information"},{"prompt":"You are a teacher. Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Generate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph. Please consider the following points while generating an output. 1) The claim will always have supporting proof in the paragraph, and the paragraph will have a clear point of view supporting the claim. 2) There can be instances where direct correlation to the claim is not available. Make use of the sentences in the paragraph to provide a corresponding output supporting the claim. 3) The explanation should be at least one and at most twelve sentences long. Paragraph: The House passed the bill 101-7 Tuesday. The telephone referral system would be available 24 hours a day, seven days of week and would refer people experiencing a mental health crisis to service providers. A spending law approved in 2018 included 3 million to develop, operate and maintain a hotline pilot program. The new legislation is intended as a way to expand that program statewide, which could cost the state between 1 million and 2.5 million more annually. Supporters say the hotline would help those who do not know where to turn — potentially keeping families together and saving lives. A spokeswoman for Whitmer said the bill was under review. Claim: Bill to create Michigan mental health hotline is approved.","completion":"First, let's identify the task at hand. The task is asking you to generate an explanation for a given claim based on the supporting evidence provided in a paragraph. Here, an understanding of the paragraph content is crucial. The guidelines are the following: 1) The claim will always have supporting proof in the paragraph. 2) Indirect correlation to the claim can be used when a direct one isn't present. 3) The explanation should be about 1 to 12 sentences long. Now, let's break down how to use these guidelines to answer the task: Claim: \\"Bill to create Michigan mental health hotline is approved.\\" Looking at the paragraph, the first sentence clearly states, \\"The House passed the bill 101-7 Tuesday.\\" This is direct evidence supporting the claim. The paragraph later explains that the bill is about creating a phone referral system available 24/7 for people experiencing a mental health crisis. Further, the paragraph indicates that an earlier law had provided funding for a pilot program, and the newly passed bill is intended to expand the program across the state. Again, this supports the claim that a bill to create a mental health hotline has been approved. If there were no direct correlation, the indirect clues could be the description of the bill (a phone referral service, working 24/7 for mental crisis cases, initially a pilot and now with a new bill planning to extend it statewide), the mention of a previous related law and funds dedicated to it. That could help you link the bill to the concept of mental health hotline and its approval. The last sentence might not directly support the claim, but it does suggest that the bill is moving forward in the legislative process, as it has been passed to the governor for review. We can use this to provide a more comprehensive response. Applying guideline 3, an explanation could look like this: \\"The House approved a bill to create a Michigan mental health hotline, as indicated by the 101-7 majority vote. The hotline would be a 24/7 telephone referral system for those experiencing a mental health crisis. This approval expands a previously funded pilot program to go statewide, which aligns with the intent of the new legislation. Note that the bill is now under review by Governor Whitmer, suggesting it's progressing in the legislative process.\\" In this way, the task is asking you to use critical thinking skills to identify and articulate the supporting evidence of a claim based on the information provided in the corresponding paragraph."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Blood Feast Movie plot: In the midst of a series of gruesome murders, a young woman is killed inside her suburban Miami house by a grey-haired, wild-eyed man. He stabs her in the eye and hacks her leg off with a machete, bagging the leg before he leaves. At the police station the next day, detective Pete Thornton investigates the killing, noting that it is the latest in a series of four murders by a homicidal maniac who has yet to leave any clues. The police chief advises him to continue to pursue the case. At Fuad Ramses Catering store, wealthy socialite Dorothy Fremont arrives, where she arranges for Fuad to cater a party for her daughter Suzette. Fuad agrees and tells Mrs. Fremont that the Egyptian feast that he is preparing has not been served for over 5,000 years. Mrs. Fremont wants the catering done in two weeks, and Fuad assures her that he will have enough time to procure the last of his needed ingredients. After Mrs. Fremont leaves, Fuad ventures to the back storage room where he has displayed a large gold statue of his \\"Egyptian goddess\\" Ishtar.

You would think I would have it duly memorized since during both legs of my trip, the flight attendant came on like every 5 minutes to brag about it. And to harass you into signing up for their exclusive Visa. And the continual announcements with the full cabin lights on, take place at 1:00 p.m. or 11:00 p.m. Apparently, they would have to charge you extra if you actually were able to fall asleep fully upright in the world's most uncomfortable seat built. Spirit Airlines must have consulted with some sort of S&M design group when they engineered their seating. I think they took a concrete bench from HomeDepot and slapped some faux-leather grey canvas on it, and voila, a seat was born. Just to drive this point home: I am a hair over 5 feet tall (maybe 5-1 if I have a great yoga or Pilates Reformer session) and weigh about 105 pounds, and this was undoubtedly, the most uncomfortable I have ever been in my life. I felt cramped, pinched and claustrophobic. And if you are thinking, well, they are a low cost airline, of course, the seats and amenities cannot be luxurious, what can you expect? Bottom line, they are not as low cost as they portray themselves and their version of cheap actually comes topped off with equally bad service . So, you pay more than you expected and suffer while not saving anything. So, they are indeed the double whammy of awful. As others have mentioned their hidden fees are ridiculous and the staff are about as unpleasant as they come. I was a few pounds over the 40 pound limit and was told in LV that I could transfer some of my things out of my checked bag into my purse, but I would have to re-wait back in the full line again when it had already taken me over 30 minutes to reach the counter. And by this point, the line was even longer. So, I ended up having to pay another 25 for my checked bag. Total cost of checking 1 bag roundtrip 91! After I came home, I re-researched my roundtrip flight (LV to DFW) and in the end, after all their crappy fees, it would have been cheaper for me to have flown another (more reputable) airline. It was my first and last Spirit trip. Choose the sentiment of this review?
