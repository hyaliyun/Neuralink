Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the last names of the two people hired to join Opeth after De Farfalla and Nordin left? Opeth recorded its debut album, Orchid, with producer Dan Swanö in April 1994. Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until May 15, 1995, and only in Europe. Orchid tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals.After a few live shows in the United Kingdom, Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album, again produced by Dan Swanö. The album was named Morningrise, and was released in Europe on June 24, 1996. With only five songs, but lasting 66 minutes, it features Opeth's longest song, the twenty-minute \\"Black Rose Immortal\\". Opeth toured the UK in support of Morningrise, followed by a 26-date Scandinavian tour with Cradle of Filth. While on tour, Opeth attracted the attention of Century Media Records, who signed the band and released the first two albums in the United States in 1997.In 1997, after the tour, Åkerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed De Farfalla for personal reasons, without the consent of Nordin. When Åkerfeldt informed Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons. Former Eternal members, drummer Martín López (formerly of Amon Amarth) and bassist Martín Méndez, responded to an ad at a music shop placed by Åkerfeldt. López and Méndez were fans of the band and took the ads down themselves so no other musicians could apply for the job. Åkerfeldt and Lindgren did not want the Martíns to join at first, due to them already knowing each other; they felt that they wanted two strangers so that there wouldn't be two camps in the band, but eventually hired both. López made his debut with Opeth playing on a cover version of Iron Maiden's \\"Remember Tomorrow\\", which was included on the album A Call to Irons: A Tribute to Iron Maiden.With a larger recording budget from Century Media, Opeth began work on its third album, with noted Swedish producer Fredrik Nordström, at Studio Fredman in August 1997.

I thought I had moved past it for the most part, thanks to supportive family and lots of counseling and medication to treat my treatment resistant depression I’ve struggled over the last 25 years. I will be 40 this year. My son, the oldest, turned 15 this year … the same age I was when it began. I see how young he is and recognized for the first time just how young I had been when I was abused. That was really hard for me, emotionally. Now, I look at my two girls, ages 9 and 3, and worry for their safety - probably more than I should, but understandable given what I went through. We have had lots of “body safety” talks and my older daughter understands the very basics of what I went through, mainly because I have spent a great part of this past year writing a memoir about my experiences and have begun speaking publicly about what I went through and what it means to be a survivor. This is challenging because it’s hard to talk about and explain to a child in a way that they understand without making them fear the world. I struggle with this often. I’ve chosen to use it as an opportunity to teach them about activism and the power of speaking the truth, what it means to be a survivor instead of a victim.

I never heard the word \\"queue\\" before. Um-what you call \\"chips\\", I call \\"French fries\\". I never heard them called \\"chips\\". Urn-there's so many-urn-words that are different.

Ah-the dress is different. You see a lot of-I see a lot of males here with earring in one of their-in one of their ears. You don't see that in America that much. Somet-maybe here and there, but not, not like you see it here. Ah-so many of the young people wear black-clothing-you know, I don't-you don't see the other colors. At home you see all different types of bright colors-and in England you see so much black. Especially on the women. Interviewer: You don't like that? Mathew: Not really. It's just my own preference.

Interviewer: What do you think the reasons are for that? Mathew: Urn-that's a good question-urn-well, I think that the reasons are-just because of the Press. You hear so much about America here that people are-they're into it-they want to know what it's about and how it's run.

(CNN) -- The jury weighing the fate of a white Florida man accused of killing a black teen during an argument over loud music concluded its second day of deliberations Thursday after asking a judge for details about a letter written in the months after the shooting. The jury was scheduled to resume deliberations Friday at 9 a.m. ET. The question was the latest posed by the jury considering the evidence in the case against Michael Dunn, who says he acted in self-defense when he opened fire on four teenagers in an SUV in Jacksonville in November 2012. Prosecutors contend it was an act of murder. Dunn has been charged with first-degree murder in the killing of 17-year-old Jordan Davis. He also has been charged with three counts of attempted murder. If Dunn is found guilty, he faces up to life in prison. Though","completion":"the trial has been emotionally charged for both the victim's family and supporters of Dunn, the jury must evaluate the evidence objectively to reach a verdict. The letter requested by the jury may offer additional insight into Dunn's thought process and actions during the event, crucial in determining whether he truly believed he was in danger and acted in self-defense, or if he maliciously intended to harm the teens out of anger. Throughout the trial, both the prosecution and the defense have presented various witnesses and evidence, including the testimony of the other teens in the SUV and forensic evidence supporting each side's narrative. Key factors for the jury to consider include the severity of the perceived threat, the rationality of Dunn's reactions, and whether this response was proportionate to the situation. Ultimately, the jury will decide whether Dunn is guilty or not based on the evidence provided and their interpretation of the law. It is their responsibility to weigh the credibility of testimonies, as well as any potentially mitigating or aggravating factors. This case underscores the importance of a fair, impartial, and objective jury within the criminal justice system, as well as the ongoing discussions surrounding racial tensions, gun control, and self-defense laws in the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What's the most logical way to complete this passage? Designer Ralph Lauren is making model-related headlines again. The last time this happened, it was when the iconic American brand digitally altered model Filippa Hamilton into a biologically impossible state, rendering her waist and pelvis in miniature and leaving the rest of her body normal-sized. Astute critics noticed and spoke up. It didn't help matters when Hamilton herself stated that she was allegedly fired by the brand for being \\"too fat\\" by fashion world metrics. More recently, however, the Ralph Lauren brand has made attempts to improve its image and hired Australian plus-size model Robyn Lawley, who stands 6-foot-2 and wears a size 12, for a print campaign. After the public relations nightmare with Hamilton, many have heralded this choice as a positive sign of improvement in a fashion industry that overwhelmingly hires and promotes models who are far thinner than the average American woman. The truth is, we want to see \\"real women\\" when they look like","completion":"Robyn Lawley, but the fashion industry still has a long way to go in embracing body diversity and inclusivity. For years, the industry has perpetuated unhealthy standards of beauty by predominantly featuring models with extremely slender figures. This has not only led to a skewed perception of what a \\"normal\\" or \\"average\\" body should look like, but has also contributed to body-image struggles and disordered eating among many young women who may try to emulate these impossible norms. The most logical way to complete this passage would be to: Acknowledge that the industry has begun to take small yet significant steps toward broadening the types of bodies they represent. Brands like Aerie, Dove, and Fenty have pioneered a trend of embracing size and shape diversity, celebrating the beauty of different body types and urging the fashion world to follow suit. The hiring of Robyn Lawley by Ralph Lauren is a step in the right direction, but it is essential to recognize that one or a few campaigns don't signify a total transformation of the industry. Further, efforts must be made to challenge the fashion industry to not only embrace diverse body sizes but also be inclusive of different ethnicities, ages, abilities, and gender identities. Models like Ashley Graham, Tess Holliday, and Halima Aden have broken barriers in their respective categories, yet there is still much work to be done. Diversity and inclusion must become the norm, rather than being viewed as a quick public relations fix or a merely \\"trendy\\" move. Ideally, fashion should be a reflection of the wide range of people who inhabit our world, encompassing the multitude of shapes, sizes, and backgrounds that comprise \\"real women.\\" To truly address the root of the issue, educational programs and advocacy efforts should target the fashion industry at every level, from designers and editors to agents and photographers. In this way, we can hope to create a global shift in attitude that will celebrate all forms of beauty and foster a more inclusive, accepting, and healthy environment for everyone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence: \\"I ate apple.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","completion":"A linguist would likely rate the sentence, \\"I ate apple,\\" as acceptable linguistically depending on the context in which it is used and the criteria they are using to evaluate the sentence. For a more in-depth examination, let's consider the various components of the sentence and its overall structure from different linguistic perspectives. 1. Syntax: The sentence \\"I ate apple\\" follows the basic structure of a subject-verb-object (SVO) sentence, which is commonly used in English. In this case, \\"I\\" is the subject, \\"ate\\" is the verb, and \\"apple\\" is the object. From a syntactic perspective, the sentence appears acceptable, though it could be improved upon by adding \\"an\\" or \\"the\\" before \\"apple\\" to indicate that only one apple was eaten. 2. Semantics: Semantically, the sentence is mostly clear, as it conveys the meaning that the speaker consumed an apple. The lack of an article before \\"apple\\" might make the sentence sound less natural, but the essential meaning remains intact. A listener would still understand the general meaning of the sentence. 3. Pragmatics: Pragmatically, the sentence could be interpreted as acceptable in certain contexts where minimizing grammatical elements is useful. For instance, in informal communication, such as text messages or abbreviated notes, users often leave out articles or other parts of speech to conserve space and time. This could make the sentence acceptable in certain situations when brevity is prioritized. 4. Morphology: From a morphological standpoint, all the individual words in the sentence are correct and properly used. The verb \\"ate\\" is the past tense form of the verb \\"to eat,\\" and \\"apple\\" is a common, uncountable noun that can be used without an article in specific contexts. The subject pronoun \\"I\\" is used correctly in this sentence. 5. Sociolinguistics: In the realm of sociolinguistics, which considers the social context and variation among speakers of a language, the sentence might be considered acceptable depending on the situation and the regional usage of English. Some English dialects or speakers may use this sentence structure without issue, while others might consider it non-standard or less sophisticated. In conclusion, a linguist may rate the sentence \\"I ate apple\\" as acceptable linguistically, depending on the specific context in which it is used and the criteria being prioritized. While the sentence could be improved by adding an article (\\"an\\" or \\"the\\") before \\"apple,\\" the overarching meaning is still clear to a listener. Depending on the context and linguistic perspective, the sentence could be understood and deemed acceptable, even if it may not adhere to standard English grammar rules universally."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Does happiness have a scent? When someone is happy,can you smell it? You can usually tell when someone is happy based on seeing them smile,hearing them laugh or perhaps from receiving a big hug.But can you also smell their happiness? Surprising new research suggests that happiness does indeed have a scent,and that the experience of happiness can be transmitted through smell,reports Phys.org. For the study,12 young men were shown videos meant to bring about a variety of emotions while researchers gathered sweat samples from them.All of the men were healthy and none of them were drug users or smokers,and all were asked to abstain from drinking or eating smelly foods during the study period. Those sweat samples were then given to 36 equally healthy young women to smell,while researchers monitored their reactions.Only women were selected to smell the samples,apparently because previous research has shown that women have a better sense of smell than men and are also more sensitive to emotional signaling--though it's unclear why only men were chosen to produce the scents. Researchers found that the behavior of the women after smelling the scents--particularly their facial expressions--indicated a relationship between the emotional states of the men who produced the sweat and the women who sniffed them. \\"Human sweat produced when a person is happy brings about a state similar to happiness in somebody who breathes this smell,\\" said study co-author Gun Semin,a professor at Koc University in Turkey. This is a fascinating finding because it not only means that happiness does have a scent,but that the scent is capable of transmitting the emotion to others.The study also found that other emotions,such as fear,seem to carry a scent too.This ensures previous research suggesting that some negative emotions have a smell,but it is the first time this has proved to be true of positive feelings. Researchers have yet to isolate exactly what the chemical compound for the happiness smell is,but you might imagine what the potential... Question: What is the main finding of the new research? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Pleasant feelings can be smelt out.\\"? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the main finding of the new research is that pleasant feelings, such as happiness, can be smelled. The study showed that human sweat produced when a person is happy can induce a similar state of happiness in someone who breathes in that smell.

Gregory Peck's brilliant portrayal of Douglas MacArthur from the Battle of Corregidor in the Philippines at the start of the Pacific War largely through to his removal as UN Commander during the Korean War offers reason to believe all three of the above possibilities. Certainly the most controversial American General of the Second World War (and possibly ever) MacArthur is presented here as a man of massive contradictions. He claims that soldiers above all yearn for peace, yet he obviously glories in war; he consistently denies any political ambitions, yet almost everything he does is deliberately used to boost himself as a presidential candidate; he obviously believes that soldiers under his command have to follow his orders to the letter, yet he himself deliberately defies orders from the President of the United States; he shows great respect for other cultures (particularly in the Philippines and Japan) and yet is completely out of touch with his own country. All these things are held in balance throughout this movie, and in the end the viewer is left to draw his or her own conclusions about the man, although one is left with no doubt that MacArthur sincerely and passionately loved his country, and especially the Army he devoted his life to. Peck's performance was, as I said, brilliant - to the point, actually, of overshadowing virtually everyone else in the film (which is perhaps appropriate, given who he was portraying!) with the possible exception of Ed Flanders. I though he offered a compelling look at Harry Truman and his attitude to MacArthur: sarcastic (repeatedly referring to MacArthur as \\"His Majesty,\\") angry, frustrated and finally completely fed up with this General who simply won't respect his authority as President. Marj Dusay was also intriguing as MacArhur's wife Jean, devoted to her husband (whom she herself referred to as \\"General,\\" although their relationship seems to have been a happy enough one.) I very much enjoyed this movie, although perhaps would have liked to have learned a little more about MacArthur's early life. I have always chuckled at MacArthur's reaction to Eisenhower being elected President (\\"He'll make a fine President - he was the best damn clerk I ever had\\" - which seems to sum up what MacArthur thought the role of the President should be, especially to his military commanders during wartime.)

If the US states that border Canada from west to east are Washington, Idaho, Montana, and North Dakota, what comes next?","completion":"The next U.S. state that borders Canada moving from west to east, after Washington, Idaho, Montana, and North Dakota, is Minnesota. Minnesota is located in the upper Midwest region of the United States and has a long international border with the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Manitoba. The border between Minnesota and Canada stretches approximately 547 miles (881 kilometers), with the majority of the border shared with the province of Ontario. A key feature of this border is the Rainy River, which flows westward from Lake of the Woods to the Lake of the Woods-Rainy River drainage divide. The border is further demarcated by the line running through the middle of Lake Superior in the south, which separates Minnesota from the Canadian province of Ontario. Minnesota is known as the \\"Land of 10,000 Lakes\\" due to its vast number of freshwater lakes, and it is home to the headwaters of the Mississippi River, which begins at Lake Itasca. The state's largest cities are Minneapolis and Saint Paul, which together form the metropolitan area known as the Twin Cities.

If you want to add significance to the process, you can use coins minted in years that mean something, such as your birth year. You can also purchase old Chinese coins if you want to add authenticity to the process. 2. Prepare your mind: Before beginning the consultation, take a few moments to quiet your mind and center yourself. Reflect on the question or situation you want guidance on, and formulate it as clearly as possible in your mind. 3. Toss the coins: Hold the three coins in your hand and silently ask your question or focus on your situation. Then, toss the coins gently onto a flat surface. 4. Interpret the results: Each coin has two sides - heads and tails. For the purpose of I Ching, assign a value of 3 to heads and a value of 2 to tails. Add up the values of the three coins. The result will be either 6, 7, 8, or 9. Each number corresponds to a specific I Ching line: - 6: A changing yin line (represented by a broken line with an X) - 7: A solid yang line (represented by an unbroken line) - 8: A broken yin line (represented by a broken line) - 9: A changing yang line (represented by an unbroken line with a circle) 5. Record the line: Draw the corresponding line at the bottom of a piece of paper or on a separate document. 6. Repeat the process: Toss the coins five more times, interpreting each result and recording the corresponding line above the previous one. This will give you a total of six lines, forming a hexagram. 7. Look up the hexagram: Consult an I Ching reference book or search online to find the specific hexagram formed by your six lines. Read the interpretation and consider how it relates to your question or situation. 8. Apply the changes: If you received any changing lines (lines with an X or a circle), these lines transform into their opposites, creating a new hexagram. Look up the meaning of the new hexagram as well, to gain further insight into how the situation may change or develop over time. Consider the guidance provided by the I Ching in the context of your own intuition and life experience. As you practice consulting the I Ching, you may find that your understanding and interpretation of the hexagrams deepen and become more personal to you. Remember that the I Ching is an ancient and profound system of divination, but ultimately, your own inner wisdom and judgment should guide your actions and decisions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How does the sentence end? See options at the end I ate a lot less vegetables than I ate fruits, because the Select from the following. [-] vegetables were fresh.. [-] fruits were fresh..","completion":"The sentence ends as: I ate a lot less vegetables than I ate fruits, because the fruits were fresh. This ending suggests that the distinction between the individual's consumption of vegetables and fruits was predominantly influenced by the freshness of the fruits. It implies that the freshness of the fruits enhanced their appeal to the individual, making them more desirable and palatable in comparison to the vegetables. Fresh fruits are often vibrant in color, juicy, sweet, and filled with flavor, which encourages their consumption by many people. Moreover, the preference for fresh fruits may also demonstrate awareness about the health benefits that they offer. Fresh fruits are packed with an array of vital nutrients including vitamins, minerals, and fiber. They are known to lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of heart disease, and aid in digestive health. Additionally, the natural sugars found in fruits provide a healthier energy source than artificial, processed sugars. However, while fruits are an essential component of a balanced diet, vegetables also pack a variety of health benefits, and are a good source of dietary fiber, providing essential vitamins like vitamin A, vitamin K and vitamin B6, dietary minerals including magnesium, dietary fiber and a variety of phytochemicals, such as beta-carotene. Some studies suggest that diets rich in vegetables reduce the risk of certain types of cancer and other chronic diseases. Thus, it is crucial to maintain a balance and include both fruits and vegetables in one's diet. You can say that the freshness of fruits has driven this particular individual's dietary preferences. But this preference may fluctify once fresh vegetables become available or the individual decides to incorporate more vegetables into their diet. After all, a balanced diet requires the intake of a variety of nutrients, which can be gained from diversity in food consumption. All in all, the sentence \\"I ate a lot less vegetables than I ate fruits, because the fruits were fresh\\" serves to highlight personal eating tendencies in the context of food freshness, possibly reflecting on health-conscious decisions as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes","completion":"The sentiment of the movie review sentence \\"a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating, that is, for about ten minutes\\" is mixed but leaning more towards negative. Initially, the review presents a positive sentiment, as evidenced by the use of the adjective \\"fascinating.\\" This adjective generally implies that the movie has captured the reviewer's interest in a compelling manner. The description of the movie as a \\"curiosity piece\\" also initially appears to be positive. It suggests that there is some unique, engaging aspect to the film that sets it apart from others. However, the latter part of the sentence, \\"fascinating, that is, for about ten minutes,\\" changes the overall tone of the sentiment by introducing a significant limitation to the positive aspects mentioned earlier. This addition implies that while the movie may have been interesting and unique in the beginning, its appeal only lasted for a short time - ten minutes, to be precise. This significantly lowers the overall positive sentiment by suggesting that the movie is unable to sustain the interest promised at the start. Thus, while the movie review sentence starts on a positive note, it ultimately conveys dissatisfaction with the film's inability to maintain its initial charm or fascination. The resulting sentiment can be described as mixed but skewing towards the negative, as it implies that the viewer's experience deteriorated after the initial ten minutes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: Double car bomb explosion killed four and injured at least 46 as blasts struck outside the headquarters of the court bailiffs' service in the capital of Russia’s Dagestan Republic, Makhachkala. The first car with the explosive placed underneath reportedly went off causing no fatalities or injuries. Once law enforcement arrived at the scene, the second bomb detonated, Interfax reported citing the local Investigative Committee. “As far as I know there are three people dead. One of them is our employee,” spokesperson of the Court Bailiffs' Service Magomed Buttaev told RT. The death toll rose to four people after another man, an employee of the court bailiffs' service, died of his injuries in hospital, according an Interior Ministry spokesman. Initial reports suggested eight people died at the scene, Interfax news agency reported. “Two cars were detonated within several minutes. At least eight people have been killed, while the number of injured is being clarified. More than 20 cars have been damaged,” the agency quoted the representative of Dagestan’s Investigative Committee. However, the chief physician in Dagestan, Kazanfar Kurbanov, has later confirmed that three people died and 24 were injured. “There have been 46 people hospitalized,” Interfax reported citing its source. As said, the blasts occurred approximately 15 minutes apart from each other with the two bombs were detonated remotely. Interfax quotes a source who said that an explosive was also found in a trash can. “It has already been established that the first explosive was placed under the car,” one of the spokesman told media. The force of the second blast was the equivalent of up to 50 kg of TNT, Rasul Temirbekov from the local Investigative committee told ITAR-TASS, adding that the first blast was less powerful, nearly causing damage to nearby parked cars. According to law enforcement officials, perpetrators clearly used a tactic which is quite common in Dagestan, when the first blast is bait to attract more people and the second explosion goes off when people are at the scene, thus injuring and killing law enforcement members. “The majority of injured are police officers who arrived at the scene after the first blast. There are at least 15 of them now,” ITAR-TASS quotes the local Interior Ministry. Russia’s Emergencies Ministry has sent doctors and psychologists from Moscow to Makhachkala. The IL-76 jet will deliver 26 specialists to Dagestan, and then return with victims of the blast to Moscow hospitals if needed. No one has claimed responsibility for the double blast, with no suspects yet identified. Investigators have said they will use the registration plates of one of the vehicles involved, in a bid to track down the culprits. “We plan to ID the owner of the exploded car and unravel the case trough this information,” an investigative committee spokesperson said. There's a belief that the car was stolen. In a recent incident near a shopping center on May 1, two teenagers were killed and another two injured as they tried to uncover the dangerous object, wrapped up either in a box or a bag. ||||| Police and investigators work at the scene of a blast in Makhachkala May 20, 2013.

MAKHACHKALA, Russia Two car bombs killed at least four people and wounded dozens of others on Monday in one of the bloodiest attacks this year in Dagestan, a turbulent province in Russia's North Caucasus region where armed groups are waging an Islamist insurgency. Car bombs, suicide bombings and firefights are common in Dagestan, at the center of an insurgency rooted in two post-Soviet wars against separatist rebels in neighboring Chechnya. Such attacks are rare in other parts of Russia, but in a separate incident in a suburb of Moscow on Monday, security forces killed two suspected militants alleged to have been plotting an attack in the capital and arrested a third suspect after a gunbattle. One elite police officer was lightly wounded in the exchange of gunfire with the suspects - Russian citizens but trained in Afghanistan or Pakistan - who had holed up in a home in the town of Orekhovo-Zuyevo east of Moscow, authorities said. Investigators initially said eight people had been killed by the successive blasts in Dagestan's provincial capital Makhachkala, but law enforcement and health officials later put the death toll at four and said about 40 people were wounded. The explosions occurred with the space of a few minutes near the headquarters of the court bailiffs' service and appeared to have been detonated by remote control, said the federal Investigative Committee, a Russian state agency. Twisted wreckage of a car could be seen near the building, which was cordoned off by police, and blackened chunks of metal lay in the street. The Health Ministry said 35 people remained in hospital, including one child, a few hours after the blasts, which the Investigative Committee called a \\"terrorist act\\". The main suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings in the United States, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, lived in Dagestan with his family about a decade ago and visited the region last year. The visit by Tsarnaev, who was shot dead by U.S. police after the April 15 bombings that killed three people and wounded 264 others, is being scrutinized by U.S. investigators for signs of ties with insurgents. Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered law enforcement authorities to ensure insurgents do not attack the 2014 Winter Olympics next February in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi, which is close to the North Caucasus. All those wounded or killed were apparently caught by the second of Monday's explosions, a few minutes after the first, the investigators said. Insurgents in the North Caucasus have often sought to increase casualties by setting off an initial blast to attract law enforcement officers and then detonating a second bomb. Dagestan, an ethnically mixed, mostly Muslim region between Chechnya and the Caspian Sea, has become the most violent province in the North Caucasus, where insurgents say they are fighting to carve out an Islamic state out of southern Russia. At least 405 people were killed in Dagestan in violence linked to the insurgency last year, according to the Caucasian Knot website, which tracks developments in the region. Putin launched the second war in Chechnya as prime minister in 1999 and likes to take credit for preventing the region from splitting from Russia. But his 13 years in power have been marred by deadly attacks claimed by or blamed on the insurgents. (Writing by Steve Gutterman; editing by Timothy Heritage and Jon Hemming) ||||| Makhachkala, Dagestan (CNN) -- At least four people are dead and 44 are injured after two bombs exploded Monday in Russia's volatile North Caucasus region, the Ministry of Health's website says. Thirty-one of the injured were hospitalized, it says. The incident -- which occurred in Makhachkala, capital of the semi-autonomous republic of Dagestan -- also caused significant damage. Security officials say they believe law enforcement officers may have been the target because the explosion occurred outside a local marshal's building. One car bomb was discovered by a police patrol, who called in a unit to defuse it. Before that could be done, the bomb went off, but the explosion was minor, security officials said. Then, as a crowd of people gathered, a second, more powerful device detonated, causing the casualties. An Islamic insurgency has taken hold in the North Caucasus and there is a strong presence of Islamic militants fighting Moscow's rule. READ MORE: Dagestan violence kills at least 5 Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev -- the suspects in the Boston Marathon terror attack last month -- had ties with the region. The brothers are ethnic Chechens who lived in Kyrgyzstan and Dagestan. Authorities who've been investigating how the brothers became radicalized are interested in a trip Tamerlan Tsarnaev took to Dagestan last year. Russian authorities asked U.S. officials to investigate Tsarnaev before the trip, saying they believed he was becoming increasingly involved with radical Islam. The FBI investigated, but found no evidence of extremist activity, FBI Director Robert Mueller told a Senate committee. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is in custody. His older brother died after a shootout with police just outside Boston days after the bombing.

On the day that France surrenders to Nazi Germany in 1940, Prudence \\"Pru\\" Cathaway a strong-willed young woman from the upper class, joins the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, a military organisation linked to the Royal Air Force, to her family's surprise. Her aunt Iris and uncle Wilbur disapprove since she has chosen to serve as a private rather than as an officer. However, family butler Parsons privately expresses his support. She goes off to training camp, where she makes friends with fellow WAAF Violet Worthing. As a favor to Violet, Prudence agrees to go on a double date one night; she is paired with Clive Briggs, a moody mysterious man with a dark secret. He seems to her rather bitter about something and is indifferent, even hostile, to her aristocratic background, but she likes him, and he asks her out again. Romance blooms. On a holiday together on the southern coast, Pru twice overhears Clive talking in his sleep. The second time, she wakes him up, but he does not want to talk about it. Then his friend Monty shows up. When the three go to dinner, Pru learns from Monty that Clive is up for a Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions during the Dunkirk evacuation. While Pru is dancing with someone else, Monty pleads with Clive to return with him. He was given a month's sick leave, but that was over two months ago, and he is about to be posted as a deserter.

The word \\"wander\\" in both sentences is used as a verb to indicate movement or travel with no specific destination or purpose. In both cases, \\"wander\\" involves a leisurely, aimless, or undirected manner of travel. The primary difference lies in the nature of the scenarios and the subjects involved. In the first sentence, \\"To wander over the fields,\\" the context suggests that the act of wandering is a voluntary, purposeful, and possibly enjoyable endeavor. It implies that someone chooses to roam around the fields without a particular goal in mind. This form of wandering might refer to someone searching for inspiration, exploring nature out of curiosity, or simply seeking a break from everyday routine. In the second sentence, \\"Might her husband be wandering?\\" the context is more uncertain and possibly has a disconcerting tone.

I heard that Jesse pleased Lee's father and was ultimately rewarded for the kindness. And I was wondering What will Jesse want to do next? Answer:","completion":"Given the information provided, I will determine what Jesse might want to do next by considering various factors. Step 1: Analyze the context Jesse pleased Lee's father, likely by demonstrating good character traits or extending a helpful gesture. As a result, Jesse was rewarded for this kind act. Step 2: Consider Jesse's motivation It is possible that Jesse's motivation for the initial kindness was a genuine desire to help or out of a sense of compassion. Alternatively, Jesse could have acted with the goal of receiving a reward or gaining favor. Step 3: Reflect on potential actions If Jesse's motivation was primarily altruistic or caring, they may want to continue their helpful actions, build a deeper relationship with Lee and their family, or extend a similar kindness to others. If Jesse's motivation was focused on receiving a reward, assessing the value of their reward would provide insight into what they could do next. If the reward was significant or fulfilling, they may consider continuing their relationship with Lee's family or being kind to others with the hope of maintaining favor or receiving additional rewards. Step 4: Determine the most likely action Taking into account both the altruistic and reward-based motivations, Jesse might want to: 1. Further strengthen their relationship with Lee and their family, as relationships can provide emotional support, long-lasting friendships, and potential future opportunities. 2. Continue being kind to others to maintain a positive reputation, which can open doors to various social or professional opportunities. So, what Jesse will likely want to do next is to continue building strong relationships, nurturing their bond with Lee and their family, and being kind to others to foster a positive reputation and enhance personal growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

AFP - Australia will appeal directly to Singapore's president to spare the life of a Vietnamese-Australian facing execution for smuggling heroin into the city-state, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said.","completion":"The situation described in the excerpt is about the Australian government's plan to appeal to the President of Singapore to spare the life of a Vietnamese-Australian citizen facing execution for smuggling heroin into Singapore. In this case, the individual involved is a Vietnamese-Australian, which means they have a connection with Australia either by birth, naturalization, or any other legally recognized means. It is not uncommon for countries to make diplomatic appeals on behalf of their citizens who are facing serious legal consequences in foreign countries, especially when it comes to the death penalty. The Foreign Minister of Australia, Alexander Downer, announced the Australian government's intention to appeal directly to Singapore's president. This suggests that the government of Australia has taken an active role in advocating for leniency in this case. Diplomatic appeals, such as the one mentioned here, are usually made in cases where the government of the citizen's home country believes that the punishment does not fit the crime, or that there may be humanitarian grounds for clemency. Singapore is a country with strict laws and regulations, especially in regards to drug crimes. Possessing, trafficking, manufacturing, importing, or exporting illicit drugs are offenses that are punishable by law, often resulting in severe penalties. Singapore's Misuse of Drugs Act imposes a mandatory death penalty for certain types and amounts of drugs being trafficked or smuggled. This harsh stance towards drugs is rooted in Singapore's belief that drug abuse and addiction have the potential to destroy the social fabric, and thus, their tough laws serve as a deterrent to people engaging in such activities. In this specific case, the Vietnamese-Australian faced execution for smuggling heroin into Singapore. It is not mentioned whether the execution is imminent or if there is still an ongoing judicial process. Nevertheless, the Australian government's decision to intervene indicates that they believe there might be justifiable reasons for leniency. Such reasons could include the individual's personal background, circumstances leading to the crime, or any mitigating factors that may warrant a reduction in punishment. In appealing directly to the President of Singapore, the Australian government is seeking the highest level of intervention possible. The President of Singapore, in certain cases, has the constitutional authority to grant pardons or commutation of sentences. However, this power is typically exercised sparingly and is solely at the discretion of the President. In conclusion, this situation pertains to the Australian government's efforts to save the life of a Vietnamese-Australian citizen who is facing execution in Singapore for smuggling heroin into the country. Foreign Minister Alexander Downer announced Australia's intention to appeal directly to Singapore's President, hoping to secure clemency on humanitarian grounds or due to any mitigating circumstances. The case highlights the complex interplay between international diplomacy, national drug policies, and the rights of individuals facing severe legal consequences abroad."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

'Get Me Roger Stone' documentary offers good insight into the dark forces behind Trump's rise. Political consultant Roger Stone attends a screening of \\"Get Me Roger Stone\\" at the SVA Theatre during the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival on April 23, 2017 in New York. (Photo: Brent N. Clarke, Brent N. Clarke/Invision/AP) “I was like a jockey looking for a horse. You can’t win the race if you don’t have a horse. He’s a prime piece of political horse flesh in my view.” – Roger Stone on Donald Trump. A grapefruit-size grinning face of Richard Nixon is tattooed on the back of Roger Stone, the longtime political operative and legendary dirty trickster. Stone, 64, credited with propelling Donald Trump into politics, defends the tattoo proudly in an early scene from Get Me Roger Stone, the fascinating and instructive new documentary recently released on Netflix. Anyone trying to keep up with the daily drama emanating from the White House lately — from President Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey to the multiple Russia investigations to the Comey memos — could benefit from a screening of this film. The documentary follows Stone from his earliest days in politics, as a 19-year-old neophyte performing dirty tricks for Nixon’s 1972 re-election campaign and the youngest person called to testify in front of the Watergate grand jury, to his close involvement in Trump's surprising win last year. I had heard of Roger Stone, of his gutter-level tactics, his conspiracy theories and his close ties to Trump. But I had little idea of the depth of influence he’s had on American politics the past five decades and on the current White House tenant. Like others, I've been intrigued by the forces that propelled Trump to the presidency and so deeply divided our nation. Get Me Roger Stone offers some of the best insight into this I've seen anywhere. Interestingly, the filmmakers — Morgan Pehme, Dylan Bank and Dan DiMauro — met Stone six years ago and planned to do a movie focusing on his influence on American politics. They had gathered five years worth of footage on Stone before the 2016 presidential campaign even began. But as Trump marched through the primaries, with Stone ever-lurking in his shadows, they realized they had something much bigger. Their goal was not to make a liberal, finger-wagging hit piece, DiMauro told me, but a film that peeled back the veneer of modern political campaigning and explained how Stone — and others like him — have muddied modern political discourse. “Sunlight is the best disinfectant,” DiMauro said. “By making this film, we wanted people to understand the profound effect (Stone) has had on our politics and the degradation of political discourse over the past 50 years.” Co-director Pehme said he hopes viewers of the film realize elections are about more than just the candidates. \\"We are painfully naive about the fact that the most powerful people, the people really moving our country, are the people behind the camera, in the shadows, like Roger Stone,\\" he said. After Watergate, the film follows Stone through his Forrest-Gump-like political career: Working on the campaigns of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush; peddling access in the influential D.C. lobbying firm of Black, Manafort and Stone (known as the “Torturer’s Lobby” for taking on clients such as Zaire's dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines); pioneering negative TV ads through political-action committees; orchestrating street protests on behalf of George W. Bush during the 2000 Florida presidential election recount. “Those who say I have no soul, those who say I have no principles, are losers,” Stone says in the film. In 1987, Stone began urging Trump to run for president. In the film, Trump praises Stone repeatedly, calling him “tough” and a “quality guy.” In one sequence, the film shows how Stone helped sabotage the Reform Party’s chances in the 2000 presidential election by urging Pat Buchanan to run as a Reform candidate, then backing Trump to run against Buchanan. In part because of Trump’s brash attacks on his rival (“He’s a Hitler lover,” Trump repeatedly says about Buchanan), the Reform Party imploded, paving the way for Bush’s contentious win that year. Stone’s fingerprints, according to the film, were again all over Trump’s victory last year: the “Make America Great Again” slogan (borrowed from a Reagan campaign Stone worked on); questioning President Obama’s birth certificate; spreading unfounded allegations that Bill Clinton is a serial rapist. Stone's name has also been mentioned in connection to the widening FBI inquiry into Russia's interference in the 2016 election. “Roger’s relationship with Trump has been so interconnected that it’s hard to define what’s Roger and what’s Donald,” Paul Manafort, Stone’s ex-partner and Trump’s former campaign manager, says in the film. Toward the end of the movie, Stone is seen inside a stretch limo winding its way through midtown Manhattan. It's after the November elections and Stone is aglow with his protégé's victory. \\"This is the manifestation of a dream I've had since 1988,\\" he says. \\"I always thought Donald Trump had the size and the courage ... to become president of the United States.\\" The camera follows Stone as he exits the limo and disappears into Trump Tower.

Realitatea este că, cu un buget care reprezintă doar 2 % din cheltuielile publice ale UE, urmărirea unor politici ambițioase în toate sectoarele va fi dificilă. Translate to English","completion":"The reality is that, with a budget representing only 2% of the EU's public spending, pursuing ambitious policies in all sectors will be difficult. The European Union's relatively small budget, accounting for just 2% of its total public expenditure, poses a significant challenge when it comes to achieving ambitious goals across various sectors. Addressing these challenges will require a strategic approach and collaborative efforts among member countries. First and foremost, it is important to recognize the limitations of the EU's financial resources in the context of its diverse policy sectors, which include economic development, agriculture, infrastructure, education, climate change, and more. Given that each sector requires substantial funding to implement concrete and transformative initiatives, the EU's current budgetary constraints hinder its capacity to support ambitious projects in every sector simultaneously. Despite these limitations, the EU has already made great strides in various policy areas. For instance, it has demonstrated considerable progress in areas such as regional development, climate change mitigation, and digital innovation. By leveraging its resources and working in close partnership with its member states, the EU has been able to drive lasting and tangible change across these crucial sectors. To further address the challenge posed by the limited budget, the EU needs to adopt innovative approaches to funding, as well as to policy design and implementation. In doing so, the EU could prioritize the most efficient and effective funding mechanisms that allow for the maximum impact to be achieved with limited resources. For example, the European Investment Bank (EIB) can play a crucial role in offering loans and guarantees to support private investment in key strategic industries and infrastructure projects. Additionally, the EU should continue to focus its efforts on fostering cooperation and collaboration among member countries to pool resources and generate synergies across sectors. By sharing expertise and best practices, the EU can increase the efficiency of policy implementation and maximize the impact of its budget. Furthermore, the EU should actively explore opportunities to collaborate with other international organizations and the private sector in order to enhance its financial and operational capacities. This not only includes tapping into new funding sources but also fostering knowledge exchange and technological cooperation to tackle shared challenges effectively. In conclusion, while the relatively modest budget of the European Union presents difficulties in pursuing ambitious policies across all sectors, strategic efforts in prioritizing funding mechanisms and fostering collaboration among member states and international partners can help amplify the EU's impact. By leveraging its resources in the most efficient and effective manner, the EU can continue to drive transformational change across various sectors, fulfilling its role as a global leader and ensuring sustainable development for its citizens."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Did you ever wonder how a microwave works?

This move comes after the seizure of a lighthouse situated on the Black Sea coast. The lighthouse holds great significance for a number of reasons, which is why it has garnered such extensive attention. The Black Sea is a crucial area for international maritime traffic and is a central economic corridor for both Russia and Europe. The Black Sea Fleet is an integral part of this maritime domain and serves as the core of Russia's naval power in the region. The seizure of the lighthouse has placed a spotlight on the vulnerability of these strategic landmarks, prompting the defense establishment to reinforce the security protocols in place. It is imperative to understand the strategic importance of the lighthouse in question. Lighthouses provide essential navigational aid to mariners and assist in facilitating safe routes for vessels passing through congested waters. This particular lighthouse, situated along the Black Sea coast, has a rich history and aids in crucial navigation along these waters. Its seizure has not only affected the smooth interoperability of maritime vessels but has also created a sense of insecurity, prompting the Russian authorities to tighten the security measures around its Black Sea Fleet. In response to the growing concerns, the naval authorities have initiated a comprehensive review of the existing security infrastructure and have identified key areas for improvement. Simultaneously, efforts are being made to procure and deploy advanced surveillance equipment to ensure better situational awareness in the area. These modern technological tools will be employed to maintain round-the-clock vigilance, providing an enriched level of security and threat detection. Another important aspect of the revised security measures is the increased collaboration among the various stakeholders involved in securing the maritime domain. The Russian defense establishment is now working closely with counterparts from neighboring countries to bolster interoperability and refine joint response mechanisms. This regional cooperation is aimed at enhancing mutual trust and promoting a unified approach towards addressing security challenges emerging in the Black Sea. In light of these mutual concerns, the participating nations are engaging in joint naval exercises designed to strengthen tactical proficiency and improve overall readiness. Additionally, the exchange of information on maritime threats and potential vulnerabilities is being actively encouraged. This intelligence sharing is critical in updating the threatscape and paving the way for a cooperative approach to maritime security in the Black Sea. In conclusion, the seizure of the lighthouse along the Black Sea coast has prompted the Russian Black Sea Fleet to reassess its security posture and take decisive measures to reinforce its protection. The multi-pronged strategy entails enhancing surveillance capabilities, strengthening regional cooperation, and conducting naval exercises in an effort to provide a secure environment for maritime traffic. It is through these comprehensive initiatives that Russia aims to maintain its strategic interests in the Black Sea and minimize any potential repercussions resulting from this incident."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - Tech house is a subgenre of house music that mixes elements of techno with house. The term \\"tech house\\" developed as a shorthand record store name for a category of electronic dance music that combined musical aspects of techno, such as \\"rugged basslines\\" and \\"steely beats,\\" with the harmonies and grooves of progressive house. The music originally had a clean and minimal production style that was associated with techno from Detroit and the UK. In the mid to late 1990s a scene developed in England around club nights such as The Drop run by Mr.C & Plink Plonk, Heart & Soul, and Wiggle run by Terry Francis and Nathan Coles. Other DJs and artists associated with the sound at that time included Charles Webster, Bushwacka!, Cuartero, Dave Angel, Herbert, Funk D'Void, Ian O'Brien, Derrick Carter, and Stacey Pullen. By the late 90's London nightclub The End, owned by the former Shamen rapper Richard West (Mr C) and Layo Paskin, was considered the home of tech house in the UK. Tech house tracks are typically between 610 minutes in length. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - Trance is a genre of electronic music that developed during the 1990s in Germany. It is characterized by a tempo lying between 125 and 150 beats per minute (BPM), repeating melodic phrases, and a musical form that distinctly builds tension and elements throughout a track often culminating in 1 to 2 \\"peaks\\" or \\"drops.\\" Although trance is a genre of its own, it liberally incorporates influences from other musical styles such as techno, house, pop, chill-out, classical music, tech house, ambient, and film music. - Matthias Paul, better known by his stage name Paul van Dyk (born 16 December 1971 in Eisenhüttenstadt, East Germany) is a German Grammy Award-winning DJ, record producer and musician. One of the first true superstar DJs, Paul van Dyk was the first artist to receive a Grammy Award nomination in the newly added category of Best Dance/Electronic album for his 2003 release \\"Reflections\\". He was named the World's number one DJ in both 2005 and 2006, something only few DJs have ever achieved. He was the first ever DJ to be named number one by \\"Mixmag\\" in 2005. By 2008, he had sold over 3 million albums worldwide. - The Politics of Dancing 2 is an album of trance music mixed by Paul van Dyk as a sequel to his The Politics of Dancing . - Mixmag is a British electronic dance and clubbing magazine, published in London, England. Launched in 1982, the magazine covers dance events, and reviews music and club nights. - East Germany, formally the German Democratic Republic or GDR, was an Eastern Bloc state during the Cold War period. From 1949 to 1990, it administered the region of Germany that was occupied by Soviet forces at the end of World War IIthe Soviet Occupation Zone of the Potsdam Agreement, bounded on the east by the OderNeisse line. The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin, but did not include it; as a result, West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR. The German Democratic Republic was established in the Soviet Zone, while the Federal Republic was established in the three western zones. East Germany was a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948, and the GDR began to function as a state on 7 October 1949. Soviet forces, however, remained in the country throughout the Cold War. Until 1989, the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party (SED), though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation, the National Front of Democratic Germany. - Eisenhüttenstadt (literally \\"ironworks city\\" in German) is a town in the Oder-Spree district of the state of Brandenburg, Germany, on the border with Poland. It had a population of 32,214 as of 31 December 2008.

Mount Danxia, the World Heritage Site containing spectacular red-striped sandstone landscape, including two bizarrely realistic (male and female) phallic rock formations, is in which country?","completion":"Mount Danxia, also known as Danxia Mountain, is located in China. More specifically, it is situated in the Renhua County, Shaoguan City of Guangdong Province, which is in the southeastern part of the country. The Danxia landforms, known for their colorful and spectacular red-striped sandstone landscapes, are unique geological formations found mainly in Southwestern China and are a stunning display of the earth's natural beauty. In 2010, UNESCO recognized Mount Danxia as a World Heritage Site, placing it under the combined title of \\"China Danxia.\\" This designation encompasses six inscribed landform groups across China, including Mount Danxia, each featuring distinctive and visually breathtaking examples of these unique sandstone formations. Mount Danxia is particularly famous for two phallic rock formations, one representing male genitals and the other representing female genitals. These formations, known as the \\"Yangyuan Stone\\" (male) and the \\"Yinyuan Hole\\" (female), have become a major attraction for tourists visiting the area, often drawing attention for their realistically shaped appearances. The Yangyuan Stone stands 28 meters tall, while the Yinyuan Hole reaches approximately 10 meters in diameter. These formations, together with the rest of the Danxia landforms, have resulted from millions of years of weathering and erosion processes acting upon red sandstone. Horizontal layers of sandstone have been exposed and shaped through natural forces such as wind, rainwater, and geological shifts, leading to the formation of unique and dramatic cliffs, mesas, and other geological features. The striking red and orange stripes that make Danxia landscapes famous are caused by variations in the iron content and oxidation levels over time. In addition to these geological wonders, Mount Danxia also boasts a rich history and cultural heritage. It is known for its numerous ancient temples, including the Zhanglao Temple, which dates back to the Tang Dynasty (618-906), and the Biezhuan Temple, a Buddhist site home to an impressive collection of stone carvings and statues. In conclusion, Mount Danxia, home to the spectacular red-striped Danxia landforms and the male and female phallic rock formations, is located in the Guangdong Province of China. Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of the China Danxia designation, it offers visitors an opportunity to witness the breathtaking beauty and the extraordinary natural formations that are the result of millions of years of geological processes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Bjorn Borg was born in Stockholm, Sweden, on 6 June 1956, as the only child of Rune and Margaretha Borg. He grew up in nearby Sodertalje. As a child, Borg became fascinated with a golden tennis racket that his father won at a table-tennis tournament. His father gave him the racket, beginning his tennis career. With 11 Grand Slam titles, Borg ranks sixth in the list of male tennis players who have won the most Grand Slam singles titles behind Roger Federer (20), Rafael Nadal (16), Pete Sampras (14), Roy Emerson (12), and Novak Djokovic (12). The French Open--Wimbledon double he achieved three times consecutively was called by Wimbledon officials \\"the most difficult double in tennis\\" and \\"a feat considered impossible among today's players.\\" Only Nadal (in 2008 and 2010) and Federer (in 2009) have managed to achieve this double since, and Andre Agassi, Nadal, Federer and Djokovic are the only male players since Borg to have won the French Open and Wimbledon men's singles titles over their career. Ilie Nastase once said about Borg, \\"We're playing tennis, and he's playing something else\\". In his 1979 autobiography, Jack Kramer, the long-time tennis promoter and great player himself, had already included Borg in his list of the 21 greatest players of all time. And in 2003, Bud Collins chose Borg as one of his top-five male players of all time. In 2008, ESPN.com asked tennis analysts, writers, and former players to build the perfect open era player. Borg was the only player mentioned in four categories: defense, footwork, intangibles, and mental toughness--with his mental game and footwork singled out as the best in open era history. Borg famously never won the US Open, losing in the final four times. Borg also never won the Australian Open, as he only played in the event once, in 1974 as a 17-year-old. The only players to defeat Borg in a Grand Slam final were fellow World No. 1 tennis players John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors. Even though it was then played on grass, a surface where he enjoyed much success, Borg chose to play the Australian Open only once, in 1974, where he lost in the third round. Phil Dent, a contemporary of Borg, has pointed out that skipping Grand Slam tournaments--especially the Australian Open--was not unusual then, before counting Grand Slam titles became the norm. Additionally, another contemporary Arthur Ashe told Sports Illustrated, \\"I think Bjorn could have won the U.S. Open. I think he could have won the Grand Slam, but by the time he left, the historical challenge didn't mean anything. He was bigger than the game. He was like Elvis or Liz Taylor or somebody.\\" Was there anything else important to happen with Borg?","completion":"Bjorn Borg's career was filled with several important milestones and events. Apart from his 11 Grand Slam titles, Borg also had a remarkable rivalry with fellow tennis legends John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors, which added drama and excitement to the tennis world in the 1970s and 1980s. Some important highlights from Borg's career and life include: 1. Davis Cup Success: Borg was a key player in helping Sweden win the Davis Cup in 1975, 1978, and 1980. His performances in these events were crucial for Sweden's success in the international tournament and further solidified his status as one of the top players in the world. 2. Record Winning Streak: In 1978, Borg set a then-record for the longest winning streak in the Open Era by registering 49 consecutive victories. This incredible run showcased Borg's consistency and dominance on multiple surfaces, as it included title wins on clay, grass, and hard courts. His record has since been broken, but it remains a testament to Borg's extraordinary skills and relentlessness. 3. Retirement and Comeback: Borg shocked the tennis world when he announced his retirement in 1983 at the young age of 26. His decision to step away from the game came after he grew disillusioned with the sport and the lifestyle it demanded. However, Borg attempted a comeback in the early 1990s but struggled to find success. His comeback was hampered by his refusal to adapt to modern equipment and the increased level of competition. Eventually, Borg retired for good in 1993. 4. Impact on Tennis Fashion: Throughout his career, Borg was known for his unique sense of style both on and off the court. His iconic headband and Fila-sponsored clothing became synonymous with the Swede's image, leading to an increase in tennis apparel sales and helping popularize the sportswear industry. 5. Personal Life: Borg's personal life saw its share of ups and downs, with tabloid reports chronicling relationships, marriages, and divorces. He was married to Romanian tennis pro Mariana Simionescu, followed by a second marriage to Italian singer Loredana Bertè. After his split with Bertè, Borg married Patricia Östfeld, with whom he has a child. 6. Post-Retirement Ventures: In addition to his brief comeback, Borg has explored several business opportunities since retiring from professional tennis. The most notable of these is the Bjorn Borg fashion brand, which focuses on sportswear and fashion clothing. The brand has since achieved international success and has expanded into other product lines such as fragrances and footwear. In conclusion, Bjorn Borg's impact on tennis goes beyond his impressive on-court achievements. He was an influential figure in the sport, inspiring a generation of athletes with his unique playing style, fashion sense, and undeniable charisma. His rivalry with fellow tennis greats like John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors added depth and passion to the sport, while his remarkable achievements and personal journey continue to inspire and captivate fans around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Passage:In 1795 Fijnje returned to the Netherlands (after the Batavian Revolution), after which he became a member of the commité van waakzaamheid (the Batavian version of the French Committee of Public Safety), chaired the Provisional Representatives of the People of Holland for a while. and - together with Samuel Iperusz Wiselius and professor Theodorus van Kooten - served on the committee for the liquidation of the VOC. In all these posts he took radical viewpoints, but he also enjoyed himself thoroughly. On 22 January 1798, he performed a Coup d'état with general Herman Willem Daendels, Pieter Vreede and Van Langen to guarantee \\"the unity and indivisibility\\" of the Batavian republic. The radical and omnipresent Fijnje represented the Uitvoerend Bewind and founded the \\"Binnenlandse Bataafse Courant\\" (Interior Batavian Courier). The controversial unitarissen did not long remain in power, for on 12 June 1798 general Daendels led another coup, this time putting the \\"moderates\\" in power in the Uitvoerend Bewind.

Morten Per Olsen (born 14 August 1949) is a Danish football manager and former football player. He was the head coach of the Danish national team for 15 years from 2000 until 2015, guiding Denmark to the 2002 FIFA World Cup, 2004 European Championship, 2010 FIFA World Cup and 2012 European Championship. He has also managed Brondby IF to two Danish Superliga championships and Ajax to the Double of the 1998 Dutch Eredivisie championship and Dutch Cup trophy. Olsen made his debut for the Denmark under-21 national team in September 1970, scoring a single goal in a 2-2 friendly match draw with the Poland U21s. Three weeks later, he was called up for the senior Danish national team under the Austrian national team manager Rudi Strittich, and Olsen made his national team debut in September 1970 against Norway. He played his first national team game as a right winger, but eventually settled as a defensive midfielder. He helped Denmark qualify for the 1972 Summer Olympics, but could not participate at the tournament, as he had signed a professional contract with Cercle Brugge beforehand. While at Anderlecht, Olsen became the seventh Dane to play 50 games for the national team, in June 1981. For Olsen's 53rd national team game in April 1983, the German national team manager of Denmark, Sepp Piontek, named Olsen permanent national team captain, as Olsen replaced the retiring Per Rontved as both libero and team captain. Olsen played as an attacking libero, and had defensive midfielder Jens Jorn Bertelsen cover for him when he was on the attack. Olsen, alongside defender Soren Busk, persuaded Piontek to implement the aggressive off-side trap they practiced at Anderlecht. Olsen captained the Danish team that qualified for the 1984 European Championship; Denmark's first international tournament participation since the 1972 Olympics. Denmark reached the semi-finals, before being eliminated by Spain on penalty shootout. In October 1985, Olsen became the second Dane, after Per Rontved, to play 75 national team matches. He captained Denmark at the 1986 World Cup, Denmark's first World Cup participation, which ended in a second round defeat to Spain. Olsen's most noticeable effort at the tournament came in the 2-0 group stage win against West Germany. He took the ball from his own half and made an irresistible dribbling run that was only stopped by a foul in the West German penalty area, with Jesper Olsen scoring the 1-0 goal on the resulting penalty kick. Olsen was identified as one of the overall top performers at the World Cup, and he was subsequently named 1986 Danish Player of the Year. While he was moved to a midfielder position at Koln, Olsen continued to play as a libero for Denmark. He captained Denmark at the 1988 European Championship, which ended in the preliminary group stage. During the tournament, Olsen proved too slow for the libero position, and was moved up as defensive midfielder, leaving the libero position for Lars Olsen. Morten Olsen ended his international career following the 1988 European Championship, having played 99 national team games, but was called up again 10 months later. Olsen became the first Dane to play 100 games for the national team in April 1989, before ending his national team career in June 1989. Olsen played a record 102 games and scored four goals for the national team, and set a record of 50 games as Danish national team captain. His team captain record was broken by Lars Olsen in 1992, while his game tally was bested by Peter Schmeichel in 1998. In his entire international career, Morten Olsen only got one yellow card.

Here is an article: Doris Payne in a Las Vegas courtroom in 2005.Photo: AP To steal a diamond worth nine figures from Cartier in Monte Carlo, you’d think you would need an “Ocean’s Eleven”-caliber team with big funding, a sleek cat-burglar wardrobe and at least one team member who can do parkour through a laser security force field. But Doris Payne, then in her 40s, did it all on her own with just simple sleight of hand. Payne, now 83, has been a jewel thief for 60 years, having stolen more than 2 million in goods. She is the subject of the new documentary, “The Life and Crimes of Doris Payne,” which begins a two-week run at Film Forum on Wednesday. Raised in West Virginia and Ohio, Payne spent her childhood watching her father beat her mother. When she was 23, she finally did something about it. She had been preparing for some time. “When [Payne] was a teenager, a store owner showed her some watches. She put one on her wrist, and when a white man walked in, the store owner asked her to leave because he didn’t want to be seen serving a black girl,” says Kirk Marcolina, who co-directed the film. “She walked out of the store, but realized she still had the watch on. She gave it back, then spent her teenage years perfecting that art.” Now, Payne walked out of a store in Pittsburgh wearing a diamond ring. For the first time ever, she didn’t give it back, and gave it to her mother to pay for her to escape the abuse. Payne poses in this undated photo provided by her family.Photo: AP But while Payne may have had noble motives the first time, she found herself addicted to the rush. Payne’s blend of charm and smarts has led to shocking successes, including her greatest heist — the Monte Carlo job in the early 1970s. Payne took a taxi to Cartier and asked the driver to wait. She entered the store, dropped a ring in her pocket and left. When she got back in the cab, she looked at what she had taken and almost fainted. “I looked at that ring and saw nine zeros,” said Payne, who had unknowingly stolen a 10-carat diamond. “The first thing I said to myself was, ‘You should not have done this.’ ” Police caught her at the airport, and she had to think fast. So she put the ring in her mouth. The cops came up empty. Payne put a tissue up to her face, as if to blow her nose. With her mouth covered, she spit the ring into the tissue and dropped it into her boot. Still, police were sure of her guilt. Monte Carlo did not have a facility for female criminals, so they booked her into a four-star hotel, where she requested a nail clipper, needle and thread. She used the clipper to pry the diamond from its mount and sewed the gem into her girdle. Authorities never found it, but Payne was sentenced to three years. Shortly after, nuns brought her to a health clinic, where they asked if she needed to use the bathroom. She went in, snuck back out and hailed a cab. Payne flew to New York, and within two hours of landing sold the jewel in the Diamond District for 148,000 (746,000 today). The film also covers the trial she was embroiled in at the time of filming, for stealing a 9,000 ring from a San Diego Macy’s. Throughout the film she claims innocence, despite the fact that she’s been convicted more times than she remembers — nine times before 1999, plus several since — and has escaped from jail almost as many. In the end, one of her smallest heists earns her one of her longest sentences. Payne in her cell at Clark County jail in 2005 after she was convicted of stealing a 9,000 diamond ring from a San Diego Macy’s.Photo: AP Most recently, on April 28, Payne pleaded guilty to stealing a 22,500 ring from a jeweler in Palm Desert, Calif. She was sentenced to two years in prison and two on house arrest. Due to her age, Marcolina expects Payne to be out before she completes her sentence. Still, it’s hard to imagine her not stealing. “She has such a lovely and mischievous way about her,” says co-director Matthew Pond, “and yet she’s proud of what she did. “One of the reasons she wanted to make the movie is that she’s proud of how smart she’s been.” 1. Payne never dresses too fancy when stealing in America, lest she stand out, although the appearance of status means more in Europe. 2. At a store, she requests several pieces to look at, then creates chaos: trying things on, taking them off, shuffling them around the top of the case. 3. She distracts a salesperson by asking for yet another item, then grabs a jewel — though not the one she’s hoping to steal. 4. Payne asks for the jewel she took, and when the distressed salesperson can’t find it, the piece suddenly turns up. This is how Payne earns their trust. 5. Having tempered suspicion, she waits for an opportune moment, takes the jewel she wants, and walks casually out of the store.

Write a summary based on this article: A leading palliative care nurse with no serious health problems has ended her life at a Swiss suicide clinic because she did not want to end up as a “hobbling old lady”. Gill Pharaoh, 75, who wrote two books giving advice on how to care for the elderly, was not suffering from a terminal disease. She said she had seen enough of old age to know that she was “going over the hill” and wanted to take action to end her life while she was able to do so. Speaking before her death in Basel, the mother of two said her experience as a nurse, including working in nursing homes, had shown her that the reality of old age was “awful”. She told The Sunday Times: “I have looked after people who are old, on and off, all my life. I have always said, ‘I am not getting old. I do not think old age is fun.’ I know that I have gone just over the hill now. It is not going to start getting better. I do not want people to remember me as a sort of old lady hobbling up the road with a trolley. “I have got so many friends with partners who, plainly, are a liability. I know you shouldn’t say that but I have this mental picture in my head of all you need to do, at my age, is break a hip and you are likely to go very much downhill from that.” Gill Pharaoh and her partner John (Julian Andrews) She said her partner and children had supported her wishes, though it would not have been their choice. In the interview before her death on July 21, she said her daughter, Caron, a nurse, had struggled particularly with the decision. The pensioner is one of a growing number of Britons who are choosing an assisted death in Switzerland. Last year a study found that one in five of the 611 people who travelled to Switzerland to end their lives between 2008 and 2012 were from the UK. A spokesman for Care Not Killing, which campaigns against assisted dying, said: “This is another deeply troubling case and sends out a chilling message about how society values and looks after elderly people in the UK.” In May a father with cancer ended his life at the Swiss clinic Dignitas against the wishes of his family, despite admitting “I know I am going too early.” Jeffrey Spector, who had a tumour on his spine but was not terminally ill, died at the Zurich hospital because he feared he would become paralysed. In a final interview given hours before he died Mr Spector, 54, admitted: “I am jumping the gun. Do not judge me.\\" However, Dr Michael Irwin, the co-ordinator of the Society for Old Age Rational Suicide (Soars), who helped the retired nurse with her plans to go to Switzerland, said: “Some will say that Gill was wrong to avoid the expected decrepitude of ‘old age’ but, having seen much suffering as a palliative care nurse, she took the rational decision that . . . she preferred to have a pre-emptive, doctor-assisted suicide.” The former nurse had no major health problems, and was on no medication. She said she suffered from intermittent back pain following a bout of shingles, and had tinnitus. Gill as a student nurse taken in 1959 (Julian Andrews) But she said she felt she was going downhill “in an almost imperceptible way” as she grew older. “I would rather go out when I am not quite at a peak. I have dropped off a bit but I want to be still me, recognisably me and not have people look and think, ‘Oh, are you Gill, were you Gill?” she said. “A lot of people are very good until they are 70 and then they start sloping off a bit.” She was accompanied to Lifecircle, the assisted-dying clinic in Basel, by John. Portrait of Gill Pharaoh and her partner John (Julian Andrews) On the eve of her death, the couple wandered through the city before enjoying a meal on the banks of the Rhine. “The whole evening was very tranquil and enjoyable,” said John. “I think it is what we both wanted. Gill had been thinking about it for years and I had no intention of spoiling it by getting emotional and heavy.” The former nurse said her children and partner had struggled with her decision. “It is not his [John’s] choice at all and my kids are backing me, although it is not their choice,” she said before the journey to Switzerland. “My daughter is a nurse and she said, ‘Intellectually, I know where you are coming from but emotionally I am finding it really hard,’ and I know she is.” Her partner called her children after the death. A humanist memorial service, arranged by Ms Pharoah, will take place later this month. Two months before her death, Gill wrote an article, entitled My Last Word, in which she set out her decision to end her life. “Day by day, I am enjoying my life. I simply do not want to follow this natural deterioration through to the last stage when I may be requiring a lot of help,” she wrote. “I have to take action early on because no one will be able to take action for me. The thought that I may need help from my children appals me. I know many old people expect, and even demand, help from their children but I think this is a most selfish and unreasonable view.” She said her experience as a nurse had shown her the reality of elderly life. “If you work in a nursing home and you have people who are incontinent, who use bad language, who walk around the rooms and just take things, it is very difficult. It is not a job you enjoy,” she said. “I just felt it was so bleak and so sad. We all did what we could but, for many of those old people, there wasn’t a lot you could do. We do not look at the reality. Generally, it is awful.” ||||| Healthy nurse, 75, chooses death over ‘going downhill’ Gill Pharoah with her partner John (Julian Andrews) A HEALTHY and active former palliative care nurse has ended her life at a Swiss suicide clinic because she did not want to become “an old lady hobbling up the road with a trolley”.

The phrase \\"a heavy stench of 'been there, done that' hanging over the film\\" indicates a sense of disappointment and dissatisfaction with the overall experience. The choice of words plays a critical role in conveying the critic's unfavorable opinion. The term \\"heavy stench\\" creates a strong and vivid image of something unpleasant or repulsive, suggesting that the movie has a strong air of unoriginality or predictability. Moreover, the quote \\"been there, done that\\" implies that the critic feels the movie is formulaic or derivative, as if it brings nothing new or interesting to the table. Furthermore, this negative review may also imply that the critic felt the movie lacked innovation, freshness, or creativity – qualities that are essential for a film to stand out and leave an impact on the audience. Consequently, the reviewer's choice of the term \\"hanging over the film\\" might be an indication that this unoriginality is pervasive and consistently present throughout the movie's runtime, further enhancing the negative tone of the review. In conclusion, it is evident that the critic's opinion of the movie is negative, based on the choice of displeasing imagery and a sense of disappointment that the movie did not offer anything new or captivating. By pointing out the film's lack of originality and innovation, the critic leaves potential viewers with the idea that the movie may not be worth watching, effectively establishing a negative viewpoint."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

It grow along cracks in stone walls and along the roadside near my home in Settignano, which is blooming with spring goodness right now: robinia (black locust) trees, wild garlic (three-cornered leek) and even elderflowers are already bursting. I asked the vendor just to double check, “Is this borage?” “Si,” Came the answer, “Borragine.” He confirmed. “I’ve had it in ravioli,” I started to say, “Brava!” He said, as if we were about to start a guessing game on what could be done with it. Actually, there’s a lot that can be done with it. If you can use it as a ravioli filling with ricotta, then you can imagine it taking the place of spinach in gnudi, too, but also soups or frittata or stirred through polenta. I learned that the flowers are just as delicious, if not more interesting, for their delicate cucumber-like flavour — people told me of their use in salads or cocktails like Pimms, and someone even mentioned she freezes them in ice cubes, what a pretty idea for those first warm nights when you can dine al fresco, homemade cocktail in hand.

Here is a news article: Photo by Whitney Curtis/Getty Images After becoming a national scandal with his claims that \\"legitimate rape\\" cannot result in pregnancy, Rep. Todd Akin has been slowly regaining lost ground in the contest against incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill for a Missouri Senate seat. Akin's strategy has been to characterize the remark as a mere misspeaking that is not indicative of his larger character, and the strategy must be working, because at least one poll has him up by one percentage point. Amanda Marcotte Amanda Marcotte is writer for Salon.

One revealing glimpse into the Akin worldview: May 24, 2005, Akin's speech denouncing stem cell research on the House floor. It's a marvel of right-wing paranoia in which he fantasizes about what will happen if stem cell research continues—if it reaches what he calls \\"step three\\"—based on a story about harvesting organs from real humans that his daughter wrote: My own daughter wrote a little story—I will read it—about step three. \\"I live with 40 others in a compound, supervised by cool, efficient orderlies.

Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: A deal has been signed to turn by-products from a Scottish distillery into fuel for cars. In what is declared to be a world first, the Tullibardine distillery in Perthshire has linked up with a spin-out company from Napier University in Edinburgh. They plan to use bacteria to feed on the \\"leftovers\\" from the whisky making process. This will produce butanol which can be used to fuel vehicles. More than 90% of the stuff that comes out of a whisky distillery is not whisky. It is leftovers like draff and pot ales -- both produced in the early stages of the process. They are high in sugar and are currently used for things like fertiliser and cattle feed. Napier University's Biofuel Research Centre (BfRC) has already shown that the right bacteria can feed on those by-products to produce butanol--a direct replacement for vehicle fuel. Now the spin-out company, Celtic Renewables, and independent whisky producer Tullibardine have signed an agreement. Together they will apply the process to thousands of tons of the distillery's leftovers. Professor Martin Tangney, founder of Celtic Renewables, said \\"Our partnership with Tullibardine is an important step in the development of a business which combines two important Scottish industries -- whisky and renewables. This project shows that creative use of existing technologies can _ resources on our doorstep to benefit both the environment and the economy.\\" Douglas Ross, managing director of Tullibardine, which spends PS250,000 disposing of its by-products every year, said \\"We are delighted to be partnering Celtic Renewables in this creative business, the obvious benefits of which are environmental. It takes a cost to us and turns it into something that has social as well as commercial value.\\" The project is being supported by a grant from the Scottish government's Zero Waste Scotland initiative. Celtic Renewables said it eventually aimed to build a processing plant in Scotland, with the hope of building an industry that could be worth PS60m a year. Question: How do people deal with whisky leftovers at present? Options: A: They throw them away. B: They use them to feed people. C: They use them to feed bacteria. D: They use them for crops or cattle. Answer:","completion":"D: They use them for crops or cattle. Currently, the by-products or leftovers from the whisky production process, such as draff and pot ales, which are produced in the early stages and make up over 90% of the distillery's output, are used for things like fertiliser for crops and cattle feed. These by-products are high in sugar, making them suitable for these purposes. The deal signed by the Tullibardine distillery and Celtic Renewables plans to introduce a new method of dealing with these by-products - by using bacteria to feed on them and produce butanol, a direct replacement for vehicle fuel. However, as of now, these leftovers are typically used in agriculture - either in aiding the growth of crops or as a nutritional supplement for livestock.

The revelation that Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri are possibly residing in houses in northwest Pakistan, enjoying relative comfort and protection from locals and members of the Pakistani intelligence services, is a cause for concern. It is essential for the Pakistan government to address this issue and work collaboratively with international stakeholders to ensure that the al Qaeda leadership can no longer evade justice. To begin with, the Pakistan government must enhance its internal counterterrorism measures, focusing specifically on areas where bin Laden and al-Zawahiri are suspected to be hiding. This will require an increase in intelligence gathering and surveillance efforts, as well as strengthening the government's ability to act upon critical information swiftly. This may involve allocating additional resources and personnel to areas such as Chitral, close to the Chinese border, and the Kurram Valley, adjoining Afghanistan's Tora Bora. Furthermore, the Pakistan government should engage in close cooperation and intelligence sharing with its neighboring countries, particularly Afghanistan, to ensure a more comprehensive and effective approach to counterterrorism. Partnerships with international organizations such as NATO can provide valuable support in these efforts, and the Pakistan government must be open to receiving assistance and utilizing intelligence gathered by international stakeholders. Moreover, it is crucial for the government to address the concerns of protecting members of the al Qaeda leadership within its intelligence services. Thorough investigations must be carried out, and if necessary, reforms should be implemented to ensure that individuals within these agencies are held accountable for any actions supporting terrorist organizations. To strengthen the credibility and efficacy of its intelligence services, the Pakistan government should also focus on training and education programs for its operatives in the area of counterterrorism and intelligence gathering. Lastly, it is important for the government to address the root causes of extremism within the country and work to inhibit the recruitment of new members into terrorist organizations. This can be achieved through social and educational initiatives, aimed at integrating marginalized or vulnerable communities into mainstream society and reducing the appeal of extremist groups. It is essential for the Pakistan government to recognize that addressing these issues is not only important for the security of its own nation but also has significant implications for regional and global security. By taking prompt and decisive actions, the government can prevent terrorist organizations from evading justice and help to create a safer and more stable environment for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on this summary: us lawmakers press china on trade disputes Text:","completion":"Title: U.S. Lawmakers Urge Tackling Trade Disputes with China Introduction In recent times, a growing number of U.S. lawmakers have begun pressing China on various trade disputes, emphasizing the urgency in resolving the long-standing issues between the two economic powerhouses. With a focus on the areas of contention, the lawmakers are seeking a more level playing field and calling for transparent dialogue between the United States and China to promote fair trade practices and mutual economic growth. Trade Disputes and Concerns Over the past few years, the trade relationship between the United States and China has experienced increased tensions. One of the primary concerns is the ballooning trade deficit that has emerged between the two countries, which reached a staggering 315.1 billion in 2020. This deficit has sparked worries among U.S. politicians, business leaders, and economists, as it highlights the growing reliance of the United States on Chinese imports. Another significant issue contributing to trade disputes is Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) receiving substantial subsidies. Lawmakers assert that these subsidies create an unfair advantage for Chinese companies over their U.S. counterparts. Moreover, concerns about intellectual property (IP) theft and forced technology transfers have further exacerbated the situation. Furthermore, the Made in China 2025 initiative, China's strategic plan to upgrade its manufacturing sector, has raised eyebrows in the U.S. The program aims to increase the Chinese share of core components and materials in the global market, which could potentially threaten the competitiveness of U.S. industries. Lawmakers' Actions and Demands In response to these disputes, U.S. lawmakers are urging the Biden administration to take a firm stance on trade issues with China. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have called for a comprehensive strategy to ensure that future trade agreements with China address key concerns, such as the protection of intellectual property rights, stringent regulations against subsidies for state-owned enterprises, and restrictions on forced technology transfers. Additionally, U.S. lawmakers are pressing for a thorough review of the existing trade deal with China, known as Phase One. They argue that the deal, which was implemented under the Trump administration, does not adequately address the root causes of the disputes and must be revised. With new tariffs on Chinese goods implemented by the Trump administration still in place, they also argue that the impact of these tariffs should be assessed to determine their effectiveness in leveling the playing field for U.S. businesses. Towards Transparent Dialogue and Long-standing Solutions U.S. lawmakers see transparent dialogue as crucial to resolving the trade disputes between the United States and China. One proposed solution is the establishment of a high-level, ongoing dialogue between the two countries that focuses on economic and trade issues. By engaging in open discussions, the U.S. and China can work together to rectify trade imbalances and promote mutually beneficial economic growth. Through a combination of revised trade agreements, open dialogue, and strong government actions, U.S. lawmakers aim to create a level playing field for businesses in both countries. Developing a comprehensive, sustainable, and fair trade policy will benefit not only the economies of the United States and China, but the global economy as a whole. Conclusion The pressing of China on trade disputes by U.S. lawmakers reflects the urgency in addressing the ongoing issues in the trade relationship between the two nations. With demands for a comprehensive strategy that tackles unfair subsidies, IP theft, forced technology transfers, and trade imbalances, lawmakers are pushing for transparency and sustainable solutions in hopes of building a more equitable and mutually beneficial economic relationship. By working together and engaging in honest, open dialogue, the United States and China can pave the way for a future of shared prosperity and global economic growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These are tiny, sac-like structures. Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of very small blood vessels (see Figure below ). Because there are millions of alveoli in each lung, they greatly increase the surface area for gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream. Human lungs, for example, contain about 300 million alveoli. They give the lungs a total surface area for gas exchange of up to 90 square meters (968 square feet).

Any painter can benefit from the presence of a live model from which to draw. Does the word \\"presence\\" mean the same thing in the above two sentences?","completion":"In the two sentences you provided, the word \\"presence\\" is used in different contexts and thus carries different meanings. Let's elaborate on the usage of \\"presence\\" in each sentence: 1. \\"I'm convinced that there was a presence in that building that I can't explain, which led to my heroic actions.\\" In this sentence, \\"presence\\" refers to a feeling or sensation experienced by a person, possibly something supernatural, mysterious, or inexplicable. This type of presence is often associated with paranormal events or beliefs, such as the feeling that a ghost or otherworldly entity is nearby or influencing one's actions. In this context, \\"presence\\" is an abstract and often intangible concept that may not necessarily have a concrete, physical manifestation. The presence felt here could simply be an atmosphere or energy that the speaker sensed but couldn't rationalize or explain. 2. \\"Any painter can benefit from the presence of a live model from which to draw.\\" Here, \\"presence\\" refers to the physical existence or appearance of a live model in the painter's studio, workspace, or observational environment. In this context, \\"presence\\" indicates that the model is actually available, in-person, to be viewed, studied, and captured on canvas or paper by the artist. In this situation, \\"presence\\" is tangible and easily described and demonstrated, as it refers to an actual person occupying the same space as the painter. In conclusion, while the word \\"presence\\" is used in both sentences, it takes on unique meanings based on the context in which it appears. In the first sentence, \\"presence\\" denotes an unexplainable, abstract feeling or sensation that influenced the individual's actions. Conversely, in the second sentence, \\"presence\\" represents the physically observable existence of a live model for the benefit of an artist. The variability in meaning demonstrates the flexibility of the English language and highlights the importance of context in understanding the intended message of a word or phrase."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now let's compare the premise and hypothesis. Comparison: Based on the premise, the preference is for companies to engage in trash management without incurring huge costs. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that everyone would pay a significant amount of money to deal with trash.

Question: There are various aspects that go into making a successful school, and success can be measured in various ways. Often, the teachers are praised for a school's success and blamed for its failure. Yet, in order for a school to be effective, it must be a place where teaching and learning can easily take place, and that requires the hard work of more than just educators. Students must take learning into their own hands and feel as if what they are doing is as important as it actually is. This can only be done with the cooperation of every adult that is involved in the students' life. Some of these individuals often go unnoticed, yet the role they play in the students' lives is immeasurable. In the school, administrative assistants greet students at the start of the day and answer a large quantity of questions. When an assistant remembers a student's name or even something special about that student, it communicates to him that he is cared for. The assistant can also give that extra encouragement for a student to make better choices, especially when they are visiting the principal's office. Meanwhile, though cafeteria workers have a short space of time to interact with students, they can make a big difference as well. Beyond meeting nutritional needs, cafeteria workers may also on occasion meet the emotional needs of the students they serve. Students benefit from positive interaction with adults, and cafeteria workers may give that extra bit of encouragement that a child needs. Custodians are usually underappreciated for what they offer to schools. They have to be knowledgeable about everything from cleaning to fixing the most intricate tools. They get to school early in the morning before teachers arrive and lock up late at night after the last student has left from the after-school event. They also make sure teachers are equipped with the necessary items and prepare the rooms so that they are ready for learning.

The boys are trained from an early age to be professional, international hitmen-for-hire. Years later, Interpol agent Mike Whittier arrives at his house and discovers Agent 47, where the two talk about 47's life as a professional hitman, working for a mysterious unknown paramilitary group known as The Organization. Three months prior, 47 (Timothy Olyphant) is completing a hit on a gang leader named Bwana Ovie in Niger. He is told by his Organization contact, Diana, to kill his next target, Russian President Mikhail Belicoff publicly. He completes his mission, but before he can leave Russia, he is contacted by his employers. They tell him that there is a witness to the assassination and order him to intercept her. When Agent 47 realizes she has never seen him before, he does not shoot her, instead, he narrowly avoids an assassination attempt on himself, attempted by another unknown Agent. His employers reveal his location to agents of FSB, who make plans to intercept him. As he is about to be taken, Diana calls to warn him and that Belicoff ordered the hit. After an escape from the hotel, 47 intercepts Nika, Belicoff's mistress, the woman who supposedly witnessed his hit. He interrogates her about Belicoff and discovers that Belicoff had a body double, who ordered the hit on the real Belicoff so that he could take his place as the president of Russia. 47 was to be killed after the hit to ensure total secrecy. As Nika and 47 attempt to take a train further into Russia, they are intercepted by more assassins from the Organization. 47 kills three before disarming Agent Whittier and wounding his partner.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"If the perturbation hypothesis suggests that there is a reduction in the number of zygotes implanting into the uterus, it would indeed have a direct effect on producing less babies. This could happen due to various reasons, such as issues related to fertility in either partner, problems with the uterus lining, or other health factors affecting the process. The reduction of zygote implantation would lead to decreased pregnancy rates and subsequently, fewer babies being born. This would directly impact the overall population growth and also affect families and individuals who are trying to conceive. Additionally, this perturbation could lead to more people seeking fertility treatments and interventions in order to have children, which may result in a larger reliance on assisted reproductive technologies, increased health care costs, and potential emotional and mental stress for those affected.

Neither the latitude for government speech nor its rationale applies to subsidies for private speech in every instance, however. Does it follow that \\"Government speech applies to private speech.\\"? Choose from: --yes --it is not possible to tell --no","completion":"The statement \\"Neither the latitude for government speech nor its rationale applies to subsidies for private speech in every instance, however\\" essentially implies that there are situations where the principles and reasoning behind government speech do not apply to private speech in cases when subsidies are involved. This indicates that the specific context and circumstances would determine how the government and private speeches relate to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to simply conclude that \\"Government speech applies to private speech\\" on a universal basis. Government speech refers to the speech that is an official expression of the government's policies, opinions, and viewpoints as it seeks to communicate its intentions with the public. Meanwhile, private speech includes the opinions, expressions, and ideas of individuals or non-government organizations that are often protected under freedom of speech. When it comes to subsidies for private speech, the government may provide financial support to certain individuals or organizations to enhance their ability to convey their ideas, allowing them to reach a wider audience. This support does not necessarily mean that such private speeches are a direct reflection of the government's opinions or policies. At times, the government may promote a plurality of voices, ideas, or opinions, facilitating a healthy and diverse marketplace of ideas. In such cases, even as the government subsidizes private speech, it is not directly controlling or dictating the content. In such scenarios, one cannot simply state that \\"Government speech applies to private speech.\\" However, there may be situations where the government provides subsidies in a way that influences private speech directly, as it aligns more closely with the government's policies or opinions. In such cases, the line between government and private speech may become blurred. These specific instances would require a deeper and nuanced analysis to determine the extent of the government's influence over private speech. In conclusion, it is challenging to make a blanket statement in this matter, as it depends on the context and circumstances. While there may be cases where government speech may directly or indirectly apply to private speech, especially in instances involving subsidies, it is important to evaluate how the latitude and rationale of government speech operate in each specific situation before drawing conclusions.

Process: - A forest fire starts - The trees and plants burn - The animals lose their homes - If the animals can not escape, they may die from smoke inhalation - The plants that provide food are gone - The animals have little to eat - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose animals will have more to eat happens, how will it affect a SMALLER negative effect on animals. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"If the perturbation hypothesis that animals will have more to eat after the forest fire happens, it will have a smaller negative effect on animals. The supposed perturbation could have a direct or indirect effect on the process. Direct effect: If animals have more to eat, it indicates that there might be some alternative food sources that emerge within the burnt forest ecosystem after the fire. This could be due to some plants being more resistant to fire, regrowth from fire-resistant seeds, or fire-induced vegetation changes that increase the availability of food for certain species. Consequently, the animals might be able to adapt to the post-fire environment more effectively, reducing the overall negative impact on their populations. Indirect effect: The increased food availability for animals could indirectly promote their survival, reproduction, and migration to other areas with more favorable conditions. This would help maintain local biodiversity and ensure the continuity of various animal populations in the ecosystem. In turn, these animals could play a crucial role in promoting the recovery of the forest after the fire, such as through seed dispersal and nutrient cycling. As a result, the perturbation would contribute to the forest's resilience and regeneration, minimizing the overall negative effect on animals in the long term."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: In Renaissance Europe, from about 1400 onwards, there was a revival of Classical learning accompanied by the development of Renaissance Humanism which placed greater emphasis on the role of the individual in society than had been the case during the Medieval period. Buildings were ascribed to specific architects – Brunelleschi, Alberti, Michelangelo, Palladio – and the cult of the individual had begun. There was still no dividing line between artist, architect and engineer, or any of the related vocations, and the appellation was often one of regional preference. What is the answer to this question: What was the name for the time period?","completion":"The time period mentioned in the article is the Renaissance. This era started in Europe around the 14th century (circa 1400) and continued to the 17th century. It was a time of significant cultural and intellectual rebirth following the Middle Ages, often referred to as the \\"dark ages\\". This era marked a considerable shift towards a more modern and progressive Europe. Renaissance is a French term meaning 'rebirth', and it perfectly encapsulates the spirit of this epoch that resurrected the values, philosophy, and aesthetics of Classical Antiquity, especially those of Ancient Greece and Rome. Enlightenment, scientific revolution, the discovery of new continents, and the formation of new types of art, architecture, literature, and music are the defining features of this era. During this period, the concept of individualism was borne, a significant departure from the collective focus that defined the Medieval period. It propagated the idea that each person has their own set of skills, talents, and purposes to fulfill in society. The Renaissance is famous for its great artists, architects, and engineers who were often multi-talented individuals combining their abilities in different disciplines. Luminaries like Brunelleschi, Alberti, Michelangelo, and Palladio made significant contributions to architecture in this epoch. Before the Renaissance, buildings were not usually attributed to individual architects. The concept of individual artists and creators began during the Renaissance, which eventually led to the modern idea of celebrity and individual fame for contributions to art and culture. However, it is significant to note that, during the Renaissance, there was no definitive separation between an artist, engineer, architect and other related professions. The distinction between these occupations as we understand it today did not exist, leading many Renaissance figures to demonstrate expertise across a diverse range of fields. The 'appellation', or the title one was given, was often a matter of regional preference rather than a clear professional classification, demonstrating the fluidity and interdisciplinary nature of intellectual and artistic pursuits during the Renaissance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Throughout the past few seasons, Manchester United has been notorious for rebuilding its squad and undergoing numerous changes. Amidst the club's various endeavors to restore its former glory, the signing of Armenian international Henrikh Mkhitaryan will undoubtedly prove to be a valuable addition to the roster. Known for his playmaking abilities, vision, creativity, and versatility on the pitch, Mkhitaryan will likely serve Manchester United significantly in their pursuit of silverware. Rumors had been circulating the football sphere about the Premier League outfit's interest in Mkhitaryan, but it wasn't until recently that Borussia Dortmund decided to accept their bid. This signing not only signifies Manchester United's assertion of seriousness in the transfer market but also asserts their intent to challenge for the title in the upcoming season. The 28-year-old attacking midfielder had enjoyed a sensational campaign with Dortmund last season, delivering 13 goals and 15 assists across all competitions. His consistent performances combined with his ability to unlock opposition defenses made him a hot property in this transfer window. However, it was Manchester United who ultimately succeeded in swooping him in after tabling a convincing offer that Borussia Dortmund could not refuse. Mkhitaryan's arrival at Old Trafford will be undeniably welcomed by the Red Devils' fan base, as the club seeks to bolster its attacking options in the lineup. Moreover, the Armenian's ability to play in various roles across the attacking midfield will provide manager José Mourinho with more tactical possibilities and flexible formations to employ. It is widely believed that Mkhitaryan's presence on the field will not only bolster Manchester United's playmaking prowess but will also serve to alleviate the pressure on Paul Pogba, another crucial player for the Red Devils. Manchester United's eagerness to pry Mkhitaryan away from Borussia Dortmund is a testament to their faith in his capability to be a game-changer. The Armenian international has a proven track record of success, considering his scintillating form with his former club. Moreover, his experience as a UEFA Champions League regular is an attribute that the English side hopes to capitalize upon in their quest to regain their European supremacy. The Mkhitaryan transfer saga's climax is a win-win situation for all parties involved. On one hand, Manchester United has secured an exceptional attacking talent who has the potential to help the club achieve its objectives. On the other hand, the German side has pocketed a significant sum of money for a player who might have been contemplating a departure from the Signal Iduna Park. Finally, the Armenian international has been granted a golden opportunity to showcase his skills and make an impact in one of Europe's most popular football leagues. As Manchester United awaits Henrikh Mkhitaryan's arrival, the signing's implications reverberate throughout the world of football. It is no secret that the club is craving a return to the top in both domestic and European competitions, and Mkhitaryan may very well be the catalyst that propels them in that direction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I was under full custody of my father living in a trailer in very rural Tennessee (Wayne County) with no electricity and a wood burning stove for heat. My mother was nowhere to be found until a few years later. We received the settlement and it turned out to be several thousand dollars. My dad turned on the electricity and bought our first computer, a Packard Bell. Now we needed dial up internet! -My what a change! Then he started dating online. He met a woman who lived in Franklin, TN (Williamson County), dated and married her (at least for a few years), worked at CompUSA for a few years, then started his own computer repair business which he and I ran from 2001 to 2014 before selling it.

At very low pressure, the particles of the substance are far apart from one another and the substance is in the gas state. As the pressure is increased, the particles of the substance are forced closer and closer together. Eventually the particles are pushed so close together that attractive forces cause the substance to condense into the liquid state. Continually increasing the pressure on the liquid will eventually cause the substance to solidify. For the majority of substances, the solid state is denser than the liquid state and so putting a liquid under great pressure will cause it to turn into a solid. The line segment represents the process of sublimation, where the substance changes directly from a solid to a gas. At a sufficiently low pressure, the liquid phase does not exist.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No, the answer provided does not accurately address the question of how former volcanoes affect hydrothermal activity. While it is true that large volcanic eruptions can influence temperatures in the troposphere and stratosphere, the question specifically focuses on the relationship between former volcanoes and hydrothermal activity. Hydrothermal activity refers to the movement and circulation of heated water, often caused by magma or residual heat from a volcanic system. While an active volcano can directly impact hydrothermal activity, former volcanoes (those that are extinct or no longer active) can still influence these processes in several ways: 1. Heat source: Even though a volcano is no longer active, it can contain residual heat from past volcanic activity. This trapped heat can still warm up the surrounding rocks and groundwater, leading to hydrothermal activity in the form of hot springs, fumaroles, and geysers. 2. Geothermal reservoirs: Volcanic activity can lead to the formation of underground geothermal reservoirs, which are areas of high heat trapped in porous rocks and groundwater. These reservoirs can exist for thousands of years, even after the volcano has become extinct, leading to ongoing hydrothermal activity in the surrounding area. 3. Groundwater circulation: The complex geological structures created by volcanic activity, such as faults, fissures, and fractured rocks, can provide pathways for groundwater circulation. As water moves through these pathways, it can interact with residual heat associated with the extinct volcano, creating hydrothermal activity. 4. Geothermal gradients: Extinct volcanoes can still influence the geothermal gradient – the rate at which temperature increases with depth. The residual heat from the magma chamber can warm the overlying rocks, resulting in a higher geothermal gradient than the surrounding area. This can affect hydrothermal activity by creating conditions favorable for the formation of hot springs, geysers, and other manifestations. 5. Mineral deposition: Hydrothermal activity often results in the deposition of various minerals as the heated water flows through rocks and cools down. These mineral deposits can form in the vicinity of extinct volcanoes, providing evidence of past hydrothermal activity associated with the volcanic system. In conclusion, while the initial answer provided information on the impact of large volcanic eruptions, it did not address the specific question of how former volcanoes affect hydrothermal activity. Former volcanoes can influence hydrothermal processes through residual heat, geological structures, and the formation of geothermal reservoirs, among other factors."},{"prompt":"Question: What genres are defined chiefly by lyrical focus? Answer the above question based on the context below: The term \\"Viking metal\\" has sometimes been used as a nickname for the 1990s Norwegian black metal scene, which was \\"noisy, chaotic, and often augmented by sorrowful keyboard melodies\\". It has also been variously described as a subgenre of black metal, albeit one that abandoned black metal's Satanic imagery, \\"slow black metal\\" with influences from Nordic folk music, straddling black metal and folk metal almost equally, or running the gamut from \\"folk to black to death metal\\". Typically, Viking metal artists rely extensively on keyboards, which are often played at a \\"swift, galloping pace\\". These artists often add \\"local cultural flourishes\\" such as traditional instruments and ethnic melodies. It is similar to folk metal, and is sometimes categorized as such, but it uses folk instruments less extensively. For vocals, Viking metal incorporates both singing and the typical black metal screams and growls. Overall, Viking metal is hard to define since, apart from certain elements like anthem-like choruses, it is not based entirely on musical features and overlaps with other metal genres, with origins in black and death metal Some bands, such as Unleashed and Amon Amarth, play death metal, but incorporate Viking themes and thus are labeled as part of the genre. Generally, Viking metal is defined more by its thematic material and imagery than musical qualities. Rather than being a mock-up of medieval music, \\"it is in the band names, album titles, artwork of album covers and, especially, in the song lyrics that Viking themes are so evident.\\" Viking metal, and the closely related style pagan metal, is more of a term or \\"etiquette\\" than a musical style. Since they are defined chiefly by lyrical focus, any musical categorizations of these two styles is controversial. Thus, Viking metal is more of a cross-genre term than a descriptor of a certain sound.

Article: When you are traveling, it's vital to know about the customs and etiquette(,)of the global village. What we consider polite behavior at home isn't always accepted outside our borders. * Etiquette of Gift Giving Gift giving should be a happy, positive experience. When selecting a present for someone in Netherlands, don't purchase fancy kitchen knives or scissors. Giving sharp, pointy objects as gifts is considered unlucky. Be careful when presenting flowers to a friend or a business partner in Russia. Yellow blooms suggest cheat or a relationship break up. Traditionally, red carnations are placed on the tombs of the dead. Writing cards or notes while visiting South Korea, be mindful of your pen's ink color1. Writing a person's name in red ink traditionally suggests that the person has passed away--an important point to remember when giving a birthday card. * Eating Customs Being early or on time is viewed as being rude, too eager or even greedy in Venezuela. If you are invited to someone's home for a meal, it's recommended that you arrive 10 minutes later than the requested time. When having a meal in Egypt, don't use the salt shaker . It's insulting to your host to spread salt on your food, which means that you find the meal terrible. Japan is a very polite nation, and their fondness for etiquette extends to the use of chopsticks. According to Japanese custom, if you're in the middle of eating, use the opposite end of your chopsticks to secure food from a shared plate. When doing business in Turkey, it's the custom for your host to pay for your meal. Requests to split the bill won't be accepted. If you would like to pay your fair share, Turks recommend inviting your host to a follow-up meal. Question: where is this passage probably from? Options: A: A news report. B: A culture column.

Pete Arnold, a right-wing blogger known for his anti-abortion posts on platforms like the DailyKos, spoke to CNN about the controversy surrounding the birthornot.com site. Arnold revealed that he and his wife had agreed that aborting their unborn child, nicknamed \\"Baby Wiggles,\\" wasn't an option for them.

We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by -1: -1 x 2 = -1 x (-s) This gives us: -2 = s Step 4: Verify the solution (Optional) To verify that the solution 's = -2' indeed satisfies the original equation, plug -2 for 's' in the original equation: 0 = -(-2) - 24 + 22 Simplify: 0 = 2 - 24 + 22 Combine like terms: 0 = -22 + 24 Add 24 to -22: 0 = 2 However, the correct solution is -2 = s. The verification process shows that the solution may have mathematical error which we can verify again as follows: 0 = -(-2) - 24 + 22 0 = 2 - 24 + 22 0 = -22 + 24 0 = 2 ≠ s As per the correct solution, s = -2 doesn't satisfy the original equation. Let's reevaluate the solution: Step 1: Simplify the equation 0 = -s - 24 + 22 Add 22 to -24: 0 = -s - 2 Step 2: Isolate the variable 's' Add 2 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 2 = -s + 2 This gives us: 2 = -s Step 3: Solve for 's' To get 's' alone, just multiply both sides of the equation by -1: -1 × 2 = -1 × (-s) -2 = s Solution: s = -2"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Shen Kuo (Chinese: Chen Gua ; 1031-1095), courtesy name Cunzhong (Cun Zhong ) and pseudonym Mengqi (now usually given as Mengxi) Weng (Meng Xi Weng ), was a Han Chinese polymathic scientist and statesman of the Song dynasty (960-1279). Excelling in many fields of study and statecraft, he was a mathematician, astronomer, meteorologist, geologist, zoologist, botanist, pharmacologist, agronomist, archaeologist, ethnographer, cartographer, encyclopedist, general, diplomat, hydraulic engineer, inventor, academy chancellor, finance minister, governmental state inspector, poet, and musician. Shen Kuo was born in Qiantang (modern-day Hangzhou) in the year 1031. His father Shen Zhou (Chen Zhou ; 978-1052) was a somewhat lower-class gentry figure serving in official posts on the provincial level; his mother was from a family of equal status in Suzhou, with her maiden name being Xu (Xu ). Shen Kuo received his initial childhood education from his mother, which was a common practice in China during this period. She was very educated herself, teaching Kuo and his brother Pi (Pi ) the military doctrines of her own elder brother Xu Tang (Xu Dong ; 975-1016). Since Shen was unable to boast of a prominent familial clan history like many of his elite peers born in the north, he was forced to rely on his wit and stern determination to achieve in his studies, subsequently passing the imperial examinations and enter the challenging and sophisticated life of an exam-drafted state bureaucrat. From about 1040 AD, Shen's family moved around Sichuan province and finally to the international seaport at Xiamen, where Shen's father accepted minor provincial posts in each new location. Shen Zhou also served several years in the prestigious capital judiciary, the equivalent of a federal supreme court. Shen Kuo took notice of the various towns and rural features of China as his family traveled, while he became interested during his youth in the diverse topography of the land. He also observed the intriguing aspects of his father's engagement in administrative governance and the managerial problems involved; these experiences had a deep impact on him as he later became a government official. Since he often became ill as a child, Shen Kuo also developed a natural curiosity about medicine and pharmaceutics. Shen Zhou died in the late winter of 1051 (or early 1052), when his son Shen Kuo was 21 years old. Shen Kuo grieved for his father, and following Confucian ethics, remained inactive in a state of mourning for three years until 1054 (or early 1055). As of 1054, Shen began serving in minor local governmental posts. However, his natural abilities to plan, organize, and design were proven early in life; one example is his design and supervision of the hydraulic drainage of an embankment system, which converted some one hundred thousand acres (400 km2) of swampland into prime farmland. Shen Kuo noted that the success of the silt fertilization method relied upon the effective operation of sluice gates of irrigation canals. Where did she go to school?","completion":"Shen Kuo did not go to a specific school as we understand it today. Instead, he received his initial childhood education from his mother, who was very educated herself. She taught Kuo and his brother different subjects, including military doctrines. This kind of home education was a common practice in China during that time period. As Shen Kuo grew older, he relied on his wit and determination to achieve in his studies, eventually passing the imperial examinations and entering the life of an exam-drafted state bureaucrat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In Colombia, the drug-financed guerrillas trying to seize the country and destroy democracy include M-19, which Castro has clearly backed. Robert Merkel, a former U.S. attorney handling drug indictments in Florida, doesn't think for a minute that Castro's much publicized trials of high officials engaged in the drug trade mean he has broken off with the Medellin drug cartel. \\"If the cartel succeeds in blackmailing the Colombian authorities into negotiations, the cartel will be in control and Fidel can exploit his past relationships with them,\\" he told the Journal's David Asman recently. The struggle against the drug lords in Colombia will be a near thing. This week, the government arrested Jose Abello Silva, said to be the fourth-ranking cartel leader. He will probably be extradited to the U.S. for trial under an extradition treaty President Virgilia Barco has revived. Later, another high-ranking trafficker, Leonidas Vargas, was arrested and 1,000 pounds of dynamite seized. Mr. Barco has refused U.S. troops or advisers but has accepted U.S. military aid. President Bush has agreed to meet within 90 days with Mr. Barco, President Alan Garcia of Peru and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia to discuss the drug problem.

Context: Benedykt Ossolinsky, age 39, began to grow childish. On the first day of his midlife crisis, he stood in front of the mirror examining his receding hairline and wrinkles on his face. In that very moment, while staring at his reflection he found in his eyes that mad look he had last seen thirty years ago in a photograph taken at a tethered flying model competition. The photo was taken by Henryk the servant, when his little charge decided he wanted a red biplane model Curtiss Consolidated Skyhawk Cruisader 3A \\"Bingo Star\\". This new look was also noticed by his co-workers, who for the most part, considered him to be an infantile spoiled brat. It fit with their idea of a boss. And Benedykt was indeed the boss, even though he himself couldn't quite believe it. He was the head of a foundation for the self-promotion of the Ossolinsky family, well-known descendants of Polish-American aristocrats, engaged in business ventures there, and charity work here. The position was highly honorable and very prestigious. Just as the employees didn't like Benedykt, in equal measure Benedykt didn't like his job. He considered it extremely stressful and felt it forced him to super-human sacrifices. Everything was arranged by the family as a penance for avoiding work. He had to go to the office at least three times a week for two full hours and entertain various smiling journalists, drink coffee with them and listen. He had to sign letters and open gifts from various companies hoping to win favors. And he had to play golf and attend social functions, movie premiers, shows and art exhibits.

What is the answer?","completion":"A balaniferous tree is one that bears or produces acorns. Acorns are the nut-like seeds of trees in the Quercus genus, more commonly known as oak trees. Oaks are widespread and native in the Northern Hemisphere, and their acorns have served as a food source for numerous animal and human populations throughout history. Acorns consist of a hard outer shell called a cupule, which encloses a smooth-surfaced nut on the inside. The acorn takes about six to eighteen months to mature, depending on the species of oak tree. Once mature, the acorns fall from the tree and serve as a food source for various wildlife, including squirrels, deer, and birds. In addition to being an essential food supply for animals, acorns were commonly consumed by human populations, especially before the widespread cultivation of other food crops like grains and legumes. Acorns are nutritionally dense, containing various essential nutrients such as proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and several vitamins and minerals. Acorns are also rich in many other nutrients like dietary fiber, potassium, and polyphenols. However, they should not be eaten raw due to the presence of tannins, which can cause stomach upsets and interfere with the absorption of certain nutrients. To eat acorns, they must be processed by leaching to remove the tannins, after which they can be ground into a flour or used in a variety of dishes. In summary, a balaniferous tree is an oak tree that bears acorns, which have been a vital food source for both animals and humans for thousands of years. Acorns are dense in essential nutrients, but they must be properly processed before they can be consumed by humans safely. Oak trees play a crucial role in supporting diverse ecosystems by providing food, shelter, and habitat for numerous species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A working knowledge of Photoshop tools will help you immensely with this method. See How To Use Adobe Photoshop Tools for general Photoshop tips. Open the “File” menu and click “New” to view options for your new file. Type a name for your animation in the box next to “Name.” In the “width” and “height” boxes, note the measurement types after the value boxes. It's either set to inches or pixels, depending on what you've used in the past. If you feel comfortable specifying pixel size, change the measurement type to “Pixels.” If it's easier for you to visualize inches, choose that option. Type your desired measurement in its corresponding box. Choose a background color for your animation. Click the menu next to “Background” or “Background contents” (depending on your version of Photoshop) and choose from the color options. Click “OK” to create your new image with these settings. Each frame of your animation needs to be in its own layer, so you'll want the layers panel visible. Click the Window menu and check both Layers and Animations. The panels will then appear in your workspace. In the Layers panel, click the plus sign (+) to add a new layer. Next to “Name,” type a name for your layer, such as “Frame 1.” Set the Fill color either to Transparent or the color of your background. Click “OK” to create this new layer. Each element of your animation needs to be on a unique frame. Anything you put on this new layer will animate as one frame. If you want to draw on this layer, choose a color from the swatch panel (the panel with all of the colored squares) then click the paintbrush tool. If you want to add text, click the “T” to launch the text tool. Create another layer and build the second frame of your animation. If the next frame of your animation will simply be a slight modification to the first frame, you may want to “Clone” your layer instead of creating a new one. To clone the layer, right-click on that layer in the Layers panel and select “Duplicate layer.” Continue creating or cloning layers until you have each individual frame of your animation on its own layer. In the Animation panel at the bottom of the screen, click the icon that is a small rectangle with a smaller square on top of it (the New Frame button). This will create one new frame. Click this button as many times as there are layers in your animation. If your animation will have 7 layers, create 7 frames. Click the first frame in the panel. As you can see from the thumbnail, this frame presently consists of every layer in your animation. Notice that each layer in your Layers panel has a small eyeball symbol next to it. This symbol tells you that the layer is currently visible. To make the first frame in the Animation panel display only the first layer, remove the eyeball symbol from each of the other layers. Change the duration for this frame by adjusting the time (in seconds) beneath the thumbnail, which currently reads “0 sec.” Click each additional frame and remove visibility from all layers other than the one you want to be visible in the frame. Remember to adjust the time at the bottom of each thumbnail. The Play button is located beneath the animation frames at the bottom of the screen.

Answer this question: who helped the afghanis fight against the soviet union in their war of the 1980s??","completion":"During the 1980s, Afghanistan witnessed a fierce conflict between the Soviet Union and the Afghan resistance fighters known as the Mujahideen. This long-lasting battle, also called the Soviet-Afghan War, lasted from December 1979 to February 1989. Apart from the indigenous Afghan resistance fighters, several countries and entities backed and supported the Afghan Mujahideen – notably, the United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and China. 1. The United States: The US played a significant role in supporting the Afghan Mujahideen during the Soviet-Afghan War. As part of its foreign policy goals to counter Soviet expansion and influence, the US provided financial aid, military equipment, and intelligence support to the Afghan resistance fighters. The CIA launched Operation Cyclone, a program that funneled billions of dollars' worth of arms, ammunition, and equipment to the Afghan Mujahideen. These support efforts were mostly conducted through Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Additionally, the US provided humanitarian aid to Afghan refugees who fled to Pakistan and Iran during the war. 2. Pakistan: Serving as the frontline state in the conflict, Pakistan played a central role in assisting the Afghan Mujahideen. With its close geographical proximity, Pakistan became both a safe haven for Afghan refugees and a base for Mujahideen fighters. The ISI was instrumental in distributing funds, arms, and military training to various Mujahideen factions. Pakistan's role was crucial to the success of the Afghan resistance, as it provided the necessary logistical support and extensive, cross-border supply routes. 3. Saudi Arabia: Riyadh played a key role in financing the Afghan resistance against the Soviet Union. The Saudi government matched US financial contributions on a dollar-for-dollar basis, significantly increasing the funds available to the Mujahideen. Moreover, Saudi intelligence agencies cooperated with the US and Pakistan in facilitating arms shipments, logistics, and other support. Saudi Arabia also encouraged Muslim volunteers from various countries to join the Afghan resistance in the name of Islamic solidarity and jihad. 4. The United Kingdom: The UK also participated in backing the Afghan Mujahideen, primarily through its intelligence services. The British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) and the SAS (Special Air Service) provided financial support, training, and equipment to the resistance fighters. British operatives aided in training the Mujahideen in areas such as guerrilla warfare, intelligence gathering, sabotage techniques, and communications. The cooperation between British and American intelligence agencies significantly bolstered the Mujahideen's efforts against Soviet forces. 5. China: Alongside the US, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia, China played a crucial yet discreet role in supporting the Afghan resistance. China provided military aid to the Mujahideen, including heavy weapons, ammunition, and logistics support. It was motivated by a desire to counter Soviet influence in the region and thus viewed the Soviet invasion as a threat to its own interests. In addition to these material contributions, China enabled a vital flow of arms and assistance through its territory to the Afghan Mujahideen. In summary, the Afghan resistance against the Soviet Union in the 1980s received significant support from various international allies. The United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and China provided financial, military, and intelligence assistance to the Afghan Mujahideen, enabling a prolonged and ultimately successful resistance campaign. This multifaceted international effort was instrumental in the eventual withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan in 1989."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the official name of the act helped push through parliament by the man that who introduced Tom Nero? In the first print Hogarth introduces Tom Nero, whose surname may have been inspired by the Roman Emperor of the same name or a contraction of \\"No hero\\". Conspicuous in the centre of the plate, he is shown being assisted by other boys to insert an arrow into a dog's rectum, a torture apparently inspired by a devil punishing a sinner in Jacques Callot's Temptation of St. Anthony. An initialled badge on the shoulder of his light-hued and ragged coat shows him to be a pupil of the charity school of the parish of St Giles. Hogarth used this notorious slum area as the background for many of his works including Gin Lane and Noon, part of the Four Times of the Day series. A more tender-hearted boy, perhaps the dog's owner, pleads with Nero to stop tormenting the frightened animal, even offering food in an attempt to appease him. This boy supposedly represents a young George III. His appearance is deliberately more pleasing than the scowling ugly ruffians that populate the rest of the picture, made clear in the text at the bottom of the scene: The other boys carry out equally barbaric acts: the two boys at the top of the steps are burning the eyes out of a bird with a hot needle heated by the link-boy's torch; the boys in the foreground are throwing at a cock (perhaps an allusion to a nationalistic enmity towards the French, and a suggestion that the action takes place on Shrove Tuesday, the traditional day for cock-shying); another boy ties a bone to a dog's tail—tempting, but out of reach; a pair of fighting cats are hung by their tails and taunted by a jeering group of boys; in the bottom left-hand corner a dog is set on a cat, with the latter's intestines spilling out onto the ground; and in the rear of the picture another cat tied to two bladders is thrown from a high window.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What two brands of amplifiers do grunge guitarists use?, using the article: Grunge is generally characterized by a sludgy electric guitar sound with a \\"thick\\" middle register and rolled-off treble tone and a high level of distortion and fuzz, typically created with small 1970s-style stompbox pedals, with some guitarists chaining several fuzz pedals together and plugging them into a tube amplifier and speaker cabinet. Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic. As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their \\"debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff\\". In the song Mudride, the band's guitars were said to have \\"growled malevolently\\" through its \\"Cro-magnon slog\\"., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The two brands of amplifiers that grunge guitarists often use, as indicated in your provided text, are Marshall and Mesa-Boogie. Both of these brands were specifically mentioned as being very popular within the grunge scene, with notable musicians like Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl using them.

The provided statement \\"A solid-state drive (SSD) (also known as a solid-state disk or electronic disk, though it contains no actual \\"disk\\" of any kind) is a data storage device using integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data persistently.\\" is a reasonable answer as it briefly describes the key components of SSDs and how they function. To elaborate on SSDs: 1. SSDs use integrated circuits (ICs) instead of magnetic platters or disks found in traditional hard drives (HDDs). This eliminates the need for any moving parts, which results in faster data access times and higher reliability. 2. Data is stored in NAND flash memory cells, which are grouped into pages and blocks. 3. SSDs use a controller to manage the data stored in the NAND flash memory and communicate with the host system (e.g., computer, server, etc.). This controller performs operations such as reading, writing, and erasing data. 4. SSDs can store data even when there is no power applied to them, making them non-volatile storage devices. This is due to the nature of NAND flash memory, which retains data even in the absence of an electric current. In summary, a solid-state drive works by utilizing NAND flash memory and integrated circuits to store data persistently and efficiently, offering faster performance and higher reliability compared to traditional hard drives with magnetic platters and moving parts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I can use this background: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. Now, I have a new situation: Two identical planets, Norlon and Bothar, have been discovered in a neighboring galaxy of ours. These two planets have the same type of atmosphere as Earth and are extremely similar to Earth in terms of topography and even species of animals that live on them. The main difference is that Norlon is inhabited by a species very similar to humans that emit a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Bothar, however, has no such species on its planet. Answer this question please: Which new planet has a cooler atmosphere? The answer is:","completion":"Bothar has a cooler atmosphere. Since Bothar does not have a species similar to humans that emit a significant amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, it is likely to have a cooler atmosphere compared to Norlon. The reason for this is that carbon dioxide is one of the primary greenhouse gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect and global warming. On Norlon, the human-like species' activities would increase the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, causing more heat to be trapped and raising the planet's overall temperature.

Dave Ki staged a dramatic return to the Rangers power battle on Friday in a move that places huge pressure on the current boardroom regime. The South Africa-based businessman purchased a near 15 per cent stake in the club by buying up shares held by fund managers Artemis and Miton. Former Ibrox director King is acting independently of the group comprising wealthy supporters Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor, who bought out Laxey Partners earlier this week to raise their total holding to 19 per cent. Dave King (centre) watches the Champions League clash between Liverpool and Real Madrid in October. However, the two parties share similar aims and could count on further support from various fan factions and other figures associated with the club who have a combined stake in excess of 10 per cent. Sportsmail believes that one of the parties may also have negotiated proxies from an institution to further increase an emerging power base that could force a New Year revolution. A call for an extraordinary general meeting aimed at removing current directors is now a real possibility. However, it was claimed on Friday that one shareholder has lodged a complaint with the takeover commission, believing King is working in concert with the Park consortium in a bid to seize control. Takeover panel rules dictate that if a consortium crosses the 29.9 per cent threshold it must make an offer to buy the rest of the company. King and the Park-Letham-Taylor group have 34 per cent between them but are adamant they are separate entities. King had previously spearheaded a £16million investment package that was rejected by the Rangers board in favour of a £2m loan from Newcastle owner Mike Ashley, subsequently raised to £3m. The Ibrox club is now facing a financial crisis, admitting on Friday that cash received from the £1m sale of Lewis Macleod to Brentford ‘will be used for immediate working capital’. Asked why he had moved, King told Sportsmail: ‘Because the board rejected my attempts to issue new shares to me and thereby get much-needed money into the club, which was my stated preference.’ Rangers captain Lee McCulloch applauds the club's travelling fans after their humiliating 4-0 defeat by Hibs. He stressed a willingness to work with any ‘like-minded’ group but stated he would ‘consult with other stakeholders before deciding’ future plans. King claimed his move was not influenced by the acquisition made by Park, Letham and Taylor but by ‘the availability of shares’. Of the decision to sell by Artemis and Miton, he added: ‘I believe they just lost faith in the present board and its ability to move the club forward.’ Subsequently asked whether an EGM was a likelihood in terms of bringing about boardroom change, King replied: ‘It may become necessary.’ Laxey Partners chairman Colin Kingsnorth said earlier this week that his firm had sold up to Park, Letham and Taylor to provide credible opposition to Ashley’s ambitions at Ibrox. The Sports Direct tycoon currently owns around nine per cent of Rangers and is limited to a 10-per- cent stake by a past agreement with the SFA. The governing body rejected a move for that to be increased to 29.9 per cent on Christmas Eve and Ashley’s next move is still awaited. He already has ally Derek Llambias in position as chief executive at Ibrox, while Sports Direct executive Barry Leach has been tipped to become finance director. However, asked how he viewed Ashley’s influence on the future of the club, King replied: ‘He has no real interest in the club — only in Sports Direct. I don’t view him as being significant going forward.’ King (third right), a former Rangers director, pictured at Ibrox with the league trophy in May 2010. Second-placed Rangers are 15 points adrift of Hearts at the top of the Scottish Championship. A statement from Rangers to the Stock Exchange confirmed King’s share purchase and the vehicle he had used. It read: ‘The company was informed on 2 January 2015 that New Oasis Investments Limited, a company 100% owned by the Family Trust of Dave King, acquired 11,869,505 ordinary shares in the company on 2 January 2015.’ ‘Following the transaction, New Oasis will be interested in 11,869,505 ordinary shares in the company, representing approximately 14.57 per cent of the issued share capital.’ Ashley has previously received backing from a 26-per-cent shareholding block for which Sandy Easdale holds voting rights. The Rangers football board chairman could now find his position under threat, as could brother James — a non-executive director — and PLC chairman David Somers. Sandy Easdale and King became locked in a war of words after the latter’s investment offer was turned down. But Easdale family adviser Jack Irvine said on Friday: ‘Sandy is pleased Dave King has shown goodwill and bought these shares and he hopes it leads to further investment in the club.’ A Stock Exchange statement from Rangers earlier yesterday formally confirmed the purchase by Park, Letham and Taylor.

What is the common name of aluminium/aluminum oxide crystals used in grinding?","completion":"The common name of aluminium/aluminum oxide crystals used in grinding is Corundum. Corundum is a naturally occurring mineral and the second hardest natural substance, ranking only behind diamond in terms of hardness. It has a Mohs hardness of 9, making it an extremely durable and abrasive material, ideal for various grinding and cutting applications. Corundum is a crystalline form of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and belongs to the trigonal crystal system. In its pure state, it is colorless and transparent, but the presence of impurities such as iron, chromium, vanadium, and titanium can give it a range of colors, including blue, red, green, and yellow. There are a few well-known gem varieties of corundum, including ruby and sapphire. Ruby is the red variety of corundum, colored by traces of chromium, while sapphire refers to any other corundum gemstone that is not red and typically comes in shades of blue due to the presence of iron and titanium. In the industrial world, however, it is the abrasive properties of corundum that make it valuable. Corundum is widely used in grinding applications due to its extreme hardness, durability, and heat resistance. Its highly abrasive nature makes it suitable for grinding and polishing various materials such as metal, glass, ceramics, and even other abrasive materials. Some common uses of corundum in grinding applications include: 1. Grinding wheels: Corundum is used as an abrasive material in grinding wheels for various industrial applications. The wheels can be designed for different materials, such as metal, stone, ceramic, or even other abrasives. 2. Sandpaper: Corundum can be used as the abrasive material in sandpapers and other coated abrasive products for surface preparation, polishing, and finishing of hard surfaces. 3. Cutting tools: The hardness and abrasiveness of corundum can be utilized in the making of cutting tools such as saws, drills, and cutting discs for various materials. 4. Polishing compounds: Corundum can be used as a fine powder for polishing compounds and pastes that are used to achieve high-quality surface finishes on various materials such as metals, ceramics, and plastic. 5. Lapping and honing: Fine corundum particles can be used in lapping and honing processes to refine and create precise fits in components of mechanical devices, engines, and other equipment. 6. Abrasive blasting: Corundum is also employed in abrasive blasting applications as a high-performance, recyclable abrasive blasting medium for applications such as surface preparation, paint stripping, rust removal, and the cleaning of metal surfaces. In summary, corundum, or aluminum oxide crystals, are known for their remarkable hardness and abrasive properties, making them an ideal material for various grinding applications in various industries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence from a movie review: annoying score Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","completion":"Based on the sentence provided from the movie review, it appears that the movie was seen negatively. The term \\"annoying score\\" indicates a negative critique towards the film's music, which is a crucial part of a film's overall presentation and immersion. A film's score, or the background music and sounds that play throughout, plays a significant part in setting the tone, mood, and atmosphere of the scenes. It's instrumental in invoking emotions, enhancing storytelling, and accentuating the on-screen action, performances and dialogue. It can range from orchestral music to pop songs, electronic music to traditional folk tunes, depending upon the theme and essence of the film. In some cases, the score also serves as a character in itself, providing audiences a sensorial feel of the unseen elements of the narrative, amplifying tension, fear, romance, excitement or melancholy as the plot requires. Movie scores also have a huge impact on the rhythm and pace of the narrative, sometimes signalling transitions, denoting passage of time or zoning in to focus on minute details. When a reviewer hence describes a score as \\"annoying,\\" it means the music may have been deemed too intrusive, out of sync, repetitive, lacking variation or originality, or simply not fitting with the tone or genre of the movie. It might have distracted from the overall viewing experience rather than adding any value to it, thus bringing down the overall impression of the movie. Therefore, given the important role of a film's score in contributing to the overall effect and impression, the phrase \\"annoying score\\" undoubtedly signifies a negative review of the movie. However, it's important to note that this is only one aspect of the film, and other elements might have been positively received. But, based on this sentence alone, the movie review is negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

To solve this instance, I will use the given fact statement to generate the correct answer for the question. Fact: A tree can be replaced by planting a new tree. Question: Which of these would result in reversal of desertification? Step 1: Understand the context of the question, which is desertification. Desertification refers to the process of land degradation due to various factors, including climate change and human activities, which results in the land becoming more arid and less capable of sustaining life. Step 2: Based on the fact, we know that trees play a vital role in preventing desertification as they help to retain soil moisture, provide shade, and support other plant and animal life. Thus, maintaining or increasing the number of trees is essential for reversing desertification. Step 3: Analyze the fact statement and its implications for reversing desertification. If a tree can be replaced by planting a new tree, it means that even if a tree dies or gets destroyed, we can plant a new one to take its place. This, in turn, contributes to maintaining or even increasing the tree cover in an area, which is crucial for counteracting desertification.

The Third Carnatic War spread beyond southern India and into Bengal where British forces captured the French settlement of Chandernagore in 1757. However, the war was decided in the south, where the British successfully defended Madras, and Sir Eyre Coote decisively defeated the French, commanded by Comte de Lally at the Battle of Wandiwash in 1760. After Wandiwash, the French capital of Pondicherry fell to the British in 1761.

Here is a news article: Yaren, Nauru I FORGIVE you if you have never heard of my country. At just 8 square miles, about a third of the size of Manhattan, and located in the southern Pacific Ocean, Nauru appears as merely a pinpoint on most maps — if it is not missing entirely in a vast expanse of blue. But make no mistake; we are a sovereign nation, with our own language, customs and history dating back 3,000 years. Nauru is worth a quick Internet search, I assure you, for not only will you discover a fascinating country that is often overlooked, you will find an indispensible cautionary tale about life in a place with hard ecological limits. Phosphate mining, first by foreign companies and later our own, cleared the lush tropical rainforest that once covered our island’s interior, scarring the land and leaving only a thin strip of coastline for us to live on. The legacy of exploitation left us with few economic alternatives and one of the highest unemployment rates in the world, and led previous governments to make unwise investments that ultimately squandered our country’s savings. Photo I am not looking for sympathy, but rather warning you what can happen when a country runs out of options. The world is headed down a similar path with the relentless burning of coal and oil, which is altering the planet’s climate, melting ice caps, making oceans more acidic and edging us ever closer to a day when no one will be able to take clean water, fertile soil or abundant food for granted. Climate change also threatens the very existence of many countries in the Pacific, where the sea level is projected to rise three feet or more by the end of the century. Already, Nauru’s coast, the only habitable area, is steadily eroding, and communities in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands have been forced to flee their homes to escape record tides. The low-lying nations of Tuvalu, Kiribati and the Marshall Islands may vanish entirely within our grandchildren’s lifetimes. Similar climate stories are playing out on nearly every continent, where a steady onslaught of droughts, floods and heat waves, which are expected to become even more frequent and intense with climate change, have displaced millions of people and led to widespread food shortages. The changes have already heightened competition over scarce resources, and could foreshadow life in a world where conflicts are increasingly driven by environmental catastrophes. Yet the international community has not begun to prepare for the strain they will put on humanitarian organizations or their implications for political stability around the world. In 2009, an initiative by the Pacific Small Island Developing States, of which I am chairman, prompted the United Nations General Assembly to recognize the link between climate change and security. But two years later, no concrete action has been taken. So I was pleased to learn that the United Nations Security Council will take up the issue tomorrow in an open debate, in which I will have the opportunity to address the body and reiterate my organization’s proposals. First, the Security Council should join the General Assembly in recognizing climate change as a threat to international peace and security. It is a threat as great as nuclear proliferation or global terrorism. Second, a special representative on climate and security should be appointed. Third, we must assess whether the United Nations system is itself capable of responding to a crisis of this magnitude. The stakes are too high to implement these measures only after a disaster is already upon us. Negotiations to reduce emissions should remain the primary forum for reaching an international agreement. We are not asking for blue helmets to intervene; we are simply asking the international community to plan for the biggest environmental and humanitarian challenge of our time. Nauru has begun an intensive program to restore the damage done by mining, and my administration has put environmental sustainability at the center of our policymaking. Making our island whole again will be a long and difficult process, but it is our home and we cannot leave it for another one. I forgive you if you have never heard of Nauru — but you will not forgive yourselves if you ignore our story. ||||| I FORGIVE you if you have never heard of my country.

One Twitter user asked: \\"When will Transport for London sort out overcrowding at Oxford Circus? Closed almost every day at rush hour.\\" Following the terrorist attacks in Paris, another tweeted the overcrowding made \\"everyone jumpy\\". Minor closures were not included in the figures, released to BBC London through a Freedom of Information request. These include times when entrances were closed and stations only used for people to interchange and exit. TfL said these \\"partial closures\\" were \\"treated as 'business as usual' and usually only recorded locally, if at all\\". Oxford Circus is London Underground's busiest station, with nearly 100 million passengers entering or leaving the station in 2014. Stations are closed in order to \\"ensure that platforms are safe to use and there are not too many people on them,\\" a TfL spokeswoman added. Tailor Thomas Church, 25, from West Hampstead, who uses the station every day, said the closures affected surrounding businesses. He said: \\"When it closes I have to cancel appointments and that means I lose money. It can cost us thousands of pounds every time. \\"What I don't get is that London is the world's favourite city and Oxford Circus is at the heart of it - so why hasn't it been upgraded to cope with demand?\\" London Mayor Boris Johnson was forced to defend TfL in response to the figures. \\"Oxford Circus is in line, as you know, for a huge improvement and don't forget that is one of the reasons why Crossrail is so vital,\\" he told LBC. \\"That Central line, that whole network will be radically relieved by Crossrail when it comes in in a couple of years' time.\\" A spokesman for watchdog London TravelWatch said the figures showed the \\"need for continued investment in capacity in the face of ever increasing demand\\". A July report from the watchdog recommended improving how interchanges are shown on Tube and rail maps. It said this could include making it clear where stations are a short walk apart, the interchanges that do not require additional fares and those that require passengers to leave the station. General Secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union (RMT) Mick Cash said the underground network was \\"bursting at the seams\\". \\"RMT is now receiving regular reports from our reps of severe overcrowding on both the tube and the commuter rail services,\\" he said. \\"All the indicators are that passenger numbers will continue to surge, cramming more people into a capacity that is already at breaking point. \\"At the moment the transport authorities are winging it and that is a recipe for disaster. \\" \\"I think it needs to be pedestrian-only. There's just too many people. People are walking in the roads, I just walked in the road myself. It's a bit of a joke,\\" said Jonny Button. Isabel Cordwell, who works between Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Circus, said: \\"It stops me getting home in the evening. It's not at the same time every day so it's quite inconvenient. \\"But I'm not sure what can be done to change it - it's just the amount of people trying to get in and out.\\" Rebecca Koczan said: \\"It's pretty rubbish.

This sentiment stems from multiple negative experiences the reviewer had with the business in question. The reviewer's first point of dissatisfaction revolves around the quality of service received, describing their first massage as the 'worst massage of my life.' There's a clear note of disappointment and frustration, indicating a significant failure in the service provision. The reviewer's second key complaint refers to their experience with a second masseuse who allegedly was not paying full attention during the service, and was apparently engaged in inappropriate behavior. This experience would understandably lead to a sense of discomfort, imbuing the review with a negative tone. The third issue refers to the customer service component. The reviewer mentions a failure in being able to schedule further appointments despite having already paid for them through Groupon. This includes not receiving call backs or responses to emails and messages, which signals a disregard or neglect of customer needs and requests. Finally, the expiration of the Groupon without being able to use it for the services already paid for contributes to the overall negative sentiment. This aspect indicates a lack of resolution for the customer's problems, which further intensifies the negative feelings. The review concludes with a strong negative recommendation against patronizing the establishment, which significantly adds to the negative sentiment as it indicates the reviewer's overall dissatisfaction and their desire to discourage others from making the same mistake. The phrase \\"Don't go there, it's horrible\\" is an aggressive call to action, emphasizing the reviewer's extreme dissatisfaction and negative feelings towards the business."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The graduate of St. Matthew's Catholic High School is an outfielder who stands six feet four inches tall and weighs 225 pounds, according to his draft profile. Orimoloye was born in Nigeria but grew up in the east Ottawa suburb of Orleans. He has previously committed to the University of Oregon, but has the option of signing with Milwaukee and playing professional baseball, or choosing to go to school. If Orimoloye does go pro, his signing bonus will likely sit in the 2 million range in addition to his contract. Orimoloye played with the Ottawa-Nepean Canadians and travelled with Canada's Junior National Team. He compares his game to Adam Jones, an outfielder with the Baltimore Orioles. Write a title for it.","completion":"\\"Ottawa Outfielder Demi Orimoloye Selected by Milwaukee Brewers in 2015 MLB Draft\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

We have: 525*x + 1840 = 445*x First, we want to get all the x's on one side of the equation. So, let's subtract 445*x from both sides: 525*x - 445*x + 1840 = 445*x - 445*x This simplifies to: 80*x + 1840 = 0 Now, we want to get x all by itself. So let's subtract 1840 from both sides: 80*x + 1840 - 1840 = 0 - 1840 This simplifies to: 80*x = -1840 Now, we just need to divide by 80 to find the value of x: 80*x / 80 = -1840 / 80 This gives us: x = -23 So the answer is x = -23.

Given the question \\"What will happen to Cameron?\\", is \\"she will pay a bill\\" a valid answer? Answer:","completion":"Yes, \\"she will pay a bill\\" is a valid answer to the question, \\"What will happen to Cameron?\\" when taking her pet to the veterinarian to get a new rabies shot. However, this answer can be expanded upon to provide more details and a better understanding of the situation. When Cameron takes her pet to the veterinarian for a rabies shot, several events or actions may take place, including the following: 1. Registration and check-in: Upon arriving at the veterinary clinic, Cameron will likely need to register her pet and provide necessary information, such as the pet's name, age, breed, medical history, and any current health issues or symptoms. If Cameron is a new client, she may need to fill out additional forms or provide proof of her pet's previous vaccinations. 2. Physical examination: Before administering the rabies shot, the veterinarian may conduct a physical examination to assess the overall health of Cameron's pet, checking for any signs of illness or distress. This may include listening to the pet's heartbeat, inspecting its coat, and examining its eyes, ears, mouth, and limbs. This serves to ensure that the pet can safely receive the vaccination. 3. Vaccination administration: Once the veterinarian determines that the pet is in good health, they will administer the rabies shot. This usually involves injecting the vaccine under the skin or into the muscle, depending on the specific vaccine being used. The veterinarian may also explain any possible side effects of the vaccine and provide aftercare instructions. 4. Record updates and future appointments: After administering the rabies vaccine, the veterinarian will update the pet's vaccination records. They may also provide Cameron with a vaccination certificate or documentation, which can be useful for pet licensing, travel, and other official requirements. Additionally, the veterinarian may discuss the recommended schedule for future vaccinations and appointments, in order to maintain the pet's overall health. 5. Payment and checkout: As mentioned in the original answer, Cameron will need to pay for the services rendered by the veterinarian. This will typically include the cost of the rabies vaccine, any additional tests or procedures conducted during the appointment, and possibly a consultation or examination fee. Most veterinary clinics will provide a detailed invoice that outlines all charges before requiring payment. In conclusion, while the response \\"she will pay a bill\\" is a valid answer indicating that Cameron will incur a financial cost for taking her pet to receive a rabies shot at the veterinarian, there are several other aspects of the appointment that can be elaborated upon to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Donald Trump is stress-testing how we think about American democracy Over at Foreign Affairs, Timothy Frye talks about how political science is having a devil of a time predicting Russia’s future trajectory. One theory of political science says that because Russia is a personalist autocracy, it is less likely to experience a successful regime transition to democracy (there’s a lot of other problems with personalist autocracies — click here for more). Another theory of political science says that Russia’s comparatively high per capita income and educational attainment makes it ripe for more democratization. In short, Russia is either on a dangerous path, or not. It is either primed for change from below or through a coup. Or neither. The consensus of experts suggests that change is unlikely. Predicting Russia’s future is particularly challenging because both theories have merit. The danger is to blindly follow one. Instead, observers need to keep an open mind about Russia’s political future. Or, to make it even shorter: ¯_(ツ)_/¯ It was impossible for me to read Frye’s analysis and not think about just how much political scientists don’t know about politics. For example, what is it exactly that makes American democracy tick? How has a 230-year old political compact managed to persist as well as it has? What in the Constitution has put a stop to permanent despotism or division? Many people and an awful lot of political scientists would answer with “rule of law” and “separation of powers” and “a republic, not a democracy.” Indeed, that’s pretty much the gist of James Madison’s answer in Federalist 10: It is in vain to say that enlightened statesmen will be able to adjust these clashing interests, and render them all subservient to the public good. Enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm. Nor, in many cases, can such an adjustment be made at all without taking into view indirect and remote considerations, which will rarely prevail over the immediate interest which one party may find in disregarding the rights of another or the good of the whole. The inference to which we are brought is, that the causes of faction cannot be removed, and that relief is only to be sought in the means of controlling its effects. Madison goes on to argue that the Constitution’s checks and balances prevent the existence of factions from crippling the United States. And this is what I’ve always been taught — that the genius of the American Republic is that even majorities face constitutional limits on their ability to implement their will. While at the G-7 Summit in Japan, President Obama says world leaders are \\"rattled\\" by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. He also told reporters that Trump displays ignorance of world affairs. (AP) As political polarization has increased in the United States, however, a lot of commentators have raised a significant objection: what if this system can only function with the presence of strong norms as well as laws? This is a point that Jonathan Chait has made repeatedly, most recently this past February: It turns out that what has held together American government is less the elaborate rules hammered out by the guys in the wigs in 1789 than a series of social norms that have begun to disintegrate. Senate filibusters were supposed to be rare, until they became routine. They weren’t supposed to be applied to judicial nominations, then they were. The Senate majority would never dream of changing the rules to limit the filibuster; the minority party would never plan to withhold all support from the president even before he took office; it would never threaten to default on the debt to extort concessions from the president. And then all of this happened. Indeed, a disturbing fraction of Americans are growing skeptical about democracy itself. Can a constitutional democracy persist if the norms and beliefs that traditionally uphold it are eroding and eroding fast? Which brings me to the prospect of Donald Trump somehow becoming president. There’s been an emergent literature warning about the possibility of Trump inheriting the awesome powers of the executive branch that legislative gridlock has managed to engender. I’ve written on this problem as well. But as Brookings’ Benjamin Wittes notes, much of this is premised on the notion that the executive branch has poached too much extraordinary power, and that this enhanced power would turn a president Trump into a tyrant. That may or may not be true, but as Wittes writes, that’s not the biggest problem of a President Trump: Let me be blunt: The soft spot is not NSA and it’s not the drone program. The soft spot, the least tyrant-proof part of the government, is the U.S. Department of Justice and the larger law enforcement and regulatory apparatus of the United States government. The first reason you should fear a Donald Trump presidency is what he would do to the ordinary enforcement functions of the federal government, not the most extraordinary ones…. What would a president need to do to shift the Justice Department to the crimes or civil infractions committed—or suspected—by Trump critics and opponents? He would need to appoint and get confirmed by the Senate the right attorney general. That’s very doable. He’d want to keep his communications with that person limited. An unspoken understanding that the Justice Department’s new priorities include crimes by the right sort of people would be better than the sort of chortling communications Richard Nixon and John Mitchell used to have.

Develop a sudden trust-busting interest in retailers that are “too big”; half the country will be with you. Just make sure you state your non-neutral principles in neutral terms…. The presidency’s very virtues as an office—relative unity and vertical integration—make it impossible to render abuse-proof. It is vested with a truly awesome thing:“the executive power” of the entire federal government. There are simply too many ways to abuse that power to imagine we can denude the office of the ability to behave tyranically. There is, in fact, only one way to tyrant-proof the American presidency: Don’t elect tyrants to it.

Mandolin There are many styles of mandolin, but four are common, the Neapolitan or round-backed mandolin, the carved-top mandolin and the flat-backed mandolin. The round-back has a deep bottom, constructed of strips of wood, glued together into a bowl. The carved-top or arch-top mandolin has a much shallower, arched back, and an arched top—both carved out of wood. The flat-backed mandolin uses thin sheets of wood for the body, braced on the inside for strength in a similar manner to a guitar. Each style of instrument has its own sound quality and is associated with particular forms of music. Neapolitan mandolins feature prominently in European classical music and traditional music.

Sarah had a competitive edge over Angela in the race, because","completion":"Sarah had been training rigorously for the past few months. Every morning, she would wake up at 5 AM sharp, put on her running gear, and head out for her daily run. She knew that this disciplined approach would yield results, and she was determined to prove herself in the upcoming race against Angela. She had also sought expert advice from a professional coach, who helped her fine-tune her running technique, focusing on maintaining a steady pace and conserving her energy for the final sprint. This guidance was invaluable in helping her reach her full potential as a runner, and she had been practicing these techniques consistently during her training sessions. Additionally, Sarah incorporated strength training and flexibility exercises into her workout routine, as she realized their importance in boosting her performance on the track. These exercises focused on building her leg strength, improving her balance, and increasing her range of motion, all critical factors in giving her a competitive edge in the race. On the other hand, Angela had adopted a more nonchalant approach to the race. While she was naturally athletic and had a strong base of running experience, she had not dedicated the same amount of time and effort to her training. Instead of setting a strict training schedule, she would run sporadically and often missed sessions when she felt tired or unmotivated. Angela did not consult a professional coach, relying solely on her instincts and her natural ability. As a result, she was not aware of the latest techniques or strategies that could help her optimize her performance, and she had not invested time in specific exercises to improve her running. As the race day approached, Sarah's preparation was evident. Her dedication to her training had led to significant improvement in both her stamina and her technique. She could feel the newfound strength in her legs and the fluidity in her stride. Meanwhile, Angela was growing increasingly anxious about the race. She knew that she had not prepared as thoroughly as her opponent, and she couldn't shake the feeling that her sporadic training would be her undoing. When the day of the race finally arrived, both Sarah and Angela arrived at the starting line with their eyes on the prize. The starting gun fired, and the two runners took off, each determined to claim victory. However, it soon became clear that Sarah's disciplined training had paid off. Her powerful strides carried her ahead of Angela, and her unwavering focus allowed her to maintain her pace without faltering. Angela fought valiantly, relying on her natural athleticism to keep up, but it was evident that she was struggling. As they reached the final stretch of the race, Sarah tapped into the energy reserves she had carefully cultivated during her months of disciplined training. She surged forward and crossed the finish line, her arms raised in triumph. Angela arrived shortly after, panting and disappointed. Sarah's competitive edge had proven to be the deciding factor. Her commitment, planning, and strategic execution of her training regimen had enabled her to overcome a talented but underprepared opponent. The race gave Sarah an important lesson on the power of discipline and determination, which she would carry with her into future challenges."},{"prompt":"Question: Read the article and select the best answer.

If the lungs are able to remove more oxygen from the air, this increased oxygen availability would then affect the rest of the process. When more oxygen is available in the lungs, a higher concentration of oxygen will diffuse into the alveoli, which would subsequently lead to a higher concentration of oxygen in the bloodstream. As hemoglobin in red blood cells attaches to the oxygen, the level of oxygenated red blood cells increases as well. Since there are more oxygenated red blood cells traveling throughout the body, more oxygen would be available to diffuse into cells from capillaries.

A friend asked me to answer this question: The witch doctors reach the school before who can escape?, using the article: The film opens with an English schoolteacher, Gwen Mayfield, packing up her belongings at a mission school in colonial Africa. The local witch doctors have led a rebellion, and they reach the school before she is able to escape—the shaman wearing a body mask. Gwen screams, and the scene dissolves to the opening credits. The next scene is back home in England, where Gwen meets with the apparently Reverend Alan Bax for a job interview.

Alan is impressed by Gwen and hires her to be the new head teacher at the small private school he and his sister, well-known journalist Stephanie Bax, run for the local children in the village of Heddaby. Upon moving into the teacher's cottage, Gwen asks her maid, Valerie Creek, where she might find the rectory. Valerie is confused—she knows there is no rectory—until Gwen explains she would like to thank Mr. Bax. \\"Oh, you mean the Baxes' house!\\" she says, and shows her the way after tea. At the house, Gwen meets Stephanie and mentions she tried to look for the church on the way but couldn't find it.

In order to absorb the iron, you must consume it through food or supplements. Vegetarians, young children, pregnant women, and individuals with certain chronic illnesses may be at increased risk for poor iron absorption or inadequate iron levels. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? people with chronic illnesses may be at risk for poor iron absorption","completion":"Yes, the next sentence, \\"people with chronic illnesses may be at risk for poor iron absorption,\\" does follow and is supported by the preceding text. Moreover, it emphasizes that certain groups of people might face challenges in maintaining adequate iron levels in their bodies. However, you might want to provide more context and information on how to improve iron absorption rates for these individuals and others in general. To increase iron absorption, try the following tips: 1. Consume heme-iron-rich foods: Heme-iron sources, found in animal products like red meat, poultry, and fish, are more easily absorbed by the body than non-heme iron found in plant-based sources (like leafy greens, beans, and fortified cereals). 2. Combine heme and non-heme iron sources: Pairing non-heme iron sources, such as spinach, with heme-iron sources, like chicken, can result in improved iron absorption. 3. Eat foods high in Vitamin C: Vitamin C (found in citrus fruits, strawberries, kiwis, and bell peppers) enhances iron absorption, so consuming these foods alongside iron-rich ingredients will optimize the absorption process. 4. Avoid or reduce the consumption of iron inhibitors: Certain substances, like calcium and polyphenols (found in coffee, tea, and wine), can inhibit iron absorption. By not consuming these items during meals with iron-rich foods, you can improve absorption rates. 5. Utilize cast-iron cookware: Cooking food in cast-iron pots or pans can increase the iron content of the cooked food by naturally transferring some of the iron from the cookware to what is being prepared. 6. Consider iron supplements: For those having difficulty obtaining adequate iron through their diet, iron supplements can serve as an alternative source. Consult with a healthcare provider to discuss whether supplements are necessary and to identify the appropriate dosage. 7. Regular check-ups and blood tests: It is essential to have regular check-ups, especially for those at higher risk for poor iron absorption or inadequate iron levels. Monitoring iron levels in the bloodstream and adjusting dietary habits and supplementation as needed can help maintain optimal iron levels and ensure overall health. In summary, the next sentence does follow the provided text. To further support the statement, additional information and guidelines can be provided to educate individuals and promote better strategies for increasing iron absorption, especially in those most at risk."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What did Hans Müller think would prevent tragedy befalling he and his family? After World War II, a German named Hans Müller is one of a shipload of Jewish refugees who disembark at Haifa in 1949. Like many other concentration camp survivors, Hans has psychological problems, including survivor guilt. At one point, he mistakes a woman and some children for his murdered family. At the first opportunity, he sneaks out of the refugee camp and goes into the city. When he spots a policeman, Hans panics and reacts by fleeing. The policeman chases him down and begins questioning him. Hans becomes very agitated and attacks, leaving the man unconscious in the street. Hans flees and ends up sleeping in the countryside, where he is found by a teenage orphan Sabra, Yehoshua \\"Josh\\" Bresler. Hans pretends to be an eccentric American, out to see Israel firsthand. Josh offers to be his guide. During their journey, Hans reveals that he was a professional juggler; Josh persuades him to pass on his knowledge. Meanwhile, police detective Karni sets out to track the fugitive down. On their journey, Josh is injured when he wanders into a minefield. He is taken to a hospital at a nearby kibbutz, but has only broken his leg. While Josh recovers, Hans becomes acquainted with one of the residents, Ya'el (Milly Vitale). They are attracted to each other, but he at first strongly resists her attempt to persuade him to remain at the kibbutz. He reveals to her that he had ignored warnings from friends to flee Nazi Germany before it was too late, making the fatal mistake of counting on his fame and popularity to protect his family. Gradually, however, he begins to settle in. Karni finally tracks Hans down and tries to take him into custody. Hans panics again and barricades himself in Ya'el's room with her rifle, but Ya'el and Karni get him to admit he needs help and to give himself up.

Input: Problem: a jar full of whisky contains 40 % alcohol . a part of this whisky is replaced by another containg 17 % alcohol and now the percentage of alcohol was found to be 26 % . what quantity of whisky is replaced ? Options: a ) 1 / 3 , b ) 2 / 3 , c ) 2 / 5 , d ) 3 / 5 , e ) 4 / 5 Output:","completion":"The question is basically a mixture problem, more specifically a problem related to alcohol content concentration in a whisky mixture. The initial percentage of alcohol in the whisky is 40%, and then a certain quantity of this whisky is replaced with another that has 17% alcohol content, resulting in a new mixture that has 26% alcohol content. We are asked to find what quantity of the original whisky was replaced. The theory used here is that the amount of alcohol in the jar before and after replacement remains the same (since we just replaced some whisky, not added or subtracted). So, we can set up an equation based on this understanding to solve for the unknown quantity of whisky that was replaced. Let's denote: - The quantity of whisky replaced as x (This is what we are trying to find out). - The total initial quantity of whisky as 1 (for simplicity) Therefore, the remaining quantity after replacement would be (1-x) Now, we can set up the equation by equating the quantity of alcohol before and after the replacement: (Quantity alcohol in original whisky - Quantity alcohol in removed whisky) = Quantity alcohol in the replaced whisky Whose expression becomes: 40% * 1 - 40% * x = 26% * (1 - x) + 17% * x Which simplifies to: 40% - 40% * x = 26% - 26% * x + 17% * x Solving for x gives: x = 2/5 So, the answer is c) 2/5.

Premise: He changed thumbs while he considered. Hypothesis: He changed thumbs while considering. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"In order to assess whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, it's important to first understand the meaning of each statement and the logical relationship between them. Let's break down the components of the premise and the hypothesis and compare their overall implications to determine if entailment is present. Premise: \\"He changed thumbs while he considered.\\" This premise suggests that a certain individual (referred to as \\"he\\") changed thumbs while also engaged in contemplation or thought. In this case, \\"changing thumbs\\" might refer to an action or gesture, such as switching the position of one's thumbs or fiddling with one's thumbs out of nervousness or concentration during the process of thinking. It may also be interpreted as the action of switching between thumbs while scrolling or clicking with one's phone. Hypothesis: \\"He changed thumbs while considering.\\" This hypothesis similarly posits that the same individual changed thumbs while in the state of considering or thinking. Here, the hypothesis also implies that the subject was engaged in some form of mental deliberation, and the action of changing thumbs occurred simultaneously or parallel to this thought process. Now, we can compare the logical implications of both the premise and the hypothesis to assess the presence of entailment. Entailment is a relationship where the truth of one statement strictly and necessarily implies the truth of another statement. If the premise entails the hypothesis, the premise must imply that the hypothesis is also true. Upon examining both statements, it becomes evident that they share a similar underlying message: the protagonist swapped thumbs in concert with a process of thought or consideration. In both scenarios, the act of \\"changing thumbs\\" coincides with engaging in mental deliberation. Given the close alignment in the intended meanings of both statements, it's plausible to suggest that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. The premise demonstrates that a certain individual changed thumbs and considered simultaneously, which directly implies the assertion the hypothesis is making. This strong and necessary connection between the two statements indicates a relationship of entailment. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"He changed thumbs while considering\\" is entailed by the premise \\"He changed thumbs while he considered,\\" as the meaning and implications of the premise contain the same elements of the hypothesis, and the truth of the premise directly leads to the truth of the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: In modern society there is a great deal of argument about competition. Some value it highly, believing that it is responsible for social progress. Others say that competition is bad; that it sets one person against another; that it leads to unfriendly relationship between people. I have taught many children who held the belief that their self-worth depended on how well they performed at tennis and other skills. For them, playing well and winning are often life-and-death affairs . The development of many other human qualities is sadly forgotten. However, while some seem to be lost in the desire to succeed, others take an opposite attitude. In a culture which values only the winner and pays no attention to the common players, they are strongly against competition. Most of them are young people who have suffered under competitive pressures from their parents or society. Teaching these youngsters, I often observe in them a desire to fail. They seem to find failure by not trying to win or achieve success. By not trying, they always have an excuse: \\" I may have lost, but it doesn't matter because I really didn't try.\\" What is not usually accepted by themselves is the belief that if they had really tried and lost, that would mean a lot. Such a loss would be a measure of their worth. Clearly, this belief is the same as that of true competitors who try to prove themselves. Both are based on the mistaken belief that one's self-worth depends on how well one performs in the competition. Both are afraid of not being valued.

Process: - Gather the ingredients for the cake - Mix the flour, sugar, egg, and water to make batter - Pour the mixture into a cake pan - Place the cake in the oven to cook - Take the cake out when it is cooked through - Let the cake cool - Serve the cake - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less sugar is used happens, how will it affect a BIGGER cake. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"If less sugar is used in the recipe, it will indeed have an effect on a bigger cake, both in terms of taste and texture. The perturbation caused by using less sugar can have direct and indirect effects on the process of making and the final outcome of the cake. Direct effects: 1. Taste: Reducing the amount of sugar will lead to a less sweet cake. As sugar is one of the primary ingredients responsible for providing sweetness, using less sugar will result in a cake that may not be as palatable or meet the expectations of those who prefer a more traditional level of sweetness. 2. Texture: Sugar plays an essential role in the cake's texture. It helps make the cake tender by absorbing water, which later evaporates during baking. This process contributes to the formation of a desirable crumb structure in the finished product. Using less sugar can lead to a denser, drier, and possibly tougher cake, depending on the other ingredients and preparation methods used. 3. Browning and crust formation: When sugar is heated, it undergoes a process called caramelization, which leads to the browning and formation of a crust on the cake's surface. This process contributes to both the flavor and appearance of the cake. When less sugar is used, the cake may not brown as effectively or develop the desired crust. Indirect effects: 1. Recipe adjustments: To compensate for using less sugar, one might increase the amounts of other ingredients or add alternative sweeteners to help maintain both the desired taste and texture. This alteration can change the overall balance of ingredients and affect the final outcome of the cake. 2. Baking time and temperature: Since less sugar is being used, the baking time and temperature may need to be adjusted to account for the differences in texture and browning. This can lead to trial and error or the need to closely monitor the cake to ensure it is properly cooked. 3. Serving and presentation: A less sweet cake may require additional elements to enhance its flavor, such as serving it with fresh fruits, whipped cream or a sweet sauce. This can affect how the cake is presented, served, and enjoyed by those consuming it. In conclusion, using less sugar in a bigger cake can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of cake-making and its final outcome. The perturbation may require adjustments to the recipe, baking time, temperature, and serving suggestions to achieve a satisfactory result, particularly when considering taste and texture."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Earths magnetic field helps protect Earth and its organisms. It protects us from harmful particles given off by the sun. Most of the particles are attracted to the north and south magnetic poles. This is where Earths magnetic field is strongest. This is also where relatively few organisms live. Another benefit of Earths magnetic field is its use for navigation.

This is a terrific movie, and at the same time ultimately poignant and sad. It's a story of a relatively wealthy and happy family from outward appearance during difficult times of Depression when the, Michael Sullivan, a father of two children, played by great Tom Hanks (I'm not his admirer but ought to say that) is a hit-man for local mafia boss, played by Paul Newman. His eldest son, a thirteen years boy Michael Sullivan Jr., perfectly played by young Tyler Hoechlin, after years of blissful ignorance finds out what is his father job and on what money their family live. Prompted by his curiosity and his aspiration to know truth he accidentally becomes a witness of a murder, committed by John Rooney, son of his father boss.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Given the background: There must be more to this story than just gas exchange with the environment. To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis. and the situation: Matthew is training to run a marathon. Every day he runs up and down a hill near his house until he is out of breath, then walks around his house until his breathing rate returns to normal. Answer the following question: Will breathing rate increase or decrease when the body requires more energy to preform a task such as running? Answer:","completion":"Breathing rate will increase when the body requires more energy to perform a task such as running. This is because the body needs more oxygen to support the energy demand during the activity, which in turn facilitates cellular respiration to produce ATP molecules for energy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Not as a nurse, but as a patient. I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned. She told me she appreciated the humor of the situation so there was no “hard feelings.” Question: How long did it take the author to fully recover from the surgical mishap?

Options are: + Yes; + No; The answer is:","completion":"No. The correct answer to the question of what allows an organism to create offspring both sexually and asexually is not \\"remains of prehistoric life\\". Remains of prehistoric life refers to fossils or preserved evidence of living organisms from earlier geological periods. This does not have a direct relation to the sexual or asexual reproduction methods of contemporary organisms. The question is most likely referring to the biological process known as the alternation of generations. This complex life cycle is found in some plants and algae. During this cycle, the organism alternates between a sexual phase (the gametophyte, producing gametes) and an asexual phase (the sporophyte, producing spores). Let's elaborate to make this clearer. During the gametophyte phase of the life cycle, the plant or algae reproduces sexually. Gametes (sperm and egg cells) are produced, which combine during fertilization to create a new organism with a full set of genetic information (a zygote), half provided by each parent. This zygote will grow into a mature sporophyte. Then, during the sporophyte phase, the plant or algae reproduces asexually. Special cells (spores) are produced through a process called meiosis, which halves the number of chromosomes.

Article:The company will also begin to offer Sunday parcel deliveries but this will be in the London area only. Allowing customers to collect parcels on a Sunday for the first time is the latest in a number of changes introduced by the company. Royal Mail, which was part-privatised last year, is facing competition from business rivals such Amazon. Royal Mail said its decision to open some delivery offices on Sundays would make it easier for people who shop online, but are not normally home during the day, to get their goods. The offices, which are located across the UK, will be open between 12:00 and 16:00 on Sundays. The company is also launching some Sunday delivery services, to addresses within the M25 area. Royal Mail spokesman Mike Newnham said it was about making things easier for customers. \\"In the last year or so we've launched our Delivery to Neighbour service, we've opened up about 600 of our delivery offices on a Wednesday evening to provide more convenience, and also we've launched the country's largest click-and-collect service in conjunction with the Post Office,\\" he said. Royal Mail's Delivery to Neighbour service involves items being delivered to a neighbouring address for collection if the intended recipient is not at home. Parcel deliveries account for more than half of Royal Mail's revenues but it is facing increasing competition from rival operators such as online retailer Amazon which began offering Sunday deliveries earlier this year. Analysts believe the growing popularity of so-called click-and-collect services, which allow goods to be ordered online before being picked up at local stores or collection points, is also having a significant effect on the parcels business. Last month, Royal Mail said it was bringing forward the final collection times at thousands of post boxes in order to save money. Royal Mail's network of about 1,400 delivery offices is currently open six days a week. Nick Landon, managing director of Royal Mail Parcels, said: \\"We are continuing to be more customer responsive and provide more options for people to receive items they have ordered online. \\"I am delighted to pilot Sunday afternoon opening at around 100 of our delivery offices across the UK with the highest parcel volumes, and Sunday deliveries to addresses within the M25 motorway.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"Royal Mail is introducing Sunday parcel deliveries in the London area and opening around 100 delivery offices across the UK on Sundays between 12:00 and 16:00.

The answer to the question: Who is the son of the person that the hacker helps unplug everything from their house? is inside the article: A serial killer named Karl Hochman is known as \\"The Address Book Killer\\" due to his habit of stealing address books and choosing his victims from them. While he is working at a computer store, he obtains Terry Munroe's (Karen Allen) address book after another employee, who is demonstrating a scanner, copies a page of her address book into the computer. On a rainy night while heading home, Karl collides into a truck, which causes his car to go off the road and swerve down a trail in a cemetery as he laughs. In the emergency room he is put into an MRI machine. A surge from an electrical storm manages to transfer his soul into a computer. Now as a network-based entity, Karl continues to plot his killing spree using various objects connected to the electrical grid and computer networks. Karl opens the scanned page from Terry's address book and begins to kill all the names he finds there. Her co-worker, Frank Mallory, becomes the first victim when his microwave oven explodes.

Answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him. Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump...

After news of it spreads across town, a Catholic priest named Father Richard Moore is arrested and sent to court. The archdiocese wishes for Father Moore to plead guilty, in order for publicity of the incident to be minimized. A lawyer named Erin Bruner is provided to Father Moore to negotiate a plea deal, but Father Moore insists on pleading not guilty. Bruner takes the case, believing it will elevate her to senior partner at her law firm. Father Moore agrees to let her defend him only if he is allowed to tell Emily's story. The trial begins with the calling of several medical experts by the prosecutor Ethan Thomas, and Judge Brewster presiding. One expert testifies that Emily was suffering from both epilepsy and psychosis. The defense contests that she may have actually been possessed but Bruner explains that Emily was suffering from something that neither medicine nor psychology could explain, and that Father Moore as well as her family realized this and tried to help in another way. Several flashbacks reveal the story leading up to the exorcism. Emily gets a scholarship to a university to study for a bachelor's degree in education. After days pass, strange events occur. In her dorm room one night, at 3:00 AM, Emily smells a strange burning smell from the hallway. Attempting to investigate it, she sees a door open and shut itself several times. She then sees a writing material jar move by itself. Emily sees her bed covers roll themselves down, and a great weight pins her in bed along with a force which also proceeds to choke her and seemingly to possess her momentarily. Through these episodes Emily wonders if they are true or just a hallucination. She suffers more of these visions such as people's faces demonically distorting, and being unable to eat.

GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Police telling us it will take days to process the gruesome crime scene, 26 people, 20 just mere children slaughtered inside the elementary school. Now, we spoke with Connecticut State Police Lieutenant Paul Vance. VAN SUSTEREN: Nice to see you, sir. LT. PAUL VANCE, CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE: Thank you very having us. VAN SUSTEREN: Lieutenant, you know, we've seen so many of these across the country and going back even as long as Columbine and before that. You never think it's going to happen in your own community, do you. VANCE: No, you don't. This is something that is horrific, it's tragic. These parents sent these children to school today to be educated and they never expected never to see them again. And it's just a heartbreaking tragedy that this community's enduring. VAN SUSTEREN: And you think right now -- you haven't identified all the bodies for the families, have you. VANCE: We have not. We have tentative identification. We have a process where we have to positively identify everyone, and we want certainly to do that as expeditiously as possible. We're working on that as we speak right now. We'll work right through the night. It's important for the families and we understand that. VAN SUSTEREN: But just imagine, you're home tonight and you haven't gotten the official word, but your child isn't home, so you know that your child was one of the victims. I mean, it's inevitable. I mean, imagine that pain. VANCE: It's -- it's unbelievable. I mean, it's something that no one really ever wants to bear, and it was heartbreaking to have to hear the parents being told that their children were not coming home. It was heartbreaking for the law enforcement officers to go in to rescue as many people as they did, as many staffers as they did, and then encounter what they discovered in those last two classrooms. VAN SUSTEREN: Was the situation where the killer killed everybody in one single room, so that he killed an entire class? VANCE: No, it wasn't -- it wasn't like that, and it's even difficult to talk about. But suffice to say that, you know, there were deceased in two classrooms and the hallway, and it was a horrific scene. VAN SUSTEREN: Was he known to law enforcement? Because sometimes, these people who come in here and to that, you know, their names are familiar to law enforcement. They've been around. VANCE: We're looking at that. We have a State Police command investigation under way. We've brought in major crime detectives. We've had the Newtown police detectives working with us. And we're going to answer all those questions. We're going to do an extensive background on the shooter, going back as far as we need to go. We're going to answer every question about the history and historical -- any historical events that this young man may have been involved n. We'll leave no stone unturned. VAN SUSTEREN: Has the school indicated that they know him? Had his mother ever complained about him or said anything about him that she was worried about him? VANCE: There's nothing that showed that something like this could occur. But again, our investigators will look at all of that. We'll certainly interview all the administration of the school, superintendent, friends, family, relatives, co-workers. The list is endless, and we will certainly do everything we can to answer all those questions. VAN SUSTEREN: One thing that I was sort of curious -- I didn't quite understand, maybe you can clear it up for me, is that -- that I've read or heard that the mother was found dead at her home and that she's also a teacher. So was she not teaching now or was she not -- did she call in sick? Or why wasn't she at school today, do you know? VANCE: I've got to -- I've got to say we haven't identified officially anyone yet. So I'm in a position where I can tell you we have a secondary scene with a deceased female, who we tentatively have identified. And those are questions that we have and those are questions that we have to answer. And at this point in time, we haven't answered them yet. VAN SUSTEREN: Well, can you tell me whether there was a substitute teacher in that classroom? VANCE: That I don't know. I'm sorry. I don't know. VAN SUSTEREN: And so -- and right now, medical examiners in with those children and the adults? VANCE: Yes, the medical examiner's at the scene with a team, and he has his team in place and they're going to work right through the night. They're going to do whatever they need to do, again, to identify these children for these families. VAN SUSTEREN: You know, I can't -- you know, every time I've covered these stories, you know, the police officers, the law enforcement -- I mean, they're all parents. And you know, and they go into these scenes and it's, like, you know, it's -- it's unthinkable and unspeakable. I mean, they've all got kids these -- you know, the age of these children. VANCE: Yes. It's a very difficult scene for them. The law enforcement officers that entered that building, we've provided them with counseling. We have the briefers with them. We did the same for the family. We brought in clergy. It's hard. It's very hard for law enforcement, the fire service, EMS personnel, but certainly nothing like the parents are going through. VAN SUSTEREN: No, no parent wants to send his child to school that's essentially a prison and with a lot of metal detectors and security and everything else. But I'm curious. With this school, any security? Not that I'm any way condemning them if it hasn't because it -- you know, both -- it goes both ways. VANCE: Suffice it to say that the school was secure. It was very secure. And we will certainly determine exactly how the shooter was able to gain access. VAN SUSTEREN: Secure in a sense that if I tried to get in, somebody would stop me? Is it that kind of security? You've got -- someone's got to me in? VANCE: That's correct. You could not have gotten in. VAN SUSTEREN: Thank you, sir, and good luck. I know it's tough on you, and everybody in the community, especially the families of the dead. Thank you, sir.","completion":"\\"Connecticut School Tragedy: A Heartbreaking Scene Unfolds - An Interview with Lt. Paul Vance\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The object of a sentence is the person, thing, or place that is receiving the action of the verb. In this case, the action is 'charged' and the object of the action is 'a horde of men'. To decide if the object is singular or plural, we need to check the noun 'a horde of men'. When we have a phrase like 'a horde of...', whatever comes after 'of' will determine if the overall phrase is singular or plural. Here 'men' is plural.

Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","completion":"After analyzing the given task, it appears that you have not provided any specific methods to compare. However, I will suggest several effective methods to prevent your clothes from smelling like mildew in the closet. You can evaluate these methods based on your available resources and preferences before choosing the most reasonable method that suits your needs. 1. Proper ventilation and air circulation: Ensure that your closet has proper ventilation to allow air circulation. Open closet doors or install vents, as good air flow aids in evaporating moisture before it causes mildew growth. You can also use a small fan to promote air circulation. 2. Keep clothes clean and dry before storing: Washing and completely drying your clothes before storing them in the closet can significantly reduce the risk of mildew. Damp clothes can encourage mold and mildew growth, so make sure that your clothes are completely dry before hanging or folding them into the closet. 3. Use a dehumidifier: A dehumidifier can help regulate the humidity levels in the area, thereby reducing the chances of mildew development. Portable and compact dehumidifiers are available in the market and can be placed near the closet to maintain optimal humidity. 4. Use moisture-absorbing products: There are various moisture-absorbing products available, such as silica gel packs or moisture absorber tubs, which can be placed inside the closet. These products help reduce excess moisture, thereby preventing mildew growth. 5. Regularly clean the closet: Periodically declutter and clean your closet to remove any mold spores or mildew. Wipe down the shelves, walls, and other surfaces with a vinegar-water solution (1 part white vinegar and 1 part water) or mild bleach solution. This can help prevent mildew build-up. 6. Use essential oils or natural odor absorbers: Certain essential oils, like tea tree oil and lavender oil, have natural antimicrobial properties that can help prevent mold and mildew growth. Additionally, you can place odor-absorbing materials like activated charcoal, baking soda, or coffee grounds in your closet to help neutralize any potential odors. 7. Avoid overcrowding: Do not overstuff your closet, as it can limit air circulation and trap moisture. Give your clothes enough room to breathe, which will help prevent mildew growth. 8. Periodically air out clothes: Take your clothes out of the closet occasionally and expose them to sunlight and fresh air. Sunlight and proper air circulation can help prevent mildew growth and eliminate any existing odors. In summary, several methods can help you keep your clothes from smelling like mildew. Some key factors to consider when selecting the most reasonable method include the effectiveness of the method, ease of implementation, cost, and your personal preferences. By combining multiple methods, you can effectively create an environment that inhibits the growth of mold and mildew, thus ensuring your clothes remain fresh and odor-free."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Reporter Richard Thornburg, who exposed Holly's identity to Hans Gruber in the Nakatomi Tower, is assigned a seat across the aisle from her. In the airport bar McClane spots two men in army fatigues carrying a package, one of whom has a gun. He follows them into the baggage area. After a shootout, he kills one of the men while the other escapes. Learning the dead man is a mercenary thought killed in action while originally serving with the US military, McClane relates the situation to airport police Captain Carmine Lorenzo, but Lorenzo has McClane ejected from his office. Former U.S. Army Special Forces Colonel Stuart and other members of his unit set up a base in a church near Dulles. They take over the air traffic control systems, cut off all communication to the planes and seize control of the airport. Their goal is to rescue General Ramon Esperanza, a drug lord and dictator of Val Verde, who is being extradited to the United States to stand trial on drug trafficking charges. They demand a Boeing 747 cargo plane so they can escape to another country, and warn the airport controllers not to try to restore control.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Information: - Carignan (also known as Mazuelo, Bovale Grande, Cariñena, Samsó, and Carignane) is a red Spanish/French wine grape variety that is widely planted throughout the western Mediterranean and around the globe. Along with Aramon, it was once considered one of the main grapes responsible for France's wine lake and was a substantial producer in jug wine production in California's Central Valley. - A Bordeaux wine is any wine produced in the Bordeaux region of France, centred on the city of Bordeaux and covering the whole area of the Gironde department, with a total vineyard area of over 120,000 hectares, making it the largest wine growing area in France. Average vintages produce over 700 million bottles of Bordeaux wine, ranging from large quantities of everyday table wine, to some of the most expensive and prestigious wines in the world. The vast majority of wine produced in Bordeaux is red (called \\"claret\\" in Britain), with sweet white wines (most notably Sauternes), dry whites, and (in much smaller quantities) rosé and sparkling wines (Crémant de Bordeaux) collectively making up the remainder. Bordeaux wine is made by more than 8,500 producers or \\"châteaux\\". There are 54 appellations of Bordeaux wine. - French wine is produced all throughout France, in quantities between 50 and 60 million hectolitres per year, or 78 billion bottles. France is one of the largest wine producers in the world. French wine traces its history to the 6th century BC, with many of France's regions dating their wine-making history to Roman times. The wines produced range from expensive high-end wines sold internationally to more modest wines usually only seen within France such as the Margnat wines were during the post war period. - Vitis (grapevines) is a genus of 79 accepted species of vining plants in the flowering plant family Vitaceae. The genus is made up of species predominantly from the Northern hemisphere. It is economically important as the source of grapes, both for direct consumption of the fruit and for fermentation to produce wine. The study and cultivation of grapevines is called viticulture. - A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the flowering plant genus \\"Vitis\\". - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering. - Ruby Cabernet is a red Olmo grape variety that is a cross between Cabernet Sauvignon and Carignan , it can produce wines with good colour and a pleasant cherry flavour , but is mostly blended into bulk wines . The purpose for the creation of the crossing of the grape varieties utilized to produce Ruby Cabernet was to obtain the superior quality of a Cabernet wine , and the resistance to heat of the Carignan combined in an inexpensive table wine . Even though the wine made from these grapes does not possess the distinctive flavor and the overall structure of other types of Cabernet wines , it does carry their fruitful essence . The grape for this type of red wine was developed for California 's hot climate , specially for regions such as the San Joaquin and the Napa Valleys . Ruby Cabernet has improved the quality of the bulk wines produced in these areas thanks to its natural , special acidity . - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - The Beqaa Valley (', ), also transliterated as Bekaa, Biqâ and Becaa and known in Classical antiquity as Coele-Syria, is a fertile valley in eastern Lebanon. It is Lebanon's most important farming region. Industry also flourishes in Beqaa, especially that related to agriculture. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Deciduous means \\"falling off at maturity\\" \\" or \\"tending to fall off\\", and it is typically used in order to refer to trees or shrubs that lose their leaves seasonally (most commonly during autumn) and to the shedding of other plant structures such as petals after flowering or fruit when ripe. In a more general sense, \\"deciduous\\" means \\"the dropping of a part that is no longer needed\\" or \\"falling away after its purpose is finished\\". In plants it is the result of natural processes. \\"Deciduous\\" has a similar meaning when referring to animal parts, such as deciduous antlers in deer or deciduous teeth, also known as baby teeth, in some mammals (including humans). - The wine lake refers to the continuing supply surplus of wine produced in the European Union. A major contributor to that glut is the Languedoc-Roussillon, which produces over one-third of the grapes grown in France. In 2007 it was reported that for the previous several vintages, European countries had been producing 1.7 billion more bottles of wine than they sell. Hundreds of millions of bottles of wine are turned into industrial alcohol every year, a practice that is sometimes described as \\"emergency distillation\\". - Wine (from Latin \\"vinum\\") is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. - Cabernet Sauvignon is one of the world's most widely recognized red wine grape varieties. It is grown in nearly every major wine producing country among a diverse spectrum of climates from Canada's Okanagan Valley to Lebanon's Beqaa Valley. Cabernet Sauvignon became internationally recognized through its prominence in Bordeaux wines where it is often blended with Merlot and Cabernet Franc. From France, the grape spread across Europe and to the New World where it found new homes in places like California's Santa Cruz Mountains, Napa Valley, New Zealand's Hawkes Bay, Australia's Margaret River and Coonawarra regions, and Chile's Maipo Valley and Colchagua. For most of the 20th century, it was the world's most widely planted premium red wine grape until it was surpassed by Merlot in the 1990s. - The flowering plants (angiosperms), also known as Angiospermae or Magnoliophyta, are the most diverse group of land plants, with 416 families, approx. 13,164 known genera and a total of c. 295,383 known species. Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants; they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure, in other words, a fruiting plant. The term \\"angiosperm\\" comes from the Greek composite word (\\"angeion\\", \\"case\\" or \\"casing\\", and \\"sperma\\", \\"seed\\") meaning \\"enclosed seeds\\", after the enclosed condition of the seeds. - A vine (Latin \\"vnea\\" \\"grapevine\\", \\"vineyard\\", from \\"vnum\\" \\"wine\\") in the narrowest sense is the grapevine (\\"Vitis\\"), but more generally it can refer to any plant with a growth habit of trailing or (that is, climbing) stems or runners. The word also can refer to such stems or runners themselves, for instance when used in wicker work. - \\"Jug wine\\" is a term in the United States for inexpensive table wine (or \\"bulk wine\\") typically bottled in a glass jug. - Merlot is a dark blue-colored wine grape variety, that is used as both a blending grape and for varietal wines. The name \\"Merlot\\" is thought to be a diminutive of \\"merle\\", the French name for the blackbird, probably a reference to the color of the grape. Its softness and \\"fleshiness\\", combined with its earlier ripening, makes Merlot a popular grape for blending with the sterner, later-ripening Cabernet Sauvignon, which tends to be higher in tannin. - Cabernet Franc is one of the major black grape varieties worldwide. It is principally grown for blending with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in the Bordeaux style, but can also be vinified alone, as in the Loire's Chinon. In addition to being used in blends and produced as a varietal in Canada and the United States, it is made into ice wine in those regions.

Her aunt Iris and uncle Wilbur disapprove since she has chosen to serve as a private rather than as an officer. However, family butler Parsons privately expresses his support. She goes off to training camp, where she makes friends with fellow WAAF Violet Worthing. As a favor to Violet, Prudence agrees to go on a double date one night; she is paired with Clive Briggs, a moody mysterious man with a dark secret. He seems to her rather bitter about something and is indifferent, even hostile, to her aristocratic background, but she likes him, and he asks her out again. Romance blooms. On a holiday together on the southern coast, Pru twice overhears Clive talking in his sleep. The second time, she wakes him up, but he does not want to talk about it. Then his friend Monty shows up. When the three go to dinner, Pru learns from Monty that Clive is up for a Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions during the Dunkirk evacuation. While Pru is dancing with someone else, Monty pleads with Clive to return with him. He was given a month's sick leave, but that was over two months ago, and he is about to be posted as a deserter. Finally, Clive tells Pru, indirectly, about his predicament and that he no longer wants to fight for the benefit of an English elite that oppresses and humiliates people of his class.

Write a question about the following article: At home for the first time in three weeks, the Patriots, looking to remain unbeaten, faced off against the 4-2 Redskins. After spending the first seven weeks of the season on the Physically Unable to Perform list, defensive end Richard Seymour was activated for the game, but did not start. Following a Redskins punt, in their first possession of the game, the Patriots drove 90&#160;yards over more than 7&#160;minutes, finishing the drive with a 3-yard Brady rushing touchdown, continuing a season-long opening drive scoring streak. The teams exchanged punts into the second quarter, before a 67-yard Patriots drive was capped off with a 2-yard touchdown reception by Vrabel, his second for the season and the tenth of his career (including playoffs). On the Redskins' ensuing possession, Warren recovered a Vrabel strip-sack of Jason Campbell at the Redskins' 21-yard line, setting up a 36-yard Gostkowski field goal. The Redskins turned the ball over again on their next possession on a Samuel interception, only to regain it on the next play after Brady was strip-sacked by Phillip Daniels at the Patriots' 40-yard line. The string of turnovers continued as the Redskins drove 20&#160;yards before another Vrabel strip-sack of Campbell was again recovered by Warren. With less than 2&#160;minutes remaining in the first half, the Patriots drove 73&#160;yards, and on a fake spike play from the Redskins' 6-yard line, increased their lead to 24-0 on a touchdown catch by Moss from Brady. That touchdown pass was Brady's 29th of the season, eclipsing his career high set in 2004 and 2002, but with it only being week 8, accomplished this in only playing through the first eight of 16 games. On the opening drive of the second half, an 85-yard Patriots drive ended in another Brady touchdown run, this one from 2&#160;yards out. The Redskins committed their fourth turnover of the game on their next possession, as Vrabel strip-sacked Campbell for the third time in the game; this time Colvin recovered the fumble and returned it 11&#160;yards for a touchdown to increase the Patriots' lead to 38-0. The Redskins managed to reach the Patriots' 13-yard line on their next drive, but on fourth down, the Redskins could not convert and turned the ball over again. The Patriots began their next drive where they left off, going 88&#160;yards on a 14-play drive that spanned into the fourth quarter. It was finished on a 2-yard touchdown reception by Welker that grew the Patriots lead to 45-0. Following a Redskins punt, on the Patriots' next series, Cassel replaced Brady. A 21-yard pass from Cassel to Gaffney gave the Patriots their 33rd first down of the game, a new single-game franchise record. Two plays later, Cassel ran it in for a touchdown from 15&#160;yards out, and the first rushing touchdown of his career, increasing the Patriots' lead to 52-0; the touchdown was the longest rushing touchdown by a Patriots quarterback in more than 20 years. The Redskins then drove 63&#160;yards and scored their only points of the game on a 15-yard Chris Cooley touchdown reception. Third-string quarterback Matt Gutierrez replaced Cassel on the next possession, a three-and-out. The Redskins then punted back to the Patriots to end the game. The Patriots' 52-7 win gave them an 8-0 record heading into a Week 9 matchup against the 7-0 Colts. It also made Brady only the second quarterback to defeat the other 31 teams at least once; the Colts' Peyton Manning was the first to accomplish the feat, having done so earlier that day.

Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it.

In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system.

Unfortunately, however, his writing is often a vehicle for a philosophy of neo-anarchist romanticism and anti-intellectualism.

Intellectuals and government are seen as the source of all the problems in the world, and we are told that action guided by moral purpose is all that is needed. We are supposed to learn how to live from the superior wisdom of dogs.

Q: A prospective client sent me a link to this in-depth article on IBM's design thinking revolution, where Phil Gilbert, IBM's General Manager of Design, has hired over 1000 designers into the firm, and pushed for over 8000 of its managers and staff to get 'trained' in design thinking. They have even created specific design centres across the firm, with design offices in most of its key locations, such as the one above. The goal is nothing short of beginning IBM's next phase of transformation, one of many in its 100+ year history. However, all is not rosy. Despite achieving a monumental success relative to the status quo, 8000 'recognised' design thinkers in a corporation of over 370,000 souls is barely a dent in terms of changing practice. If NoTosh were to effect change in only 2% of the teachers with whom we work, we'd have packed up our bags long ago. I'm not sure hiring 1000 designers in and of itself is the answer to any organisation trying to instil a different way of viewing the world. Here's why. Since design thinking really began to be a thing, back in the early 60s, the designer him or herself has consistently been at the centre of the design process. Even though we talk of 'user-centred design', the actual ideation and production of a solution, and in many cases the synthesis and definition of the problem to be solve, too, are all tasks undertaken by skilled 'designers', rather than the people in the organisation who have the scope, brand, or 'permission' to play in that space. Once the designers leave the project, so does the design thinking. There is a reason d.school sees its executive courses filled with repeat customers and firms like IDEO continue to thrive - they are resolving challenges in specific examples of services or products, but not necessarily transforming the firms and organisations who had the budget and desire to solve a problem in that specific area. Solving a problem costs money. Solving a problem and teaching the client how to do it again and again costs more than just money.... Question: Why did IMB hire so many designers? === The answer to the above question is The answer is:","completion":"IBM hired so many designers as a part of their design thinking revolution, led by Phil Gilbert, IBM's General Manager of Design. The goal of this initiative was to transform the company and adapt to the rapidly changing business environment by incorporating design thinking principles into its core business practices. There were several key reasons behind hiring such a large number of designers: 1. Infusing design thinking into the organization: IBM wanted to ensure that design thinking became an integral part of the company's culture. By bringing in designers from diverse backgrounds, they aimed to foster a creative, user-centered mindset among the workforce. 2. Enhancing product and service development: Designers play a crucial role in shaping products and services that cater to the needs of users. Having a large pool of designers allowed IBM to work on multiple projects simultaneously, ensuring that each product or service met user requirements and provided superior experience. 3. Accelerating innovation: The presence of a large number of designers enabled IBM to generate new ideas quickly, iterate on them, and bring innovative solutions to the market faster. Designers have significantly contributed to the company's innovation pipeline. 4. Strengthening collaboration and cross-functional teams: Designers at IBM work closely with other departments like engineering, marketing, and sales, promoting a collaborative environment and more effective communication. This increased collaboration has been key to the development of innovative solutions that address complex business problems. 5. Staff training and upskilling: With over 1,000 designers on board, IBM provided design thinking training to over 8,000 of its managers and staff. Although this number represents a small portion of the entire workforce, it demonstrates IBM's commitment to invest in employee development and create a more design-driven organization. In summary, IBM hired a significant number of designers to instill a design thinking mindset within the company, improve product and service offerings, accelerate innovation, boost collaboration, and train its workforce in design thinking principles. This approach aimed to transform IBM and better position it for the future in a competitive business landscape."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

I like to tell stories about people who work together. What is even better is when countries help each other and build a good friendship. An excellent example of this happened when Britain and China worked together to bring the Milu deer back to China. Milu deer, a kind of animal with large horns , used to be common in China long ago. Like other deer they lived together and ate grass and the soft parts of trees. Milu deer were often killed for food or sport. The Ming and Qing dynasties did not protect them and many were killed. That is how the Milu deer disappeared from China. Luckily before all of them were killed, some were taken to Britain to improve the environment of the beautiful park which belonged to the Duke of Bedford. He liked them so much that he took them from China to Britain. Milu deer liked the cool, wet weather in England and their number increased year by year. As a result, when in 1985 the government of China wanted to bring back the Milu deer, the Duke of Bedford was able to help. The first deer came back to China to the Nanhaizi Milu Park 20 kilometers south of Beijing and the centre in Dafeng, Jiangsu province. The deer certainly seem happy to be back in China because their number has grown quickly. There are now so many of them that a new park has been opened for them in Hubei Province. At the moment the Milu deer live in centres where they are being well protected and cared for.

Known as one of the Philadelphia Phillies' greatest pitchers, Roberts left an indelible mark on the sport as he led the Whiz Kids, a group of young and talented players, to win the 1950 National League Pennant. This incredible achievement set the stage for a golden era in the Phillies' history, and Roberts' inspiring leadership is still remembered fondly by fans and colleagues alike. Early Life and Career: Born Robin Evan Roberts on September 30, 1926, in Springfield, Illinois, he spent his early years honing his skills in both basketball and baseball as a multi-sport athlete. Following a short stint at Michigan State University, Roberts was signed by the Philadelphia Phillies in 1948 and made his Major League debut the following year. His impressive fastball and tireless work ethic quickly established him as the team's ace pitcher. During the 1950 MLB season, Roberts helped secure the Phillies' first National League Pennant in 35 years, earning the nickname of \\"Whiz Kids.\\" This success was not only a testament to Roberts' exceptional skill but also his innate leadership qualities, which won him the admiration and respect of his teammates. Leading the Whiz Kids: The 1950 Phillies' team predominantly consisted of young, inexperienced players, collectively known as the Whiz Kids. Their average age was just 26, and they seemed unlikely to win a championship. However, Robin Roberts' unwavering commitment to excellence propelled the team forward. As the team's star pitcher, Roberts had an incredible season in 1950. He secured 20 wins, a feat he would achieve in six consecutive seasons. His exceptional performances on the mound and leadership off the field enabled the Whiz Kids to defy the odds and clinch the National League Pennant in a tense, winner-take-all game against the Brooklyn Dodgers. Roberts' Resilience and Rewards: Robin Roberts' claim to fame did not come without challenges. In 1950, he suffered a near-fatal accident when a line drive fractured his skull. Incredibly, after just three weeks of recovery, he returned to pitch and played an instrumental role in winning the pennant. Throughout his career, Roberts was consistently recognized for his achievements on the field. He was selected to seven All-Star games, becoming the first National League pitcher to start five of the games. In 1962, Roberts became the first Phillies' pitcher to receive an honorary plaque in the team's Wall of Fame, a testament to his lasting legacy in the hearts of Philadelphia baseball fans. Later Years and Legacy: Roberts played a total of 19 seasons in Major League Baseball, with stints on the Baltimore Orioles, Houston Astros, and Chicago Cubs. He retired from professional baseball in 1966 with 286 career wins, a total of 45 shutouts, and an astonishing 2,357 strikeouts under his belt. In retirement, Roberts turned his attention to coaching and administration. He served as a front-office executive for various teams, including the Reading Phillies, and coached at the University of South Florida. His profound knowledge of the game allowed him to cultivate future generations of baseball players. Robin Roberts’ life was a testament to the enduring power of hard work, dedication, and determination. He led a group of young, inexperienced players to achieve baseball greatness, establishing a lasting legacy that remains woven into the fabric of Philadelphia Phillies' history. His story is a reminder that with passion and perseverance, seemingly insurmountable odds can be overcome, and true success can be achieved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mary has been experiencing some health issues lately. Which person has a stronger immune system? Hint: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease.

These are virtually still images revealing the key elements of the film: Justine (Kirsten Dunst) the bride in deep melancholy with birds falling behind her; of a lawn with trees and a sundial with two different shadows; Pieter Breughel's Hunters in the Snow (often used as interpretation of an idealised nostalgia) the non existent 19th hole (limbo) and the Black Horse collapsing catastrophically in slow motion (id/ego battle); Justine as a bride being swept along by a river; and her being held back by her wedding dress; and finally Justine and her nephew building their magic cave before the earth crashes into Melancholia becoming one.

These metaphors are developed during the night of the wedding reception. Her brother-in-law, John, represents sacrifice (cost of the wedding) and social conformity. Her dad is hedonistic and selfish therefore unable to connect at a meaningful level with Justine. Her mother ,Gaby (honesty) is brutally; ruthlessly and pathologically honest which gets her thrown out of the wedding.

Choose the area where you will be planting. Test the soil. Article:","completion":"Title: The Ultimate Guide to Growing Grapes: From Selection to Harvest Introduction Growing grapes can be an enjoyable and rewarding endeavor, whether you're looking to start your own vineyard or simply cultivate grapes for personal use. However, to ensure the best possible outcome, it is essential to understand the ins and outs of grape cultivation. In this article, we will provide a step-by-step guide on how to grow grapes, from selecting the appropriate grape variety to testing the soil before planting. Step 1: Establishing the Purpose of Your Vineyard The first step in growing grapes is determining the purpose of your vineyard. Are you looking to produce wine, raisins, or fresh table grapes? The end goal will determine which grape varieties to consider, as well as the cultivation techniques, grapevine maintenance, and harvesting practices. Step 2: Studying Your Local Climate Before you can begin growing grapes, it is vital to understand your local climate, as grapes are sensitive to temperature variations and rainfall levels. Consult local agricultural agencies or extension offices for information on the ideal growing conditions for different grape varieties in your region. This will provide a solid foundation for your decision-making process when choosing a grape variety. Step 3: Selecting a Grape Variety Once you have determined the purpose of your vineyard and studied your local climate, it is time to select a grape variety. Grape varieties are classified into three categories: table grape varieties, which are most commonly consumed fresh; wine grape varieties, which are specifically cultivated for wine production; and raisin grape varieties, intended for drying. Selecting a grape variety that aligns with the purpose of your vineyard and your local climate is essential for the success of your grape-growing endeavor. Step 4: Considering Grafted Vines Grafted vines are created by attaching a desired grape variety to a rootstock, which is a separate plant chosen for its root system compatibility and ability to combat soil-borne pests and diseases. Grafted vines can be an excellent choice for beginners or those looking to expedite their grape production process, as they generally have shorter establishment times and require less pruning. Consult with local vineyard experts to determine if grafted vines are an ideal option for your location and desired grape variety. Step 5: Choosing the Planting Area Selecting the right area to plant your grapevines is of utmost importance. Grapes require ample sunlight and well-drained, fertile soil. In addition, the planting area should have a slight slope to prevent soil erosion and promote air circulation. Make sure to choose an area that provides adequate space for your desired vine density, as overcrowding can lead to disease and poor grape production. Step 6: Testing the Soil The final step before planting your grapevines is testing the soil to ensure it is suitable for grape cultivation. Grapes prefer soil with a pH level between 5.5 and 6.5, and soil testing can reveal potential deficiencies or issues that may need to be addressed prior to planting. Consult with local agricultural agencies or extension offices for information on soil testing laboratories and services in your area. Conclusion Grape cultivation can be a highly rewarding experience, providing both a sense of personal accomplishment and, in time, a bountiful harvest. By following these steps and critically assessing each aspect of the grape-growing process, you will be well on your way to establishing a thriving vineyard that can be enjoyed for generations to come."},{"prompt":"Q: Because several genes, each with more than one allele, contribute to determining height in humans, height is considered what kind of trait?

For example, if you always pick up the check, put it in the \\"to don't\\" list. Ask your friend to pick it up next time. Organizing information in list form and checking it off hits our information processing sweet spot. This list will be easy to follow and satisfying to fulfill. If the thought of confronting high-pressure situations makes you sick, start small. You may not be able to stand up to your bully right away, but you can make little changes to build your assertiveness. If you ordered a salad but received a soup, send it back. Once you start getting comfortable with asserting yourself in small situations like this, start building up to bigger ones. If you expect you are going to fail, you have already accepted failure. Base your expectations on what you would love to see happen, not what bad thing you are expecting to happen. If you have done all you can to correct the situation, get out of it. Try to remove yourself as much as possible from the person who is trying to take advantage of you. Life is too short for you to put up with someone who disrespects you. Make the brave choice and remove this person from your life. Keeping them in your life will do nothing but maintain the negativity and you will find it harder to grow confident. Summary:","completion":"It's important to know what you want and don't want to do to feel confident. Make a list of things you don't want to do, like always paying the bill. Start by being assertive in small situations, like fixing a wrong food order. Don't expect to fail, and focus on what you want to happen. Stay away from people who don't respect you, and make choices that help you feel more confident."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Fossett had one of his team members develop a more advanced balloon autopilot that would allow him to sleep and do other tasks while flying safely. Steve Fossett attempted the hot-air balloon trip around the world six times. This was not easy to do. He flew in the balloon'scapsule that was too small to stand upright. During his fourth attempt in 1998, he was almost killed during a storm off the coast of Australia. He fell 9,000 meters into the Coral Sea with his balloon's capsule on fire. He was later rescued at sea. Fossett successfully made the trip in 2002. The trip started and ended in Australia. He traveled more than 33,000 kilometers for more than 14 days. On this flight, Fossett set other records including a speed record of 322 kilometers per hour. One main problem with earlier balloon flights was the threat of dangerous storms.

A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest at this temperature. When the temperature is higher, the pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the temperature to kill them. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells. In these ways, a fever helps the body fight infection. James is sick with strep throat, a bacterial infection. After a few days of feeling terrible his brother comes by to check his temperature noting that it is 100.6°F. Given a person is recovering from a fever, will their body temperature be increasing or decreasing? Answer:","completion":"Given that a person is recovering from a fever, their body temperature will be decreasing. In James's case, his fever of 100.6°F is higher than the normal body temperature of 98.6°F (37°C). As his body continues to fight the bacterial infection and he begins to recover, his body temperature will gradually decrease back towards the normal range, indicating that his immune system is managing the infection."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For more information visit http://www.terrapinn.com/conference/stem-cells-and-regenerative-medicine-congress/index.stm. About the Arcelis® Technology Platform Arcelis® is a fully personalized immunotherapy technology that captures mutated and variant antigens that are specific to each patient's disease. It is designed to overcome immunosuppression by producing a durable memory T-cell response without adjuvants that may be associated with toxicity. The technology is potentially applicable to a wide range of different cancers, and is designed to overcome many of the manufacturing and commercialization challenges that have impeded other personalized cancer immunotherapies. The Arcelis® process uses only a small tumor or blood sample and the patient's own dendritic cells, which are optimized from cells collected by a single leukapheresis procedure. The proprietary process uses RNA isolated from the patient's disease sample to program dendritic cells to target disease specific antigens. The activated, antigen-loaded dendritic cells are then formulated into the patient's plasma and administered via intradermal injection. Argos Therapeutics is an immuno-oncology company focused on the development and commercialization of fully personalized immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer using its Arcelis® technology platform. Argos' most advanced product candidate, AGS-003, is being evaluated in the pivotal ADAPT phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).

Write an article that answers the following question: How many years was the longest term length of Parliament?","completion":"Title: The Longest Term Length of Parliament: The Indefatigable Stuart Era Introduction The length of a parliamentary term varies significantly between different periods, political systems, and countries. Generally, a term of parliament measures the time taken from the initial seating of a parliamentary assembly after an election to the point when the assembly is dissolved, paving the way for new elections. In this article, we will delve into the history of parliamentary systems to examine the record length of the longest term parliament and the unique circumstances that contributed to this unusually prolonged duration. The Longest Term Length of Parliament The record for the longest term length of a parliament in history goes to the English Parliament during the Stuart era, under the reign of King Charles I. This parliamentary term, which later came to be known as the \\"Long Parliament,\\" lasted for an astounding 20 years, from November 3, 1640, until April 20, 1660. Historical Context The Long Parliament's lengthy tenure can be traced back to the complex political, religious, and social factors prevalent in 17th-century England. It was a time marked by tensions between the monarchy, the aristocracy, and the emerging bourgeoisie, as well as the struggle between Catholicism and Protestantism that permeated European society. King Charles I ascended the English throne in 1625 and immediately attempted to rule without the need for Parliament. This deeply unpopular move led to several conflicts, including the Bishops' Wars (1639-1640), which ultimately forced the King to recall Parliament in 1640. However, the newly-elected Parliament, consisting mostly of Puritans and Calvinists, would go on to challenge Charles' authority and resist his autocratic tendencies. Main Events during the Long Parliament 1. Reform Agenda: The Long Parliament immediately embarked upon a reform agenda, seeking to curtail the power of the monarchy. The Parliament successfully abolished the widely despised Court of Star Chamber and the Court of High Commission. Additionally, Charles I was compelled to dissolve the Council of Wales and the North, further consolidating parliamentary authority. 2. Grand Remonstrance: Dissatisfied with Charles I's continued interference in religious and political matters, Parliament drafted the Grand Remonstrance, a comprehensive list of grievances against the King's policies. The conflict boiled over when Charles tried to arrest five members of Parliament in 1642, marking the beginning of the English Civil War. 3. English Civil War: This brutal conflict spanned from 1642 to 1649, with the war fought between Parliamentary forces led by Oliver Cromwell and the Royalist supporters of King Charles I. The battles culminated in a victory for the Parliamentary forces, and Charles was ultimately executed in 1649. 4. The Interregnum and the Commonwealth: After the execution of Charles I, England experimented briefly with the establishment of a republic, known as the Commonwealth of England, with Cromwell as its Lord Protector. In the years that followed, the Long Parliament would establish its own interim administration and continued exercising its legislative and executive power. 5. The Restoration: With Cromwell's death in 1658 and the subsequent collapse of the Protectorate, the political landscape changed drastically. The return of the monarchy became imminent, and in 1660, General George Monck facilitated the restoration of the Stuart monarchy under Charles II. This marked the end of the Long Parliament and the beginning of the Convention Parliament, thereby concluding the two-decade-long parliamentary term. Conclusion The record-breaking 20-year term length of the Long Parliament not only stands as an unusual historical anomaly but also serves as a testament to the dramatic and tumultuous era it was a part of. The sheer longevity of this Parliament was marked by Civil War, the rise and fall of the Commonwealth, and the Restoration of the Monarchy. The Long Parliament was instrumental in shaping England's political trajectory, with its legacy effusing social, political, and religious facets of British history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

Choices: + yes + it is not possible to tell + no","completion":"Yes, the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true. Let's analyze both sentences to understand why: Sentence 1: Greider suggests we could replay the terrible conflicts of the twentieth century. In this sentence, Greider is mentioned as making a suggestion. The suggestion is about the possibility of replaying the terrible conflicts of the twentieth century. We don't know the context or reasoning behind Greider's suggestion, but the statement confirms that Greider has indeed made this suggestion. Sentence 2: One suggestion was to replay conflicts of the twentieth century. This sentence speaks about a suggestion that was made, and the suggestion is to replay conflicts of the twentieth century. The sentence does not mention Greider or any other individual, but the suggestion made is essentially the same as the one mentioned in Sentence 1. Based on the analysis of both sentences, we can see a parallelism between the content of the suggestions. If Sentence 1, which says that Greider made a particular suggestion, is true, then it logically follows that Sentence 2, which states that a suggestion was made (without specifying by whom), must also be true.

Katrina uses a delicious sauce.. II. Megan uses a delicious sauce..","completion":"I. Katrina uses a delicious sauce. As the tantalizing aroma of the slowly cooking ribs wafts through the air, it becomes abundantly clear that the key to the vastly superior taste of Katrina's ribs lies in her delicious sauce. With every bite, a burst of flavors takes over, making it an unforgettable culinary experience for anyone fortunate enough to taste it. Katrina's sauce is a delectable concoction, honed to perfection after years of experimentation and adjustments. It all starts with her selection of the finest, freshest ingredients, each meticulously chosen to complement and build upon the flavor profile of the dish. Her sauce features a mix of tangy, sweet, and spicy elements crafted from a delightful blend of ketchup, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, apple cider vinegar, and her secret mix of spices. This exquisite combination creates an impeccable balance that heightens the already appetizing taste of the ribs themselves. From working with several experts in the culinary world, Katrina has spent countless hours perfecting her recipe and refining her cooking techniques. By utilizing slow cooking methods, she ensures that her ribs are tender and juicy, allowing them to absorb the delectable sauce thoroughly. As a result, the ribs take on a unique, mouth-watering flavor that accentuates the succulence of the meat and the pleasantly smoky notes from the barbecue. Moreover, Katrina understands that achieving consistent quality requires systematic excellence. Each step of the cooking process – from selecting the ribs, seasoning them, and cooking them to the precise moment of doneness – is carried out with a focus on detail and unwavering dedication to the craft. Katrina's expertise in cooking techniques doesn't end there. Her attention to detail is showcased by her mastery of the art of basting. She pays close attention to the heat of the grill, ensuring that the ribs never char and are cooked evenly. Applying her sauce at optimal intervals is also one of her secrets. This allows it to caramelize on the ribs, enveloping them in a rich, glossy finish that adds an irresistible aroma and a slightly sticky texture. On the other hand, Megan's ribs, while not unpalatable in their own right, fall short when compared to Katrina's culinary masterpieces. Megan's ribs, although tender, lack the depth of flavor and the exquisite balance that is present in Katrina's sauce. Additionally, Megan's sauce, while still appetizing, seems somewhat one-dimensional and fails to provide that same burst of tangy, sweet, and spicy delight. In conclusion, the succulent, flavorful ribs, coupled with her delicious sauce, make Katrina's cooking a clear winner over Megan's. With her unique blend of ingredients, attention to detail, and mastery of cooking techniques, Katrina elevates the humble barbecue to an unforgettable taste sensation that keeps people eagerly coming back for more."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The answer to the question: What was the full name of the person who married and left the state altogether in 1876? is inside the article: The search for a singer-actress to play Carmen began in the summer of 1873. Press speculation favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach's operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to Célestine Galli-Marié, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Marié, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.The leading tenor part of Don José was given to Paul Lhérie, a rising star of the Opéra-Comique who had recently appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of Les pêcheurs de perles. Jacques Bouhy, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as Méphistophélès in Gounod's Faust and as Mozart's Figaro. Marguerite Chapuy, who sang Micaëla, was at the beginning of a short career in which she was briefly a star at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; the impresario James H. Mapleson thought her \\"one of the most charming vocalists it has been my pleasure to know\\".

(Photo: Brennan Linsley/AP ) Vice President Biden wrapped up a Week of Action campaign on Friday, part of Sexual Assault Awareness Month, at the University of Colorado in front of a packed audience, where he spoke about the need for each student to help change the culture of sexual assault. The campaign is part of the White House’s It’s On Us initiative, launched in 2014, which urges students to make a “personal commitment to help keep women and men safe from sexual assault,” and which provides tools to help empower and equip students and administrations to both better understand and tackle the issue. Biden asked the crowd to raise their right hands and repeat the It’s On Us pledge, what the organization says is a “personal commitment to help keep women and men safe from sexual assault.” “I pledge to recognize that non-consensual sex is sexual assault. To identify situations in which sexual assault may occur. To intervene in situations where consent has not or cannot be given. To create an environment in which sexual assault is unacceptable and survivors are supported.” Throughout his speech, Biden called on college administrators to help make their campuses safe, and focused on the need to hear from the victims themselves. “Every time you talk about it, it comes back. It comes back. It takes courage (to speak up), but they’re all saving lives,” Biden said. “Think about how many voices are on this campus that you haven’t heard but you know are there, crying silently.” Vice President Joe Biden kisses University of Colorado sophomore Emma Beach after seeing her crying after speaking about sexual violence on campus as part of the “It’s On Us” campaign April 8, 2016, at the University of Colorado campus in Boulder, Colo.

Article: A Spanish doctor has shrugged off widespread national criticism and given birth to a healthy child at age 62. Lina Alvarez’s daughter, who she has christened with the same first name, was delivered two weeks ahead of schedule by Caeserean section. The mother-of-three, from Lugo in north-west Spain, began the menopause 20 years ago but underwent fertility treatment to have more babies. Her pregnancy ignited a heated debate in her native country over calls to potentially cap the age limit for IVF treatment. Lina Alvarez was told she had only a five per cent chance of giving birth to a healthy baby La Página A series of gynecologists also said a successful pregnancy would be nigh on impossible and refused to help her. Her healthy daughter weighed 5.2lbs. “I’m the happiest person on the planet, everything went perfectly,” she said. “When she is 30, I’ll be 90. She’ll have been raised and life expectancy for women is growing all the time. “I always wanted to be a mother again but most medical experts said ‘no’. “I feel like I’m having a second chance and the pregnancy has made me younger and stronger.” Her eldest son, 28-year-old Exiquio, is disabled after a gynaecologist damaged his head during a routine test while she was pregnant. Ms Alvarez had her second child, Sam, at the age of 52 after her IVF treatment. He said: “My emotions have got the better of me and I’ve been crying a lot out of happiness.” The world’s oldest person to give birth is thought to be Daljinder Kaur, from India, who believes she is around 70 years old, and who had her first child earlier this year. ||||| A Spanish woman said she felt \\"phenomenal\\" after giving birth at the age of 62. Lina Alvarez posed with her week-old daughter as she left the hospital in the Galician city of Lugo after her Caesarian section. \\"I couldn't feel happier\\", the doctor said tearfully on the steps of Lucas Augusti Hospital. Ms Alvarez, whose daughter shares her name, sparked debate in her home nation by announcing last month she was eight months pregnant with her third child. The new arrival was born two weeks ahead of schedule last Monday weighing 5.2lbs after her mother was admitted for observation when she began to suffer high blood pressure. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A 62-year-old Spanish doctor named Lina Alvarez gave birth to a healthy baby girl, also named Lina. She had the baby two weeks earlier than expected by Caesarean section.

Article:","completion":"Title: Adoption Turns into Marriage for Longtime Couple in Pennsylvania Norman MacArthur and Bill Novak have spent the past 15 years as father and son, legally speaking. However, after a recent development, they'll spend the rest of their years as a married couple. After more than 50 years together, the couple got married in Pennsylvania on Sunday, according to Yahoo! Parenting. Before the ceremony, the men expressed their excitement to Patch.com, stating they were \\"ecstatic beyond belief.\\" The journey to this point, however, was far from traditional. In 2000, Novak adopted MacArthur after they moved from New York to Pennsylvania and realized their legal partnership would not be recognized in their new state. \\"The only legal avenue we had in order to be afforded any rights was adoption,\\" MacArthur explained. A lawyer referred to this \\"creative\\" strategy as \\"entirely understandable\\" and said, \\"It reflects people's deep need to protect each other as family.\\" At the time, the couple had no other choice, and this approach was considered their best option. This predicament changed this month, when a court agreed to dissolve the adoption so that MacArthur and Novak could marry. MacArthur shared his reaction with the Associated Press, saying, \\"The courtroom burst into applause. I burst into tears. They were certainly happy tears. After months of investigating ways that we could do this and finally having the decision coming down in our favor, I'm still walking 3 feet above the ground.\\" This groundbreaking case of an adoption-turned-marriage in Pennsylvania removes a significant barrier for others who may find themselves in a similar situation as MacArthur and Novak. The couple's attorney mentioned he is already representing another pair hoping to vacate their adoption in order to get married. In conclusion, the adoption-turned-marriage of Norman MacArthur and Bill Novak demonstrates how times have changed, and how the love and commitment between two individuals can eventually triumph even in the face of challenging circumstances. This case has set a precedent in Pennsylvania and may open the door for others who wish to follow in MacArthur and Novak's footsteps."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Buying pianos: a grand idea for an investment The biggest blue-chip name is Steinway – but a brand new grand can cost as much as £100,000 and loses value as soon as it leaves the showroom. The investment market focuses on the second-hand pieces, where examples of a Steinway grand typically start at about £10,000 and go up in price depending on the condition and the model. There are numerous other great makers, including the 'three Bs’ of Blüthner, Bechstein and Bösendorfer, as well as the early Steinway family offshoot Grotrian-Steinweg, plus the modern piano-maker Fazioli, that also attract investors who want a quality name but do not want to buy new. Although prices can start at under £1,000, cheaper pianos may be in need of expensive restoration. But from £2,000 upwards there is no reason why a piano with a good label cannot be purchased that will at least hold its value over time. Over the past decade, the prices of the most collectable grand pianos have doubled, thanks to an increase in demand – much of it coming from international musicians, particularly those in China. Grand pianos are the most collectable because they are the most rare and tend to offer superior acoustics – but, at 9ft in length, may not fit in your home. The so-called parlour or boudoir grand, which is typically between 5ft and 7ft long, may be more practical. However, a baby grand that is less than 5ft may not be such a shrewd investment. Reason says: “The so-called baby grand might compromise on sound. If you do not have the space or budget for a full-size grand then consider a top-quality upright piano. An upright with an overstrung iron frame can also provide better acoustics than a baby grand piano, as the strings in this instrument tend to be of greater length.” Piano Auctions holds four sales a year, with the next being on April 11 at the Conway Hall in Holborn, London. Among the top pieces being offered is a restored 9ft Steinway concert grand from the Twenties, finished in rosewood, with an estimate of £55,000. In a sale held last December, another 9ft Steinway grand made in 1925 cased in mahogany sold for £16,500. In the same sale a 1950 Steinway upright in mahogany sold for £3,400 – less than half the £7,000 estimate. Reason says: “Big price differences are due to a lot of factors – it is far more than just about the make and model. Many believe the Twenties were a heyday for piano-makers but, over time, unless the instrument has been well looked after, the piano can easily have fallen into disrepair.” In the December sale, a 9ft 2in concert grand made by Fazioli in 2007 went for £34,000, while a 6ft 3in Blüthner, also made in 2007, sold for £11,500. At the bargain end, a late-19th-century Bechstein upright valued at £1,500 sold for £200. Simon Hablin, a technician at piano restoration specialist Courtney Pianos in Oxford, says: “Condition is key. But before you throw out your old piano because it sounds out of tune, check with a specialist – not being a well-known name does not mean it can’t be valuable. It is vital for both buyers and sellers to get expert independent valuations.” Hablin explains that the passage of time – and central heating – can warp the wood and metal of many pianos. He says a basic restoration of the actions, hammers and re-felting might cost £1,500, so it can be cheaper to buy a piano with pedigree rather than fixing a relatively worthless old model. “If you want to keep a strong value you should treat it like a classic car and try to get it restored to its former glory. But an old Victorian piano can also be in better shape than a badly made modern instrument – in 100 years, the design of the piano has hardly changed,” he says. Hablin explains that the piano should be treated as an attractive piece of furniture as well as a musical instrument. The cost of a complete French polish restoration might add £2,000 to the bill, but this cost should be more than recouped in the investment appeal it can bring. Special commissioned “art case” or Art Deco pianos are particularly sought after by piano investors, with unique craftsmanship commanding a premium. “A popular modern piano is the Yamaha, but it is important to realise some cheaper models are often put together with synthetic glues and made of veneer rather than solid wood – they can be great-value instruments but cannot be renovated the same way,” adds Hablin. He warns against electronic pianos as an investment, as instruments that might have cost £2,000 new can soon plummet in value when they are overtaken by later innovations. The pianoforte - meaning “soft-loud” – was invented in 1709 by the Italian Bartolomeo Cristofori after he tinkered with a harpsichord to give it hammer volume control. Only three examples of a Cristofori survive today and these are now priceless artefacts. In the Twenties and Thirties many households had a stand-up piano as the centre of family singalongs. The piano hit its lowest note in the Sixties when many thousands were destroyed during “piano-smashing” charity events. In more recent years, the survivors have had to fight it out with modern quality pianos made by the likes of Yamaha that can provide great acoustics for reasonable prices – as well as the hi-tech electronic versions. The Yamaha is a favourite among piano teachers for its consistent good quality, and if looked after should maintain its value. Decent U1 and U3 uprights can be picked up for less than £2,000 – though you can pay more for reconditioned models. A professional piano tuner should be used to check out any potential purchase to save you from making a big mistake at auction or in a private sale. It is also good to involve the family when making any purchase. Aesthetics are important, but if you want children to enjoy the piano, let them join in the shopping. Buying a classic piano should be a fun and rewarding experience. You need to consider the cost of looking after the instrument, too. The piano should be tuned once every six months and this costs at least £50. Central heating can do permanent damage to piano wood so be wary of keeping the investment too close to a radiator, or in a room with under-floor heating. Although a piano should benefit from use – providing joy to musicians and listeners – there is no reason why it should not be seen as a beautiful piece of furniture that might appreciate in value. Provenance can also play a role in the value of a piano – especially if someone famous once owned it. Unfortunately, even the finest heritage is unlikely to improve the skills of a pianist – though the quality of the note may sound better. You will still have to keep taking those piano lessons. Five famous pianos that have soared in value A 1970 Steinway 'Model Z’ upright used by John Lennon to compose Imagine in 1971 was sold at auction for £1.67 million – £1.45 million plus commission – to George Michael in October 2000. The former Beatle also recorded the single on this piano. A piano used by the actor Dooley Wilson as Sam in the 1942 movie Casablanca sold for £370,000 at a Sotheby’s auction in December 2012. Humphrey Bogart – who played Rick – actually said: 'Play it, Sam’, referring to As Time Goes By, and not: 'Play it again, Sam.’ The piano was a Warner Brothers prop with 58 keys – 30 less than on a conventional instrument. A piano used by Paul McCartney for the first rendition of Yesterday sold for £150,000 in April 2011. The 1926 green Eavestaff mini-piano was owned by a friend, the singer Alma Cogan. The Beatle had dreamt of the melody the previous night while in bed and went round to her house in 1964, fearing it might have been an existing melody. A white 1910 “A-Day Birdcage” upright, used by Elton John in the early Seventies to compose in collaboration with Bernie Taupin, sold at auction for £91,000 in 2004. He used it to play classic pieces such as Your Song.

A brand called Steinway is really popular, but brand new pianos can be very pricey. Instead, people look at second-hand pianos that are a bit cheaper. Over the years, the prices of some old grand pianos have gone up a lot because people really want them. These grand pianos look and sound really nice, but they are very big, so they might not fit in someone's house. When you want to buy a piano, it is important to check if it is in good condition. Sometimes old pianos can be worth fixing up if they have a good brand name, but other times it is better to buy a newer one instead. A piano can be a great piece of furniture as well as a musical instrument, and taking good care of it can help it keep its value."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A cry broke through soon after. Then silence. Char stood over a pile of black fur and red blood. He held a curved sword, jagged half way down the wide blade and hilted in bone. He held a large thick bow in the other. Lorfel and Ranur stood behind him, panting. Lorfel, a short man of twenty six held a large axe in both hands and still prepared to swing it hard. Ranur, the largest of the three held a pike in one hand, its tip hanging low towards the ground. He buried his other hand in his gray tunic. \\"Did it get either of you?\\" Char's voice rasped low in the silence of the night. \\"No\\" Lorfel said. He planted his axe head on the ground with a thud and leaned on the tall handle. There was a pause.

At 9:48, a representative from the White House shelter asked if there were any indications of another hijacked aircraft. The deputy director for operations mentioned the Delta flight and concluded that \\"that would be the fourth possible hijack.\\" At 9:49, the commander of NORAD directed all air sovereignty aircraft to battle stations, fully armed. At 9:59, an Air Force lieutenant colonel working in the White House Military Office joined the conference and stated he had just talked to Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley. The White House requested (1) the implementation of continuity of government measures, (2) fighter escorts for Air Force One, and (3) a fighter combat air patrol over Washington, D.C. By 10:03, when United 93 crashed in Pennsylvania, there had been no mention of its hijacking and the FAA had not yet been added to the teleconference. The President and the Vice President The President was seated in a classroom when, at 9:05, Andrew Card whispered to him: \\"A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.\\" The President told us his instinct was to project calm, not to have the country see an excited reaction at a moment of crisis. The press was standing behind the children; he saw their phones and pagers start to ring. The President felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening. The President remained in the classroom for another five to seven minutes, while the children continued reading. He then returned to a holding room shortly before 9:15, where he was briefed by staff and saw television coverage. He next spoke to Vice President Cheney, Dr. Rice, New York Governor George Pataki, and FBI Director Robert Mueller. He decided to make a brief statement from the school before leaving for the airport. The Secret Service told us they were anxious to move the President to a safer location, but did not think it imperative for him to run out the door. Between 9:15 and 9:30, the staff was busy arranging a return to Washington, while the President consulted his senior advisers about his remarks. No one in the traveling party had any information during this time that other aircraft were hijacked or missing. Staff was in contact with the White House Situation Room, but as far as we could determine, no one with the President was in contact with the Pentagon. After reading the above, is \\"64 minutes\\" the correct answer to the question \\"How long from the time that the president was told a second plane hit the second tower, did it take for air sovereignty aircraft to be directed to battle stations\\"?","completion":"First, we need to determine the exact time the President was told about the second plane hitting the second tower, and then find out the time when the air sovereignty aircraft were directed to battle stations. From the text: - At 9:05, Andrew Card whispered to the President: \\"A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.\\" - At 9:49, the commander of NORAD directed all air sovereignty aircraft to battle stations, fully armed. Now, we can calculate the time difference to find out how long it took: 9:49 (time air sovereignty aircraft directed to battle stations) - 9:05 (time President was told about the second plane) = 44 minutes So, the correct answer to the question \\"How long from the time that the president was told a second plane hit the second tower, did it take for air sovereignty aircraft to be directed to battle stations?\\" is 44 minutes, not 64 minutes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context: While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against Richard Wagner's music dramas, heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period. Fanning writes, \\"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera Saul and David and the Second Symphony (The Four Temperaments) and the cantatas Hymnus amoris and Søvnen\\".

(Evasive Beats) is a story set in the near future where technology has advanced far beyond what people once thought possible. The protagonist, E.B., short for Evasive Beats, is a skilled martial artist and undercover operative who has been implanted with an intuitive AI system that gives them great combat capabilities, including the ability to predict the movement of enemies and dodge attacks with incredible precision. The film starts with E.B., a highly trained operative, being assigned to a covert mission to infiltrate and dismantle a dangerous and powerful criminal organization, known as The Blades. This organization has recently acquired a mass production facility for advanced weaponry, threatening global peace and stability. The weapons of choice for The Blades are life-threatening, intelligent, and self-guided blades that inflict brutal damage on their victims. E.B.'s main task is to locate the factory, bring down its operations, and capture the leader of The Blades, Victor Helix, an infamous figure in the criminal underworld. Joined by a highly skilled team of agents, E.B. embarks on a treacherous journey through a dystopian city filled with incredibly skilled adversaries and deadly traps. Throughout the film, E.B. faces numerous deadly encounters with members of The Blades and its array of lethal machines, including battles with the powerful and highly skilled henchmen of Victor Helix. In these high-octane scenes, E.B. relies on the evasive beats - the predictive AI system implanted within them - to avoid the lethal attacks of The Blades. But the plot takes a twist when E.B. discovers that Victor Helix has anticipated their arrival and is tracking E.B.'s every move, including the team's extraction plans. Now trapped in the city, E.B. and the team not only have to face Victor's henchmen but must also dodge city surveillance and military police forces sent to eliminate them. As the story unfolds, E.B. slowly learns that the intuitive AI system within them not only helps them evade their enemies but also lays down some hidden talents that they had not previously known - such as an ability to connect with and manipulate cutting-edge technology. Relying on this newfound power, E.B. takes on a daring and seemingly impossible plan to take down the entire organization. Along with the help of his team, E.B. successfully infiltrates the factory, shutting down the production line, and ultimately confronts Victor Helix in a climactic showdown combining martial arts combat, state-of-the-art weapons, and lightning-fast dodging skills. The movie concludes as E.B., using their predictive AI implant's incredible power, narrowly dodges the leader's final attack before delivering the decisive blow, effectively dismantling The Blades and ensuring global peace. Throughout the film, E.B. demonstrates their incredible survival skills and tenacity, giving audiences an adrenaline-pumping ride filled with action, suspense, and cutting-edge technology all built around the central question: How does E.B. survive dodging the blades?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender. Question: \\"Is the Iranian government for or against women activists?\\" Response: \\"Against\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question. The passage discusses the Iranian government's strategy against the women's movement and its targeting of women activists, which indicates that the Iranian government is against women activists."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context: The visual arts during the Song dynasty were heightened by new developments such as advances in landscape and portrait painting. The gentry elite engaged in the arts as accepted pastimes of the cultured scholar-official, including painting, composing poetry, and writing calligraphy. The poet and statesman Su Shi and his associate Mi Fu (1051–1107) enjoyed antiquarian affairs, often borrowing or buying art pieces to study and copy. Poetry and literature profited from the rising popularity and development of the ci poetry form. Enormous encyclopedic volumes were compiled, such as works of historiography and dozens of treatises on technical subjects. This included the universal history text of the Zizhi Tongjian, compiled into 1000 volumes of 9.4 million written Chinese characters. The genre of Chinese travel literature also became popular with the writings of the geographer Fan Chengda (1126–1193) and Su Shi, the latter of whom wrote the 'daytrip essay' known as Record of Stone Bell Mountain that used persuasive writing to argue for a philosophical point. Although an early form of the local geographic gazetteer existed in China since the 1st century, the matured form known as \\"treatise on a place\\", or fangzhi, replaced the old \\"map guide\\", or tujing, during the Song dynasty.The imperial courts of the emperor's palace were filled with his entourage of court painters, calligraphers, poets, and storytellers. Emperor Huizong was a renowned artist as well as a patron of the arts. A prime example of a highly venerated court painter was Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145) who painted an enormous panoramic painting, Along the River During the Qingming Festival. Emperor Gaozong of Song initiated a massive art project during his reign, known as the Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute from the life story of Cai Wenji (b. 177). This art project was a diplomatic gesture to the Jin dynasty while he negotiated for the release of his mother from Jurchen captivity in the north.

The first piece of information is: \\"A person with long hair stares out of the window on the top level of a double decker bus.\\" The second piece of information is: \\"The person is sleeping.\\" Now let's look at these two statements together, step-by-step: 1. The first statement: It describes a person with long hair, located on the top level of a double-decker bus, actively doing something: they are staring out of the window. This implies that the person is conscious and awake to be able to perform these activities. 2. The second statement: It simply states that the person is sleeping. Sleeping is a state of unconsciousness where the person is not aware of their surroundings and therefore, most likely, not capable of performing any conscious activity like the aforementioned staring out of the window. Considering these two points, it seems the two statements are logically inconsistent. However, one possible interpretation could be that the first statement described the person before they fell asleep, and the second statement describes them afterwards. But without this context, we cannot assume that is the case. In conclusion, based on the given information, it's not possible to conclude that \\"A person with long hair stares out of the window on the top level of a double decker bus\\" if \\"the person is sleeping\\", as these two things cannot occur simultaneously under normal circumstances. The states of being awake and sleeping are mutually exclusive, and staring out of the window requires the person to be awake."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender. Question: \\"Why was Shiva Nazar Ahari put in prison?\\" Answer: \\"Alleged adultery\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: (1). no; (2). yes;","completion":"(1). no; The paragraph states that Shiva Nazar Ahari was put in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God.\\" This catch-all offense is used for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record.

Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860.

If you've tried everything, you can try replacing your hard drive as a last-ditch effort. If you iPod is making a clicking sound and the \\"sad iPod\\" image appears on your screen, then the hard drive most likely needs to be replaced. Replacement hard drives can be ordered online, or you can scavenge a drive out of another iPod that is the same model. All versions of the iPod Touch, iPod Shuffle, and iPod Nano use flash memory instead of a traditional hard drive. This means there are no moving parts that can fail or connections that can become severed. There is no practical way to secure or replace an iPod Touch hard drive, as the flash memory unit is built into the circuitry. Make sure that the iPod is turned off and locked with the Hold switch toggled on before opening your iPod. This will ensure that you don't accidentally turn it on while working on it. Follow the steps in the previous method to remove the back from your iPod to expose the hard drive. Lift the hard drive from the top of the iPod. Don't try to pull it out completely. Remove the rubber bumpers and shock absorber and set them to the side. You will see a cable at the bottom the drive that attaches the drive to the circuitry. Gently work the cable out of the drive, using either your fingers or a screwdriver. Once the cable has been detached, you should be able to completely remove the drive from the housing.

Justin didn't have the strength to lift the bricks unlike Kevin because","completion":"Justin had always been a bit of a scrawny kid. Where Kevin was muscular and confident, Justin was slim and shy. This made it difficult for Justin to compete against his brother, Kevin, when it came to physical tasks. Growing up together, the two had always been compared by their parents, teachers, and friends. Justin couldn't help but feel inadequate in the shadow of his determined and strong brother. However, as they got older, their differences took them along separate paths in life. Kevin went on to become a star athlete in their small town, his well-toned physique earning him praise and attention from everyone, whether on the football field or the local construction site. His natural ability to perform physically demanding tasks landed him a job with the prominent local construction company. Everyone agreed that Kevin was truly a force to be reckoned with. Meanwhile, what Justin lacked in physical strength, he made up for in his creativity and intellect. Passionate about science and engineering, he delved deep into his studies, earning top grades and recognition from his professors. Though Justin was well-aware of his physical limitations, he channeled his energy into inventing devices and gadgets that would give him the opportunity to keep up with his brother. Justin's devices were as awe-inspiring as they were ingenious – from the robotic exoskeleton that allowed him to assist on construction sites to the remote-controlled drones that he used to help rescue trapped workers in collapsed buildings. Still, whenever he was around Kevin, Justin couldn't escape that nagging feeling that he was the lesser sibling, somehow inferior in the eyes of others. One day, as Justin was walking home from school, he stumbled across a group of kids who were struggling to build a makeshift fort out of bricks in a nearby alley. He watched in fascination as the children strained to lift the heavy stones in their small arms but couldn't budge them. Justin spotted Kevin driving past in his truck. The temptation was too great to resist. He had to find a way to construct a stronger and more efficient device that would allow him to demonstrate his own capabilities, particularly in front of his brother. As Justin hurried home, an idea struck him. What if he could devise a kinetic power enhancer that would harness and amplify his own limited strength? This way, he could lift the bricks with ease and help the kids complete their fort. Over the following weeks, Justin toiled away in his makeshift workshop, feverishly working on the blueprint for his new invention. Chronicling every gear, lever, and switch, he spent hours tinkering and building his power-enhancing masterpiece. The day finally arrived, and Justin proudly unveiled his KinetiX-3000, to the amazement of the children gathered around. As he strapped the device to his arms and legs, he could feel the surge of newfound power coursing through him. Justin marveled in delight as he effortlessly lifted a brick and then another, each seemingly weightless in his hands. It was undeniably impressive, a testament to his ingenuity and determination. As he built the children's fort, word began to spread, and the crowd grew. Even Kevin, who was driving by again, stopped to see what all the commotion was about. The sight of his little brother handling bricks with super-human strength surprised him, but it also filled Kevin with profound respect for Justin. Kevin told his brother, now more than impressed, \\"You may not have the muscles, but you've got something much stronger: your brain.\\" Justin understood that what made him different from Kevin didn't have to be a burden, but what truly defined him and contributed to their community. Lifting bricks might have been a small act, but it was a monumental victory for both brothers – a moment of realization that strength comes in many forms, and each person's unique abilities can be celebrated. From that day on, Justin and Kevin no longer compared themselves to each other. Instead, they embraced each other's strengths, working together as siblings and supporting one another in their common goal of improving the lives of the people in their town. The brothers had finally formed an unbreakable bond, built not on bricks, but on love, respect, and understanding."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This condition can cause a tendency toward prolonged or excessive bleeding ( bleeding diathesis or bleeding disorder ) , which may occur spontaneously or following an injury or medical and dental procedures . - In medicine (hematology), bleeding diathesis (h(a)emorrhagic diathesis) is an unusual susceptibility to bleed (hemorrhage) mostly due to hypocoagulability, in turn caused by a coagulopathy (a defect in the system of coagulation). Several types are distinguished, ranging from mild to lethal. Also, bleeding diathesis can be caused by thinning of the skin or impaired wound healing. - Hematology, also spelled haematology (from the Greek , \\"haima\\" \\"blood,\\" and -o), is the branch of medicine concerned with the study, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases related to blood. Hematology includes the study of etiology. It involves treating diseases that affect the production of blood and its components, such as blood cells, hemoglobin, blood proteins, bone marrow, platelets, blood vessels, spleen, and the mechanism of coagulation. Such diseases might include hemophilia, blood clots, other bleeding disorders and blood cancers such as leukemia, myeloma, and lymphoma. The laboratory work that goes into the study of blood is frequently performed by a medical technologist or medical laboratory scientist. Many hematologists work as hematologist-oncologists, also providing medical treatment for all types of cancer. - Medicine (British English ; American English ) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. The word \\"medicine\\" is derived from Latin \\"medicus\\", meaning \\"a physician\\". Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness.

The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who picked which version of the text to reprint? is inside the article: The \\"magnificent and accurate\\" Shakespeare edition which Boydell began in 1786 was to be the focus of his enterprise—he viewed the print folio and the gallery as offshoots of the main project. In an advertisement prefacing the first volume of the edition, Nicol wrote that \\"splendor and magnificence, united with correctness of text were the great objects of this Edition\\". The volumes themselves were handsome, with gilded pages that, unlike those in previous scholarly editions, were unencumbered by footnotes. Each play had its own title page followed by a list of \\"Persons in the Drama\\". Boydell spared no expense. He hired the typography experts William Bulmer and William Martin to develop and cut a new typeface specifically for the edition. Nicol explains in the preface that they \\"established a printing-house ... [and] a foundry to cast the types; and even a manufactory to make the ink\\". Boydell also chose to use high-quality wove Whatman paper. The illustrations were printed independently and could be inserted and removed as the purchaser desired. The first volumes of the Dramatic Works were published in 1791 and the last in 1805. Boydell was responsible for the \\"splendor\\", and George Steevens, the general editor, was responsible for the \\"correctness of text\\". Steevens, according to Evelyn Wenner, who has studied the history of the Boydell edition, was \\"at first an ardent advocate of the plan\\" but \\"soon realized that the editor of this text must in the very scheme of things give way to painters, publishers and engravers\\". He was also ultimately disappointed in the quality of the prints, but he said nothing to jeopardize the edition's sales. Steevens, who had already edited two complete Shakespeare editions, was not asked to edit the text anew; instead, he picked which version of the text to reprint.

Although it changes direction many times, it flows generally west for 215 miles (346 km) from the Cascade Range through the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest and the Klamath Mountains to the Pacific Ocean at Gold Beach. Communities along its course include Union Creek, Prospect, Trail, Shady Cove, Gold Hill and Rogue River, all in Jackson County; Grants Pass and Galice in Josephine County; and Agness, Wedderburn and Gold Beach in Curry County. Significant tributaries include the South Fork Rogue River, Elk Creek, Bear Creek, the Applegate River, and the Illinois River. Arising at 5,320 feet (1,622 m) above sea level, the river loses more than 1 mile (1.6 km) in elevation by the time it reaches the Pacific. It was one of the original eight rivers named in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968, which included 84 miles (135 km) of the Rogue, from 7 miles (11.3 km) west of Grants Pass to 11 miles (18 km) east of the mouth at Gold Beach. In 1988, an additional 40 miles (64 km) of the Rogue between Crater Lake National Park and the unincorporated community of Prospect was named Wild and Scenic.

In this case, the review only has two words: \\"Like it.\\" It does indicate that the reviewer has positive feelings towards the subject, but it doesn't provide much context or explanation. Step 2: Consider the scope of the review. Short reviews can sometimes be impactful and concise, but in this case, the use of only two words does not provide much information about the reasons behind the reviewer's liking or specific aspects they enjoyed. Step 3: Assess potential biases or lack of objectivity. Since the review is very short and doesn't provide much context, it is hard to ascertain any potential bias or objectivity. Step 4: Factor in writing style and grammar. The review is written in a simple way with no clear grammatical errors or problems with punctuation. However, it also lacks any descriptive language or variety. After considering these steps, I would rate this review as a 2 out of 5.

Please tell me if those questions are the same. Choose from: (a). no (b). yes","completion":"In order to determine if KFC is halal, I will perform the following steps: Step 1: Research KFC's food practices I will research KFC's food practices to understand whether they follow halal guidelines. This includes the sourcing of their chicken, the method of slaughtering and preparing the meat, and overall hygiene and cleanliness. Step 2: Explore regional differences Different countries may have varying halal standards and KFC restaurants may adapt to comply with local regulations. I will check if KFC meets the halal standards in various regions. Step 3: Check for certification I will check if KFC has any halal certification to confirm whether their chicken is halal or not. Halal certifying bodies can provide assurance that KFC follows the necessary guidelines. After conducting research, it is found that KFC is halal in some countries, such as the United Arab Emirates, where the company operates halal-certified branches. However, in other countries or regions, KFC may not necessarily be halal. It is important to check local KFC branches and their certification to confirm whether KFC's chicken is halal or not in a specific area. Now, let's analyze the two questions: 1. Is KFC Halal? 2. Is KFC chicken halal? Both questions ask whether KFC complies with halal rules, although the second question specifically focuses on the chicken itself. It can be assumed that if the chicken is halal, then the overall restaurant will be considered halal, given that chicken is their primary product. As both questions are aiming to determine the halal status of KFC, particularly its chicken, the questions can be considered the same.

The term \\"head\\" suggests that the palace is at the starting point or entrance of the avenue, rather than being situated at a distance from it. Durbar Marg Avenue likely stretches southwards from the palace, with the palace serving as a prominent landmark or focal point at its northern end. The actual distance between the palace and various locations along Durbar Marg Avenue may vary, but it would be incorrect to assume that palace is far from the avenue as the entire avenue starts from the palace itself.

I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem. According to the above context, answer the following question. When did the cab driver have enough money to only work 1 job?","completion":"The cab driver had enough money to only work 1 job when she won a small jackpot a few years back. This allowed her to cut back to one job for a few months. Therefore, she had enough money when she won the jackpot because it reduced her need for multiple jobs. It is also implied that after this period when she only had to work one job ended, she was forced to return to working multiple jobs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We have this equation: 218*h - 2880 = 98*h First, let's move all the h terms to one side and the other numbers to the other side. To do that, we will subtract 98*h from both sides: 218*h - 98*h - 2880 = 0 Now, let's simplify that: (218 - 98) * h - 2880 = 0 120 * h - 2880 = 0 Next, we want to isolate h, so let's add 2880 to both sides: 120 * h = 2880 Now, to find the value of h, we'll just divide by 120: h = 2880 / 120 And after we divide, we'll find our answer: h = 24 So, the value of h is 24!

(Associated Press) Police detain a protester in downtown Moscow, Russia, Sunday, May 26, 2017. Russia's leading opposition figure Alexei Navalny and his supporters aim to hold anti-corruption demonstrations throughout Russia. But authorities are denying permission and police have warned they won't be responsible for \\"negative... (Associated Press) MOSCOW (AP) — Thousands of people crowded into Moscow's Pushkin Square on Sunday for an unsanctioned protest against the Russian government, the biggest gathering in a wave of nationwide protests that were the most extensive show of defiance in years. Alexei Navalny, the anti-corruption campaigner who is leading the opposition to President Vladimir Putin, was arrested while walking from a nearby subway station to the demonstration at Moscow's iconic Pushkin Square. Navalny and his Foundation for Fighting Corruption had called for the protests, which attracted hundreds or thousands in most sizeable Russian cities, from the Far East port of Vladivostok to the European heartland including St. Petersburg. The protests were the largest coordinated outpourings of dissatisfaction in Russia since the massive 2011-12 demonstrations that followed a fraud-tainted parliamentary election. Police estimated the Moscow crowd at about 7,000, but it could have been larger. The one-hectare (2.5-acre) Pushkin Square was densely crowded as were sidewalks on the adjacent Tverskaya Street. State news agency Tass cited Moscow police as saying about 200 people were arrested. Russia's beleaguered opposition is often seen as primarily a phenomenon of a Westernized urban elite, but Sunday's protests included gatherings in places far from cosmopolitan centers, such as Siberia's Chita and Barnaul. \\"Navalny has united people who think the same; that people don't agree with the authorities is obvious from what is going on in the country today,\\" Anna Ivanova, 19, said at the Moscow demonstration. \\"I am a bit scared.\\" Scuffles with police erupted sporadically and the arrested demonstrators included a gray-haired man whom police dragged along the pavement. Police cleared the square after about three hours and began herding demonstrators down side streets. \\"It's scary, but if everyone is afraid, no one would come out onto the streets,\\" Yana Aksyonova, 19, said. The protests Sunday focused on reports by Navalny's group claiming that Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has amassed a collection of mansions, yachts and vineyards. The alleged luxuries include a house for raising ducks, so many placards in Sunday's protests featured mocking images of yellow duck toys. \\"People are unhappy with the fact that there's been no investigation\\" of the corruption allegations, said Moscow protester Ivan Gronstein. In the Pacific port city of Vladivostok, police forcefully detained some demonstrators near the city's railway terminal, in one case falling down a small grassy slope as they wrestled with a detainee. News reports and social media reported demonstrations in large cities throughout the country, including Novosibirsk, Tomsk and Krasnoyarsk. At least 25 people were reported arrested in Vladivostok and 12 in Khabarovsk. Some demonstrators showed up with their faces painted green, a reference to a recent attack on Navalny in which an assailant threw a green antiseptic liquid onto his face. ||||| Moscow (CNN) Hundreds of people, including a prominent opposition figure, were arrested in Moscow Sunday for participating in unauthorized protests, according to state media and a human rights group. The demonstrators were attending a large-scale anti-corruption demonstration in Moscow. State-run news outlet Tass reported that 8,000 people attended the protest in Moscow alone. Similar protests were planned in 100 cities across Russia, according to organizers. Opposition supporters take part in an unauthorized anti-corruption rally in central Moscow on Sunday. Russian human rights group OVD-Info tweeted that more than 700 had been detained in Moscow -- while state-run news agency Ria Novosti said 500 had been held. Among those detained was Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny, according to tweets by Navalny and his press secretary. \\"Today we are discussing (and condemning) corruption, not the detentions. Well, I was detained. So what. It OK. There are things in life that are worth being detained for,\\" Navalny tweeted. The demonstrations come at a time when the safety of critics of Vladimir Putin is under scrutiny. On Thursday, a former Russian lawmaker and vocal critic of the Russian government, Denis Voronenkov, was shot dead outside a luxury hotel in the Ukrainian capital Kiev. Navalny has not commented on the killing. CNN has contacted him for comment. JUST WATCHED Chilling video shows Kremlin critic's death Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Chilling video shows Kremlin critic's death 02:24 Condemnation The US State Department spoke out against the arrests. \\"The United States strongly condemns the detention of hundreds of peaceful protesters throughout Russia on Sunday,\\" acting State Department spokesperson Mark Toner said in a statement. \\"We were troubled to hear of the arrest of opposition figure Alexei Navalny upon arrival at the demonstration, as well as the police raids on the anti-corruption organization he heads.\\" Toner said, \\"Detaining peaceful protesters, human rights observers, and journalists is an affront to core democratic values.\\" Police detain a protester in central Moscow on Sunday. The protest drew a heavy police presence but remained largely peaceful. Riot officers flanked crowds while plainclothes officers moved among the demonstrators. Police told those on the street that the protest was unsanctioned and asked them to move on. Navalny praised turnouts for the protests in early morning tweets. \\"Far East started fine,\\" he tweeted, referring to a photo of protesters gathering in the city of Vladivostok, located on Russia's far eastern coast. Navalny also shared photos and tweets from various parts of the country. Opposition supporters participate in an anti-corruption rally in central St. Petersburg on March 26, 2017. 'He is not your Dimon' The protests are part of a campaign called \\"He is not your Dimon,\\" which uses the diminutive form of the Russian name Dmitry to refer to Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. Navalny has accused Medvedev of amassing a global property empire through various forms of corruption. In a report published on March 2, Navalny said Medvedev has a portfolio of assets including \\"huge pieces of land in the most sought-after regions, yachts, apartments in old mansions, agricultural complexes and wineries in Russia and abroad.\\" Navalny's report claims this was all purchased through \\"bribes from oligarchs, and state bank loans.\\" Police officers detain a man during an unauthorized anti-corruption rally in central Moscow on March 26. Medvedev's spokeswoman, Natalya Timakova, told state-run news agency RIA Novosti, \\"It is pointless to comment on the propagandistic outbursts of a convicted opposition figure, who has already announced he is running some kind of election campaign and fighting against the authorities.\\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the report \\"not the first creative effort from this well-known convicted citizen,\\" according to Tass. Moscow protest in sight of Kremlin Protesters in Moscow walked along Tverskaya Street, one of the city's main arteries that starts at the Kremlin walls. \\"I can't support our government, really,\\" one protester said. \\"They steal our money using their power.\\" The Moscow Police Department put out a statement Thursday urging people not to attend, calling it illegal and warning of a high risk of \\"provocative acts, designed to violate public order.\\" Police said the organizers of the event were offered an alternative location but declined. The Kremlin said Friday the event was \\"illegal\\" and a \\"provocation.\\" Navalny, who rose to prominence during the large-scale anti-government protests in Russia in 2011, has announced he plans to run for the Russian presidency in 2018. In February, he was found guilty of embezzlement in a retrial of a case that dates back to 2013. Russian law prevents convicted criminals running for public office, but Navalny has appealed the verdict. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"On 26 May 2017, thousands of people gathered in Moscow's Pushkin Square and other major Russian cities in a wave of anti-government demonstrations, the largest in years.

Former Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti believes Louis van Gaal will find it hard to take Manchester United back to the top of the Barclays Premier League in his first season. Ancelotti’s Real Madrid team come face to face with United in front of 109,000 fans at the enormous Michigan Stadium with Cristiano Ronaldo, who is not yet match fit. The Italian believes Van Gaal will succeed at Old Trafford but thinks it may take time. VIDEO Scroll down for Cristiano Ronaldo enjoys rub-down from Real Madrid physio... a lot! Out: Cristiano Ronaldo won't play against Manchester United after Carlo Ancelotti admitted his star man isn't fit. Pity: The Portugal international won't be able to face his old side when they play in Michigan on Saturday. Doing battle: New United boss Louis van Gaal will face a stern test against Carlo Ancelotti's Real. 'He is a very good and very experience manager, he has fantastic experience and he will do a fantastic job at United,' said Ancelotti at a press conference ahead of Real training. 'He is a manager who has nothing to learn. After Sir Alex Ferguson, it was more difficult for United, but they now have to rebuild a team. 'They have signed good players, but building a team is not easy and the Premier League is a very competitive league. 'It will not be easy to win in the first year because there are many competitive teams who want to win. 'It is not easy to implement a new system. It is important that the player is convinced, but it is difficult to say how long it will take.' Ancelotti won the Premier League title with Chelsea in his first season in 2009/10 and led Real to the Champions League crown last season. He was on United’s short-list to replace David Moyes after Ferguson’s successor was sacked last April. Asked about this on Friday, he said: 'These are rumours that usually happen, but I am at a fantastic club. 'I have lots of respect for United, but I am happy here and I think they have made a good chance in Louis van Gaal.' Injury problems: Ronaldo will not face his former employers on Saturday for Real Madrid. Ronaldo has joined up with Real here in Michigan but will not play against his old club on Saturday. Ancelotti said: 'He has been working individually, separate from the team, but he will not play tomorrow and will train when back at Madrid because we will use him in the Super Cup. 'The plan for Cristiano was right. We gave him one month of rest and started back on July 26, but he needs to recover completely and for this reason we don’t want to take a risk tomorrow. Disappointing: Ronaldo will be gutted at the news he will miss this Saturday's game against his former side. 'It’s never a friendly against Man Utd.

The Prime Minister has dismissed these allegations, citing that his opponents have taken things too far in their pursuits against him. Step 1: Present the accusations The controversy began when Italy's Prime Minister was accused of engaging in sexual relations with a 17-year-old nightclub dancer. As a leader of the nation, such allegations have raised questions about his integrity and have put his leadership under the microscope. Step 2: Describe the Prime Minister's response In response to these allegations, the Prime Minister has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, stating that his opponents were merely attempting to discredit him by going too far in their attacks. He asserts that not only are these accusations baseless, but they are also a reflection of political maneuvering by those wishing to topple his administration. Step 3: Include the woman's reaction and statement In addition to the Prime Minister's dismissal of the allegations, the woman in question, who has not been named thus far, has also come forward stating that she has never engaged in a sexual relationship with the Prime Minister. Speaking to an Italian TV station, she made it clear that the accusations were not based on any factual information. Step 4: Discuss the recent legal developments Complicating matters further, Italy's top court has recently struck down a law that had previously protected Berlusconi from prosecution. This ruling now paves the way for potential legal consequences if the Prime Minister is ever found to be guilty of the allegations being brought against him. Conclusion: While the scandal continues to make headlines and captivate the nation, it remains to be seen whether these allegations against Italy's Prime Minister will be substantiated. For now, both the Prime Minister and the woman at the center of the scandal have denied any wrongdoing. As the investigation unfolds, it will be important to keep an eye on legal developments that may further impact Italy's political landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It incorporates great action with an intense love story. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette have amazing chemistry. Brad Pitt delivers one of his finest roles in a cameo as a drugged out, but friendly guy (check out the honey container he offers Christopher Walken, in one of the most awkward but funniest scenes I've seen). Worth seeing over and over again as well for Val Kilmer's cameo as Elvis, who guides Christian Slater and gives him courage throughout the movie. Dennis Hopper also delivers a poignant and sweet performance as Christian Slater's somewhat estranged but loving father. Don't miss this one!!!!

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was conducted by Henry Wood when it was played at a London Promenade Concert? Elgar is probably best known for the first of the five Pomp and Circumstance Marches, which were composed between 1901 and 1930. It is familiar to millions of television viewers all over the world every year who watch the Last Night of the Proms, where it is traditionally performed. When the theme of the slower middle section (technically called the \\"trio\\") of the first march came into his head, he told his friend Dora Penny, \\"I've got a tune that will knock 'em – will knock 'em flat\\". When the first march was played in 1901 at a London Promenade Concert, it was conducted by Henry J. Wood, who later wrote that the audience \\"rose and yelled ... the one and only time in the history of the Promenade concerts that an orchestral item was accorded a double encore.\\" To mark the coronation of Edward VII, Elgar was commissioned to set A. C. Benson's Coronation Ode for a gala concert at the Royal Opera House in June 1901. The approval of the king was confirmed, and Elgar began work. The contralto Clara Butt had persuaded him that the trio of the first Pomp and Circumstance march could have words fitted to it, and Elgar invited Benson to do so. Elgar incorporated the new vocal version into the Ode. The publishers of the score recognised the potential of the vocal piece, \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\", and asked Benson and Elgar to make a further revision for publication as a separate song. It was immensely popular and is now considered an unofficial British national anthem. In the United States, the trio, known simply as \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" or \\"The Graduation March\\", has been adopted since 1905 for virtually all high school and university graduations.In March 1904 a three-day festival of Elgar's works was presented at Covent Garden, an honour never before given to any English composer. The Times commented, \\"Four or five years ago if any one had predicted that the Opera-house would be full from floor to ceiling for the performance of an oratorio by an English composer he would probably have been supposed to be out of his...

Write a title for this article: Returning to work after maternity leave is a huge stressor for many first time moms, not only because of the logistical hoops you have to jump through to re-arrange your work life around your new baby, but it can also fill women with self-doubt about their roles as career woman and mom. It also seems to come way too quickly. Some experts believe that women need about four months of maternity leave before they’re ready to come back, but many women only get six to eight weeks. Here’s how to make the transition as smooth as possible. Performing at Work • Ease the transition. Experts recommend starting in the middle of the week, so your first work week is short. It is also becoming more common for women to arrange to work one or two days the first week or so, or come in for a shorter day for the first two or three days to help ease the transition. The smoother your transition, the more productive you’ll be at work, says Chris Essex, director of the Center for Work and Family in Rockville, Md. • Tone down the baby talk—or not! A lot of women fear if they talk about their babies at work, people will assume they wish they were home instead of working. “Yet talking about your baby can build connections to people in the workplace,” says Jamie Ladge, assistant professor in management at Northeastern University in Boston. “People talk about their personal lives all the time at work, so it’s natural to talk about your kids.\\" But use your judgment. If you intuit that your co-workers won’t be receptive or can’t relate, then keep the cute baby stories to a minimum. • Give yourself time to adjust. Don’t think you need to reconsider your options if your first few weeks back are rocky. “When women come back to work, they’re in a lot of flux, trying to integrate how they are as a professional with their new role as a mother,” Ladge says. It may take some time to adjust to your new identity and learn how to juggle work and home responsibilities. • Ask for flex time. More and more women and men are negotiating schedules that are less rigid and can ease the stresses with working 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. “You may fear that people will think less of you if you ask, but if you don’t ask, you don’t get,” Ladge says. Talk to other employees who may have been down the same road to see what type of arrangements they have. • Ignore the comments. People can say overtly or covertly stereotypical things, which can fill you with self doubt. A seasoned mother might say, “I cried and cried when I came back to work,” making you question what kind of mom you are since you didn’t shed a tear. A boss might say, “I hope you’re not one of those women who aren’t 100 percent committed now that you have a baby.” Just laugh it off. And don’t work twice as hard to prove them wrong. • Be clear with your supervisors. Be communicative about what you want from your job and what your ambitions are so that you don’t get sidelined for promotions because of inaccurate assumptions about you now that you’re a mom. Juggling • You’ll be exhausted. If there’s a time you could use the support of your parents or some extra paid help, it is when you’re transitioning back to work. If you can get some help with cleaning and cooking during this time, it can help you feel less frazzled. • Plan the morning routine. One of the most critical issues is the division of labor between you and your spouse. Who will take showers when, who will watch the baby, feed the baby, and get the baby to child care. Ditto for dinnertime and pickup. “You and your spouse need to work it out in advance because it’s hard to negotiate when you’re tired or in the middle of a hectic schedule,” Essex says. • Alternate nighttime feedings. If you handle all the middle-of-the night feedings, you’ll be exhausted in the morning. Try to alternate nights with your husband. • Don’t try to be super-mom. Understand that you may not be able to do everything like you used to. Some things may fall by the wayside, like a perfectly clean house, or home-cooked dinners every night. Missing Your Baby • Get acclimated to child care. Test drive your child care for at least three days before going back to work to give you and your baby time to adjust. That can lower your anxiety level about your child’s transition. “Having good child care that makes you feel confident is key and reminding yourself that your baby is safe and loved will really help,” says Murphy Daly, author of The Pregnant Professional. • Do a dress rehearsal. Prior to the first day back, get all the stuff ready, have the feeding and napping things packed and ready to go,” Daly says. “Take baby to childcare and then go get your personal grooming done while you practice being away.\\" • Check in with your child care once a day. For some people, checking in may make it harder, so tailor the advice to what works for you. Some women like to have pictures of the baby at work, while for others, it may make the transition more difficult. • Don’t be surprised to miss your baby. Try not to assume that something is wrong with your work ethic for wanting to be home with your baby rather than working. Women often feel pulled in both directions, so it’s more about getting used to wanting to be in both places at once. • Think about a breastfeeding plan. If you are breastfeeding, you should start pumping and freezing milk about a month before you go back to work. Make sure you have a private place to pump at work.

When you can't find Meyer lemons, the best alternative is to use a combination of regular lemons and oranges. Meyer lemons have a sweeter taste compared to regular lemons, and the mixture of orange (which is sweet) and lemon (which is sour) will give you a similar flavor to Meyer lemons. Using half a pomegranate and half an orange doesn't make sense because pomegranates have a completely different taste and texture compared to Meyer lemons.

Please answer the following question: The two basic things you have to do to have a successful weight-loss journey is consume fewer calories (eat less) and exercise more. It is a pleasure to report that it is possible to do both of these things without feeling deprived or overwhelmed. Just add these two little extras for help with weight-loss success. Add a Little Extra Exercise to Your Daily Routine A simple way to increase the level of exercise during your week is by adding a little more effort into your daily activities – the things you are going to do anyway. For example, we all have to do housework right? So, that is an easy one! Instead of taking your time and working at a leisurely pace, work faster. As you sweep and mop the kitchen floor, put some oomph into it. Work at a steady, brisk pace. Stretch your arms and use your muscles. This will definitely increase your heart rate, and burn more calories. When it’s time to clean the windows, reach up as high as you can – stretch to the top of the windows and be sure to get into the corners. Then, buff the glass to a high sheen, which will involve a little more elbow grease than normal. When you scrub out the tub and the shower, do it with energy and a song – make those tiles shine. Play fun music and dance when you sweep, mop or vacuum. Work for longer periods of time – 20 to 30 minutes of active cleaning is much better than 5 minutes here and 5 minutes there. It gives you more time to get your heart rate going and a better boost to your metabolism. These are things you can do to keep your house sparkling and build the new you. So, start throwing in an abundant amount of gusto for extra calorie burning and body shaping. Why does the author recommend sweeping and mopping at a brisk pace? A. More calories will be burned B. So there is more time in the day to exercise, since you will be done with chores faster C. Stretching your arms will make you more flexible D. not enough information Answer:","completion":"A.

Step 2: I'll now think about a possible scenario or context where I can use these words coherently in a sentence, taking into account their meanings. Considering the context of structures, a possible scenario could involve a bridge built on a pier that has to hold a certain amount of weight, with the span referring to the distance the bridge covers. Step 3: Having determined the context, I'll proceed to drafting the sentence. \\"The pier-built bridge was designed to hold a significant load of weight, stretching across an impressive span from one shore to the other.\\" In this sentence, I faithfully incorporated all three words - 'hold,' 'pier,' and 'span' - in a context where their meanings make sense and create a coherent statement."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. In fact, the sentences convey contrasting ideas. Let's analyze both sentences to understand their meanings and see why they are not related in the manner suggested. Sentence 1: \\"But I, yeah, I do want to have a raised bed. I've never... my flower gardens have always been like on the ground.\\" This sentence shows that the speaker wants to have a raised bed for their flower garden, but they have never had one before. The speaker's flower gardens have traditionally been on the ground, not raised. This implies that the speaker has experience with ground-level gardening and is now expressing interest in trying raised-bed gardening. Sentence 2: \\"I've always had raised flower garden beds.\\" The second sentence straightforwardly states that the speaker has consistently had raised garden beds. By saying \\"I've always had,\\" the speaker is asserting that in all their gardening experiences, they have used raised beds. In summary, the first sentence illustrates a desire to change from ground-level gardening to raised bed gardening, while the second sentence suggests that the speaker already has a long-standing history with raised-bed gardening. Consequently, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence, as they express opposing perspectives on the speaker's engagement with raised garden beds."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. - Star Search is an American television show that was produced T.P.E./Rysher Entertainment from 1983 to 1995, hosted by Ed McMahon, and created by Alfred Masini. A relaunch was produced by 2929 Productions from 2003 to 2004. On both versions of the show, contestants competed in several genres of entertainment. The show was originally filmed at the old Earl Carroll Theatre (now known as Nickelodeon on Sunset), at 6230 Sunset Blvd. in Hollywood and later at the Disney Hollywood Studios in Orlando, Florida. - A boy band (or boyband) is loosely defined as a vocal group consisting of young male singers, usually in their teenage years or in their twenties at the time of formation. The first boy bands consisted of the Beatles, Jackson 5, the Monkees, and the Osmonds singing love songs marketed towards young females. Being vocal groups, most boy band members do not play musical instruments, either in recording sessions or on stage, making the term something of a misnomer. However, exceptions do exist. Many boy bands dance as well as sing, usually giving highly choreographed performances. - Pharrell Lanscilo Williams (born April 5, 1973) is an American singer-songwriter, rapper, record producer, and film producer. - NSYNC (sometimes stylized as NSYNC or 'N Sync) was an American boy band formed in Orlando, Florida in 1995 and launched in Germany by BMG Ariola Munich. NSYNC consisted of Justin Timberlake, JC Chasez, Chris Kirkpatrick, Joey Fatone, and Lance Bass. After heavily publicized legal battles with their former manager Lou Pearlman and former record label Bertelsmann Music Group, the group's second album, \\"No Strings Attached\\", sold over one million copies in one day and 2.42 million copies in one week, which was a record for over fifteen years. In addition to a host of Grammy Award nominations, NSYNC has performed at the World Series, the Super Bowl and the Olympic Games, and sang or recorded with Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Phil Collins, Celine Dion, Aerosmith, Britney Spears, Nelly, Left Eye, Mary J. Blige, country music supergroup Alabama, and Gloria Estefan. - The Neptunes are an American production duo, composed of Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo, who are credited with contributing the sound for many successful hip hop and R&B artists in the late-1990s and 2000s. The Neptunes' sound is a distinctive brand of off-kilter, stripped-down electronic funk with sounds from Middle Eastern and Asian music including percussion and woodwind. Pharrell sings and (later) raps on records and appears in videos, unlike his production partner Chad, who tends to stay behind the scenes. - \\"Rock Your Body\\" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Justin Timberlake for his debut studio album, \\"Justified\\" (2002). It was written by Timberlake along with The Neptunes (consisting of Chad Hugo and Pharrell Williams), who also produced the track. The song was released on April 7, 2003 by Jive Records as the third single from \\"Justified\\". The track is an uptempo, disco groove, soul infused song containing influences from Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder. The female section of the track is sung by Vanessa Marquez. Originally intended to be featured on Jackson's tenth studio album \\"Invincible\\" (2001), the latter rejected the song along with several other tracks, which were instead given to Timberlake for his debut album. - A Grammy Award (originally called Gramophone Award), or Grammy, is an honor awarded by The Recording Academy to recognize outstanding achievement in the mainly English-language music industry. The annual presentation ceremony features performances by prominent artists, and the presentation of those awards that have a more popular interest. It shares recognition of the music industry as that of the other performance awards such as the Emmy Awards (television), the Tony Awards (stage performance), and the Academy Awards (motion pictures). - \`\` I 'm Lovin ' It '' is a song recorded by American singer - songwriter Justin Timberlake . It was written by Pharrell Williams , Tom Batoy , Andreas Forberger and Franco Tortora and produced by The Neptunes . The song has since been used as a jingle in commercials for McDonald 's . - Justin Randall Timberlake (born January 31, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, actor and record producer.

Q:Process: - Particles in the environment interact with rocks - The particles remove small pieces of the rock each time they touch the rocks - The particles continue to hit, brush against, or grow against the rocks - The rock eventually is broken apart by this contact - The pieces of the rock are now small rocks - The rock pieces are worn away into smaller and smaller pieces by the same forces - suppose bigger particles hitting the rock happens, how will it affect LESS or SLOWER erosion of rocks. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"When bigger particles hit the rock, it affects the erosion of rocks in both a direct and indirect manner. Let's analyze how this perturbation impacts the given process step by step. 1. Directly impacting a step of the process: When bigger particles interact with rocks, they directly impact the erosion process by causing more significant abrasion or fragmentation. The removal of small pieces of rock each time bigger particles touch the rocks results in more substantial chunks being broken off, leading to a quicker overall deterioration. During these interactions, the energy and mass of larger particles can cause higher stress on the rock, leading to quicker fragmentation and disintegration of the rock structure. As a result, bigger particles accelerate the erosion process by removing more substantial parts of the rock. Due to the larger mass and higher striking force of these particles, the erosion happens more rapidly than if smaller particles were solely responsible. 2. Indirectly impacting a step of the process: Bigger particles hitting the rock can also indirectly impact the erosion process by changing the overall environment where the rocks are found. For instance, when larger particles remove significant parts of rock, they can alter the surrounding landscape and lead to further changes in environmental factors, including water flow patterns and wind speed. These alterations may, in turn, expose the rocks to different kinds of erosional forces, affecting the overall pace of erosion. This aspect is especially notable in cases where water or wind is transporting the larger particles, leading to more potent erosive forces. In summary, the perturbation of bigger particles hitting the rock both directly and indirectly impacts the erosion process. While their immediate influence involves accelerated erosion due to increased abrasion or fragmentation, they can also lead to indirect impacts through changes in environmental factors, which may further modify the rate of erosion. Therefore, in this scenario, the erosion of rocks would not be less or slower. Instead, it would most likely be quicker and more extensive due to the larger size of particles involved in the process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize this article: False accusations in the workplace can touch on a number of legal issues. Being able to identify the different types of legal claims you might have can help you find the right attorney to offer you advice. Issue-spotting is a fairly complex procedure that law students tackle extensively over three years of law school – so don't expect to become a master. However, basic issues can be spotted more easily, and point you in the direction of the type of attorney you need to consult. For example, if the false accusations relate to something that harms your reputation, you may have a defamation claim against your accuser. An accuser might file a false report against you to manipulate you into doing something for them, such as giving them a raise or a promotion. That situation involves elements of blackmail or fraud. Your accuser also may have a discriminatory motive. For example, they may have made a false accusation against you because they don't want to work with (or be supervised by) someone of your race or gender. This is an employment law issue. Apart from asking trusted family or friends for recommendations, you also may be able to find attorneys to consult by searching online. Your state or local bar association typically will have a searchable directory on its website. Many bar associations have an attorney-referral service that will do much of that issue-spotting work for you. All you have to do is answer a few questions about your case, typically using an online form, to retrieve a list of attorneys who handle clients with problems similar to yours. Do a little research on the attorneys you find. Look at their professional websites to learn more about them and read client reviews. This can help you narrow down your list to a handful of attorneys who potentially could give you the best advice. Most attorneys offer a free initial consultation. You can use this to your advantage to get advice from a number of different lawyers without breaking the bank. This can be especially helpful if your case involves several legal issues and you're not sure which direction to take. If you are seriously contemplating pursuing legal action, and want to hire an attorney for that purpose, you should interview at least three. However, if you're just looking for some general advice on what to do and haven't made up your mind yet what to do, feel free to talk to as many or as few attorneys as you feel is necessary to make an informed decision. When you schedule the consultation, ask if there's any information about your case that the attorney needs before the consultation. Some attorneys have a basic information form they expect all potential new clients to complete. Do your best to get any information about your case to the attorneys as soon as possible – at least several days before the consultations are scheduled. This gives the attorneys plenty of time to familiarize themselves with your situation. Often, attorneys treat free initial consultations as little more than an opportunity to market and sell their services. However, if you come armed with plenty of specific questions, you can get the information you need. If you're planning on hiring an attorney, ask questions about their work and communication style. These consultations will be more focused on finding an attorney with whom you'll have a positive and productive working relationship. The consultation has a different focus if you're still trying to sort out what to do. Ask specific questions about your case as well as whether the attorney believes a lawsuit would be worth pursuing. Contrary to popular belief, most attorneys aren't sue-happy people who are itching to take any and every case that might come their way. If an attorney believes you don't have a case, they'll tell you. Likewise, if an attorney believes you have a case, but it's not a strong one or not one that would be worth the time and expense of a lawsuit, they'll tell you that too. After you've finished talking to several attorneys, you have a big decision to make regarding whether you want to file a lawsuit or take other legal action against your accuser. You may decide that you want to sue your accuser, or your employer, or both. Get in touch with the attorney you felt was the best fit for you as soon as possible so you can determine your next steps. On the other hand, if you've decided filing a lawsuit would be too much effort and you'd rather just move on with your life, call the attorneys you met and thank them for their time. Keep in mind that attorneys are experts. If one (or several) attorneys have told you that a lawsuit is not worth pursuing, you're probably better off dropping the issue. Focus on your work and repairing any damage that has been done to your reputation as a result of the false accusation. Summary:","completion":"False accusations in the workplace can involve various legal issues, and identifying them can help find the right attorney for advice. To find an attorney, you can ask for recommendations from family or friends, search online, or use your local bar association's attorney-referral service.

During consultations, ask specific questions about your situation and the attorney's work style.

I realized that I had been neglecting my hair's health for quite some time now. Determined to improve the situation, I decided to make a comprehensive plan to restore my hair's strength and vitality. Step 1: Research hair care techniques Before starting any new hair care routine, I spent some time researching various techniques and products that can help improve hair strength and promote growth. I visited online forums, read blog articles, and even watched YouTube videos to gather a wealth of knowledge on hair care. Step 2: Determine the root cause I wanted to figure out what factors had contributed to my hair becoming so weak. Was it the chemicals, constant heat, or improper care? Upon closer examination, I concluded that I had been using excessive heat, not trimming my split ends, and using harsh chemical-laden products. Addressing these issues would be key to restoring my hair's health. Step 3: Create a hair care routine To combat my weak hair, I developed a hair care routine that incorporated both internal and external strategies. I started taking multivitamins containing biotin, which is known for benefiting hair and nails. I also began massaging my scalp with coconut oil regularly, as well as applying deep-conditioning hair masks at least once a week. Step 4: Limit heat and chemical exposure To reduce heat exposure, I limited the use of my hair straightener, curling iron, and blow-dryer. On days when it was necessary to use these tools, I made sure to apply a heat protectant spray before styling. I also switched to sulfate-free and silicone-free hair products, as they are less harsh on the hair strands. Step 5: Trim split ends To ensure my hair was in its best condition, I visited a professional hairdresser to trim my split ends. I pledged to schedule regular trims every 6-8 weeks to prevent further damage and keep my hair looking healthy. Step 6: Stay consistent The final and most important step was consistency. I knew that following my hair care routine with dedication would yield positive results. I set reminders to help me stay on track with my routine. Over the course of a few months, I could see my hair start to regain its strength, and the split ends gradually diminished. With continuous care, not only did the coconut oil help my hair grow, but it also restored its health and vitality. The journey taught me the importance of giving my hair the attention and care it deserves."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Start on the internet by checking out national German Shepherd breed clubs like the German Shepherd Dog Club of America or the American Kennel Club. Both of these sites provide detailed information on what to look for in an ethical breeder, and can point you toward more local resources. Do further research into these local German Shepherd breed clubs in your area. Whether you get information from their websites or contact them directly for help, local breed clubs are a great way to get the names of reputable breeders in your area. Veterinarians come into contact with a lot of different types of animal care-givers, from breeders to shelters to individual owners. Because they know so much about animal issues in the community, it's a good idea to talk to a few vets in your area for ethical breeder recommendations. Also consider speaking to other German Shepherd owners, dog groomers, or dog trainers. If you visit a breed show, talk to owners and trainers about who they've had good or bad experiences with. A good breeder won't have a variety of breeds available for adoption. Look for a breeder who specializes only in German Shepherds. Your best option is to find a breeder who has years of experience with the German Shepherd breed. They should be able to answer your questions about development, temperament, and training easily and without hesitation. A key marker of a good breeder is the amount of effort they put into early socialization. Puppies need to be taught from an early age to live harmoniously with humans. If a breeder keeps litters isolated away from the home, the puppies will not be used to the sights and sounds of a normal household, and won't be used to human interaction. This can become a problem by the time they are old enough to be adopted. Make sure the puppies spend at least some time in the breeders' home with them. The more time they spend with humans, the more you can trust the breeder. An ethical breeder will never try to breed a female who hasn't reached sexual maturity — about 2 years of age. Mothers should also be given enough time to recover from pregnancies and being separated from their litters as they get adopted. Females should be healthy and alert. Never adopt a puppy from a breeder who breeds a young or unhealthy female, or who doesn't give mothers time to recover before breeding them again. Puppies should never be sold or separated from their mothers before 8 weeks of age. Before that, it’s unsafe to wean them from their mothers. The breeder should have begun the puppies' vaccination and deworming processes before adopting them out. Make sure that's happened, and ask about any health problems the vet may have reported in these early checkups. Ask if the breeders have their dogs tested for the Degenerative Myelopathy (DM) gene. This can determine whether a common inherited disease in German Shepherds is present in the litter's bloodline. Dogs with DM suffer from progressive paralysis, particularly in the hind legs.[5] Also ask the breeder whether the parents are \\"OFA certified\\" or \\"AKC Registered.\\" You can ask to see certification for both parents from one of these organizations, but reputable breeders usually offer this without asking. Note that being AKC-registered does not mean that you are getting a healthy animal. It means that the owner paid money to the AKC to register the dog. The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA), on the other hand, is interested in orthopedic and genetic health. German Shepherds commonly have hip and elbow dysplasia. While experts recommend against breeding animals with known genetic problems, an OFA certification will give you proof. Be aware, though, that there's no guarantee of health in any animal. There's always a chance that two dogs free of known genetic diseases can still produce a puppy with genetic problems. The breeder should be evaluating you as a potential owner, just as you're evaluating him or her as a breeder. No good breeder will just hand over a puppy without being sure that the new owners will be able to provide it with a good, healthy life. Ask the breeder what they look for in a good owner, and whether they've ever turned potential owners away. The breeder should be able to answer these questions without even having to think about it. You might also ask the breeder for references so you can contact other families who have dogs from previous litters. A reputable breeder should ask questions about your dog background and experience, your lifestyle, and your family to guide you in making the best decision. As difficult as it may be, a good breeder will be willing to turn you away if they think you're a bad fit for their particular puppies. For example, if the litter has particularly inactive parents, the puppies may not be a good fit for your highly active lifestyle. If you get turned away, ask if the breeder can point you to other options and litters so you can expand your search. Also ask if they have any unborn litters coming up that may be a better fit for you. Be patient and don't get discouraged. With enough patience and legwork, you'll find the right puppy. Don't lie to a breeder just to get a puppy, though. Trust the breeder's decision-making process. You don't want to end up with a dog who doesn't fit your needs. Avoid any breeder who offers to cut you a \\"deal,\\" who has unclean or smelly kennels, or who acts suspiciously in any way. Trust your instincts. A breeder who's in it just for the money has the wrong motivation, and likely isn't interested in the welfare of their dogs. Make sure the dogs are not crowded into cages. They should have plenty of room to stumble around and explore their surroundings. Part of the time, puppies should be kept in the home to expose them to household environments. There should be adequate food and water for all animals on the premises. Kennels should be cleaned daily. Although it may be that a dog had an accident just before you arrived, be suspicious of a kennel that looks like it hasn't been cleaned recently. All reputable breeders should be willing to take the dog back should things not work out with your family. If a breeder doesn't have a return policy, it suggests they don't really care what happens to their dogs once they leave their property. That's not a good sign! Also find out what kind of documentation you would get with your puppy. Would you get registration papers and pedigree papers? Negotiate for what you want if it's not included in the contract. Be very wary of a breeder who will not discuss the chance that a puppy may need to be returned. Does the contract require you to take the puppy for a vet visit within a set time? Does it cover hereditary issues for life? For only a certain period of time? What kind of documentation will you need to provide to “prove” your case? What does the breeder agree to offer? 100% money back? Trade for another puppy when one is available? Are there restrictions on the activities you can do with your dog that will invalidate the contract or guarantee? Are you purchasing a show prospect puppy or a pet quality animal? Does the breeder have strong feelings (or even bans) about the vaccinations, foods or supplements for your puppy? Are these opinions based on solid science?","completion":"This article provides guidance on finding an ethical breeder for German Shepherd puppies and the importance of doing research before choosing a breeder.

Dogs should have ample space, food, and water, and kennels should be clean. Reputable breeders should have a return policy for puppies if they don't work out with the new family. Important considerations include the contract's terms, what documentation comes with the puppy (registration and pedigree papers), and whether the breeder requires a vet visit within a specific time.

What company was founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 1998?","completion":"Google, the American technology company, was founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 1998. Both were Ph.D. students at Stanford University in California when they developed the idea to create a more efficient and innovative search engine. Their motivation stemmed from the realization that the existing search engines at the time were insufficient and unable to cope with the explosive growth of the internet. The concept behind Google's search engine was to use a unique algorithm called PageRank, which determined the importance of websites by measuring the number and quality of other pages linking to them. This not only facilitated more accurate search results, but it also made the process faster and more convenient for users. Their innovative technology quickly gained popularity, and its founders decided to incorporate the company as Google Inc. on September 4, 1998. The company's name is derived from the word \\"googol,\\" which is a mathematical term representing the numeral one followed by 100 zeros. This name embodies the founders' vision to organize the vast amount of information available on the internet. Over the years, Google has expanded its services to cater to a wide range of user needs. Some notable products and services include Gmail, Google Maps, Google Drive, and Google Photos, as well as the Android operating system for smartphones and tablets. Google is also behind the Chrome web browser, and its digital assistant, Google Assistant, competes with the likes of Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa. Google's growth and influence have been staggering, transforming it from a simple search engine to an essential part of daily life for millions of people worldwide. In 2004, the company went public, and in 2015, Google restructured itself under a new umbrella company called Alphabet Inc. This move allowed for better management of its growing suite of products and services, as well as provided a clearer view of Google's various non-advertising revenue streams. Under Alphabet Inc., Google remains one of the most prominent technology companies in the world. Its commitment to continuous innovation has led to breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, life sciences, and more. Despite facing regulatory challenges and criticisms about privacy and monopolistic practices, the company founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page has been able to maintain its dominance, redefine the way people access information, and leave its mark as an internet giant."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Those of you who are regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that I suffer from a very sensitive, itchy scalp and I am constantly on the hunt for haircare products that are natural and non-irritating but that also treat my hair well and leave it feeling soft, shiny and clean. So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it. I have tried the ‘reverse poo’ method which helps a bit – this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second – but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage.

The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive. Question: \\"What cell operatives arrived in the US shortly after May 2000?\\" Answer: \\"Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"I will explain it simply for you.

What is the correct answer to this question?","completion":"The correct answer to this question is that the male gametes in humans are produced by the testes (also known as testicles or gonads), which are the primary male reproductive organs. The testes are a pair of oval-shaped structures located in the scrotum, a pouch of skin hanging below the penis. The primary function of the testes is to produce sperm cells, or male gametes, and hormones, mainly testosterone. Testosterone plays a critical role in the development of male reproductive tissues and secondary sexual characteristics. Spermatogenesis, the process of sperm production, occurs in the seminiferous tubules within the testes. Each testis contains numerous seminiferous tubules, where the germ cells differentiate into mature sperm cells. This process begins with spermatogonia, which are undifferentiated male germ cells, and continues through various stages of development, including primary and secondary spermatocytes and spermatids. Finally, mature spermatozoa are formed. They are then released into the lumen of the seminiferous tubules. The mature spermatozoa then travel from the seminiferous tubules to the epididymis, a coiled tube next to each testis, where they undergo further maturation and gain mobility. During ejaculation, sperm are propelled from the epididymis through the vas deferens, a muscular tube that carries sperm from the epididymis to the urethra. Along the way, secretions from accessory glands such as the seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and bulbourethral glands mix with the sperm to form semen, which is eventually expelled through the penis during ejaculation. In summary, the testes are the structures responsible for producing male gametes in humans. Spermatogenesis occurs in the seminiferous tubules within each testis, with sperm cells going through several stages of development before becoming mature spermatozoa. These spermatozoa subsequently travel through the male reproductive system, ultimately exiting the body during ejaculation as part of semen."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This suggests that India is not acting defensively in response to an immediate threat from either of these countries.

Please answer the following question: This article: Michael Joseph Jackson was born in Gary, Indiana, near Chicago, on August 29, 1958. He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street. His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (née Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears. She was a Jehovah's Witness. His father, Joseph Walter \\"Joe\\" Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at U.S. Steel and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income. His father's great-grandfather, July \\"Jack\\" Gale, was a Native American medicine man and US Army scout. Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy). A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after birth.Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Michael; Michael said his father told him he had a \\"fat nose\\", and regularly physically and emotionally abused him during rehearsals. He recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, ready to physically punish any mistakes. Katherine Jackson stated that although whipping is considered abuse in more modern times, it was a common way to discipline children when Michael was growing up. Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon have said that their father was not abusive and that the whippings, which were harder on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 1993, Jackson said that his youth had been lonely and isolating.In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by their father which included Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine.

Sitting here, in a warm cafu00e9 on a cold, blustery November afternoon whilst reminiscing of summer days gone by... And when you think of a summer's day in Edinburgh, you think of The Peartree. The Peartree inside is a pub, with a big bar in the middle. It's the outside of The Peartree that counts. One of the few \\"beer gardens\\" in the Old Town, or Edinbrugh at all (and keep in mind that \\"beer garden\\" is the normal expression for any outdoor drinking area belonging to a pub -- it's not a garden at all, but stone floor with park benches, so don't expect grass, trees or picnic blankets).

They show rugby and football on a screen outside, they have outdoor shacks serving hot dogs / burgers in the summer. And attached upstairs / next door is a cool pub doing all sorts of dance nights like swing. So, The Peartree for me is the epitome of Edinburgh summer and Festival season.

The old county seat of Beichuan was abandoned and preserved as part of the Beichuan Earthquake Museum. Eight schools were toppled in Dujiangyan. A 56-year-old was killed in Dujiangyan during a rescue attempt on the Lingyanshan Ropeway, where due to the earthquake 11 tourists from Taiwan had been trapped inside cable cars since May 13. A 4-year-old boy named Zhu Shaowei (traditional Chinese: 朱紹維; simplified Chinese: 朱绍维; pinyin: Zhū Shàowéi) was also killed in Mianzhu City when a house collapsed on him and another was reported missing.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"In the given context, it is mentioned that one rescue team reported only 2,300 survivors from the town of Yingxiu in Wenchuan County, out of a total population of about 9,000. When comparing this number to 3,000, it is clear that the number of survivors from Yingxiu is smaller, with 2,300 survivors as opposed to the stated 3,000. The context goes on to discuss the devastating impact of the earthquake in various locations in Sichuan, detailing the massive losses in terms of human life, injuries, and destruction of buildings and infrastructure. The loss of life and property caused by the earthquake was indeed substantial and had significant consequences on the affected areas. In Beichuan County, Sichuan alone, it is mentioned that there were between 3,000 to 5,000 fatalities, with 10,000 people injured and 80% of the buildings destroyed. The old county seat of Beichuan was abandoned due to the extensive damage and preserved as part of the Beichuan Earthquake Museum. Dujiangyan also suffered massive destruction, with eight schools being toppled. Tragic incidents were reported, such as the death of a 56-year-old during a rescue attempt on the Lingyanshan Ropeway, and a 4-year-old boy named Zhu Shaowei, who lost his life in Mianzhu City when a house collapsed on him. In conclusion, when comparing the number of survivors from Yingxiu (2,300) with the given number of 3,000, the number of survivors in Yingxiu is smaller. This highlights the tragic scale of the disaster and serves as a reminder of the human loss and suffering experienced by those living in the impacted areas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Larry Wilson and Richard Parker are at a Manhattan morgue where they see their deceased CEO Bernie Lomax. Larry falsely claims Bernie as his uncle, so he can get some of Bernie's possessions including Bernie's credit card. At the insurance company, Larry and Richard are quizzed by their boss and Arthur Hummel, the company's internal investigator, who ask the two if they have the US2 million that Bernie embezzled. They deny knowing where the money is, but their boss believes they're lying and fires them. He also sends Hummel after them, giving him two weeks to prove their guilt. Over dinner (paid for with Bernie's credit card, in one of its many uses), Larry tells Richard he found a key to a safe deposit box in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands and asks Richard if he will use the computer at work to see if the 2 million is in Bernie's account. At first Richard refuses but ultimately gives in. Meanwhile, in the Virgin Islands, a voodoo queen named Mobu is hired by mobsters to find the money Bernie stole. She sends two servants—Henry and Charles (Tom Wright)—to go to New York, get Bernie's body, use a voodoo ceremony to reanimate him, and bring him back to her so he can lead her to the money. Their attempts to bring Bernie back are plagued by accidents. They prepare in a bathroom at a sleazy porno theater for the voodoo ceremony, but having lost the sacrificial chicken, they use a pigeon instead.

Article: Do you or someone you know use a mobile phone? In today's world, many people use a mobile phone especially businessmen and businesswomen. These people are an important part of the business world and help our economies develop. In fact in some countries even children and the elderly use mobile phones to keep in touch with family and friends. We know how useful it is to have a mobile phone, but do we know how safe these phones are? Some scientists say that mobile phones could be a risk to our health. So, money is being given to scientific research to find out if mobile phones may be harmful in any way. What does the future look like? Is a hands - free phone the answer? The idea behind hands - free sets is simple and maybe they are a safer way for people to communicate. The hands - free set has a piece in your ear and a microphone near your mouth which is connected to a wire that goes into your phone. Some scientists think this is a much safer way to use a phone. Some scientists have proved that a mobile phone 10 centimeters from your head is far safer than if the headset is right against your ear. Some reports say that hands - free sets have 95% less radiation exposure, while other reports say that hands - free sets expose you to more radiation. Governments and the mobile phone industry are researching the effects, including: * the effects of radio waves on blood pressure and the brain, such as the abilities to concentrate, remember and learn the connections between mobile phone use and brain cancer long - term effects of mobile phone use, looking at health histories of people who have used mobiles since the 1980s. They will be looking at both current mobile phones and the new generation of 4G phones. The results from these studies will help us understand more about the world beyond mobile communications. Wouldn't it be strange if scientists discovered that mobile phones were too dangerous and we had to stop using them and go back to writing letter and using the normal telephone? Question: From the passage we can know _ . - wearing headsets is a safer way when we communicate with mobile phones - nobody can tell exactly which the safer way to use a mobile phone is - we'd better stop using hands - free sets while scientists are looking at them - there is some connections between mobile phone use and some illness A:","completion":"From the passage, we can know that nobody can tell exactly which the safer way to use a mobile phone is.

Q: Passage: After their loss to Atlanta, Washington hosted the Minnesota Vikings, looking to snap an 8-game home losing streak. The first quarter was dominated by the Vikings, as they reached the redzone three times and intercepted Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III. However, the Redskins defense was able to stiffen in the redzone, holding the Vikings to three Blair Walsh field goals of 20, 27, and 27 yards, to give the Vikings a 9-0 advantage after one quarter. In the second, Washington finally was able to sustain a drive. The Redskins drive stalled at the Vikings' 33-yard line, however, and new Redskins kicker Kai Forbath got his first NFL opportunity, having replaced Billy Cundiff, who was cut earlier in the week, and delivered a 50-yard boot to trim the deficit to 9-3. After a Vikings three-and-out, Washington was able to run an 11-play drive that gave it its first advantage of the game, as Alfred Morris scored on a 1-yard run and gave Washington a 10-9 lead. On Minnesota's ensuing possession, Vikings quarterback Christian Ponder was sacked, fumbled, and the fumble was subsequently recovered by Lorenzo Alexander of Washington, setting the Redskins up at the Vikings 6. Robert Griffin III then found fullback Darrel Young for a 6-yard touchdown pass, extending the Redskins advantage to 17-9. In the third, Washington continued imposing its will, as they drove down the field again, this time culminating in a Robert Griffin III touchdown run, his fifth rushing touchdown of the year, setting a Washington Redskins record for rushing touchdowns by a Redskins QB and extending the Washington advantage to 24-9. The Vikings would not back down, though, and Blair Walsh connected again, this time from 37 yards, his fourth field goal on the day, to cut into the lead, and make it 24-12. In the fourth, the Vikings possessed the ball, but Ponder threw an interception straight into the waiting arms of Redskins free safety Madieu Williams, who returned it 24 yards to put the game nearly on ice, at 31-12 Washington. The Vikings, however, proved resilient. On their ensuing drive, the Vikings found the endzone for the first time on the day, with Ponder finding wide receiver Michael Jenkins for a 9-yard score. Ponder subsequently found Kyle Rudolph on a successful two-point conversion attempt, and the Redskins lead was cut to 31-20. After Washington could not extend its advantage, Minnesota got the ball back. Once again, Minnesota scored, this time Ponder found Rudolph to cut the lead to 31-26. This time, however, the two-point conversion came up short, meaning Minnesota would again need to score a touchdown to complete its rally. However, Washington's rookie QB would see to it that no comeback would be complete on his team on this day, as Griffin, on 3rd-and-6 from his own 24, found a seam on a designed quarterback draw, and raced down the sideline for a 76-yard touchdown run, the longest such rush TD by a QB since Kordell Stewart scrambled for an 80-yard score against the Carolina Panthers in the 1996 season. With the score now 38-26 Redskins, the Vikings tried to rally again, and were able to reach the Redskins' goal line. However, with less than a half minute remaining, DeAngelo Hall intercepted Christian Ponder, to officially preserve the 38-26 win. With the win, Washington improved to 3-3, snapped an 8-game home losing streak, and will have an opportunity to take first place in the NFC East with a victory over the defending Super Bowl XLVI champion New York Giants next week.

I was victimised by a gang of bent police men, who arrested me and set me up to get charged with something that I did not do which I believe was connected to other criminals who live in my area, who I believe were connected to a gang of DJ’s who were involved stealing intellectual and copyright works from me (likely their party organisers and drug dealer buddies). I was sent to court and found guilty based on no evidence by a magistrate court judge who was later struck off for corruption after defrauding an old lady of over a million pounds! I was not put in prison for this minor offense but did receive a minor criminal record. This criminal records the same DJ’s and bent ex-police have used to ruin my reputation and career. One of the bent policemen, who incidentally had already been thrown out of the police force for car insurance fraud, even turned up at the uni I went to and spread vicious slander to ruin me there, and in the area that I lived at the time. I was then victimised by the people at the famous college that I went to and all my intellectual and copyright works stolen. Which I note, generated millions for others. Once they made their money and gained credibility on the back of my hard work, innovation and some may say genius, the thieves then did all they could to ruin my reputation in the entertainment industry and in the area that I live. Making my life extremely hard for no more reason than having my work stolen. If I wasn't so tough, and for a few people left who have at least some integrity, I would be dead now, like the rest of their victims.

This plan included setting specific goals for exercise, nutrition, stress management, and sleep. Step 3: Exercise consistently Joe committed to going to the gym at least four days a week, focusing on a combination of cardio and resistance training. He understood that regular exercise, while not only helping in weight management, also increases blood flow and energy levels, which can greatly impact libido levels. Step 4: Adopt a balanced and nutrient-dense diet While eating vegan food was a good start for Joe, he realized he needed to focus more on consuming a balanced diet with a variety of nutrient-dense foods. He designed a meal plan that included ample fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats like nuts and seeds. He also made an effort to limit processed foods and excess sugar, which can negatively affect libido and overall health. Step 5: Manage stress Joe understood that chronic stress is a major factor in diminishing libido. He began incorporating stress management techniques into his daily routine such as meditation, deep breathing, and engaging in hobbies that brought him joy and relaxation. Step 6: Prioritize quality sleep Getting enough quality sleep is essential for maintaining healthy libido levels. Joe set a goal to aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night and created a nighttime routine that would help him relax and wind down before bed.

Question: With whom does Swagger take refuge after his escape? Title: Shooter Movie plot: As the film opens, US Special Forces sniper Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) and his scout Donny Fenn (Lane Garrison) lie in wait in the hills of Ethiopia, ready to deliver covering fire for a US convoy heading back to base through hostile country. They pass the time with small talk, and Donny looks at a photo of his wife, Sarah (Kate Mara). Far below, a lone truck carrying a machine gun in the back speeds towards the American convoy. Swagger takes out the shooter and driver, each with a single shot to the head. It seems like the mission is over as the Americans make their way down the road until a horde of hostile militia appear, firing on the soldiers. Donny relays target information while Swagger systematically picks off numerous hostiles, allowing the US forces to escape.Protecting the convoy has revealed the sniper's position, and soon the two snipers are under heavy fire. Back at base, their commanding officer is more concerned about avoiding detection, as the Americans aren't supposed to be in the country, and Swagger and Donny are abandoned, left to fend for themselves, left for dead. An enemy helicopter begins to strafe their position. Donny is killed. Swagger fires futilely at the helicopter with his sniper rifle until he uncovers a Barret 50 caliber VBM82A3 SASR, and returns fire on the helicopter, bringing it down in flames. The smoke engulfs the screen as the helicopter crashes and explodes.Three years later Swagger is a private citizen, living in the mountains, a recluse from the world that abandoned him. Unshaven and long haired, he lives alone; his only companion his dog, trained to open the fridge and take out a cold beer for Swagger as he returns to his cabin.

В автономном аспекте искусства, который является частью его \\"двойственного характера\\", Франкфуртские теоретики увидели параллель с несгибаемостью критической теории. Согласно данному подходу, искусство обладает как социальными, так и автономными функциями. С одной стороны, искусство выражает основные ценности и идеи культуры, в которой оно было создано, а с другой стороны, искусство является самодостаточной системой, не зависящей от внешних воздействий. Критическая теория, разрабатываемая Франкфуртской школой, стремилась раскрыть и обозначить социальные, политические и экономические противоречия и процессы, которые мешали развитию свободного и равноправного общества. Эта теория носит противостоящий характер, так как критикует господствующие системы власти и культурные нормы. Таким образом, несгибаемость критической теории проявляется в ее стремлении выявлять и анализировать социальные проблемы и процессы независимо от принятых видений и условий. Сходство между автономным аспектом искусства и несгибаемостью критической теории заключается в том, что обе сферы демонстрируют самостоятельность от традиционных догм и структур. Искусство, как и критическая теория, основывается на самостоятельном мышлении и анализе, что позволяет им избегать ограничений, наложенных традиционными идеологиями и культурными нормами.

Население Руанды Translate to English English:","completion":"The Population of Rwanda Rwanda is an East African country known for its scenic landscapes, mainly comprising mountains and hills. Despite being one of the smallest countries in Africa, it has a large population, which has been steadily increasing over the years. As of 2021, the population of Rwanda is estimated to be around 13 million people. This marks a significant increase from the 1994 figure of about 7.95 million, a year that saw Rwanda devastated by a horrific genocide. Consequently, population growth has been an essential aspect of the country's recovery and rebuilding process. The population density in Rwanda is one of the highest in Africa, with approximately 525 people per square kilometer. The nation's urban population is relatively low, with approximately 18% of the people living in urban areas. The capital city, Kigali, is the largest and most populous city, accounting for around 1.2 million residents. Most Rwandans belong to one of three main ethnic groups: Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa. The Hutu ethnic group comprises about 85% of the population, while the Tutsi and Twa account for 14% and 1%, respectively. Though ethnic tensions played a significant role in the 1994 genocide, the Rwandan government has since implemented policies and campaigns to promote unity and reconciliation among these groups. The official languages of Rwanda are Kinyarwanda, English, French, and Swahili, with Kinyarwanda being the most common language spoken among the people. The literacy rate has been improving, with the current rate standing at approximately 73%. Rwanda's population has a relatively young age structure, with about 60% of the people under the age of 25. This presents challenges in terms of education and employment opportunities but also provides the nation with a potentially vibrant workforce for future economic growth. The life expectancy in Rwanda has been increasing as well, currently standing at around 69 years for both males and females. The Rwandan government has been emphasizing economic growth and development in the country, focusing primarily on sectors such as agriculture, tourism, and information technology. The population growth comes with the need to provide adequate resources, including education, healthcare, and job opportunities for the Rwandan people. To sum up, Rwanda's population has been steadily growing in the past few decades despite its history of conflict and tragedy. The country's government has made strides in fostering unity among ethnic groups and investing in economic growth to ensure the wellbeing of its citizens. Continued progress in healthcare, education, and economic sectors will be crucial for Rwanda's future development and the welfare of its people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While Brett was more focused on socializing and enjoying the party scene, Matthew was the complete opposite, dedicating himself to his academic pursuits without fail. Step 1: Establish their differing priorities This contrast between their personalities highlighted the fact that they each had a different set of priorities. Brett believed in living in the moment, attending parties, and enjoying his youth. In contrast, Matthew felt that his college years were an opportunity to advance his future career prospects and dedicated the majority of his time to getting a solid education. Step 2: Explore the consequences of their choices As college progressed, the consequences of their choices began to manifest. Brett's grades started declining due to his constant partying, while Matthew maintained a stellar academic record. Despite their differences, they remained friends and occasionally attempted to influence each other's habits. Matthew would try to convince Brett to pay more attention to his studies, while Brett would coax Matthew into attending a party or two. Step 3: Show how they influenced each other Through the years, they both influenced each other in subtle ways. Brett helped Matthew to realize the importance of having a social life and creating memorable experiences outside of his academic obligations. On the other hand, Matthew's disciplined approach to his studies prompted Brett to put more effort into his college work, improving his own academic performance to some extent. Step 4: Describe the outcome of their college experience As graduation approached, both Brett and Matthew had experienced growth, not just in their respective academics or social lives, but also as individuals. They had learned valuable lessons from one another, which they would carry with them beyond their college years. Matthew had learned to have a better balance in his life, making time for leisure activities and socializing while still excelling academically. Meanwhile, Brett acknowledged the importance of maintaining a good work ethic in achieving his goals. Graduation turned out to be a bittersweet moment for both of them, as they looked back on their journey together and prepared to face the next chapter of their lives. In conclusion, Brett and Matthew's contrasting college experiences resulted in mutual growth and self-improvement. Through their opposing approaches to college life, they discovered the value of balance between academics and social interactions and developed lifelong skills that would serve them well in their future endeavors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They express different historical timeframes for the construction and duration of the subject in question. The first sentence, \\"It was built in the 14th century and had until the 17th century,\\" implies that the structure or object was constructed in the 14th century and continued to exist or remained in use until the 17th century. This indicates a definite timeline, starting in the 14th century and ending in the 17th century. The second sentence, \\"It was built in the 17th century and had in the 14th century,\\" does not follow a clear timeline and appears to have a misplaced phrase. It states that the structure or object was built in the 17th century, but then inaccurately refers to the 14th century.

Once the substances trypsin and chymotrypsin have broken down the proteins in the stomach into smaller chains of amino acids, other pancreatic enzymes such as amylase and lipase work on the carbohydrates and fats, respectively. This action further breaks down carbohydrates into simple sugars and fats into fatty acids and glycerol. As digestion progresses, the resulting smaller molecules are absorbed into the bloodstream. The increased glucose triggers the pancreas to release insulin. Insulin is a hormone that signals body cells to absorb glucose from the bloodstream for energy, glycogen synthesis, or conversion to fat. Simultaneously, the amino acids, fatty acids, and glycerol are absorbed by cells as building blocks for new proteins and fats, as well as for generating energy. Lastly, the pancreas also secretes another hormone called glucagon when necessary. Glucagon works in opposition to insulin, signaling the liver to release stored glucose into the bloodstream if blood sugar levels drop too low. This intricate system involving insulin and glucagon maintains a proper energy balance and ensures stable blood sugar levels within the body. In summary, the last step in the process involves the body regulating blood sugar levels through hormones insulin and glucagon and the absorption of nutrients like amino acids, fatty acids, and simple sugars into body cells for growth, repair, and energy production. This intricate balance is essential for maintaining overall health and homeostasis for optimal bodily function."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At her Catholic girls school, she quickly makes a new friend in Lynne Stone due to their shared love of dance and Dance TV. When Robert nixes the idea of her traveling to downtown Chicago to try out, Janey accompanies Lynne to the auditions. At the auditions, an enemy is made of spoiled rich girl Natalie Sands when she rudely parks her car where Lynne is walking. The auditions are going well until Lynne's partner gets her cut (it is later found out that Natalie paid him to have her kicked out). Janey and a dreamboat named Jeff both shine, albeit partnered with others at first. They are later paired once the final cut is made. Jeff loves to dance although his father is drilling him to go to trade school and is following his heart instead of his father's wishes. The two butt heads initially due to their disparate upbringings. Despite Jeff's natural ability to dance, he has never taken a class. Janey has been taking both gymnastics and dance classes for ten years. Helping them to get off on the wrong foot is also Janey's inability to practice when it's convenient for Jeff. Things are further complicated by Natalie's meddling (she finds out that Janey skipped choir practice to meet Jeff and calls her father to tell, posing as \\"Sister Natalie\\"). An excellent opportunity for both girls to get back at Natalie presents itself when Jeff is invited to her coming out party. They make copies of her invitation (provided by Jeff's best friend Drew) and pass them out to strangers all over town. Jeff and Drew attend the party and watch the chaos ensue when all of the extra invited people show up (as do Lynne, Janey and Jeff's sister Maggie, watching from the window). Janey and Jeff have become close through their rehearsals. One night, he tells her to meet him not at the rehearsal studio but at a club. While they are enjoying some unstructured dance time, Jeff is taken away by a girl...

Phillip Bellamy, a leading barrister, tells his wife, psychiatrist Anne Dyson, about his most recent case defending a young man, Harry Jukes, who has apparently shot a policeman on a country road and been found by police still holding the gun. Bellamy is convinced of his guilt but Anne is less sure. Much of her practice is with troubled young people and she feels there is more to the story than the police evidence. Anne visits Harry in prison. He is depressed and distrustful but finally agrees to talk to her. Harry's story is that he took a Bentley Continental car to impress a girl but when she went off with another boy decided to take the car for a spin before dumping it. Swerving to avoid another car he burst a tyre but could not find any tools in the boot to change the wheel. He asked the driver of a car parked in the copse nearby for help but he was occupied with his girl and refused. Harry was spotted by a policeman on a bike who stopped to help. He flagged down a lorry to ask to borrow a jack. The lorry stopped but the passenger immediately produced a gun and shot the policeman. Harry managed to grab the gun off the killer as the lorry drove away. Shortly after, a police car arrived and Harry was arrested.

Do those questions have the same meaning? Choose from: --no --yes","completion":"\\"Yes\\", both of the questions you have asked do pertain to the same basic inquiry, although the wording is slightly different. They both deal with understanding the differences between cascade and cascode amplifiers. A cascade connection (also known as a two-stage amplification) and a cascode configuration are both multistage designs of amplifiers, they are used to gain advantages in terms of bandwidth, gain, and stability. However, they accomplish this in different ways, hence leading to different characteristics on their performances. [1] The Cascade configuration: In a cascade amplifier, two or more amplifier stages are sequentially connected (cascaded), with the output of one stage serving as the input for the next one. Each individual stage can have a different gain based upon the requirement. The total gain is then the product of the gain of each stage. This configuration is mainly employed for getting a high gain. However, as the number of stages increases, the gain bandwidth decreases because each stage adds a certain amount of phase shift that in turn can lead to stability issues if not properly compensated. Moreover, the cascade amplifier is also subject to the gain-bandwidth tradeoff, where an increase in gain will lead to a decrease in bandwidth. The fundamental benefit of cascade amplifiers is that they have the ability to provide a large amount of amplification, especially for low-level signals, before the signal is applied to a power amplifier. Therefore, they can be beneficial in improving the signal-to-noise ratio. [2] The Cascode configuration: The cascode amplifier consists of a common-emitter stage followed by a common-base stage in case of a BJT, or common-source followed by common-gate for a FET. Unlike the cascade configuration where the stages are connected in series, the cascode configuration has stages connected in a specific back-to-back arrangement in such a way that the output of the first transistor is the input of the second transistor. The main benefits of the cascode amplifier are improved frequency response (bandwidth), better linearity, lower noise, and a high input impedance along with low output impedance. Although it does not have a large gain like a cascade amplifier, it significantly improves the gain-bandwidth product. One more notable advantage of a cascode amplifier is its ability to isolate the Miller effect (an effect that reduces the gain and bandwidth of an amplifier), thus improving the amplifier’s high frequency response. The main drawback of the cascode amplifier is that it needs a high supply voltage because the voltages of the two stages are effectively added together. In conclusion, both configurations have their own advantages and disadvantages. The cascade amplifier is good for systems that require high amplification of weak signals, while the cascode amplifier is an excellent choice for systems requiring a wide bandwidth and noise immunity. The choice between the two depends heavily on the specific application and the needs of the system in question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: James shook his money box again. Nothing! He carefully counted the coins that lay on the bed. 24. 17 was all that he had. The bicycle he wanted was at least 90! How was he going to get the end of the money? He knew that his friends all had bicycles. It was hard to hang around with people when you were the only one without wheels. He thought about what he could do. It was no use asking his parents, for he knew they had no money to save. There was only one way to get money, and that was to earn it. He would have to find a job. But who would hire him and what could he do? He decided to ask Mr. Clay for advice, who usually had opinions on most things. \\"Well, you can start right here,\\" said Mr. Clay. \\"My windows need cleaning and my car needs washing. \\" That was the beginning of James' part-time job. For three months he worked every day after finishing his homework. He was amazed by the different kinds of jobs that people found for him to do. He took dogs and babies for walks, cleared out cupboards, and mended books. He lost count of the number of cars he washed and windows he cleaned, but the money increased and he knew that he would soon have enough for the bicycle he was eager to have. The day finally came when James counted his money and found 94. 32. He wasted no time and went down to the shop to pick up the bicycle he wanted. He rode proudly home, looking forward to showing his new bicycle to his friends. It had been hard working for the money, but James knew that he valued his bicycle far more since he had bought it with his own money. Question: The only way for James to earn money was to _ . Options: A: find a part-time job B: borrow some from his parents C: ask Mr. Clay for help D: study very hard A:","completion":"The correct answer to this question would be A: find a part-time job. From the context of the article, it's clear that James' sole answer to his problem was to earn money. His parents were unable to provide any form of financial assistance, as explicitly stated in the passage. Asking Mr. Clay for help was indeed part of his action plan, but what Mr. Clay offered him was not a cash loan or a favor, but an opportunity to earn money - a job. The form of help Mr. Clay provided is differenct from simply giving money or a loan. So, looking through the options, we can rule out B: borrow some from his parents, as the article mentioned that the parents didn't have any money to spare. We can also rule out C: ask Mr. Clay for help, as although James did ask Mr. Clay for some assistance, what he received in return was not a handout but an opportunity for employment. D: study very hard can also be ruled out as the article makes no reference to studying hard as a way to earn money. In fact, the article posits the idea that James was focused on doing multiple odd jobs to amass the required sum for his desired bicycle. So, the remaining option is A: find a part-time job. This fits best with the provided information in the article, as James did various tasks like cleaning windows or washing cars in order to earn money for his bicycle. He embarked on a part-time endeavor and developed a work ethic as he carried out a variety of jobs. This independent venture of his to earn money, which was necessitated by the situation he was in, yielded the required results after a dedicated period of three months. So, the most fitting answer to the question \\"The only way for James to earn money was to____\\" is indeed A: find a part-time job."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Bryant identified \\"Son of Three\\" as an example of \\"when the Breeders set out to rock\\", noting \\"the chugging guitars and stomping drums.\\" The Breeders re-recorded \\"Son of Three\\" in July 2002 for its release as Title TK's third single; this version is faster than the album track, and reflects the speed they were playing the song in concert that year. The lyrics of both \\"Son of Three\\" and \\"The She\\" suggest extended road trips with unknown outcomes. The album's next song, \\"Put on a Side\\", has a distinctive bassline and a cramped, repressive feel. Berger wrote that Kim Deal's \\"voice grinds sweetly, weariedly, sloppily inside your brain,\\" as she repeats twelve words over the course of the song: \\"Better I better I stayed up / Better mono, put on a side.\\"An earlier version of \\"Full on Idle\\", Title TK's eighth track, was released on the Amps' Pacer in 1995. In a 1997 interview, Deal expressed an interest in redoing multiple Amps songs, partially because she did not feel Pacer was well recorded. Bryant opined that both versions of \\"Full on Idle\\" sound almost the same, but The Village Voice's Jessica Grose wrote that the Breeders' rendition is noticeably slower. In Cibula's view, this version contains elements of country music, cumbia, and ska. The Guardian's Betty Clarke cited the line \\"Obey your colorist, bleach it all away\\" as an example of Title TK's amusing, off-center lyrics. On \\"Sinister Foxx\\", Deal repeatedly sings \\"Has anyone seen the iguana?\\" She has explained this as being a reference to buying marijuana: \\"Have you ever bought a bag of weed? You walk in, and the pot dealer's got an empty terrarium ... Every time I go to a pot dealer's house, there's no iguana.\\" Another line, \\"I'm in beer class every Thursday night\\", refers to the alcohol awareness classes that Richard Presley attended after being caught driving while drunk.

This was based on the woman's actual diary, which I read many years later. She said in her diary that her parents died when she was little and all their bothers and sisters had to work the farm to feed themselves. She learned to mow, which was not lady-like. She was afraid that no prince charming would want a woman with sun-browned, calloused hands, but this husband was so happy that his new wife knew how to mow, and she was happy to do it. Both were widowed and together they worked to build a new home. It was so, so sad when the baby died. Of course, if they had it today, I am sure it would have been fine.

The sporf is no innovation; back in 1940 the \\"sporf\\" was born. It took me until 2015 to notice this one thanks to its rather pleasant design. The sporf is a little like most strategy documents that I come across. It is one implement designed to serve a multitude of goals, but with one fatal flaw: you can only ever use one part of the sporf / strategy at any one time. With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork. In strategy formation, we can develop a multitude of potential purposes within one document, killer vision statement or mission. But it's important to recognise that the teams around us will only ever be able to do one thing really well at any one time.

This local vote in a small, remote part of the Soviet Union made headlines around the world; it was an unprecedented defiance of republic and national authorities. On February 22, 1988, in what became known as the \\"Askeran clash\\", two Azerbaijanis were killed by Karabakh police. These deaths, announced on state radio, led to the Sumgait Pogrom. Between February 26 and March 1, the city of Sumgait (Azerbaijan) saw violent anti-Armenian rioting during which 32 people were killed. The authorities totally lost control and occupied the city with paratroopers and tanks; nearly all of the 14,000 Armenian residents of Sumgait fled. When was the Askeran clash?

Write a title for this article: By Shelby Lin Erdman, CNN updated 4:13 PM EDT, Sat October 18, 2014 (CNN) -- Two island paradises may be spared heavy damage this weekend, as hurricanes roar through the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The worst was over early Saturday for the British territory of Bermuda in the North Atlantic Ocean, after Hurricane Gonzalo passed over. And in the South Pacific, forecasters say the center of Hurricane Ana will slink by about 150 miles southwest of Hawaii. Over 80% of households in Bermuda were without power, according to a local newspaper, the Royal Gazette, which has reported no deaths, injuries or major damage due to the storm. A tropical storm a week earlier had knocked out power to nearly as many customers, the Gazette reported. Gonzalo weakened from a powerful Category 3 storm Friday evening to a Category 2 storm, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. It battered the island with wind gusts that topped 115 mph at one point, the agency said, as the storm moved in a northeasterly direction at 16 mph. Ahead of the storm, Bermuda closed schools, shut down bus and ferry service, and opened up shelters. Forecasters predicted Gonzalo will weaken to as it moves past Bermuda and pushes into the North Atlantic. 2014 Atlantic Hurricane Season facts Hurricane Ana strengthened into a Category 1 storm Friday afternoon with maximum sustained winds of 75 miles per hour, according to the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu. But the hurricane is far enough away that forecasters predict its effects will amount to tropical storm conditions in parts of the islands over the weekend. But Gov. Neil Abercrombie isn't taking any chances. Abercrombie declared a state of emergency earlier this week in advance of Ana's arrival. The emergency proclamation \\"allows us to respond quickly to any potential impacts,\\" he said. Ana could cause dangerous surf conditions, coastal flooding and mudslides as it moves through the region. Some areas could see up to the 8 inches of rain with as much as 12 inches in isolated areas. Hurricanes are a rare occurrence in Hawaii. Only three storms have made a direct landfall on the islands in the past 55 years, according to the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. But it's already been an unusual year for Hawaiians, weatherwise. The island chain has already been hit by two damaging tropical storms so far this season.

Q:Information: - A castle (from ) is a type of fortified structure built in Europe and the Middle East during the Middle Ages by nobility. Scholars debate the scope of the word \\"castle\\", but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a palace, which is not fortified; from a fortress, which was not always a residence for nobility; and from a fortified settlement, which was a public defence though there are many similarities among these types of construction. Usage of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses. Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built, they took on a great many forms with many different features, although some, such as curtain walls and arrowslits, were commonplace. - The Middle East is a transcontinental region centered on Western Asia and Egypt. The corresponding adjective is \\"Middle-Eastern\\" and the derived noun is \\"Middle-Easterner\\". The term has come into wider usage as a replacement of the term Near East (as opposed to Far East) beginning in the early 20th century. - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period.

Urban areas are created through urbanization and are categorized by urban morphology as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs. In urbanism, the term contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets and in urban sociology or urban anthropology it contrasts with natural environment. The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the urban revolution led to the creation of human civilization with modern urban planning, which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources leads to human impact on the environment. - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe.

There are a few aspects of the review that contribute to this conclusion, which we will explore further. 1. The reviewer mentions that the movie has an \\"interesting\\" screenplay. This term is not particularly strong in conveying a positive or negative judgment, as the reviewer is simply stating that it is engaging in some way. However, it implies that there might be some aspects of the screenplay that the reviewer appreciates. 2. After the word \\"interesting,\\" the reviewer states that the screenplay \\"lags badly in the middle.\\" This is a negative evaluation, as it suggests that the movie's pace becomes slow and uninteresting, which could negatively impact the viewer's enjoyment. 3. The review continues by pointing out the lack of consistency in the movie's tone, mentioning that it \\"lurches between not-very-funny comedy, unconvincing dramatics.\\" By using the term \\"lurches,\\" the reviewer implies that the movie does not handle transitions between different tones effectively. Additionally, the mention of \\"not-very-funny comedy\\" and \\"unconvincing dramatics\\" indicate that the reviewer finds both the comedic and dramatic aspects of the movie unsatisfactory. 4. Lastly, the reviewer references the movie's \\"last-minute action\\" as \\"strongly reminiscent of Run Lola Run.\\" This comparison can be perceived in two ways: either as an appreciation of the action scenes or a criticism of the seemingly derivative nature of these scenes. As the reviewer does not provide an explicit positive or negative judgment about the action scenes, it is difficult to determine their overall satisfaction with this aspect of the movie. In conclusion, while there are some potentially interesting aspects that the reviewer acknowledges, the negative points outweigh them overall. The review highlights concerns related to the screenplay, pacing, and tone inconsistency, leading us to determine that the reviewer's opinion of the movie is primarily negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Develop questions for your interviewer: Asking thoughtful questions about the company and role will showcase your dedication and interest in the position. Keep in mind that interviews are not just for the employer to learn about you, but for you to learn about the company and whether it would be a good fit. 5.

Dressing a step above the company's expected dress code will convey your respect and professionalism. 6. Practice good body language: Maintain eye contact, smile, give a firm handshake, and sit up straight. These gestures demonstrate that you are confident, respectful, and attentive. 7. Follow up after the interview: Send a thank-you email within 24 hours of the interview. This message should express your appreciation for the opportunity, reiterate your interest in the position, and remind the interviewers of any key points from your conversation.

Charles Elwood \\"Chuck\\" Yeager (; born February 13, 1923) is a retired United States Air Force general officer, flying ace and record-setting test pilot. In 1947, he became the first pilot confirmed to have exceeded the speed of sound in level flight. Yeager's career began in World War II as a private in the United States Army Air Forces. In 1973, Yeager was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame, arguably aviation's highest honor. In December 1975, the U.S. Congress awarded Yeager a silver medal \\"equivalent to a noncombat Medal of Honor ... for contributing immeasurably to aerospace science by risking his life in piloting the XS-1 research airplane faster than the speed of sound on October 14, 1947.\\" President Gerald Ford presented the medal to Yeager in a ceremony at the White House on December 8, 1976. Yeager, who never attended college and was often modest about his background, is considered by many, including Flying Magazine, the California Hall of Fame, the State of West Virginia, National Aviation Hall of Fame, a few U.S. presidents, and the United States Army Air Force, to be one of the greatest pilots of all time. Despite his lack of higher education, he has been honored in his home state. Marshall University has named its highest academic scholarship, the Society of Yeager Scholars, in his honor. Yeager was also the chairman of Experimental Aircraft Association's Young Eagle Program from 1994-2004, and has been named the program's chairman emeritus. Yeager Airport in Charleston, West Virginia, is named in his honor. The Interstate 64/Interstate 77 bridge over the Kanawha River in Charleston is named in his honor. On October 19, 2006, the state of West Virginia also honored Yeager with a marker along Corridor G (part of U.S. 119) in his home Lincoln County, and also renamed part of the highway the Yeager Highway. Yeager is an honorary board member of the humanitarian organization Wings of Hope. On August 25, 2009, Governor Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver announced that Yeager would be one of 13 California Hall of Fame inductees in The California Museum's yearlong exhibit. The induction ceremony was on December 1, 2009, in Sacramento, California. Flying Magazine ranked Yeager number 5 on its 2013 list of The 51 Heroes of Aviation; he is the highest-ranked living person on the list. The Civil Air Patrol, the volunteer auxiliary of the USAF, awards the Charles E. \\"Chuck\\" Yeager Award to its Senior Members as part of its Aerospace Education program.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Definition: In this task, based on the given context word, you are asked to create a pair of sentences each containing a blank (_). The sentence pair should look similar and should be about two different persons (PersonX and PersonY). Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \\"sympathetic\\" and \\"stern\\") which express contrasting attributes about the two persons. The answer to the first and the second sentence must be PersonX and PersonY, respectively. PersonX and PersonY should not be equally likely to fill the blank. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use the names of real people (e.g., Donald Trump, Putin, etc.) in your sentences. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences e.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that PersonX and PersonY have the same gender.

Article: Watching bison up close is fascinating, like watching a grass fire about to leap out of control. With their huge, wedge-shaped heads and silver-dollar-size brown eyes, the 2,000-pound animals are symbols of another place and time. More than 100 bison now roam the 30,000-acre American Prairie Reserve in eastern Montana -- the first time they've inhabited that region in a century. Direct descendants of the tens of millions of bison that once populated the Western plains, they represent an epic effort: to restore a piece of America's prairie to the national grandeur that Lewis and Clark extolled two centuries ago. During that famous expedition across the Western states to the Pacific, the two explorers encountered so many bison that they had to wait hours for one herd to pass. In order to protect what's here and reintroduce long-gone wildlife (something the World Wildlife Fund is helping with), the American Prairie Foundation began purchasing land from local ranchers in 2004. It now owns 30,000 acres and has grazing privileges on another 57,000. Its goal over the next 25 years is to assemble three million acres, the largest area of land devoted to wildlife management in the continental United States. Already, herds of elk, deer, and pronghorn antelope roam the grasslands, where visitors can camp, hike, and bike. Cottonwoods and willows are thriving along streams, creating habitats for bobcats, beavers, and other animals. Not everyone shares APF's vision. Some residents of Phillips County (pop. 3,904) worry that the area could become a prairie Disneyland, overcrowded with tourists. But the biggest obstacle is the ranchers themselves, whose cattle compete with prairie dogs and bison for grass and space. \\"People like me have no intention of selling their ranches,\\" says Dale Veseth, who heads the Ranchers Stewardship Alliance of 35 families in Phillips County and whose family has been ranching here since 1886. \\"They've been a labor of love through the generations.\\" Instead, he wants APF to pay or ranchers to raise...

See Ethicon, Inc. v. American Cyanamid Co., 369 F.Supp. 934, 936-37 (D.N.J.1973). Therefore, even though it appears as if the defendants have never directly threatened the plaintiffs with legal action in the United States, the court concludes that the plaintiffs have introduced sufficient evidence to support their claim that they reasonably feared a lawsuit if they attempted to enter the U.S. market.

Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"The region of France would classify mangas under which term?\\" is in \\"European comics studies began with Töpffer's theories of his own work in the 1840s, which emphasized panel transitions and the visual–verbal combination. No further progress was made until the 1970s. Pierre Fresnault-Deruelle then took a semiotics approach to the study of comics, analyzing text–image relations, page-level image relations, and image discontinuities, or what Scott McCloud later dubbed \\"closure\\". In 1987, Henri Vanlier introduced the term multicadre, or \\"multiframe\\", to refer to the comics a page as a semantic unit. By the 1990s, theorists such as Benoît Peeters and Thierry Groensteen turned attention to artists' poïetic creative choices. Thierry Smolderen and Harry Morgan have held relativistic views of the definition of comics, a medium that has taken various, equally valid forms over its history. Morgan sees comics as a subset of \\"les littératures dessinées\\" (or \\"drawn literatures\\"). French theory has come to give special attention to the page, in distinction from American theories such as McCloud's which focus on panel-to-panel transitions. Since the mid-2000s, Neil Cohn has begun analyzing how comics are understood using tools from cognitive science, extending beyond theory by using actual psychological and neuroscience experiments. This work has argued that sequential images and page layouts both use separate rule-bound \\"grammars\\" to be understood that extend beyond panel-to-panel transitions and categorical distinctions of types of layouts, and that the brain's comprehension of comics is similar to comprehending other domains, such as language and music.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, \\"les littératures dessinées\\" would be the term that the region of France would classify manga under. This term, which translates to \\"drawn literatures,\\" refers to the broader category of visual storytelling forms such as comics and graphic narratives, including manga. Harry Morgan, a comics theorist, sees comics as a subset of \\"les littératures dessinées,\\" which emphasizes the diverse and equally valid forms this medium has taken throughout history. While French comics theory gives special attention to page-level analysis, manga, as part of \\"drawn literatures,\\" would still fall under this term in the context of French classification."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Salvatore obviously shies from committed relationships and has not been to his home village of Giancaldo, Sicily in 30 years. As his girlfriend asks him who Alfredo is, Salvatore flashes back to his childhood. It is a few years after World War II. Six-year-old Salvatore is the mischievous, intelligent son of a war widow. Nicknamed Toto, he discovers a love for films and spends every free moment at the movie house Cinema Paradiso. Although they initially start off on tense terms, he develops a friendship with the fatherly projectionist, Alfredo, who takes a shine to the young boy and often lets him watch movies from the projection booth. During the shows, the audience can be heard booing when there are missing sections, causing the films to suddenly jump, bypassing a critical romantic kiss or embrace. The local priest had ordered these sections censored, and the deleted scenes are piled on the projection room floor. At first, Alfredo considers Toto a bit of a pest, but eventually he teaches Salvatore to operate the film projector. The montage ends as the movie house catches fire (highly flammable nitrate film was in routine use at the time) as Alfredo was projecting The Firemen of ViggiÃ¹ after hours, on the wall of a nearby house. Salvatore saves Alfredo's life, but not before some film reels explode in Alfredo's face, leaving him permanently blind. The Cinema Paradiso is rebuilt by a town citizen, Ciccio, who invests his football lottery winnings. Salvatore, still a child, is hired as the new projectionist, as he is the only person who knows how to run the machines. About a decade later, Salvatore, now in high school, is still operating the projector at the Cinema Paradiso.

But very annoying. I had met a woman. Actually, at 19, she was still a girl. I lived in Pittsburgh. She lived in London, Ontario. She was, to put it bluntly, hotter than hell. On top of that, she’s one of the sweetest, nicest people you were ever going to meet. Needless to say, I was quite smitten, and quickly arranged to spend a week in London with her. When I showed up, she was wearing very interesting pajamas. At least for a few minutes. Unfortunately, my two cats, who had never spent a night in my home without me being there, were, less than impressed when I didn’t show up by 5 PM the day I left, despite having arranged for one of my parents to come over each day to feed them and make sure they had water, etc. Playing with them was optional, but neither would show themselves during that week. Nothing looked amiss on the first floor to Mom or Dad. The food was eaten, the water, apparently drunk, etc. When I got home and went upstairs I found something quite different. There was a trail of toilette paper strewn all over the hallway. My pillow was in the bedroom door and shredded. My alarm clock was on the floor. The power cord had been pulled from the wall and chewed through. There were several…uhmmm… “presents” in the middle of the bed, where they had pulled the sheets back. Some of them were still wet.

Joe started the no-till gardening method, while Kat applied conventional gardening methods. and a hint : The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted. Please answer this question : Which gardener didn't increase predator population? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Kat, who applied conventional gardening methods, did not increase the predator population in her garden. Joe, on the other hand, implemented no-till gardening techniques, which have been shown to provide benefits to predators, potentially leading to larger predator populations. These increased predator populations can be advantageous for controlling pests through biological control methods, but they can also facilitate predation of the crop itself. It is essential to understand that no single method of farming or gardening is universally superior. The choice of tillage practice depends on various factors, including local climate, soil type, and specific agricultural issues. Agroecologists, therefore, evaluate the necessity of different practices depending on the unique context in which each farm or garden is situated. In summary, Kat, who employed conventional gardening methods, did not increase predator populations in her garden, whereas Joe, who adopted the no-till gardening method, may have contributed to a larger predator population, with both pros and cons associated with that outcome."},{"prompt":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: Detective Hercule Poirot (Albert Finney) is returning to England aboard the Orient Express, encountering his friend Signor Bianchi (Martin Balsam), a director of the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits, which owns the line.

Members of Reclaim Australia, the True Blue Crew and other groups, some from Sydney, were among those in attendance who oppose the imminent arrival or refugees. Penny Tridgell, 20, said she opposed the idea because “aged care is for the elderly”. “With refugees you don’t know their history or what they’re capable of doing, or even where they’ve come from,” she said Supporters for the plan were also in attendance – more than 8,000 hand-made “welcome butterflies” dotted Andrews Park to welcome proposed residents. Nina Kelabora, from the group Welcome to Eltham, said the butterflies are the community's way of saying refugees are welcome. Up to 120 asylum seekers would be housed under the proposal.

She tells the manager her address — 1127 Walnut Avenue — and he hires the Laurel and Hardy Transfer Company to deliver the piano in their freight wagon. The duo soon learn from a postman that the home is at the top of a very long stairway. Their attempts to carry the piano up the stairs result in it rolling and crashing into the street below several times, twice with Ollie in tow.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the modern name of the photograph by the commercial photographer that inspired an 1888 oil painting? is inside the article: Farsari and other 19th-century commercial photographers generally concentrated on two types of subject matter: the scenery of Japan and the \\"manners and customs\\" of its inhabitants. Such subjects, and the ways in which they were literally and figuratively framed, were chosen to appeal to foreign taste; and the reason for this, apart from the photographer's individual aesthetics, vision and preconceptions, had much to do with economics. Photographs were expensive to make and accordingly expensive to buy. In 1870s Japan, a portrait photograph usually cost half a ryō \\"per head\\", about a month's pay for an artisan. Given such pricing, few Japanese could afford photographs and a photographer's clientele was largely drawn from the foreign residents of the European and American enclaves: colonial administrators, missionaries, merchants and the military. By the early 1870s, tourists had joined their number. To appeal to this clientele, photographers often staged and contrived the scenes they photographed, particularly the portraits depicting \\"manners and customs\\".In 1885, Charles J. S. Makin used some of Farsari's views to illustrate his travel account Land of the Rising Sun, Being a Short Account of Japan and the Japanese. As photomechanical printing was still in its infancy, it was common for artists and illustrators to create works derived from photographs. For example, Charles Wirgman's numerous engravings for the Illustrated London News were made from views by Wirgman's friend and sometime partner Felice Beato. Occasionally the link between a work of art and its photographic source material was less overt: Louis-Jules Dumoulin's 1888 oil painting Boys' Festival from the Bluff, Yokohama [sic] (now called Carp Banners in Kyoto) draws heavily from Farsari's photograph Gionmachi, Kioto (now often called View of Shijō-dōri, Kyoto); although the painted image strongly resembles the photographic source, the location of the subject has been changed in the title.

Intrigued by Reshma's charisma, Ram learned that she worked for an organization called Devataa, which helped people find stable employment and affordable housing. Reshma told him that Devataa was committed to helping individuals like Ram secure good jobs so they could eventually own their own apartments. Ram's curiosity was piqued, and the prospect of a better life inspired him further. As the days went by, Ram continued his pursuit of a better job while working as a taxi driver. His encounter with Reshma had given him hope and direction. However, his newfound sense of purpose was about to be tested by an unexpected turn of events. One evening, Ram picked up a passenger who seemed in a hurry. His name was Niranjan Das, and he was anxious about getting to his destination as quickly as possible. Ram sensed something off about the man but didn't give it much thought. After dropping Niranjan off, he continued his daily routine, blissfully unaware of the storm brewing ahead. Several days later, Ram found himself being summoned to the police station. The Deputy Commissioner of Police informed him that Niranjan Das had been found dead on the night of Ram's encounter with him, and Ram was the last known person to have seen him alive. As a result, the Deputy Commissioner deemed him a prime suspect in Niranjan's murder. Overwhelmed by disbelief, Ram maintained his innocence. His thoughts turned to Reshma, and he knew that she believed in him. With Reshma and Devataa by his side, Ram prepared to clear his name and seek justice. He was determined not to let the unfair suspicions derail his pursuit of a better life, for himself and for the many people Devataa was striving to help. The story of Ram Kumar Singh, which began with him relocating by train, would not end in despair but rather with hope, resilience, and an unwavering belief in the power of human connection."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

And I was wondering How would Lee feel afterwards? Pick from: -- upset; -- validated; -- hurt; The answer is:","completion":"Lee would likely feel validated after driving home a valid point in their argument with other people. This feeling of validation comes from the fact that Lee was not only able to articulate their thoughts and opinions clearly, but also manage to have their perspectives acknowledged by others in the discussion. When people are able to support their viewpoint with logic and evidence, it typically instills a sense of confidence and satisfaction, as it demonstrates their knowledge and understanding of the subject matter. Feeling validated is a natural human emotion, as it provides a sense of worth and accomplishment. In Lee's case, defending their point of view during an argument and succeeding at making a persuasive case would contribute to their self-assurance and reinforce their belief in their own opinions. However, it's important to note that while Lee may feel validated in this instance, emotions can be complex and multifaceted. It's possible that they may also experience other emotions depending on the specific context and outcome of the argument. For example, if the conversation continued in a negative or antagonistic manner, they may also feel upset or hurt. Conversely, if the exchange was respectful and productive, they may experience additional positive emotions, such as pride or contentment. Overall, while the primary emotion Lee may experience after arguing their point effectively is likely to be validation, it's essential to consider the broader context and individual factors that may impact their feelings. People respond differently to various situations, and emotions can vary greatly depending on the specific circumstances and unique personalities involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

An argument for idealism, such as those of Hegel and Berkeley, is ipso facto an argument against materialism. Matter can be argued to be redundant, as in bundle theory, and mind-independent properties can in turn be reduced to subjective percepts. Berkeley presents an example of the latter by pointing out that it is impossible to gather direct evidence of matter, as there is no direct experience of matter; all that is experienced is perception, whether internal or external. As such, the existence of matter can only be assumed from the apparent (perceived) stability of perceptions; it finds absolutely no evidence in direct experience. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Why is it possible to gather direct evidence?","completion":"It is possible to gather direct evidence because our subjective perceptions, while not providing us access to the ultimate and independent nature of external reality, do still provide us with reliable and consistent information about the world. The continuous nature and coherence of our perceptions allow us to draw meaningful conclusions and make predictions about our experiences. Furthermore, while some idealist arguments claim that there is no direct experience of matter and that all we have are perceptions, we can still extract useful and practical knowledge from these perceptions. Direct evidence, in the context of these idealist arguments, is considered inaccessible. However, we can use our experiences, observations, and our ability to communicate with and learn from others to form a collective pool of empirical knowledge about our world. Our ability to gather this shared knowledge and communicate it to others helps us to establish principles, laws, and theories to explain our experiences, even if we cannot access the underlying nature of reality beyond our perceptions. This empirical knowledge, regardless of its ultimate 'directness,' is still valuable in understanding and navigating the world in which we live. So, while idealist arguments like those of Hegel and Berkeley may raise philosophical questions about the nature of direct evidence and the ultimate reality of matter, we can still gather evidence through our perceptions, shared experiences, and empirical knowledge that allows us to make meaningful predictions and inferences about the world around us."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Solaris Movie plot: Psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) spends his last day on Earth reflecting on his life while walking by a lake near his childhood home where his elderly father still resides. Kelvin is about to embark on an interstellar journey to a space station orbiting the remote oceanic planet Solaris. After decades of study, the scientific mission at the space station has barely progressed. The crew is sending confusing messages. Kelvin is dispatched to evaluate the situation aboard the ship and determine whether the venture should continue. Henri Berton (Vladislav Dvorzhetsky), a former space pilot, visits Kelvin. They watch film footage of Berton's own testimony years before of seeing a four-meter-tall child on the ocean surface of Solaris while searching for two lost scientists. However, the cameras of his craft recorded only clouds and the flat ocean surface; Berton's report was dismissed as hallucinations. After failing to convince Kelvin of the reality of his experience, Berton angrily departs, only to contact Kelvin later via videophone from his private car. He explains that he met the child of a scientist lost on that mission, and the child was like a much smaller version of the one he had seen on Solaris. Before departing Earth for Solaris, Kelvin destroys most of his personal mementos in a bonfire, noting the volume of keepsakes he has accumulated. In Kelvin's last conversation with his father (Nikolai Grinko), they realize that the father will probably not live to see Kelvin return. Although he readily accepted the mission, it is a choice that weighs heavily upon Kelvin's conscience. Upon his arrival at Solaris Station,[10][11] a scientific research station hovering above the oceanic surface of the planet Solaris, none of the three remaining scientists bother to greet Kelvin, who finds the disarrayed space station dangerously neglected. He soon learns that his friend among the scientists, Dr. Gibarian (Sos Sargsyan), had killed himself. The two surviving crewmen are uncooperative and evasive. Kelvin...

These concert halls serve as venues for performances by students, faculty, and guest artists, and foster a vibrant creative environment for both the university and surrounding community. Universities with strong music programs are particularly likely to have concert halls, as these are essential for hosting recitals, concerts, and masterclasses. Additionally, these concert halls not only serve the university's musical needs but also often host other events, such as lectures, panel discussions, and presentations. The other options provided are less likely to have concert halls: 1. Commercial building - Although some commercial buildings may have event spaces, it is less common for them to have a dedicated concert hall, as their primary purpose is usually business and commerce. 2.

Soldiers and photographers think so. The photo from the war front in eastern Ukraine is striking: A cascade of mud, dirt and debris rockets skyward as three soldiers run toward cover. To their right, a discarded baby carriage almost within arms’ reach. The picture, posted on Facebook earlier this month, quickly went viral as a token of a war that often seems forgotten. But a number of Ukraine-based photographers and soldiers claim the photo was staged. In an open letter, the photographers said the picture is a “clumsy” attempt at information war and that if the photo is fake, it has the potential to damage the reputation of the Ukrainian media writ large. Dmitry Muravsky, the man who took the picture and an amateur photographer who volunteers with the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, insists the image is real. The dispute has broken out primarily on Facebook and on a Ukrainian news site that published the open letter. The issue is particularly sensitive since fledgling Ukrainian outlets have been deadlocked with their better-funded Russian counterparts for more than two years in their efforts to show opposing sides of a war in which propaganda has played a major part. The conflict between government troops and Russian-backed separatists has killed upward of 9,500 people. “We emphasize that the only thing we are winning in the conflict with Russia is uncompromising and truthful presentation of information from the [front],” the letter reads. “We kindly ask not to put these photos on a par with Russian fakes. The war is really going on, really, people are dying, and to prove it there is [a huge] number of documentary photo and video evidence.” If the photo is fake, it enters a long line of war images marred by controversy, such as Robert Capa’s “Falling Soldier” taken during the Spanish Civil War. In conversations with Muravsky over WhatsApp and Facebook, the photographer said that the picture in question was taken June 4 in the small village of Shyrokne just east of the coastal city of Mariupol and that the explosion was created by “the enemy.” The village has been a flash point for artillery duels and small-arms fire since Ukrainian volunteer battalions pushed the separatists out of Mariupol in the summer of 2014. Since Muravsky published the picture to his Facebook on Aug. 15, he has returned to the village and interviewed two of the soldiers supposedly depicted in the image. While the soldiers in the video confirmed the incident, according to a translation by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, an officer from the unit wrote in a Facebook post that the men in the video had been co-opted by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense to Muravsky’s account. The officer, a platoon commander named Viktor Moroz, said he served in Shyrokne from February to June but was not there when Muravsky took the picture. “If Muravsky or the Ministry of Defense begins to put pressure on the commanders of the unit or on the guys, I will learn about this at once. And I hope and believe that my instructions to the men always to act according to their conscience and those days that we spent as one fighting family did not pass in vain,” he wrote. “I officially declare that Muravsky’s photo with the explosion in [Shyrokne] was staged. The place is real, it’s on the front. The men were told what to do and how to act, there were no injuries and sprained limbs. There was no bombardment, an explosive device was detonated remotely, covered in a sack or in cement or in a mixture used for construction, or in chalk.” According to Kenton Fulmer, a former U.S. Army explosive ordnance disposal technician and current researcher at Armament Research Services, the picture of the blast supports Moroz’s assertion that the explosive was indeed buried underneath something, though a similar effect could have been made by a mortar or artillery round set to explode after penetrating the surface. “If the mortar had a short delay-action fuse, as opposed to a super quick fuse, then it could present a similar pattern, but I would hope to see some sort of signature fragmentation,” Fulmer said, adding that he would need physical evidence to make hard conclusions. Muravsky provided the raw image and a number of sequential photos following the blast to The Washington Post for analysis. When asked for the photographs before the explosion, Muravsky said he deleted them because they were “unnecessary.” “I am not a pro and had not intention of this photo to give to the press so did not know these standards,” he said. According to an image analysis provided by researchers at the Monterey, Calif.-based James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, who ran the photo through a piece of forensic software called Tungstène, there is relatively little evidence of tampering on the raw photo. The picture was taken at 12:50:29 p.m. on June 4, according to the researchers who have experience analyzing photography. The camera was focused on the left side of the frame, specifically at the baby carriage. According to a Ukrainian Ministry of Defense-associated website that maintains a record of attacks on the front, there was a mortar strike in Shyrokne from 12:45 to 12:47. From June 4 to July 4, there were only three other mortar attacks that occurred before 5 p.m.; the other 11 during that time frame occurred after dusk, according to the site. Cease-fire monitors were in the village from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. that morning but did not record explosions for that day, according to Alexandra Taylor, a spokeswoman for the Ukrainian mission to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, or OSCE. “Of course, this does not preclude that this happened, and we did not observe it,” she said. Muravsky uploaded the picture to his Facebook on Aug. 15 into his album titled “Pain of War.” The photos in the album have no captions. Roughly two days later, the pictures began circulating on Twitter and were featured in a Business Insider article titled “Images from the front lines of Ukraine are a vivid reminder that there’s still a war going on in Europe” The article features a photograph that Muravsky included in his “Pain of War” album depicting two soldiers running in a trench with an explosion behind them. We don't see much of it in US, but eastern Ukraine is a very real shooting war, people via @MrKovalenko pic.twitter.com/fwCE6MJg8Z — Michael Crowley (@michaelcrowley) August 17, 2016 The photo appears in the same series as the one under scrutiny, but when asked about the trench picture, Muravsky said it happened at a different time and place but would not specify when and where the photo was taken. When asked whether it was training or combat, Muravsky said that he was “not prepared to discuss the photo.” In another album of his, Muravsky has a picture of Ukrainian troops with similar camouflage patterns and markings on their helmets as those of the soldiers in the trench. In this image, however, the soldiers are kneeling in a field as explosions erupt from a nearby tree line. Muravsky says the picture was taken during training. Both the field and trench images were uploaded the same day. According to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Muravsky has given past photos to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, and they have been used in advertisements for the military. On Aug. 25, Muravsky said in a Facebook post that he would respond to any further allegations that his photo is staged in the form of a lawsuit. Andrew Roth in Moscow contributed to this report.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the last names of the three lesser known composers that Tyrrell talks about when he says a view of Czech music has been propagated that downplays the contributions of contemporaries and successors? Smetana's biographers describe him as physically frail and unimpressive in appearance yet, at least in his youth, he had a joie-de-vivre that women evidently found attractive. He was also excitable, passionate and strong-willed, determined to make his career in music whatever the hardships, over the wishes of his father who wanted him to become a brewer or a civil servant. Throughout his career he stood his ground; when under the severest of criticism for the \\"Wagnerism\\" in Dalibor he responded by writing Libuše, even more firmly based on the scale and concept of Wagnerian music drama. His personal life became stressful; his marriage to Bettina was loveless, and effectively broke down altogether in the years of illness and relative poverty towards the end of his life. Little of his relationships with his children is on record, although on the day that he was transferred to the asylum, Žofie was \\"crying as though her heart would break\\". There is broad agreement among most commentators that Smetana created a canon of Czech opera where none had previously existed, and that he developed a style of music in all his compositions that equated with the emergent Czech national spirit. A modified view is presented by the music writer Michael Steen, who questions whether \\"nationalistic music\\" can in fact exist: \\"We should recognise that, whereas music is infinitely expressive, on its own it is not good at describing concrete, earthly objects or concepts.\\" He concludes that much is dependent upon what listeners are conditioned to hear.According to the musicologist John Tyrrell, Smetana's close identification with Czech nationalism and the tragic circumstances of his last years, have affected the objectivity of assessments of his work, particularly in his native land. Tyrrell argues that the almost iconic status awarded to Smetana in his homeland \\"monumentalized him into a figure where any criticism of his life or work was discouraged\\" by the Czech authorities, even as late as the last part of the 20th century.

Answer:","completion":"The article provided does not mention the names of the three lesser-known composers that Tyrrell talks about when he says a view of Czech music has been propagated that downplays the contributions of contemporaries and successors. It focuses solely on Smetana and does not provide information on any other composer. Therefore, it is impossible to provide the last names of the three lesser-known composers from the text of the article. You should check the full content of the source or look for other articles that might have this information. John Tyrrell, a renowned musicologist, is known for his extensive research on Czech music and composers, so there is a possibility that he did talk about these composers in some of his work. For a detailed answer, it would be better to refer to his writings or research directly. However, without the specific reference or direct quotes within the article, we cannot provide the names you're inquiring about."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which jogger experienced less nausea? Ted and Randy liked jogging. Last week while jogging by himself, Randy experienced an unpleasant episode and was taken to the hospital, because he passed out while jogging in the heat, without any water or supplements on him. Hint: Millions of people in the world jog for exercise. For the most part, jogging can be a healthy way to stay fit. However, problems can also develop for those who jog in the heat. Excessive sweating can lead to electrolyte loss that could be life-threatening. Early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency can include nausea, fatugue, and dizziness. If not treated, individuals can experience muscle weakness and increased heart rate (which could lead to a heart attack). Many sports drinks can be consumed to restore electrolytes quickly in the body.
