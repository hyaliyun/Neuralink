The United Kingdom, one of the very few stable nations with a functioning government, is deluged by asylum seekers fleeing the chaos and war which have taken hold around the world. In response, the UK has become a militarized police state as British government forces round up and detain immigrants. Theo Faron, a former activist turned cynical bureaucrat, is kidnapped by the Fishes, a militant immigrants' rights group. They are led by Theo's estranged wife, Julian Taylor, from whom he separated after their son Dylan's death during a 2008 flu pandemic. Julian offers Theo money to acquire transit papers for a young refugee named Kee, which Theo obtains from his cousin Nigel, a government minister who runs a state-sponsored collection of salvaged art from around the world. The transit papers require that the bearer must be accompanied, so Theo agrees to escort Kee in exchange for a large sum. Luke, a Fishes member, drives them and former midwife Miriam towards the coast to a boat. They are ambushed by an armed gang, and Julian is killed. Luke kills two police officers who stop their car, and they bury Julian in the forest as Theo breaks down crying over her death, as the group ditches their car for another to escape to a Fishes safe house. Kee reveals to Theo that she is pregnant, as Julian had told her to trust only Theo. Julian had intended to hand Kee to the \\"Human Project\\", a supposed scientific group in the Azores dedicated to curing infertility; however, Luke persuades Kee to stay, and he is later voted as the new leader of the Fishes. Later that night, Theo eavesdrops on a meeting of Luke and other Fishes.

Tony Rivers (Michael Landon) and Jimmy (Tony Marshall) are trading blows. As Jimmy seems to be gaining the upper hand, Tony throws dirt in his face, temporarily blinding him. The police arrive and the crowd quickly disperses. Detective Donovan (Barney Phillips) cleans Jimmy up, then has a chat with both. He makes them shake hands, and Jimmy walks off. Donovan tries to talk some sense into Tony, but he refuses help. This isn't the first scrape that Tony has had that involved the police. Donovan suggests professional help, but this only infuriates Tony. Tony saunters over to see his girl, Arlene (Yvonne Lime), who waited for him. He takes her home in his car.Tony arrives home to find his Dad (Malcolm Atterbury) packing his lunch for work. Dad tries to convince his son that things would go better if he would just go along with people. That evening Tony arrives to pick up Arlene at her house. He honks the horn. This behavior reinforces for Arlene's parents, Bill Logan (S. John Launer) and Mary (Dorothy Crehan) that Tony is unsuitable for their daughter.

What is the answer to this question? when was poem put on statue of liberty?","completion":"The poem \\"The New Colossus\\" was placed on the Statue of Liberty in 1903. This famous poem was written by American poet Emma Lazarus in 1883 as part of a fundraising effort to construct the pedestal on which the statue now stands. Although not initially associated with the statue, the poem later became symbolic of the welcoming spirit of the United States towards immigrants and the meaning of the Statue of Liberty as a beacon of hope and freedom for people around the world. Emma Lazarus was inspired by the plight of immigrants arriving in the United States and their hope for a better future in their new home. The poem itself serves as an expression of American ideals of equality, freedom, and opportunity, contrasting the Statue of Liberty – represented in the poem as the \\"Mother of Exiles\\" – with the ancient Colossus of Rhodes, which symbolized military might and conquest. Here is the full text of \\"The New Colossus\\" poem: Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, With conquering limbs astride from land to land; Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame. \\"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!\\" cries she With silent lips. \\"Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\\" It is important to note that the poem was not immediately placed on the Statue of Liberty when it was completed, as its connection to the statue was not fully embraced. However, after Lazarus' death, her friend Georgina Schuyler rediscovered the poem in a bookstore and was moved by its powerful message. She campaigned for it to be engraved on a bronze plaque, which was then placed on the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty in 1903. Since then, \\"The New Colossus\\" has been inextricably linked with the Statue of Liberty, capturing the spirit of freedom and opportunity that the monument represents. The poem's words remain a poignant reminder of America's historical role as a refuge for those seeking a better life and its enduring values of compassion, inclusion, and liberty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has issued a decree authorising a multi-party political system, state media reported Thursday, a day after the U.N. Security Council condemned the Syrian government's crackdown on protesters. The decree issued by Assad may have the power to bring to an end decades of single-party rule by the Baath Party in Syria, although it remains unclear how the new law will be implemented. The draft law was earlier passed by Syrian lawmakers, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) reported, and grants citizens the right to establish political parties with the aim of contributing to political life \\"through peaceful and democratic means.\\" However, the Syrian opposition has argued the decrees are simply for show and will not bring about real change. Assad's move comes as reports of violence continue to prompt international outrage. Security forces killed four people after evening prayers on Wednesday, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, one in the southwestern town of Nawa, in Daraa province, one in the central city of Palmyra, and two in Damascus. The observatory said communications remained cut off Thursday in the western city of Hama, a center of discontent and bastion of anti-government protest. The group is concerned that many civilians may have died, as the military remains in the city. The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday issued a presidential statement condemning the Syrian government's crackdown on protesters and calling for an immediate end to violence by all parties. \\"The Security Council condemns the widespread violations of human rights and the use of force against civilians by the Syrian authorities,\\" the eight-paragraph statement says. It calls for \\"all sides to act with utmost restraint, and to refrain from reprisals, including attacks against state institutions.\\" The statement says those responsible for the violence should be held accountable but offers no suggestion that foreign intervention is being considered. \\"The Security Council reaffirms its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Syria,\\" it says. \\"It stresses that the only solution to the current crisis in Syria is through an inclusive and Syrian-led political process, with the aim of effectively addressing the legitimate aspirations and concerns of the population which will allow the full exercise of fundamental freedoms for its entire population, including that of expression and peaceful assembly.\\" Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who is to update the council on the situation in Syria within a week, welcomed the statement. \\"The world has watched the deteriorating situation in Syria with the most profound concern, but the events of the past few days have been brutally shocking,\\" he told reporters. \\"Once again, I call on President (Bashar al-) Assad and the Syrian authorities to immediately cease all violence against their people, to fully respect human rights and implement reforms that they have already announced.\\" He urged Damascus to comply with the Security Council's demand that international humanitarian organizations be granted unimpeded access to affected areas. \\"Those responsible should be held to account,\\" he said. He praised the 15-nation Security Council for speaking out \\"with one voice and condemning all this violence and asking them to take necessary measures\\" after long discussions on the matter. But Lebanon's ambassador, Caroline Ziade, said her country, which is Syria's neighbor, dissociated itself from the statement. However, Lebanon chose not to block the measure, as it could have done. Resolutions usually carry with them some sort of action. Presidential statements are simply unanimous on-the-record positions. Though a resolution would have been more significant than the presidential statement, U.S. diplomats said they were glad the United Nations had taken a stance. U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice called the statement \\"long overdue.\\" She added that she hoped Damascus will \\"be chastened by the strength and the unity of the condemnation.\\" The statement came on the third consecutive day of talks in New York to address the crisis, which a White House spokesman called \\"grotesque and appalling.\\" Witnesses said Wednesday that security forces were brazenly advancing into the heart of Hama. Hama, which has seen massive demonstrations by anti-government protesters in Friday demonstrations, was the site of the 1982 bloody crackdown by the Alawite-dominated government against a Muslim Brotherhood uprising. The city is under siege by security forces amid a military offensive, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, and witnesses say communications have been closed down amid the military push. Rami Abdul-Rahman of the observatory told CNN Thursday that 1,000 families had fled west to surrounding villages and 500 families eastwards, leaving a city where violence has persisted for days. His group monitors the unrest in Syria through many contacts on the ground, and his sources have reported hearing explosions and seeing plumes of smoke. \\"There are great concerns of a massacre in the city,\\" he said Wednesday. \\"The human situation is very bad,\\" said a witness from an opposition movement who said he was in the center of Hama and asked not to be named for security reasons. Corpses were seen on the ground after tanks occupied parts of central Hama amid heavy shelling, said a resident who fled the city. Dozens more people have been killed in Hama and other Syrian cities in recent days, rights groups have said. Residents said the city is running short on food. Power and water are scarce and residents said they fear a humanitarian crisis. Across Hama, intermittent gunfire and shelling rang out, helicopters whirled overhead and government snipers took positions, making it difficult for people to venture out, residents said. Security forces also launched a series of raids and detentions in the Khaldiyeh neighborhood of Homs, another western city, and dozens of people have been detained in the area, the scene of marches by anti-government protesters. Syria's parliament plans to meet Sunday to discuss \\"issues related to the homeland and citizens' interests,\\" SANA reported Wednesday. CNN is unable to independently confirm death tolls or events in Syria, which has restricted access to the country by international journalists, including CNN's. Since mid-March, anti-government protesters have taken to the streets across the whole country to demand reforms from or an end to the al-Assad's regime. The death toll in Syria since its uprising began in mid-March has reached 2,003, the observatory's Abdul-Rahman said. The dead include 1,629 civilians and 374 Syrian security forces. The figure doesn't include tolls from the Wednesday unrest in the city of Hama, where it is difficult confirming information because of the ongoing military offensive there. Activists blame the deaths of demonstrators on security forces, but the government has consistently attributed the violence to \\"armed groups.\\" CNN's Salma Abdelaziz, Richard Roth, Amir Ahmed, Yasmin Amer, Arwa Damon, Nada Husseini, Elise Labott and Joe Vaccarello contributed to this report.

(ii) runs all out at a huge asian man dressed in a sumo wrestling outfit.. (iii) and proceeds to eat them.. (iv) is speaking a while and waving the cape..","completion":"The given context tells that \\"the man\\" once in a blue robe, has taken off his robe and revealed a sumo wrestling outfit underneath. At the same time, he has also dropped a bag of Dorito's. As the situation suggests, we are likely in an environment where this man is set to participate in sumo wrestling. Thus, the most logical continuation of the story would be (ii) runs all out at a huge asian man dressed in a sumo wrestling outfit.

Would the answer to the question \\"What 's the northernmost U.S. state apart from Alaska ?\\" be an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric value?","completion":"The answer to the question \\"What's the northernmost U.S. state apart from Alaska?\\" would be a location. Specifically, it refers to another one of the United States of America. When we talk about the northernmost U.S. state apart from Alaska, we are looking for the state with the highest latitude, or the one farthest north within the geographic boundaries of the United States. Since Alaska is the northernmost state in the USA, we have to identify the state that holds the second highest latitude, or is the second farthest north. The state that fits this description is Minnesota. While several states are located in the northern part of the contiguous United States, Minnesota has the highest latitude, at approximately 49.3843° N, thanks to the Northwest Angle, which is located on Lake of the Woods and extends north of the 49th parallel. The Northwest Angle is the only part of the United States, apart from Alaska, that extends farther north than the 49th parallel, which is the border between the United States and Canada from Washington State to Minnesota in the West and East, respectively. Minnesota, therefore, can be considered the northernmost U.S. state apart from Alaska.

Answer:","completion":"Barney, the lovable purple dinosaur, was a central character in the American children's television show \\"Barney & Friends.\\" The series aired on PBS from April 6, 1992, to November 2, 2010, and its educational content was targeted at young children between the ages of one and eight. The main idea revolved around Barney, who encouraged his young friends, both human and animal, to learn through songs, dance, and activities that fostered creativity and imagination. Throughout its eighteen-year run, numerous actors portrayed the beloved Barney character. David Joyner was the principal actor who played Barney for the longest period, from 1991 to 2001, both during television and the live performances. Born on July 4, 1963, in Decatur, Illinois, Joyner first donned the famous costume at the inception of the show. In addition to portraying Barney, he also played Terrence or Riff's costume performer in some episodes. Joyner developed a strong bond with the role and dedicated his time and energy to personifying the benevolent dinosaur. He appeared in more than 100 episodes and several feature films, including \\"Barney's Imagination Island,\\" \\"Barney's Great Adventure,\\" and \\"Barney's Musical Castle.\\" Following Joyner's departure, Carey Stinson took over the role of Barney and remained until the show's cancellation in 2010. Stinson, a native of Amarillo, Texas, first wore the Barney suit during the show's stage tour in 1991. His work as a backup to Joyner led to him being assigned the main role following Joyner's retirement. In addition to his television work, Stinson also appeared in live events as Barney. His position as the purple dinosaur made him a popular figure among children and generated further interest in the \\"Barney & Friends\\" franchise. Apart from David Joyner and Carey Stinson, other actors wore the Barney costume for various live appearances, performances, and promotional events. They include Rick Starkweather in 1987, Josh Martin from 1997 to 2005, and Antwaun Steele from 2003 to 2004, among others. Meanwhile, the character's voice was mainly provided by Bob West from 1988 to 2000, followed by Duncan Brannan from 2000 to 2001, and eventually by Dean Wendt from 2002 to 2010. In summary, playing the role of Barney was a responsibility shared by multiple actors throughout the TV show's history, with David Joyner and Carey Stinson being the primary performers. The character became an iconic figure among young children and played a significant role in making \\"Barney & Friends\\" a considerable success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Most annelids have a pair of coelomata (body cavities) in each segment, separated from other segments by septa and from each other by vertical mesenteries.

Each mesentery is similar except that the mesothelium is the lining of each of the pair of coelomata, and the blood vessels and, in polychaetes, the main nerve cords are embedded in it. The mesothelium is made of modified epitheliomuscular cells; in other words, their bodies form part of the epithelium but their bases extend to form muscle fibers in the body wall. The mesothelium may also form radial and circular muscles on the septa, and circular muscles around the blood vessels and gut.

The paint was peeling off the schoolhouse, but not the gymnasium because the","completion":"gymnasium had been recently renovated. Step by step, the school was undergoing much needed improvements to bring it up to date and provide a better environment for the students. The paint on the schoolhouse had deteriorated over time, making it appear old and uninviting. It was finally time to address this issue. Step 1: Assess the situation Before starting the repainting process, it was important to assess the condition of the paint and the underlying structure. The maintenance team conducted a thorough inspection, identifying areas that needed additional work, such as filling in cracks and fixing any rotten wood. This step ensured that any issues would be resolved before applying a new coat of paint, preventing further problems down the line. Step 2: Choose the right materials Next, the school had to choose the right materials for the job. This included selecting high-quality paint that would be long-lasting, resistant to weather, and safe for the environment. Additionally, choosing the right color was essential, as it needed to match the newly renovated gymnasium and create a cohesive appearance for the school. Step 3: Plan and schedule the work With the materials and resources selected, the school then needed to plan and schedule the work. This involved coordinating with teachers and staff to minimize disruption to lessons and determine the best time for the work to take place. The maintenance team would also need to plan how to access the schoolhouse effectively, such as using scaffolding or ladders, to complete the job. Step 4: Prepare the surface In order to ensure a smooth and clean surface for the new paint, it was essential to properly prepare the schoolhouse exterior. This involved scraping off the old, peeling paint, sanding any rough areas, and repairing any structural issues that had been identified. A thorough cleaning of the entire surface would ensure proper adhesion of the new paint. Step 5: Apply the paint Once the surface preparation was complete, it was time to apply the new coat of paint. The maintenance team used a combination of brushes, rollers, and spray equipment to evenly cover the schoolhouse exterior. They carefully followed the manufacturer's guidelines to ensure proper drying times between coats and a consistent appearance throughout. Step 6: Inspect and make final touches Finally, with the painting complete, the team gave the exterior an overall inspection to ensure the quality and uniformity of the finish. Any necessary touch-ups were made, and the surrounding area was cleaned up, ensuring that the school looked its best and had a fresh, inviting appearance. The newly painted schoolhouse now matched the gymnasium's modern appearance, creating a cohesive and updated environment for the students and staff. This renovation was a significant step in the school's ongoing efforts to improve its facilities and provide a welcoming place for education and personal growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It only provides a comparison between HP and Dell's shipments in the third quarter of 2006. To correctly answer the question, we would need data on Dell's PC shipments levels across multiple time periods, particularly comparing figures from before and during the time frame of the decline. This information would allow us to calculate the percentage decline Dell experienced in its PC shipments. However, based on the provided statement, we only have information on their PC shipments for one specific period (third quarter of 2006) and a comparison to HP shipments, which is not sufficient for determining the rate of decline.

Oliver Pickup. Last updated at 5:04 PM on 27th October 2011. Retired headmaster John Regan was told that he would have to wait a day and a half before his complaint about his bins not being collected would be heard. All he wanted was for his rubbish to be taken away so when the binmen were four days late John Regan decided to find out why. The retired headteacher picked up the phone and called Winchester City Council helpline hoping for a swift answer to his query. But the taped message the 60-year-old father of two received stunned him. He was 'in a 37-hour queue'. Exasperated and, unsurprisingly, not prepared to wait a day and a half for an answer he then called the council's main number, only to be diverted to Hampshire County Council switchboard. Today his rubbish bins had still not been collected, seven days after they were meant to be emptied. Mr Regan, from Winchester, said: 'I just want my rubbish collected. What is so difficult about emptying my bin? He added: 'I rang Winchester council after four days and I was told I was in a 37-hour queue. 'I thought this was ridiculous so I rang their main number but I was then diverted to the county council where the operator said the city council number was overloaded. 'I am increasingly exasperated. We are in the country so there is a potential vermin. It is also unsightly. I just want my rubbish collected.

Winchester Council today admitted it had received a staggering 4,000 queries about the new waste collection service it had introduced with East Hampshire Council using the contractor BIFFA. Of that number 558 about bins not being emptied. A Winchester City Council spokesman said: 'We had an issue with our telephone system which was telling people there was a 37-hour wait but nobody waited more than 30 minutes.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is an API log-in? What is an API? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"An API log-in refers to the process of authenticating oneself and obtaining access to an API. On the other hand, an API, or Application Programming Interface, refers to a set of protocols, rules, and tools that facilitate building software applications and enable communication between different software components. The questions do not have the same meaning; the first pertains to a specific action involving an API, while the second deals with the broader concept of APIs. To better understand these concepts, let us delve deeper into each one. 1. API log-in: When using an API, it's often necessary to implement an authentication method to identify and authorize users or applications trying to access specific resources or functionality. This helps ensure secure access to sensitive data and prevents unauthorized transactions. The API log-in process typically consists of the following steps: a. Register for API access: Before you can use an API, you must usually register on the platform that offers the API. This often involves creating an account and providing necessary user or application information. b. Obtain API Key or Token: During registration, you will typically receive an API key, token, or other credentials. These function as unique identifiers for your application and are required when making API requests. c. Integrate authentication in your application: After you have obtained your API credentials, you must integrate them into your application. This may involve providing the credentials as parameters in the API request, using headers, or implementing an authentication protocol like OAuth. d. Make requests and access resources: Once your application is set up and properly authenticated, you can make API requests to access and interact with the resources and functionality provided by the API. 2. API (Application Programming Interface): The term API refers to a collection of protocols, rules, and tools that allow different software applications to communicate with one another. APIs serve as an intermediary between applications, enabling them to share data, functionality, or services without the need for the end user to be directly involved in the interchange of information. APIs offer numerous benefits, including: a. Simplifying development: APIs reduce the complexity involved in the development of applications by providing developers with a well-defined, standardized way to access specific functionalities or services. b. Encouraging modular design: APIs facilitate the separation of individual software components. This modular design approach assists developers in creating scalable and maintainable applications. c. Enhancing interoperability: APIs enable seamless interaction and data sharing between different applications, platforms, and systems, ultimately enhancing interoperability on a wider scale. d. Promoting innovation: By providing access to a broad range of functionalities and services, APIs enable developers to create new, innovative applications, driving growth and competition in various industries. To summarize, an API log-in pertains to the authentication process required to access and use an API, whereas an API is a broader concept that refers to a set of protocols and tools that facilitate communication and interaction between different software applications. The two questions are related but do not have the same meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Do those questions have the same meaning? pick from the following. -- no; -- yes;","completion":"Answer: -- no; These questions do not have the same meaning, as they address different subjects and aspects of people's preferences and experiences. To provide more detailed and long answers for each question: 1. Do women actually like dick pics? The preference for receiving explicit images, including unsolicited dick pics, varies among individuals. In general, it is essential to consider each person's unique perspective and boundaries. Some women might appreciate receiving intimate images from their partners, especially when there is prior communication and consent. However, unsolicited images might make others feel uncomfortable, violated, or disrespected. On a broader scale, it's essential to emphasize the importance of obtaining consent before sending explicit content. Numerous studies suggest that many women find unsolicited dick pics unpleasant and intrusive. In fact, some places have designated this kind of behavior as a criminal offense. 2. What are some epic advertisement scam pics? Advertisement scams or fraudulence in advertising come in various forms. They typically exploit the trust of consumers and aim to manipulate them into making purchases. Some common types of advertisement scams include: - Using false or exaggerated claims: Advertisements may display before-and-after pictures associated with weight loss, skincare, or fitness regimens, who sometimes heavily edited and exaggerated to create an illusion of effectiveness. - Counterfeit products: Scam advertisements may use images of popular branded products, such as luxury bags or watches. However, when consumers purchase these items, they receive counterfeit or lower quality versions. - Hidden fees or subscriptions: Ads may display enticing offers that come with hidden costs or compel customers to sign up for recurring subscriptions. For instance, an advertisement may promote a free trial period but require credit card information which might later charge the customers without their knowledge. - Clickbait and fake news: These ads use provocative and falsified headlines or images to encourage viewers to click on a link, leading to another site. In such cases, the content or products advertised may not have anything in common with the initial ad. It is important to stay vigilant and verify the legitimacy of advertisements and their sources before making any purchase or sharing personal information. To reiterate, the two questions do not have the same meaning and address different issues - one talks about women's preferences for receiving explicit images, and the other deals with scams in the world of advertising."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It pulled into the valet parking of a grand hotel and two people got out. Aage barely noticed them. He stared inside the car, where chrome and brass gleamed against a burled wood dashboard. The doors of the car shut with the heavy thunk of real metal. A valet pulled the car out of the parking circle and Aage never saw it again. Question: Does Aage's mom own a car?

After the second World Trade Center crash, Boston Center managers recognized that both aircraft were transcontinental 767 jetliners that had departed Logan Airport. Remembering the \\"we have some planes\\" remark, Boston Center guessed that Delta 1989 might also be hijacked.

However, bridge building experts throughout the world thought this was an impossible feat and told Roebling to forget the idea, but Roebling could not ignore the vision he had in his mind of this bridge. After much discussion and persuasion he managed to convince his son Washington, an up and coming engineer, that the bridge in fact could be built. The project started well, but when it was only a few months underway a tragic accident on the site took the life of John Roebling. Washington was injured and left with a certain amount of brain damage, which resulted in him not being able to walk or talk or even move. \\"We told them so.\\" \\"Crazy men and their crazy dreams.'' \\"It's foolish to chase wild visions.\\" Evcryone had a negative comment to make and felt that the project should be scrapped since the Roeblings were the only ones who knew how the bridge could be built.

He decided to make the best use of the only finger he could move. Thus, he slowly developed a code of communication with his wife. He touched his wife's arm with that finger, indicating to her that he wanted her to call the engineers again. Then he used the same method of tapping her arm to tell the engineers what to do. It seemed foolish but the project was under way again. For 13 years Washington tapped out his instructions with his finger on his wife's arm until the bridge was finally completed. 1.

Have you ever been in a room where you felt a little uncomfortable or maybe even a little bored? Well, don't worry because I'm here to give you some simple and fun tips on how to make yourself feel better. 1. Avoid watching the clock. Sometimes, we keep looking at the clock because we can't wait for something fun to happen. But, this can make time feel really slow. So, try not to look at the clock too much. Instead, keep your mind busy by thinking about happy thoughts or by using your imagination to create fun stories! 2. Leave the room for a few minutes. If you start to feel a little restless or bored, ask an adult if it's okay for you to step outside the room for a little while. This will give you some fresh air and help you feel less bored. 3. Drink your water. Did you know that drinking water helps you stay healthy and can even help you feel happy? So, remember to take sips of water throughout the day. This will also give you something to do when you're in a room where you can't move around a lot. 4. Move around as much as possible. If you can, try to move around the room. Stretch your legs, wiggle your toes, or march on the spot. Moving your body helps make you feel more comfortable and less tired. 5. Ask if you can change your seat. Sometimes, just changing where you sit can make a big difference. Maybe you can ask an adult if you can stand in the back, sit on top of a desk, or even sit on the floor. This might help you feel more relaxed and comfortable. 6. Stay warm. Being too cold is not fun at all! If you feel cold, put on a sweater, wrap yourself in a blanket, or give yourself a hug. Staying warm will make you feel cozier and happier. 7. Look out the window. If there's a window in the room, take some time to look outside. See the trees, the birds, or the sky. Looking at nature can help you feel calm and peaceful. Remember, it's normal to feel a little uncomfortable or bored sometimes. But with these little tips, you can make yourself feel better and enjoy your time more. And don't forget, you can always ask a grown-up for help if you need it.

As a huge fan of Italian cuisine, I was delighted to stumble upon \\"La Dolce Vita\\" in our very own neighborhood. From the moment we stepped inside, we were greeted with a warm ambiance, setting the stage for a truly memorable evening. Our meal began with the Bruschetta al Pomodoro - a delightful combination of fresh tomatoes, basil, and fragrant garlic atop crispy, slightly charred bread. Perfectly seasoned and full of flavor, it certainly whet our appetite for the dishes to come. It was evident that they use high-quality ingredients, and the freshness of the produce shined through. For our entrees, we chose the classic Lasagna Bolognese and Fettuccine Alfredo. The lasagna's layers of tender pasta, rich meat sauce, and creamy béchamel came together in a symphony of textures and flavors. The fettuccine was cooked to al dente perfection and generously coated in a velvety Alfredo sauce – a perfect comfort dish for a chilly evening. Not to be outdone by their savory dishes, the dessert selection at La Dolce Vita was equally impressive. We indulged in their signature Tiramisu, which was beautifully presented and tasted heavenly. The delicate, coffee-soaked layers of sponge cake, complimented by the light, creamy sweetness of the mascarpone, provided the ideal end to our meal. The service provided by the staff was outstanding – courteous, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu options. They truly went above and beyond to ensure our experience was enjoyable. In summary, La Dolce Vita is a hidden gem that transported us to a culinary adventure through Italy right in our hometown.

The reviewer doesn't seem to hold strong negative emotions but isn't impressed either. Throughout the review, they express their thoughts with a fair level of neutrality, focusing more on the descriptive aspects of the experience rather than their emotional connection to it. In the beginning, they mention that the restaurant was not great, but at least it wasn't disgusting, indicating they had a somewhat subpar experience. The mention of picking the place due to the presence of Chinese customers suggests that they might have had some initial positive thoughts or expectations but does not seem to carry much weight in terms of their overall sentiment. The description of the joint being a typical Cantonese style Chinese meal doesn't show a strong opinion on the food, except that the reviewer might have found it ordinary or average. The author does provide a specific dining experience of ordering a vegetarian noodle soup by comparing it with wonton noodle soup without the wontons, indicating they had a clear idea of what they were looking for and what to expect. However, the reviewer seems disappointed with the meal saying that the soup and noodles were passable, but the vegetables were super bland. It appears they didn't find the dish very appealing or satisfying. The closing statement, \\"Better than nothing,\\" conveys a sense of resignation towards the experience as if they didn't expect much in the first place, and that sentiment remains consistent throughout the review.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that had a reclusive life style? from the following article ? Charles-Valentin Alkan (French: [ʃaʁl valɑ̃tɛ̃ alkɑ̃]; 30 November 1813 – 29 March 1888) was a French-Jewish composer and virtuoso pianist. At the height of his fame in the 1830s and 1840s he was, alongside his friends and colleagues Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt, among the leading pianists in Paris, a city in which he spent virtually his entire life. Alkan earned many awards at the Conservatoire de Paris, which he entered before he was six. His career in the salons and concert halls of Paris was marked by his occasional long withdrawals from public performance, for personal reasons. Although he had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the Parisian artistic world, including Eugène Delacroix and George Sand, from 1848 he began to adopt a reclusive life style, while continuing with his compositions – virtually all of which are for the keyboard. During this period he published, among other works, his collections of large-scale studies in all the major keys (Op. 35) and all the minor keys (Op. 39). The latter includes his Symphony for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 4–7) and Concerto for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 8–10), which are often considered among his masterpieces and are of great musical and technical complexity. Alkan emerged from self-imposed retirement in the 1870s to give a series of recitals that were attended by a new generation of French musicians. Alkan's attachment to his Jewish origins is displayed both in his life and his work. He was the first composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in art music. Fluent in Hebrew and Greek, he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the Bible into French. This work, like many of his musical compositions, is now lost. Alkan never married, but his presumed son Élie-Miriam Delaborde was, like Alkan, a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the pedal piano, and edited a number of the elder composer's works. Following his death (which according to persistent but unfounded legend was caused by a falling bookcase) Alkan's music became neglected,...

Question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What band formed in London in 1973 included a former member of the Scottish group Silk? Answer:","completion":"The band in question that formed in London in 1973 and included a former member of the Scottish group Silk is the iconic rock band, Ultravox. Ultravox was originally known as Tiger Lily, and it underwent several transformations in its early years before becoming the band known and loved by fans today. The band's original lineup included Chris Cross, Billy Currie, John Foxx, and Warren Cann. One of the key members, Billy Currie, was a former member of the Scottish group Silk. Before joining Ultravox, Currie had been a member of Silk, which was a pop band formed in Scotland in 1969. Known for their flamboyant style and theatrical performances, Silk released several singles during their active years. Billy Currie, while being classically trained on the violin and piano, contributed to Silk's sound as a keyboard player. His time with Silk served as a stepping stone in his music career, after which he moved to Ultravox. Currie's transition to Ultravox in 1973 meant a shift in tone and style from the pop sounds of Silk to the unique blend of rock, synth-pop and electronic music that characterized Ultravox. His classical training and creativity proved instrumental in shaping the distinctive, pioneering sound of the band. Ultravox achieved significant success during the late 1970s and early 1980s, especially after Midge Ure joined the band in 1979. They are perhaps best known for their 1981 hit, \\"Vienna\\", which reached number two on the UK Singles Chart and remains one of their most popular songs. Their contribution to the new wave and synth-pop genres was influential, and Billy Currie's unique musicianship, marked by his time in both Silk and Ultravox, played a pivotal role in this success. Thus, the iconic band Ultravox, formed in London in 1973, encapsulates a piece of Scottish pop history through Billy Currie's earlier membership in the group Silk."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Stone's coworker, who was responsible for capturing the moment that would eventually go viral, accompanied her. Unbeknownst to them, this act would not only lead to their termination from their jobs but also ignite a heated debate on social media. The photo depicted Stone pretending to shout and make an obscene gesture next to a sign that urged for silence and respect. Stone's father, Peter Stone, referred to the snapshot as a 'total lapse of judgment.' This photograph, though likely meant as a harmless joke, was seen by many as a show of utmost disrespect towards the fallen soldiers and their families. In response to this incident, a Facebook page called 'Fire Lindsey Stone' was created. The outrage was palpable as, within a short period, the page amassed more than 19,000 likes. People from all walks of life chimed in, expressing their disdain for Stone's actions and their support for the consequences that she faced. Calls for her termination from her workplace echoed across social media, ultimately prompting her employer to heed the public outcry. Lindsey Stone and her coworker, who snapped the photo, were both fired from their positions on Wednesday. As with any controversy, there are two sides to the story. A competing Facebook page titled 'Hire Lindsey Stone' emerged, aiming to provide support for Stone and her plight. The page gathered only 39 likes, but its message was clear – there are people who believed that her punishment was too severe and that she deserved a second chance. Those in support of Stone argue that the situation was blown out of proportion, with negative consequences affecting someone's professional life over a seemingly harmless joke. The Lindsey Stone controversy highlights the role of social media in modern society and the extent to which it can impact a person's personal and professional life. In this digital age, the line between our online and offline lives is increasingly blurred, and a single lapse of judgment can rapidly turn into a life-altering event. For Stone, it led to the loss of her job and an overwhelming amount of negative attention from the general public. As social media continues to grow and influence our lives, the Lindsey Stone controversy teaches us a valuable lesson. Actions taken online, even with the intent of humor or without malice, can have unforeseen consequences. In our interconnected world, it is crucial to be cognizant of the potential impact one seemingly innocent act could have on our reputation, well-being, and livelihood."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Joy is an intense feeling of happiness and pleasure that can be triggered by various factors in life such as personal achievements, meaningful relationships, and delightful experiences. Let's analyze the other options to understand why they are not the best answers in this context: A. Own Car Owning a car can certainly bring happiness and a sense of achievement, but it is not necessary that a person will always feel very happy just by owning a car. The emotions and feelings of happiness may vary from person to person, and for some individuals, possessing material objects might not be the key to their happiness. B. Be Rich Being rich or having financial stability can open doors to more opportunities, freedom, and security which may lead to happiness, but it is an external factor and does not guarantee that a person will always be very happy. Additionally, research has shown that after a certain point, an increase in wealth does not necessarily lead to a proportional increase in happiness. C. Catch Cold Catching a cold is a physical ailment and has no direct correlation with a person's happiness. In fact, being ill generally causes discomfort, and therefore, this option cannot be equated with the experience of happiness. D. Believe in God Believing in God can provide a source of comfort, hope, and strength for some individuals, which may contribute to their happiness. However, the feeling of happiness is not limited to those having a belief in God, as people with different beliefs, values, and worldviews can also experience happiness in their own unique ways. In conclusion, out of all the given options, the best answer is E. Experience Joy, as it captures the essence of the person's emotion when they are very happy. Joy is a universal and subjective feeling that can be experienced by anyone, regardless of their circumstances, material possessions, or spiritual beliefs."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Q:For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture. If you’re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture...

The crumpled paper test, being an embodiment of Adam's disappointments, seemed magnified, size-wise too. It was an imposing sheet of failures that, in its physicality, even sneered at Adam's attempted disposal of it. The edges unfurled as if alive, splaying out forbiddingly in mid-air, before meeting with the floor rather unceremoniously. Mocking his poor aim, the cruel irony wasn't lost on Adam. Just like the cryptic math problems it bore, the test's larger than expected size seemed a fitting symbol for the mammoth challenges the world had conspired to thrust upon Adam, challenges that he was presently ill-equipped to confront. It was almost as if the universe itself was telling him that he couldn't even discard his troubles right - a fate that horrified Adam as he stood there, test paper he wanted to forget still hauntingly visible. Lost in his reverie, he felt the bristle of the material between his fingers, the sharp lines of his frustration forever imprinted on the paper, the hastily scribbled ink marks bearing testimony to his once attempted yet now futile endeavor. The sense of defeat was palpable, thrumming ever so eerily in the chill expanse of the room. As he bent down to pick the sprawling test paper from the floor, each symbol on the glowing white of the page screamed his failure, each fallen ink dot a static reminder of his inadequacy. The waste bin seemed too small compared to the vastness of his failure. It sat by the edge of his study, an insubstantial speck against the grandeur of his failed exam. A frustrated sigh escaped Adam's lips as he straightened, test held aloft in his hand. He held the paper tentatively, as though it were a sentient being capable of inflicting further harm than it already had. A quick pinch near the top of the test forced it into a more contained size, easier for the bin to swallow. With a flick of his wrist, this time he didn't miss. The crumpled ball of failure nestled among discarded pens and crumpled doodles. The sight gave him an odd sense of solace. He couldn't help but take a moment to reflect. The test's size was daunting, yes, but it wasn't everything. At that point, he learned a valuable lesson. Our failures might be big and seemingly insurmountable; however, learning from them and moving forward makes us the bigger person. It's not about failing but about what we do after failing that truly defines us. Even in defeat, there was a learning, a lesson that Adam would carry with him well beyond the confines of his current frustration. Relieved, yet wizened, Adam returned to his desk to face the next set of challenges - renewed, prepared, and subtly strengthened. Despite the setbacks, he resolved to use them as stepping stones towards his success. Yes, the test was too big, but so too was his determination to overcome."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Pataki said he expected the facility to generate thousands more jobs in the Hudson Valley area for contractors and suppliers catering to the factory. He praised IBM for being \\"a critical partner in our economic development efforts\\" in New York state. In a brief speech, Samuel J. Palmisano, IBM's chief executive, emphasized that it was important to make long-term investments despite the current slump in the technology business. \\"To play to win in technology, you innovate and you lead,\\" he said. But manufacturing technology products is a costly and cyclical business. In June, IBM announced that it was taking a charge of more than 2 billion against earnings. The largest single reasons for the charge were the cost of getting out of the business of manufacturing hard disks for storage, which it sold to Hitachi, and closing down some of its older semiconductor operations. But Kelly said the demand for advanced chips, like those produced at IBM's facility in Burlington, Vt., is strong. \\"I need more capacity in that end of the market,\\" he said, \\"and this is factory is critical to meeting that growing demand.\\" If IBM has miscalculated the demand, it will suffer badly as both the high operating costs and depreciation on the huge capital investment for the East Fishkill factory drag down earnings.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Which verses of the ballad about the Wabash River talk about missing a loved one? , can you please find it? The ballad speaks of the Wabash River, which flows through Indiana, and reminisces about events that occurred there. The song has two verses and a chorus. The first verse is about the narrator's childhood on a farm and his love for his mother. The second verse is about his lost love, Mary. While the subjects of the verses are connected, the narrative of the chorus is detached from the verses as it seemingly reminisces nostalgically.Without speaking directly of death, both verses indicate the absence of a loved one, and the narrator's sadness and inability to cope with the grief. In the second verse, the narrator cannot bring himself to come near to his lost love's grave. The effort to avoid the subject of death and the focus on fond memories is typical of songs and societal sensibilities at the time.The melody of the song is a memorable tune made easy to learn because of its combination of harmonic repetition and contrast—elements that make music easy to remember while avoiding monotony. The recurrence and dissimilarity within the melody is similar to the patterns in many popular folk songs. Dresser, however, avoided the common 19th-century practice of using a portion of the refrain's melody in the verse. With little formal training in music theory, it is unlikely that Dresser purposefully made any methodical calculations when he composed the melody.Written for piano, guitar, and mandolin, the music begins in the key of G major with an Andante Moderato tempo. The verses follow a chord progression of G–C–G. The chorus transitions to B minor, and progresses as B–E–E, before returning to G–C–G in its final bars. Although the melody of the chorus is unique within the piece, it is in harmonic unity with the verses. An upbeat version played at a Andantino tempo was also adapted for play by small orchestras and big bands. Answer:","completion":"The second verse of the ballad about the Wabash River talks about missing a loved one, specifically the narrator's lost love, Mary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Welcome to the world of multitasking -- a place where the measure of a person is how many jobs they can perform at the same time. In fact, if experts are to be believed, multitasking is a disastrous idea. One of the opponents of multitasking is Dr. Clifford Nass, a professor at Stanford University. \\"People who multitask frequently are less able to pay attention; they're worse at managing their memory.\\" he said. In his opinion, the loss that we get with multitasking is harmless in some situations, for example, part of doing business in the digital world: but you can't do serious work like writing, thinking or solving an important problem this way. You do worse even as you think you're doing better. All the time the research points to a simple fact: the brain cannot cope. When you stop midway through composing a report to check an email, you force your brain to stop and regroup. It is like pressing the pause button during a movie, meaning the film takes longer to watch. And as for Dr. Nass, the problems extend beyond the brain. Young people who frequently multitask are not as socially and emotionally healthy as those who don't. They just feel more emotionally satisfied and the feeling is so good and they are bound to desire it again. Todd Oppenheimer, a writer said \\"We've become a very short-term society and don't reward people for taking a lot of time on something.\\" He fears we may end up losing the next generation of great thinkers. \\"It's really unfortunate because the long-term challenges of our world -- environmental issues, financial issues -- require people to think wisely about the long-term consequences of what they do. And it's no coincidence that the kind of people who do think long-term don't multitask.\\" Question: From the passage, we can tell _ . - the loss that we get with multitasking is harmless - we mistakenly believe that we're doing better by switching between tasks - doing multitasking does harm to us in every area - for every task you add to your multitasking, you can finish your goal quicker A:","completion":"we mistakenly believe that we're doing better by switching between tasks"},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Context: Jordan gave their sibling something to eat so they would have a good lunch.

Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words. Evidence suggests that dormant, microscopic tumors are not only common, but are highly prevalent in otherwise healthy individuals. Due to their small size and non-invasive nature, these dormant tumors remain asymptomatic and, in most cases, undetected. With advances in diagnostic imaging and molecular biology, it is now becoming clear that such neoplasms can remain in an asymptomatic, dormant stage for considerable periods of time without expanding in size. Although a number of processes may play a role in thwarting the expansion of microscopic tumors, one critical mechanism behind tumor dormancy is the ability of the tumor population to induce angiogenesis. Although cancer can arise through multiple pathways, it is assumed that essentially most tumors begin as microscopic, non-angiogenic neoplasms which cannot expand in size until vasculature is established. It is now becoming clear that cancer does not progress through a continuous exponential growth and mass expansion. Clinical cancer is usually manifested only in late, unavoidably symptomatic stages of the disease when tumors are sufficiently large to be readily detected. While dormancy in primary tumors is best defined as the time between the carcinogenic transformation event and the onset of inexorable progressive growth, it can also occur as minimal residual or occult disease from treated tumors or as micro-metastases. The existence of dormant tumors has important implications for the early detection and treatment of cancer. Elucidating the regulatory machinery of these processes will be instrumental in identifying novel early cancer biomarkers and could provide a rationale for the development of dormancy-promoting tumor therapies. Despite the high prevalence of microscopic, dormant tumors in humans and the significant clinical implications of their early detection, this area in cancer research has, to date, been under-investigated. In this mini review observations, models and experimental approaches to study tumor dormancy are summarized. Additionally, analogies and distinctions between the concepts of \\"tumor dormancy\\" and that of the \\"cellular dormancy\\" of tumor cells, as well as between the \\"exit from tumor dormancy\\" and the \\"onset of the angiogenic switch\\" are discussed.","completion":"Title: Dormant Tumors: Prevalence, Detection, and Implications in Cancer Research and Treatment"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He quickly gets used to the city and its people, but finds it under curfew. When he shelters in a nearby tent, a witch (whom the audience later learns is Zenobia) summons a trio of ghouls, which emerge from a fire. Sinbad disposes of the ghouls. Meanwhile, Farah and Kassim's evil stepmother, Zenobia (Margaret Whiting), turn Kassim into a baboon (one of Harryhausen's stop-motion creations) just as he was going to be crowned caliph. If Kassim cannot regain his human form within seven moons, then Zenobia's son Rafi will be caliph instead. Sinbad meets with Farah, who believes Kassim's curse is one of Zenobia's spells. Sinbad, Farah, and the baboon Kassim set off to find the old Greek alchemist named Melanthius (Patrick Troughton), a hermit of on the island of Casgar, who is said to know how to break the spell. Zenobia and her son, Rafi (Kurt Christian), follow in a boat propelled by the robotic bronze Minoton, a magical creature created by the sorceress which looks like a Minotaur.

Article: New software is able to analyze exactly how many hairs there are in a patch of skin and could help in testing the effectiveness of baldness treatments and depilatory creams, say Australian researchers. Researchers from CSIRO Mathematical and Information Sciences in prefix = st1 /Sydneyreport their findings in the November issue of the journalSkin Research and Technology. The software, developed with a UKcompany, will make it easier for researchers developing hair removal creams to accurately assess how well they work, says Dr Pascal Vallotton. \\"Up to now they were counting the number of hairs that survived after treatment by hand. That's hard work and it's difficult because you may count a hair twice or you may miss it.\\" he said. The software relies on images captured by a small flatbed scanner pressed onto the skin. Using a mathematical algorithm , the software then identifies and traces each individual hair based on an understanding of a hair's unique features, such as its straightness. The software is able to distinguish between hairs and other features on the skin such as wounds or moles . \\"Our skin irregularities make it difficult to say this is a hair or this is a mole,\\" Dr Vallotton said. Comparison between earlier and later images can also determine if hair is growing quickly or slowly, he says. Unfortunately, to check the accuracy of the software, the researchers still had to adopt the old-fashioned method of counting hairs, helped by volunteers from neighboring labs who put their skins on the line for science. \\"We had 12 volunteers, mostly from neighboring labs, and we acquired images of hair before and after treatment,\\" Dr Vallotton said. To ensure an accurate count, the individual hairs had to be marked off as they were counted, but after such a laborious process, the researchers were pleased to discover the software results were comparable to the manual count. Dr Vallotton says the software could also be useful in testing the effectiveness of balding treatments and counting or tracing...

Given the following context: When Doris Maxwell starts drilling for oil, cowboy Gene Autry tries to stop the drilling, believing the territory's water supply will be ruined. Doris' father, bank president Maxwell, embezzled 25,000 to support the drilling project. Doris and Gene's fight heats up after he shoots out the tires on her car and she steals his horse, Champion. In an attempt to discredit Gene, Doris, who runs a radio station above Sing Low's cafe, broadcasts him on a program sponsored by the oil company. When Gene discovers the trick, he sets out in a rage to find her. George Wilkins, who is in charge of the oil well drilling, takes Doris to the drilling site and tell her the well is dry and he needs additional funds from her father to bring the well in. Doris doesn't know that Wilkins is actually trying to swindle her father by getting him to pay for all of the equipment while he stalls the drilling. Wilkins intends to take over the lease on the profitable land when the bank's lease runs out. While taking the payroll to the drilling site, Wilkins and Doris are held up by two thieves, who are actually Wilkins' henchmen. Gene comes to the rescue and grudingly returns the money to Doris, who continues on to the drilling site. Wilkins reprimands his men for getting caught and then lets them go. Doris and Gene return to the bank, where they discover Maxwell has tried to commit suicide after receiving a letter notifying him that the bank examiner would be arriving soon.

Sentence 2: Eventually people become happy with living on garbage dumps. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Select from: (1). yes. (2). it is not possible to tell. (3). no.","completion":"(3). no. The two sentences have contrasting ideas about people living on garbage dumps. Sentence 1 states that people are no longer eager to live on garbage dumps, which implies that at some point, they may have been willing to do so but have now lost interest or motivation to continue this lifestyle. This can be due to various reasons such as deterioration of health, difficulties obtaining necessary resources, or a change in their perception of living conditions. On the other hand, Sentence 2 states that people become happy with living on garbage dumps. This implies that over time, people have adapted to and grown content with this seemingly undesirable living situation. Reasons for this happiness could include a sense of community among garbage dump residents, learning to make the most of available resources, or developing coping mechanisms to deal with their circumstances. Based on the information provided in the first sentence, it is clear that the second sentence cannot be true. The first sentence asserts that people are no longer eager and, by extension, it means they are not happy with living on garbage dumps.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Signs of Hope as BP Captures Record Oil Amounts Good days are relative for BP, the company responsible for stopping the largest offshore oil spill in the nation’s history. But the last two days brought moderate signs of progress in the company’s struggle to contain the catastrophe flowing from the floor of the Gulf of Mexico. BP said Friday that it had captured 25,290 barrels on Thursday of crude oil leaking from the wrecked well. That amount was the most for a single day since the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig on April 20, though still not close to the total amount of oil pouring into the gulf each day. The drilling of one of the relief wells, expected to be the means of sealing the damaged well, came within 200 feet of its destination, BP said. The Coast Guard, meanwhile, said skimming equipment was being constructed for 2,000 more available vessels through BP’s Vessels of Opportunity program, which hires local boat owners to help clean up the oil. “As many as we can make and as fast as we can get them here,” Adm. Thad W. Allen of the Coast Guard, the national incident commander, said in his daily briefing. The need for expediency underscores the stark reality: oil is still gushing at 35,000 to 60,000 barrels a day, with no signs of slowing down. BP said early August was still the target time for killing the well — the technical term for sealing what has become a pernicious adversary — when the two relief wells are completed. How, then, is it possible to measure progress that may seem like a few drops in the proverbial bucket? The Coast Guard and BP prefer to consider the recent small advances — cautiously — as signs of hope. The Q4000, the second vessel to join the containment effort above the well, began collecting oil Tuesday morning, and within three days was nearly achieving its maximum capacity of about 10,000 barrels a day. On Wednesday, the two systems combined to collect 18,600 barrels of oil, which increased by nearly 7,000 barrels on Thursday. “I was quite encouraged,” said Kent Wells, a BP senior vice president, who gave a technical update to reporters on Friday. By the end of June, the Q4000, together with the Discoverer Enterprise, the vessel with a direct connection to the containment cap on the well, will be joined by a third means of collecting escaping oil: a free-standing riser on the seabed floor. Together, they are expected to be able to collect about 50,000 barrels of oil daily, Mr. Wells said. By mid-July, BP is planning to put a tighter cap on the well, and establish the second free-standing riser pipe, which can easily be disconnected in the event of a hurricane. By then, there would be four vessels in the gulf collecting oil — with a total capacity of 80,000 barrels a day. That figure might seem excessive, considering scientists have estimated the maximum flow rate to be only 60,000 barrels a day. But Mr. Wells explained that was to cover all contingencies, “if once we start capturing all the oil, something goes wrong and we’re not capturing any at all,” he said. After all, the process to kill and even contain the well has been full of failed attempts only recently. BP has said that the relief well offers the best chance to seal the well for good. Two wells are being drilled — one as a backup. Although the first is close to the existing well, the farther down in the layers of rock beneath the seabed the drill bit goes, the slower the process will be as BP determines the exact point to curve back and intersect the leaking well. They will use electromagnetic sensors to assist them. “We’re going to drill a couple hundred feet, see where the well is, and drill another 200 feet,” Mr. Wells said. “We’re honing in on exactly where the well is. Not only do we have to find where it is, we have to go right beside it and come back into it — that’s what takes the time.” As of Thursday, BP has been able to capture 204,200 barrels of oil using the twofold containment system. “Things have gone well down to this stage,” Mr. Wells said, “but that doesn’t always mean things will continue to go well.” Summary:","completion":"BP has had some progress in stopping a big oil spill in the ocean. They have captured a lot of oil, which helps a little, but oil is still coming out fast. They are making new ways to catch the oil and plan to seal the well, which will stop the oil from coming out. People are hoping their plans will work and help fix this big problem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Text: The pound is the currency of Guernsey. Since 1921, Guernsey has been in currency union with the United Kingdom and the Guernsey pound is not a separate currency but is a local issue of banknotes and coins denominated in pound sterling, in a similar way to the banknotes issued in Scotland, England and Northern Ireland (see Banknotes of the pound sterling). It can be exchanged at par with other sterling coinage and notes (see also sterling zone). Question: can you use guernsey money in the uk?","completion":"Yes, you can use Guernsey money in the UK, but with certain limitations. The Guernsey pound, as mentioned in the text, is not a separate currency but a local issue of banknotes and coins denominated in pound sterling. It is part of the currency union with the United Kingdom, which means that it shares the same value as the British pound and can be exchanged at par with other sterling coinage and notes. However, the acceptance of Guernsey banknotes and coins in the UK depends on the discretion of individual businesses, banks, and service providers. While it is possible to encounter businesses in the UK that will accept Guernsey banknotes and coins, many shops, restaurants, or transportation services may not recognize them or choose not to accept them due to unfamiliarity or because they perceive it as a potential risk. In general, it is more common for Guernsey money to be accepted in the UK in larger establishments, such as banks and post offices. They are more likely to accept and exchange Guernsey notes and coins for their British counterparts at par value. Smaller businesses, on the other hand, may be less willing or able to handle Guernsey money. It is advisable to exchange Guernsey money for British pounds before traveling to the UK to avoid any difficulties in making payments for goods and services. This can be done at most banks or currency exchange offices in Guernsey or, in some cases, upon arrival in the United Kingdom. In summary, while Guernsey pounds can technically be used in the UK due to the currency union with the United Kingdom, it is not universally accepted, and some businesses may not accept it. For convenience and to avoid potential complications, it is recommended to exchange Guernsey money for British pounds before traveling to or upon arrival in the UK."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Renee (Sarah Clarke), on the other hand, is excited and has obviously been expecting the engagement as she shares the invitation with her husband, Phil (Ty Olsson).It's the day before the wedding and the Cullens are preparing their estate for the wedding, all under the direction of Alice (Ashley Greene), who has placed herself in charge, down to the last detail. She sends Bella home for 'lots of beauty sleep,' but Bella sleeps poorly; first, just before she goes to bed, Edward goes to see her and tell her of a time shortly after he was turned, when he struck out on his own to hunt humans for blood (even though his conscience ensured he only killed men who murdered and victimized other people), as a warning against Bella becoming a vampire; and then Bella has a nightmare where the Volturi-- Aro (Michael Sheen), Marcus (Christopher Heyerdahl) and Caius (Jamie Campbell Bower)-- are standing before them in place of the minister, and then suddenly both Edward's tuxedo and Bella's dress are covered in blood as they stand before a pile of bodies -- all of the wedding guests.Bella must face Alice on the wedding day after not having slept, but Alice is pleased to see Rosalie (Nikki Reed) finally starting to warm to Bella as the finality of Bella's joining the Cullen family is finally upon them all. Bella's parents give her a sapphire-encrusted hair comb to wear in her hair, much to Alice's delight.Bella starts to have... My question: Where was the couple's honeymoon?

How do you say \\"« Digital Baby Adventure\\" in Spanish?","completion":"In Spanish, you can say \\"« Aventura Digital del Bebé\\" for \\"Digital Baby Adventure.\\" Here's a breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"Aventura\\": This word translates to \\"adventure\\" in English. It retains the same excitement and connotation of exploration, fun, and excitement. 2. \\"Digital\\": This word is a cognate, meaning it shares the same spelling and similar pronunciation in both English and Spanish. It's the appropriate term for conveying the concept of digital technology or digitally-related content. 3. \\"del\\": This is a contraction of the preposition \\"de\\" (of) and the article \\"el\\" (the). In this case, it's used to link the words \\"aventura\\" and \\"bebé.\\" The contraction \\"del\\" is used instead of \\"de el\\" because it's more grammatically correct in Spanish and helps the sentence flow better. 4. \\"Bebé\\": This word translates to \\"baby\\" in English. It's an essential element of the phrase, as it specifies the focus of the adventure.

Is this product review negative? A:","completion":"Yes, this review can indeed be categorized as negative for the most part although it does feature a few mild positive comments. The critique starts by acknowledging that the DVD associated with the product makes a \\"good addition\\", suggesting some satisfaction with this aspect of the purchase; however, the ensuing comments predominantly express dissatisfaction and criticism. Firstly, the reviewer mentions they were compelled to turn the sound off, which immediately indicates potential dissatisfaction related to sound quality, performance, or content. A second complaint regards the sound of the drums, likening them to that of a drum machine, which is typically considered an inferior sound compared to authentic drum playing. The reviewer then goes on to use the term \\"pitiful\\" in a rhetorical question about the album's producer, demonstrating a lack of approval or satisfaction with the production quality on this album. They also show appreciation for one song, \\"Unknown Feeling,\\" stating they like it. This and the comment about the DVD are the only notable positive remarks in the whole review. The reviewer next expresses disappointment with the lack of guitar solos in the album. For a music aficionado or a particular genre's fan, this omission could significantly detarct from their listening experience. Further, the reviewer mockingly adds that they are getting sleepy writing this review, conveying boredom or lack of excitement regarding the material they are commenting on. In the closing line, they circle back to their issue with the drum sound, expressing discontent once again. Taking all of these factors into account, even though there are a few positive remarks within this review, the overbearing tone of dissatisfaction along with direct criticisms towards various elements of the product makes this a negative review. To sum up, the reviewer seems mainly disappointed with their purchase, characterizing it by poor sound and production quality, as well as a lack of components they find important (i.e., guitar solos)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given those answer options, answer the question: If I tell you that Plants are multicellular eukaryotes with cell walls composed primarily of lignin, and ask you the question \\"plants are multicellular eukaryotes with cell walls composed primarily of what?\\", is the correct answer \\"protein\\"? A:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"protein\\". According to the information you provided, plants are multicellular eukaryotes with cell walls composed primarily of lignin. Lignin is a complex organic polymer that provides structural support and rigidity to plant cells. Proteins play diverse roles in plants, such as enzymes for metabolic reactions, structural components for cells and tissues, or as signaling molecules to communicate between cells. However, proteins do not serve as the primary component of plant cell walls. The major components of plant cell walls are cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Among these, cellulose is the most abundant biopolymer that forms the framework of the cell wall, while hemicellulose binds to cellulose microfibrils to provide added mechanical strength. Lignin is important for the structural integrity of plant tissues, predominantly in secondary cell walls. It provides rigidity and protects against pathogens and various environmental stresses. In summary, given the information that plants are multicellular eukaryotes with cell walls composed primarily of lignin, the correct answer to the question \\"plants are multicellular eukaryotes with cell walls composed primarily of what?\\" is \\"lignin\\", not \\"protein\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow—and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue. Two friends went to the doctor because they weren't feeling well. As it turns out Danny had a condition called hypercalcaemia, while Greg had hypocalcaemia. Which friend had an excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH)?

Translate to English English:","completion":"Consequently, the budget for Section 18 regarding the Area of Freedom, Security, and Justice has increased to 105 million euros, which will contribute to strengthening the administrative and financial management of the member states. In more detail, this increase in the budget for Section 18 - the Area of Freedom, Security, and Justice - highlights the growing importance of creating an environment where European citizens can effectively exercise their rights and freedoms. The budget increase will have a direct impact on various aspects of the European Union's functioning, including improved security measures, more efficient legal proceedings, and better management of migration and asylum policies. The 105 million euros allocated to this section will be distributed among several key initiatives designed to enhance the cooperation and coordination among European member states. These initiatives include the following: 1. Strengthening border security: A significant portion of the budget increase will be dedicated to improving border control measures, with a particular focus on member states that are more exposed to external border pressures. This step is crucial in ensuring the containment of irregular migration and preserving the safety and security of European citizens. 2. Enhancing police and judicial cooperation: Enhanced cooperation between law enforcement agencies and judicial authorities is essential in the fight against terrorism, organized crime, and cross-border criminal activities. The additional funds will enable the implementation of advanced IT systems and tools, as well as the organization of joint training programs and the exchange of best practices among member states. 3. Improving migration management: The increased budget will support the development of effective asylum and migration management systems in member states, promoting the fair treatment of applicants and fostering the integration of refugees within host communities. Additionally, resources will be allocated to combat human smuggling and trafficking networks, and to provide humanitarian assistance to migrants in distress. 4. Supporting fundamental rights and the rule of law: The budget increase will ensure that the EU continues to closely monitor and address any breaches of fundamental rights, whether occurring within member states or outside its borders. This includes financing projects to combat discrimination, racism, and xenophobia, as well as ensuring the respect of rule of law principles in the member states. 5. Enhancing administrative and financial management capacities: Lastly, the additional funds will contribute to building more robust and efficient public administrations in the member states, ultimately benefiting European citizens through improved public service delivery and more transparent and accountable decision-making processes. In conclusion, the increase of the budget allocated to Section 18 - the Area of Freedom, Security, and Justice - will play a crucial role in promoting a more secure, fair, and inclusive Europe.

Adam felt instant relief. B). Steven felt instant relief.","completion":"The lower back massage was ideal for Adam but not Steven because A). Adam felt instant relief. Adam had been experiencing chronic lower back pain for quite some time due to his lower back muscles being excessively tense and tight from strenuous workouts, a sedentary work life, and poor posture. He was eager to try a lower back massage in an attempt to alleviate some of this discomfort and help the affected muscles relax. As Adam had hoped, the lower back massage offered him instant relief from his pain. The massage therapist carefully and expertly targeted the tight muscles in his lower back, applying precise pressure and utilizing various massage techniques such as kneading, gliding, and friction, all of which are designed to improve blood flow, reduce inflammation, and induce relaxation in the area. By targeting the exact location and source of Adam's discomfort, the massage therapist was able to efficiently break down the knotted and tense muscle fibers, gradually easing the pain in his lower back. In addition, the increased blood flow to the area helped reduce inflammation and deliver essential nutrients to the affected muscles, further promoting healing and relaxation. On the other hand, Steven also tried the lower back massage, but he did not find it as effective or therapeutic as Adam did. Steven has a unique set of factors contributing to his lower back pain, such as nerve compression, slight herniated discs, and possibly an underlying genetic predisposition. In his case, the lower back massage alone was not sufficient to provide him with instant relief from his pain. Steven's situation required a more comprehensive approach that would involve addressing the specific underlying issues causing his pain. In addition to the massage, he might benefit from supplementary interventions such as physical therapy, targeted exercise programs, chiropractic care, and possibly even medical treatment if necessary. These additional treatments could help address the structural and functional issues uniquely impacting Steven, and they may need to be continued over an extended period for the best results. In conclusion, the lower back massage was ideal for Adam but not Steven because Adam felt instantaneous relief from his pain. The massage addressed the specific muscle tension issues that Adam was facing, providing him with much-needed attunement and relaxation of his back muscles. Conversely, Steven's lower back pain was caused by a combination of factors that the massage alone could not resolve. He may need to explore alternative therapies and treatments in order to discover the most appropriate solution for his unique situation, as his pain relief has proven to be more complex and multifaceted."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Step 2: Create an account and log in Most forums require that you create an account to be able to participate in discussions or use the search function. Use a valid email address and a secure password to create an account following the particular forum's registration process. Step 3: Familiarize yourself with the forum Before diving into searching, spend some time browsing the forum and familiarizing yourself with its layout, rules, and overall culture. This will not only help you understand how the forum operates but also enable you to become a more effective participant in discussions. Step 4: Locate the search function Most forums have a search bar or a magnifying glass icon situated at the top of the page, allowing users to input search queries. If the search function is not readily visible, check within the forum's navigation menus or consult the forum's help section. Step 5: Conduct a precise search When using the search function, try to use specific keywords and phrases related to your topic of interest. Refrain from using overly general terms and consider using quotation marks around exact phrases in your search query to narrow down your results. Step 6: Filter and sort results Most forums offer the option to filter and sort results based on various criteria, such as relevance, date, or popularity. This can be quite helpful in sifting through the search results to find the most relevant and up-to-date information on a particular issue. Step 7: Engage with the forum Once you have found the information you were seeking or discovered a relevant discussion, don't hesitate to engage with the forum. This could mean posting your own related question, contributing your knowledge, or simply thanking someone for their assistance. Step 8: Follow forum etiquette Always be respectful, polite, and considerate when participating in a forum. Maintain the forum's guidelines and avoid spamming, trolling, or offensive behavior. By doing so, you contribute positively to the community and increase the likelihood of receiving helpful responses. By following these steps, you can effectively use the search function on forums, allowing you to find valuable information, engage with like-minded individuals, and become an active and contributing member of the community."},{"prompt":"Q:Question: What burning feeling is eating hamburger in large amunts likely to cause?

The giant panda, on loan to Beauval zoo park, central France, from China, late on Friday, gave birth to a twin cubs but one died afterwards. \\"Congratulations on the birth of the baby panda at the Beauval zoo park. It is a great success for the zoo park and for our two countries,\\" the Chinese diplomat said. \\"I hope that the baby panda grows in the best conditions. A new symbol of Sino-French friendship, it will be a further link between our two peoples,\\" he added. In her first delivery, Huan Huan \\"was very calm\\" and has given birth to two cubs at an interval of a few minutes, the zoo said. The first panda cub was born at 10:18 p.m. local time (2018 GMT), and the other came 14 minutes later. In the wild, female pandas raise only one cub, the \\"strongest\\", the one that has the most chances of survival, and abandon the second. Huan Huan took care of the first cub immediately after its birth, but chose the second cub and abandoned the first after the second cub was born. France's first lady Brigitte Macron will be named godmother of the first cub born in France. Huan Huan and her male partner Yuan Zi arrived in central France's Beauval zoo in January 2012. There are about 2,000 pandas in the world. They are classified as \\"vulnerable\\" species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). ||||| PARIS (Reuters) - A giant panda in Beauval zoo gave birth to twin cubs on Friday, the first ever to be born in France, but one died shortly afterwards, the zoo said. Huan Huan, a female on loan to the zoo from China, had been under close surveillance for several days and a crack team of veterinary staff including two Chinese birthing specialists assembled for the birth. “Huan Huan remained very calm throughout. The first baby came quickly and Huan Huan held it against her and licked it clean,” the zoo said in a statement. “The second followed 14 minutes later. Huan Huan abandoned the first and looked after the second.” While an adult female panda can weigh up to 125 kilograms (275 pounds), a baby panda weighs barely 120 grams (4 ounces) at birth. In the wild, pandas typically give birth to a single infant, born tiny, blind and pink with hardly any hairs. While the second baby was strong and healthy, the zoo said, the firstborn was much weaker and died after barely two hours. Huan Huan and her partner Yuan Zi, whose names translate as “Joy” and “Podgy” respectively, came to France in 2012, their arrival hailed as a sign of warming diplomatic ties between Paris and Beijing. They are due to stay until 2022 before being returned to China. Their offspring will stay in France until the age of two or three before being returned to China. ||||| This will appear next to all of your comments This will NOT appear anywhere on Newser ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Chinese Ambassador to France, Zhai Jun, has celebrated the birth of the first baby panda in France as a symbol of friendship between the two nations.

Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in Hebrew. Your job is to translate the Hebrew sentence into Portugese. Q: זה שונה מאשר להיות ביישן. A:","completion":"1. First, we need to identify the words in the Hebrew sentence and understand their meaning. The sentence consists of five words: זה (this), שונה (different), מאשר (from), להיות (to be), ביישן (shy). 2. Next, we will determine the grammatical structure of the sentence. In this case, the sentence follows a structure similar to \\"This is different from being shy,\\" with the main subject being \\"this,\\" followed by \\"is different,\\" which describes the subject, and \\"from being shy,\\" which provides a comparison. 3. Now that we understand the meaning and structure of the Hebrew sentence, we can begin the translation process into Portugese. We will start with the subject, זה, which can be translated to \\"isto\\" in Portugese. 4. Next, we will translate the verb and adjective combination שונה (different) into Portugese. The appropriate term in Portugese for שונה is \\"diferente.\\" 5. Following that, we need to translate the preposition מאשר (from) into Portugese. The equivalent preposition in Portugese for מאשר is \\"de.\\" 6. After that, we will translate the verb להיות (to be) in Portugese. The infinitive form of \\"to be\\" in Portugese is \\"ser.\\" 7. Finally, we will translate the adjective ביישן (shy) into Portugese. The Portugese word for \\"shy\\" is \\"tímido.\\" 8. With all the words translated, we can now combine them to create a coherent sentence in Portugese: \\"Isto é diferente de ser tímido.\\" So, the translation of the Hebrew sentence זה שונה מאשר להיות ביישן into Portugese is: \\"Isto é diferente de ser tímido.\\""},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: Rose decides that she cannot leave who, and jumps back on the ship?

The problem is that we the public have to observe the rules. For example, we must put a stamp on a letter. If we don't, the receiver will have to pay double. We often see the sign ALL LETTERS MUST BE CORRECTLY ADDRESSED. These days, this means having to use postcodes. If you didn't use a postcode, it's no good complaining that your letter should have arrived sooner. Parcels are a problem because they must be correctly packaged. If Aunt Sophie is going to send you a jar of your favorite jam, she will have to wrap it up well. The most important thing we have to do is to address our letters and parcels legibly and correctly. This means clear handwriting and correct spelling. What we should do and what we actually do are often miles apart. Recently, the Post Office had to deliver a letter which showed a name followed by the word Arijaba. What is this, do you think? Arabic? Hiodustani ? Wrong both times! Say it out loud and you'll see it's just plain English. HARWICH HARBOUR! From the passage we can see that postmen _ . A) have no difficulty in delivering any letters B) have difficulty in delivering mis-spelt letters C) won't deliver any letters with bad handwriting D) can deliver all letters to their destinations A:","completion":"From the passage, it is clear that postmen in Britain B) have difficulty in delivering mis-spelt letters. Mis-spellings, unclear handwriting, and the lack of proper packaging and postage requirements, such as stamps and postcodes, present significant challenges for postal workers. Despite their commitment and dedication to delivering every piece of mail correctly, they face difficulty when these guidelines aren't adhered to by the public. The passage uses the example of a letter addressed simply with a name followed by the word \\"Arijaba\\" resulting in confusion. While it might make sense to the sender, it can be challenging for the postman to figure out the intended destination. In this case, the word \\"Arijaba\\", when read aloud, is meant to sound like \\"Harwich Harbour\\", but this phonetic puzzle may not be evident to the postal worker. Hence, illustrating the importance of correct spelling and clear handwriting. Furthermore, parcels pose a particular challenge if they are not correctly packaged. The example of Aunt Sophie’s jam jar demonstrates that if items are not well wrapped and protected, they might not reach their destinations in one piece. It also suggests that if Aunt Sophie failed to label the parcel correctly, it might not reach its intended recipient at all. The final and most crucial aspect highlighted in the passage is regarding the use of postcodes. These days, it isn't enough to just correctly name the city or town. The zipcode or postcode should be provided for quick and efficient sorting and delivery of mail. While postmen are traditionally known for their ability to handle some complexities of the mail system, consistently facing these barriers makes it hard for them to guarantee accurate delivery of all letters and parcels. Their job is simplified and more effective when the public respect and follow the rules outlined by the post office: proper labeling, correct spelling, clear handwriting, accurate packaging, and correct postage including stamps and postcodes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.

Please answer the following question: Which opera has more acts, The Bassarids or Don Quichotte? Answer:","completion":"Don Quichotte, an opera by Jules Massenet based on the novel Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes, has more acts than The Bassarids, an opera composed by Hans Werner Henze with a libretto by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman based on Euripides's The Bacchae. Don Quichotte is composed of five acts, while The Bassarids consists of only one act, divided into three parts. Here is a more detailed look at these two operas: Don Quichotte: 1. Composer: Jules Massenet 2. Librettist: Henri Caïn 3. Premiere: February 19, 1910, at the Opéra de Monte-Carlo 4. Structure: Five acts Act 1 - Don Quichotte's Library Act 2 - The Windmills Act 3 - The Innkeepers Act 4 - The Mountains: Dulcinea's Aria Act 5 - Don Quichotte's Death The story depicts the adventures of Don Quixote, an eccentric and idealistic knight-errant, and his loyal squire, Sancho Panza. Don Quichotte's hopeless love for the beautiful and unattainable Dulcinea and his gallant, chivalric exploits with the windmills are immortalized in Massenet's composition. The Bassarids: 1. Composer: Hans Werner Henze 2. Librettists: W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman 3. Premiere: August 6, 1966, at the Salzburg Festival 4. Structure: One act, divided into three parts: Part 1 - Prologue, Parodos, and Scene 1 Part 2 - Scenes 2 and 3 Part 3 - Scenes 4 and 5, Exodos The Bassarids is a retelling of Euripides's tragedy, The Bacchae, presenting the conflict between the rational, ordered world of King Pentheus of Thebes and the irrational, chaotic forces of Dionysus, the god of wine and ecstasy. The opera explores themes of order and anarchy, control and freedom, and the power of individual and collective desire. In conclusion, Don Quichotte, with its five acts, is the more extensive opera in comparison to The Bassarids, which has only one act divided into three parts. Both operas offer unique perspectives on the human experience, with Don Quichotte presenting a romantic vision of chivalry and The Bassarids delving into the dark forces of human nature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Run Lola Run Movie plot: Introduction[edit] Lola (Franka Potente) receives a frantic phone call from her boyfriend, Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu). Manni is a small-time criminal who has just collected 100,000 marks cash in his most recent crime. Lola had agreed to meet Manni at the crime scene and to drive him to deliver the money to his boss, Ronnie. Lola tried to do so, but her moped was stolen en route to meet Manni. When Lola failed to arrive on time, Manni, carrying the cash in a bag, took a subway train. Manni panicked when he saw ticket inspectors in his car. He fled and thoughtlessly left the bag of money on the subway because he does not have a subway ticket. As he does, Manni spotted a homeless man examining Manni's money bag in the subway car. Manni, realizing what he had done, pursued the train as it departed, only to find the man and the money gone. Manni calls Lola from a phone booth. He complains that Lola let him down. He tells Lola that unless he raises 100,000 marks to give Ronnie within 20 minutes, Ronnie will kill him. Manni also tells Lola of his plan to rob a nearby supermarketâwhich for several obvious reasons is unwise. Lola implores Manni to wait and promises to find the money. She decides to ask her father (Herbert Knaup), who is a bank manager, for help. After this telephone call, the rest of the film is divided into three \\"runs\\" by Lola, in each of which she tries to obtain the money and save Manni.

Process: - A butterfly starts as an egg - The egg hatches - A larva emerges - The larva eats and grows - The larva sheds its skin - The larva enters a chrysalis - The pupa grows inside the chrysalis - The adult butterfly exits the chrysalis - The adult butterfly is now fully grown - The adult butterfly lays more eggs. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less larvae grow happens, how will it affect LESS butterflies. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"Step 1: Identify the perturbation In this case, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that less larvae growth is happening. Step 2: Understand the original process The original process involves an egg hatching into a larva, the larva eating and growing, shedding its skin, entering a chrysalis, the pupa developing inside the chrysalis, and finally, an adult butterfly emerging and laying more eggs. Step 3: Analyze the impact of the perturbation on the process If less larval growth occurs, it implies that a smaller number of larvae reach the stage of entering the chrysalis. As a result, fewer pupae would develop inside of the chrysalises. Step 4: Determine the direct effects Directly, this would lead to a smaller number of adult butterflies emerging from the chrysalises than initially expected. Step 5: Determine the indirect effects Indirectly, fewer adult butterflies would mean less overall reproduction because fewer butterflies will be available to lay eggs. This would reduce the number of eggs laid, resulting in a decreased butterfly population over time. Step 6: Conclusion The proposed perturbation of reduced larval growth would have both direct and indirect effects on the butterfly lifecycle process. Directly, it would result in fewer adult butterflies; indirectly, it would reduce the overall butterfly population by limiting reproduction opportunities."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

She is three months pregnant and happily settled, but love life wasn't always so blissful for Katie Piper. The model, 30, has gone from strength to strength since she survived an horrific acid attack arranged by her ex-boyfriend Daniel Lynch in 2008. But she reveals getting back into dating after the ordeal was 'awful'. 'When I started dating again, it was like being 13 or 14 because I'd forgotten - should you kiss on a date? What do you wear? When do you text back? Do you have to pretend you don't like someone when you do?' Blooming lovely: Katie Piper at The Inspiration Awards For Women 2013 at Cadogan Hall in London this week. In a frank interview with the Sun's Fabulous magazine, Katie said while all her friends were starting. to settle down she was 'feeling very insecure' and 'getting it all. wrong'. 'There were people I thought liked me who actually didn't, people who maybe just felt sorry for me or wanted to go on dates with me to ask me about the TV show rather than because they fancied me... When I got rejected, instead of thinking \\"Oh well\\" I'd take it really badly. It was like being a little girl with no experience,' she said. Katie is now coupled up with her boyfriend of 18 months, whom she keeps out of the limelight. They are expecting their first child together. She said: 'I'm in love. With my boyfriend, it was never an issue or a big conversation. He would've known the news story about the girl who had acid thrown in her face, but he didn't know the ins and outs... It was me who brought it up in the end.' Through the other side: She reveals after an 'awful' time getting back into dating, she's settled. In May 2009, Lynch and Sylvestre were told by the judge that they were 'the face of pure evil'. Both were jailed for life and Lynch will serve a minimum of 16 years. Despite scarring her physically for life, the model from Andover, Hampshire, has enjoyed a successful career as a charity campaigner, presenter and spokesperson in the five years since suffering the life-changing event. Katie. announced just a fortnight ago that she was 'beaming' after going to. her 12-week scan last week, described the news of her pregnancy as. 'beyond incredible'. Speaking of the happy news: 'I've always. known that I have wanted children but there were moments after what. happened to me that I never thought this would happen, I never believed. this would be my future. 'It's beyond incredible,' she said, speaking to The Sunday Mirror. 'It's because I'm so happy about it that it's been so hard keeping quiet and I'm actually relieved to be able to tell everyone.' Fans quickly reacted to the good news on Twitter, prompting Katie to reply she has been 'Overwhelmed by all the congratulations tweets and best wishes! Thank you so much has completely taken my mind of todays morning sickness! X' Campaigner: Katie Piper is part of a groundbreaking M&S ad. campaign including a new short film. The good news is a far cry from her. her distressing experience five years ago, when violent ex-boyfriend. Lynch raped Katie and held her captive in a London hotel for eight. hours. But his revenge for. being rejected seemingly knew no bounds and two days later, under his. direction, accomplice Stefan Sylvestre threw a cup of. industrial-strength sulphuric acid in her face. The attack on a London street melted her face, blinded her in one eye and left her with horrific burns. Rushed. to the burns unit of Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, Katie was. showered with tap water for ten hours as medics fought to neutralise the. effect of the acid on her skin and prevent further damage. Eye drops were also administered every few minutes to try to wash the acid away. But. her injuries were unimaginable. The left side of Katie's face was. burned away to the fat layer - the only thing beyond it was muscle and. bone. She lost the sight in. her left eye and acid also dripped down her neck, ears and hands as well. as slipping into her nose and throat, with further terrible. consequences. Before and after: Katie had been an aspiring model before the attack in 2008, which left her with horrific burns. For more than a. year she had to be fed through a tube in her stomach and surgery to. dilate her oesophagus. In total, she has endured more than 40 operations. since the attack. As. well as the physical damage, the attack left Katie fearful of going out. in public and her self-esteem was at had all time low as she hated. seeing her scarred face, which she had to cover with a protective mask. for two years. Katie has since won widespread support for her series of thought-provoking. documentaries for Channel 4, written three books about her experience. and has won awards - including Woman of the Year in 2011 and a Pride of. Britain award. She has also. set up her own charity, The Katie Piper Foundation, to help other burn. victims receive medical and emotional support.

In the course of a long and innovative career, he played a prominent role in the revival of interest in British folk music in the early years of the 20th century. Although much of his work was experimental and unusual, the piece with which he is most generally associated is his piano arrangement of the folk-dance tune \\"Country Gardens\\". Grainger left Australia at the age of 13 to attend the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt. Between 1901 and 1914 he was based in London, where he established himself first as a society pianist and later as a concert performer, composer and collector of original folk melodies. As his reputation grew he met many of the significant figures in European music, forming important friendships with Frederick Delius and Edvard Grieg. He became a champion of Nordic music and culture, his enthusiasm for which he often expressed in private letters, sometimes in crudely racial or anti-Semitic terms. In 1914, Grainger moved to the United States, where he lived for the rest of his life, though he travelled widely in Europe and in Australia. He served briefly as a bandsman in the United States Army during the First World War through 1917–18, and took American citizenship in 1918. After his mother's suicide in 1922, he became increasingly involved in educational work. He also experimented with music machines, which he hoped would supersede human interpretation. In the 1930s he set up the Grainger Museum in Melbourne, his birthplace, as a monument to his life and works, and as a future research archive. As he grew older, he continued to give concerts and to revise and rearrange his own compositions, while writing little new music.

She had intended Newton to become a clergyman, but she died of tuberculosis when he was six years old. For the next few years, Newton was raised by his emotionally distant stepmother while his father was at sea, and spent some time at a boarding school where he was mistreated. At the age of eleven, he joined his father on a ship as an apprentice; his seagoing career would be marked by headstrong disobedience. As a youth, Newton began a pattern of coming very close to death, examining his relationship with God, then relapsing into bad habits. As a sailor, he denounced his faith after being influenced by a shipmate who discussed Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times, a book by the Third Earl of Shaftesbury, with him. In a series of letters he later wrote, \\"Like an unwary sailor who quits his port just before a rising storm, I renounced the hopes and comforts of the Gospel at the very time when every other comfort was about to fail me.\\" His disobedience caused him to be pressed into the Royal Navy, and he took advantage of opportunities to overstay his leave and finally deserted to visit Mary \\"Polly\\" Catlett, a family friend with whom he had fallen in love.

If you answered that they are all fruits you are absolutely correct. If you answered that they are all good for your health you are spot on again. Fruits used to be a staple in many diets, however in amongst all of the low carb and anti sugar chaos, many people are now avoiding them. In a rush to rid the diet of ‘toxic sugar’, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact. Most recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third. The main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits’ high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Eating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits – in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears – could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%. In the same study those who consumed two or more serves of fruit juice per day increased their risk of developing diabetes by as much as 21%. As Tim wrote in a previous blog post, this is reason why you should be eating your fruit, not drinking it According to the above context, answer the following question. When did researchers discover eating a lot of fruit can reduce the risk of an aortic aneurysm?

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up. I am facing a new situation today: There are two cities, Chien and Marisol, in France that are leaders in the amount of wine they export to the rest of the world. Although they both export the same amount of wine, they use different sources of power to generate their electricity. Chien uses coal to power the city and Marisol uses nuclear power plants to produce electricity. The citizens of both cities are voting on whether to continue their current method of electricity generation. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which city has less air pollution? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background article you provided, Marisol, the city that uses nuclear power plants to produce electricity, would have less air pollution compared to Chien, the city that uses coal power. The majority of electricity in the U.S. is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels, which generates air pollution that negatively impacts the health of living things, acid rain, and contributes to global warming. Since Chien utilizes coal as its primary energy source, it is reasonable to assume that it is prone to higher levels of air pollution. In contrast, nuclear energy, which is utilized by Marisol, does not release air pollution or cause the environmental issues associated with burning fossil fuels. While nuclear energy also involves nonrenewable resources (radioactive elements), it does not contribute to air pollution in the same manner as burning coal or fossil fuels. Therefore, Marisol, the city using nuclear power plants for electricity generation, likely experiences less air pollution than Chien, the city relying on coal power."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Get a Safety Deposit Box.","completion":"Title: Superior Strategies for Neopoint Management in Neopets: Save, Reach Goals, Collect Interest Step One: Overview The first step to writing this article based on the provided summary is to understand the user's requirement. Here, the user wants an article based on the popular online game Neopets, specifically focusing on saving Neopoints, setting goals, collecting interest, hitting the withdrawal limit, and acquiring a Safety Deposit Box. To create an engaging and informative article, I will explain each of these terms in the context of the game. Step Two: Introduction The Neopets universe provides a thrilling interaction for millions of players around the globe. Within this virtual world, the Neopoint serves as the primary currency used for numerous activities. Effectively managing your Neopoints can enhance the overall gaming experience, helping you achieve significant milestones. It necessitates strategic actions such as saving your Neopoints, setting achievable goals, collecting interest, hitting the withdrawal limit, and getting a Safety Deposit Box. Step Three: Saving Your Neopoints Savings are a key component in Neopets, allowing you to accumulate wealth over time. As in real life, impulsive spending can be detrimental to your game progress. It is crucial to think carefully before spending your hard-earned Neopoints on unnecessary items. This forms a fundamental strategy to build a large pool of Neopoints over time. Step Four: Setting Goals In the exciting world of Neopets, setting goals provides a sense of direction to your game. Whether your goal is to buy a Paint Brush, expand your Neohome, or acquire rare items, clear goals can motivate you to save more and spend wisely. Therefore, having goals is an engaging way to manage your Neopoints effectively. Step Five: Collecting Interest Neopets also offers the opportunity of a Neopoints Bank account where you can store your Neopoints safely and earn a daily interest. The more Neopoints you have in your account, the higher the interest you get each day. Regularly collecting this interest is an intelligent way to passively increase your Neopoints balance. Step Six: Hitting the Withdrawal Limit The bank in Neopets has an imposed limit on the number of Neopoints that can be withdrawn in a day. It is wise to try and hit this limit regularly, as it aids in managing your Neopoints, ensuring a significant amount remains in your account to continue accruing interest. Step Seven: Getting a Safety Deposit Box Finally, investing in a Safety Deposit Box is an essential step. The Safety Deposit Box in Neopets serves as a secure place where you can keep your precious items and obtainables safe. While this requires an initial investment, the long-term benefits of protecting your valuables makes it a worthwhile option. Step Eight: Conclusion Managing Neopoints might seem daunting initially, but with smart strategies like saving, setting goals, collecting interest, hitting the withdrawal limit and getting a Safety Deposit Box, it becomes a seamless process. These strategies not only secure a wealthy future in the Neopets universe but also make the game more enjoyable in your quest for dominance in Neopia. Step Nine: Review The final step involves reviewing the content to ensure its accuracy, coherence, and effectiveness in delivering the required information based on the user's summary. To conclude, the article takes into account all the points provided in the summary: saving Neopoints, goal setting, collecting interest, hitting the withdrawal limits, and getting a Safety Deposit Box.

Available options: (i) unacceptable; (ii) acceptable;","completion":"(ii) acceptable. A linguist would most likely rate the given sentence as linguistically acceptable for a number of reasons. Here is a detailed analysis of the sentence structure, proper use of vocabularies, and overall coherence. 1. Sentence structure: The sentence follows a sound structure, showcasing a clear subject, verb, and object sequence for two separate clauses which are properly connected with the conjunction \\"while.\\" - In the first clause, \\"During the early evening\\" works as an adverbial phrase indicating the timeframe in which the action occurs. The subject is \\"Saturn,\\" followed by the verb \\"can be found\\" and the object \\"in the north.\\" - In the second clause, the conjunction \\"while\\" is used to show a simultaneous occurrence of the two events. \\"Jupiter\\" serves as the subject, followed by the verb \\"rises\\" and the object \\"in the east.\\" 2. Vocabulary usage: The choice of words in the sentence is precise and clear. Each term offers an exact meaning, allowing the reader to understand the sentence without confusion. - \\"During the early evening\\" is a specific time phrase that sets the context. - \\"Saturn\\" and \\"Jupiter\\" are proper nouns and refer to the respective planets. - \\"can be found\\" and \\"rises\\" are appropriate, diverse verbs used to describe the visibility and rising of the celestial bodies. - \\"north\\" and \\"east\\" are clearly articulated and well-known cardinal directions, designating the respective positions in the sky. 3. Coherence and clarity: The sentence effectively communicates what it intends to, providing a clear relationship between the two planets and their positions during early evening. It allows the reader to visualize the spatial arrangement of the planets in the sky. The use of \\"while\\" provides a smooth transition between the two clauses, illustrating that both events occur simultaneously. Considering these aspects, the sentence is linguistically acceptable. It adheres to grammar rules and syntax, has appropriate vocabulary choices, and conveys meaning effectively, making it comprehensible and accurate for the intended audience."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In any case, you should start with them, or with a more senior colleague or co-worker. They will have the experience to help you and give you the feedback you need. You should follow the norms in your office for emails. Humility goes a long way in asking for feedback, but don’t be so humble that your boss or manager thinks you know nothing about your job. Rather, frame the questions in ways that show your progress on a project or task. This will let the boss know you aren’t just sitting on your hands waiting for feedback. Also keep in mind the following tips. You can say, “I was working on the presentation for tomorrow when I ran into a snag with the format—I’m not sure if I’m following the company’s standard. I’ve attached the presentation. Do you have any suggestions for the format? Thank you for your help with this.” Don’t forget to thank them in the email. This can help you avoid overly broad feedback that is unlikely to help you at your job. Avoid yes or no questions, unless necessary. Instead focus on specific parts of a project that need work. Try not to bombard your boss or co-worker with all the possible questions you could have about your job all at once. You can say, for example, “I wasn’t sure how to proceed with the Eastman file. The client hasn’t responded to my emails, and since it is a high-priority assignment, I thought it best to email you to see what I should do.” If you are looking for more general feedback in the form of a review or report, request that specifically. Being polite, concise, and as specific as you can will help. For instance you could ask for a report on your efficiency or creativity. If you are asking for feedback from those who report to you, you may need to conduct an anonymous survey. If the feedback suggested you need a lot of improvement or that your work is not up to par, make sure to include a brief statement of how you’ll fix it. Give yourself time to process the emotions before immediately responding. Make sure you reply within 1-2 days at most.

Birmingham is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Alabama and the county seat of Jefferson County. The city's population was 212,237 in the 2010 United States Census. In the 2010 US Census, the Birmingham-Hoover Metropolitan Statistical Area had a population of about 1,128,047, which is approximately one-quarter of Alabama's population. Birmingham was founded in 1871, during the post-Civil War Reconstruction period, through the merger of three pre-existing farm towns, notably, former Elyton. It was named for Birmingham, England, the UK's second largest city and then major industrial city. The Alabama city annexed smaller neighbors and developed as an industrial and railroad transportation center, based on mining, the new iron and steel industry, and railroading. Most of the original settlers who founded Birmingham were of English ancestry. The city was developed as a place where cheap, non-unionized, and African-American labor from rural Alabama could be employed in the city's steel mills and blast furnaces, giving it a competitive advantage over unionized industrial cities in the Midwest and Northeast. From its founding through the end of the 1960s, Birmingham was a primary industrial center of the southern United States. Its growth from 1881 through 1920 earned its nicknames as \\"The Magic City\\" and \\"The Pittsburgh of the South\\". Its major industries were iron and steel production, plus a major component of the railroading industry. Rails and railroad cars were both manufactured in Birmingham. Since the 1860s, the two primary hubs of railroading in the Deep South have been nearby Atlanta and Birmingham. The economy diversified in the latter half of the 20th century. Banking, telecommunications, transportation, electrical power transmission, medical care, college education, and insurance have become major economic activities. Birmingham ranks as one of the largest banking centers in the United States and as one of the most important business centers in the Southeast. 1. What US state is Birmingham in? 2.

These ambitious works are some of the largest paintings in the history of Cubism. Léger’s The Wedding, also shown at the Salon des Indépendants in 1912, gave form to the notion of simultaneity by presenting different motifs as occurring within a single temporal frame, where responses to the past and present interpenetrate with collective force. The conjunction of such subject matter with simultaneity aligns Salon Cubism with early Futurist paintings by Umberto Boccioni, Gino Severini and Carlo Carrà; themselves made in response to early Cubism.

Article: People born in winter are more likely to suffer mental health disorders, according to a recent study carried out by researchers at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. Researchers raised baby mice from birth to weaning in either \\"summer\\" light cycles of 16 hours of light and 8 hours of dark or \\"winter\\" cycles of 8 hours of light and 16 hours of dark. A third group experienced 12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark a day. Then half the winter mice stayed in a winter cycle, while half switched to a summer schedule. The summer mice were similarly _ . The mice raised in equal periods of light and dark were split into three groups, one of which stayed on the 12hour schedule, one of which joined the winter group, and one of which joined the summer group. After 28 days, it turns out the summerborn mice behaved the same whether they stayed on the summer cycle or switched to winter. But among the winterborn mice, those stayed in winter kept their previous schedule, while those that switched to summer stayed active for an extra hour and a half, which indicates that mice born and weaned in a winter light cycle showed dramatic disruptions in their biological clocks. The finding is the first of its kind in mammals, and it could explain why people born in winter are at higher risk for mental health disorders including bipolar depression, schizophrenia and seasonal affective disorder. \\"We know that the biological clock regulates mood in humans,\\"said study researcher McMahon. \\"If the mechanism similar to the one that we found in mice operates in humans, then it could not only have an effect on a number of behavioral disorders, but also have a more general effect on personality.\\" Question: What's the main idea of the text?

Photo provided by FBI/Reuters Boston was in lockdown Friday as authorities searched for a suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing, 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The other suspect, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev—who was killed in a shootout with police overnight—was Dzhokhar’s older brother. Have there been other cases of brothers working together to commit terrorist attacks? Forrest Wickman Forrest Wickman is Slate’s culture editor overseeing music and movies coverage. Yes. According to the 9/11 Commission report, six of the 19 hijackers who took part in the Sept. 11 attacks were brothers. Each of the sibling teams worked together. Brothers Hamza and Ahmed al-Ghamdi were among the hijackers on United Flight 175, sitting together in seats 9C and 9D. American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked by brothers Waleed and Wail al-Shehri, who sat together in first class. On American Airlines Flight 77, brothers Nawaf al Hazmi and Salem al Hazmi also sat together before that plane crashed into the Pentagon. Many other attacks, both at home and abroad, have been planned by teams of brothers. In the 2007 plot on Fort Dix, three of the conspirators—Shain Duka, Dritan Duka, and Eljvir Duka—were brothers. A fourth man, Agron Abdullahu, who was sentenced for weapons charges related to the plot, was Eljvir Duka’s brother-in-law. A few months ago, two South Florida brothers, 30-year-old Sheheryar Alam Qazi and 20-year-old Raees Alam Qazi, were charged with plotting to use a weapon of mass destruction within the United States. Counterterrorism experts suggest that many terrorist groups feature an “older brother figure” who converts others and leads the planning. This is not always literally an older brother, though often it has been. In the case of the 2002 Bali bombings, which left 202 dead, three of the perpetrators were brothers: Ali Imron, Amrozi Nurhasyim, and Ali Ghufron. The oldest brother, Ali Ghufron, recruited his younger brothers and was executed for being the chief organizer of the attack. Two members of the so-called Portland Seven, who were convicted for trying to enter Afghanistan and fight for the Taliban after Sept. 11, were brothers. They both pleaded guilty in 2003, though the younger brother’s lawyer argued that he was just following his older brother’s lead. The lawyer for Shujah Mahmood, the youngest defendant accused in a 2004 bombing plot in Britain, similarly argued that his client was only “used as a gofer” and was “completely overshadowed” by his older brother, Omar Khyam. Mahmood was just 16 when the plot began, and he was eventually cleared of charges. Advertisement Counterterrorism experts suggest that the more significant point isn’t that terrorists often conspire with their brothers, but rather that they tend, in most cases, to band together with a small group of their peers, whether they’re siblings or friends or neighbors. Clustering tightly together, the men begin to talk one another into more and more extremist action, with the group dynamic being crucial to their radicalization. This is true not only of politically motivated violence: In cases such as the mass murder at Columbine, the shooters fell into a similar dynamic, coming together in a closed circle in which they invented their own world. The lone wolf terrorist, on the other hand, is relatively rare. Got a question about today’s news? Ask the Explainer.

From genetics to life at home, there appear to be a number of factors that predispose some brothers to violent behavior. So it may not be a coincidence that two brothers are suspected of participating in yesterday's terrorist attacks in Belgium. Federal prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw announced that Ibrahim El Bakraoui is suspected as being one of the Brussels Airport suicide bombers. His brother Khalid El Bakraoui is suspected of inflicting the deadly suicide bombing an hour later at the Maelbeek metro station. Other sets of brothers have previously been identified as terrorists. Just a few examples include Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his slain brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, for the Boston Marathon bombing, and brothers Saïd Kouachi and Cherif Kouachi for the killing of 12 people at the offices of the Charlie Hebdo newspaper in Paris. Play Video Murder is Infectious Murder might just work in the same way than an infectious disease does. Find out how. AFP/Getty Images \\"There are numerous factors\\" that contribute to terror-related murders, \\"including neurobiological, personality, social and cultural,\\" neuropsychologist Robert Hanlon of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine told Discovery News. He added, \\"One brother is usually a stronger character and the leader of the two. The other brother is a follower and is influenced by the leader-brother. The follower wants to please the leader and obtain the respect of the leader.\\" Hanlon added that such siblings tend to be male, with men committing 90 percent of murders annually in the United States alone. \\"Due to biological, psychological and socio-developmental differences between the genders, men are far more violent than women,\\" he said. In addition to terrorist duos, there are also a number of serial killers who are brothers, such as Pete and Pat Bondurant, Larry and Danny Ranes and Reginald and Jonathan Carr, just to name a few. Terrorism is a subtype of violence that, as Hanlon indicates, can have multiple driving influences.

Why? Partly this is to indicate solidarity, attachment to a common cause, a sense of shared identity and endeavour. Partly it’s because that’s how young men speak, all over the world, but particularly in the kind of environments from which many contemporary militants come. But it is also because, remarkably often, the term is entirely accurate. Those speaking of being “brothers” are indeed blood relatives, children of the same parents, who often grew up together. The Paris attackers are reported to have included Ibrahim Abdeslam – a suicide bomber who blew himself up outside the Comptoir Voltaire restaurant – and Salah Abdeslam, who is on the run. A third brother, Mohammed, was arrested in Brussels on Monday and spent several hours in custody before being released without charge. Speaking after his release, he denied any link to his brothers’ actions: “I was accused of committing an act of terrorism … but I have not in the slightest way been connected to the operation in Paris. “My parents are completely shocked by the tragedy. My two brothers are normal and I have never noticed anything strange.” Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the suspected mastermind of the attacks, recruited his own 13-year-old brother, who travelled to Syria and then was seen in a video in a pickup truck dragging bodies of Syrian army soldiers. And this is all within one – albeit complex – plot. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the Boston bombers. Photograph: AP There are many other examples, in different countries, on different continents: the two Kouachis who attacked the Charlie Hebdo offices in January. The Tsarnaev brothers, who bombed the 2013 Boston Marathon. The brother of Mohammed Merah, who killed seven in south-west France in 2012, remains jailed, although his role in the murders and the radicalisation of the perpetrator is not entirely clear. Fraternal ties are also common among those who travel to Syria, Iraq or other war zones, even if they do not turn to terrorism at home. Few travel alone: almost all make the journey with close friends or family members. Three brothers aged 17 to 21, from Brighton, left the UK to join al-Nusra Front, an al-Qaida affiliate, in Syria. There was Aseel Muthana, a 17-year-old schoolboy who travelled with his elder brother, a medical student, to join Isis. In October, a British court found that two brothers of Iftekhar Jaman, who spoke of “five-star jihad” on the BBC, had spent two years giving help and advice to people seeking to travel to Syria to establish an Islamic state. Both were convicted of terrorist offences. Cherif Kouachi and his brother Said, who attacked at the satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo. Photograph: French police/EPA This vision of “jihad by family” may be shocking, but it should not be surprising. Ten years ago, US military intelligence officials in Iraqi identified having a close family member already involved as the greatest predictor of an individual becoming involved in violent militancy, Islamic or otherwise. This may be a brother, or it may be a father. Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, a British aspiring rapper turned Isis recruit, is the son of Adel Abdel Bary, an Egyptian militant who came to the UK in 1991 and was later convicted in New York for his role in al–Qaida’s attack on US embassies in east Africa in 1998. In the UK more recently, along with siblings, parents of jihadis have been detained and some charged with Syria-related offences. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Aseel Muthana and older brother Nasser, who travelled from Britain to join Isis in Syria. Photograph: Social media Research by New America, a nonpartisan thinktank in the United States, showed that more than a quarter of western fighters have a familial connection to jihad, whether through relatives who are also fighting in Syria and Iraq, through marriage or through some link to other jihads or terrorist attacks. The research also found that of those western fighters with familial ties to jihad, three-fifths had a relative who has also left for Syria. Another recent study, at Pennsylvania State University, examined the interactions of 120 supposed “lone wolf” terrorists from all ideological and faith backgrounds, and found that, even though they launched their attacks alone, in a large majority of the cases others were aware of the individual’s commitment to a specific extremist ideology. In an astonishing 64% of cases, family and friends were aware of the individual’s intent to engage in a terrorism-related activity because the offender verbally told them. All this offers an important window into the nature of recruitment and radicalisation. Both are often understood to be processes which involve someone who is previously “normal” being “brainwashed” by some outside influence that turns them into someone who behaves abnormally. An alternative explanation for how people are drawn into militancy blames propaganda, via the internet. The facts, however, contradict this. Terrorism, like any activism, is highly social, only its consequences are exceptional. People become interested in ideas, ideologies and activities, even appallingly destructive ones, because other people are interested in them. “Recruitment is basically by peers. It is kinship and friendship which really matter, much more than religion or locality or whatever else. There is a strong group phenomenon,” said Dr Rik Coolsaet, a Belgian expert who has studied local militant networks in the country. The psychological and social barriers to involvement in violence are certainly higher than in other less nefarious activities, but the mechanics of the process that draws people into them are the same. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"There have been other cases of brothers working together to commit terrorist attacks.

Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own. International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions. Sometimes the status of great powers is formally recognized in conferences such as the Congress of Vienna or an international structure such as the United Nations Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States serve as the body's five permanent members). At the same time the status of great powers can be informally recognized in a forum such as the G7 which consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. What 3 factors have international relations theorists considered factors for great power status?","completion":"International relations theorists have considered three main factors to determine a nation's great power status: power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions. 1. Power capabilities: This factor involves assessing a country's economic and military strength, as these are integral in projecting influence and deciding global affairs. Economic aspects include GDP, industrial capacity, technological advancement, and a strong, diverse economy. Military strength is determined by the size and quality of armed forces, nuclear capabilities, and the ability to project force globally. Countries with substantial power capabilities can mold international policies and assert dominance in global decision-making processes. 2. Spatial aspects: The spatial dimension of a great power refers to its geographical reach, its ability to use that reach to influence other nations, and its strategic positioning. A country with global or regional influence that can shape political, economic, and social landscapes in various territories is considered a great power. Strategic positioning, including maintaining beneficial alliances and relationships, also plays a crucial role in sustaining a country's status. 3. Status dimensions: This factor accounts for a country's diplomatic influence, sometimes referred to as \\"soft power.\\" Great powers have a high degree of recognition and respect from other nations. Reputation, historical contributions to global affairs, cultural influence, and the promotion of ideologies play a significant role in determining status dimensions. A country that can effectively use diplomacy and soft power to achieve its foreign policy goals, and which can shape global norms and institutions, is considered a great power. In summary, international relations theorists consider power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions as the three critical factors for determining a nation's great power status. These factors dictate a country's ability to influence and shape global affairs in various capacities, leveraging its military, economic, and diplomatic strengths."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The tail section, marked with part of the airline's logo, was detected by sonar early Wednesday, said Bambang Soelistyo, the head of Indonesia's search and rescue agency. Divers were sent to the location and plunged into the waves. Down on the sea floor, they were able to take pictures of the wreckage. Finding the tail section is a potentially vital step in the investigation because that is where the flight data and voice recorders -- the so-called black boxes -- are located in the Airbus A320-200, the aircraft model of Flight QZ8501. The vast majority of the people on the plane were","completion":"from Indonesia. The flight, carrying 162 people, including many families, lost contact with air traffic control on its way from Surabaya, Indonesia to Singapore during a storm on December 28, 2014. There were laughter and tears as relatives of the missing waited anxiously for news. The hopes of quickly finding the rest of the aircraft, which would indicate whether an explosion occurred, faded though as poor weather conditions hampered search and rescue operations. The region has been hit with heavy monsoon rains, causing high waves and strong undercurrents which have only complicated the ongoing sea and air search missions. Internationally, news of the discovery spread quickly, and families around the world reacted with a mixture of relief that the wreckage had been found, and grief over the tragic loss of life. Indonesian President Joko Widodo thanked the multinational search teams for their relentless efforts and offered his deepest condolences to the families of the passengers and crew. The cause of crash still remains a mystery as investigators await the recovery of the black boxes, which could hold important data about the aircraft’s final minutes. While it is too early to determine the exact cause of the crash, extreme weather conditions have been flagged as a possible factor. The pilot’s last communication was a request to change course due to stormy weather. The tail's discovery will pave the way for divers and an underwater drone to zero in on the wreckage and start the grim task of searching for the bodies that have not yet been recovered. Additionally, once the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder - commonly known as black boxes - are recovered, investigators will be able to start piecing together the sequence of events that caused the Airbus A320-200 to plunge into the sea. In the meantime, families of the victims gather in Surabaya, awaiting news from the recovery effort. The Indonesian government has pledged to do everything possible to support them during this incredibly difficult time and to provide full transparency in the ongoing investigation into the crash of Flight QZ8501. Meanwhile, the world awaits, hoping for answers from the depths of the Java Sea."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Passage: In 1752, a new dynasty called Konbaung rose to challenge Restored Hanthawaddy, and went on to reunite much of the kingdom by 1758. In 1758-59, King Alaungpaya, the founder of the dynasty, sent an expedition to the farther Shan States , which had been annexed by the Qing over two decades earlier, to reestablish Burmese authority. . Three of the ten farther Shan state sawbwas and their militias reportedly ran away into Yunnan and tried to persuade Qing officials to invade Burma. The nephew of Kengtung sawbwa and his followers also fled. The Yunnan government reported the news to the Emperor in 1759, and the Qing court promptly issued an imperial edict ordering reconquest. At first, the Yunnan officials, who believed that \\"barbarians must be conquered using barbarians\\", tried to resolve the matter by supporting the defected sawbwas. But the strategy did not work. In 1764, a Burmese army, which was on its way to Siam, was increasing its grip of the borderlands, and the sawbwas complained to China. In response, the Emperor appointed Liu Zao, a respected scholarly minister from the capital to sort out the matters. At Kunming, Liu assessed that the use of Tai-Shan militias alone was not working, and that he needed to commit regular Green Standard Army troops. A:","completion":"1.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Jacqueline Fernandez (born 11 August 1985) is a Sri Lankan actress, former model, and the winner of the Miss Sri Lanka Universe pageant of 2006. Born into a multiracial family of Canadian, Sri Lankan and Malaysian descent, Fernandez was raised in Bahrain. After graduating in mass communication from the University of Sydney and working as a television reporter in Sri Lanka, she joined the modeling industry. She was crowned the Miss Sri Lanka Universe 2006, and represented her country at Miss Universe 2006. Fernandez shares a close bond with her family, and admits that she misses being around them. She says: \\"I miss them so much everyday. You don't realise when you live away from home how difficult life can be [...] At the same time, staying away from them has taught me to be more responsible. It has taught me so many things about myself, about priorities and time management.\\" In March 2012, Fernandez turned vegetarian for a 40-day period to observe Lent, a period from Ash Wednesday to Holy Saturday. In 2008, Fernandez started dating Bahraini prince Hassan bin Rashid Al Khalifa, whom she met at a mutual friend's party; they separated in 2011. While filming Housefull 2 in 2011, Fernandez began a romantic relationship with director Sajid Khan. The relationship attracted media coverage in India and there was speculation of an impending wedding. However, the relationship ended in May 2013. In addition to acting in films, Fernandez has supported charitable organisations and a number of causes. In 2011, on the behalf of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), she sent a letter to the Mumbai Municipal Commissioner asking for an end to horse-drawn carriage rides in Mumbai. In early 2013, she asked the consulate general of the Philippines, William John T Perera in Colombo, to hasten the transfer of an elephant from its inadequate housing at the Manila Zoo to a humane sanctuary. Later that year, she auctioned a breakfast in Mayfair, London, where she raised around PS4000 for the Pratham NGO, which helps children's primary education. In 2014, Fernandez was named \\"Woman Of The Year\\" by PETA (India) for advocating the protection of animals. The following year, she auctioned her outfits on an online portal for a philanthropic cause. Some of her outfits included the ones she wore in the song \\"Party On My Mind\\" (from Race 2) and \\"Hangover\\" (from Kick). In March 2016, she was part of \\"Jacqueline Builds\\" campaign that raised funds for the victims of the 2015 South Indian floods. In April 2017, Jacqueline Fernandez collaborated with Rakyan Beverages by investing in their juice products. Fernandez has participated in several concert tours and televised award ceremonies. In 2013, she performed at the Temptations Reloaded in Auckland, Perth, and Sydney alongside Shah Rukh Khan, Rani Mukerji, and Madhuri Dixit. She also performed at the live talent show \\"Got Talent World Stage Live\\" with Khan, Priyanka Chopra and Varun Dhawan the following year. In July 2014, Fernandez opened a restaurant in Colombo, Kaema Sutra, in collaboration with chef Dharshan Munidasa, which specialises in contemporary Sri Lankan cuisine. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What other types of work did she do besides acting?","completion":"Besides acting, Jacqueline Fernandez has done other types of work like modeling, working as a television reporter, supporting charitable organizations, and raising money for causes.

The Englishman, who finished third in 2014, was less than a bike length away from being Team Sky's first-ever Spring Classics winner. Fellow Britons Geraint Thomas and Mark Cavendish finished down the field. An overnight rockfall 130km into the course at Arenzano forced organisers to briefly divert the race. The diversion on to the A10 bypass increased the race - already the longest of the Spring Classics - from 291km to 300km. The race was dogged by a number of crashes involving high-profile riders, including Team Sky's Thomas, who was among the favourites after victory in the week-long Paris-Nice stage race earlier this month. The Welshman was near the front of the peloton in the foothills of the Cipressa climb with 30km to the finish when a compression caused several riders to crash, including Thomas and team-mate Peter Kennaugh. Both riders picked themselves up but struggled to get back into contention, while the 2009 winner, Manxman Cavendish, saw his challenge fall away on the Cipressa's punishing ascent. Former British road champion Ian Stannard of Team Sky and Movistar's Giovanni Visconti took advantage of further crashes on the narrow coastal roads to open up a 20-second gap on the descent, but were then reeled back on the gruelling Poggio di Sanremo. Poland's former world road champion Michal Kwiatkowski made an early bid for victory going over the Poggio's summit, but the Team Sky rider was caught with a kilometre to go by a group including favourites Vincenzo Nibali (Astana) and Peter Sagan (Tinkoff-Saxo). Isle of Man-based Swift looked like he had made a decisive break for the line, but it was unfancied Demare (FDJ) who stepped out of his tracks to round the 28-year-old and Belgium's Jurgen Roelandts (Lotto-Soudal) to become the first Frenchman since Laurent Jalabert in 1995 to win La Classicissima.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Sorry, no Chinese researchers allowed! Oh wait, seems like that was a misunderstanding. Please do come. NASA's management apparently misinterpreted a security law when it barred Chinese researchers from attending the space agency's Kepler Science Conference in November, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported Sunday. Xinhua said NASA sent a letter to Chinese scientists inviting them back and cited excerpts from the letter. NASA did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Sunday morning. The confusion apparently stemmed from a U.S. law passed in 2011 that prevents NASA funds from being used to collaborate with China or to host Chinese visitors at its facilities. NASA had announced that Chinese nationals would not be allowed to attend the conference for NASA's Kepler space telescope program at the Ames Research Center due to national security. The space telescope has been searching for planets outside of our solar system. Earlier this month, China slammed NASA for its decision to ban Chinese scholars from the conference, calling it \\"discriminatory.\\" Gong Li, an official with the Party School of the China Central Committee's Communist party, said the ban was similar to previous U.S. action against the former Soviet Union during the Cold War. He said it also illustrated U.S. fear of China's fast development. NASA didn't release an official statement on its website due to the U.S. government's partial shutdown earlier this month. But some U.S. scientists joined in decrying the decision and called for a boycott of the conference. \\"In good conscience, I cannot attend a meeting that discriminates in this way. The meeting is about planets located trillions of miles away, with no national security implications,\\" Geoff Marcy, an astronomy professor at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote in an e-mail to the organizers. 'Inaccuracies' U.S. Republican Rep. Frank Wolf, who drafted the 2011 law, issued a statement on his website that sought to correct \\"inaccuracies\\" about the restrictions first reported by Britain's Guardian newspaper. \\"I was concerned to read an October 4 article in The Guardian that reported on poor guidance about these policies with regard to restrictions on Chinese nationals attending a conference next month at NASA Ames Research Center. Unfortunately, the article is riddled with inaccuracies, as is, it appears, the guidance provided by NASA Ames staff to the attendees,\\" Wolf wrote. \\"As you know, the congressional provision -- which has been in place since early 2011 -- primarily restricts bilateral, not multilateral, meetings and activities with the Communist Chinese government or Chinese-owned companies. It places no restrictions on activities involving individual Chinese nationals unless those nationals are acting as official representatives of the Chinese government.\\" Security fears. Wolf said NASA officials may have believed the decision was needed because of extra temporary restrictions on foreign nationals after a potential security breach by a Chinese citizen at a NASA facility earlier this year. In March this year, a Chinese aerospace contractor who worked for NASA was arrested at Washington's Dulles International Airport as he boarded a flight to Beijing. Bo Jiang, who worked at NASA's Langley's Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, was charged with making false statements to U.S. authorities by failing to disclose all of the electronic devices he was carrying on his one-way flight. Wolf, who oversees congressional funding of several agencies, told reporters in March he believed Jiang was spying and had access to highly sensitive documents, including source codes for high-tech imaging used in missiles, unmanned aerospace equipment and other technology desired by the Chinese government. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"This article talks about how NASA accidentally said that Chinese researchers couldn't come to a special meeting about space stuff. But, they made a mistake because they thought there was a rule that said they couldn't have Chinese guests, but that was wrong. So, NASA sent a letter to the Chinese scientists saying they could come to the meeting after all. Some people were upset when they thought the Chinese scientists couldn't come and they didn't think it was fair. After realizing the mistake, everything was fixed and the meeting could go on with everyone who should be there."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Given the following context: Two songwriters, Frank P. Fogerty and Nathan Crow, sued Eon, MGM, Universal Music and Universal Studios for copyright infringement over \\"The World Is Not Enough\\", alleging that it derived from their song \\"This Game We Play\\", which was submitted to MGM executives in February 1999 for consideration for the soundtrack of The Thomas Crown Affair. Their claim centered on a four-note sequence in \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" which they alleged was identical to part of \\"This Game We Play\\". When the songwriters were gathering evidence, one posed as an employee of composer James Horner to contact Don Black and solicit his services for Ocean's Eleven. They recorded their conversation with Black, trying to get him to disclose when he and Arnold composed \\"The World Is Not Enough\\", and contacted Shirley Manson in a similar manner.The case was argued in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee in June 2004. The court rejected the plaintiffs' claim, concluding that Arnold independently composed \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" and it did not share a passage with \\"This Game We Play\\". The plaintiffs conceded that Arnold did not have access to \\"This Game We Play\\" after journal entries, delivery invoices, telephone and computer records, written declarations from Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli and testimony from David Arnold, Don Black, Shirley Manson and Arnold's personal assistant provided \\"irrefutable evidence\\" that \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" had already been written and was not changed significantly—other than a lyrical alteration (the removal of one line to accommodate Shirley Manson) and an amendment to the score (the removal of the \\"three-note motif\\" to accommodate the MGM executives)—from the date that \\"This Game We Play\\" was submitted to MGM. answer the following question: What were the full names of the two people who were contacted in a similar manner by one of the songwriters posing as an employee of James Horner?

Given the below context: In medieval Nubia, pottery and its decoration were appreciated as an art form. Until the 7th century, the most common pottery type found at Soba was the so-called \\"Red Ware\\". These wheel-made hemispherical bowls were made of red or orange slip and painted with separated motifs such as boxes with inner cross-hatchings, stylized floral motifs or crosses. The outlines of the motifs were drawn in black while the interiors were white. In their design, they are a direct continuation of Kushite styles, with possible influences from Aksumite Ethiopia. Due to their relative rarity, it has been suggested that they were imported, although they bear similarities to the pottery type, known as \\"Soba Ware\\", that succeeded them.\\"Soba Ware\\" was a type of wheel-made pottery with a distinctive decoration very different from that found in the rest of Nubia. The shape of the pottery was diverse, as was the repertoire of painted decoration. One of the most distinctive features was the use of faces as painted decoration. They were simplified, if not geometric, in form and with big round eyes. This style is foreign to Makuria and Egypt, but bears a resemblance to paintings and manuscripts from Ethiopia. It is possible the potters copied these motifs from local church murals. Also unique was the application of animal-shaped bosses (protomes). Glazed vessels were also produced, copying Persian aquamaniles without reaching their quality. Beginning in the 9th century, \\"Soba Ware\\" was increasingly replaced by fine ware imported from Makuria. Guess a valid title for it!

Some made their way to the Twin Towers, the signature structures of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Others went to Arlington, Virginia, to the Pentagon. Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run. For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine. Boston: American 11 and United 175. Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft. This did not hinder Atta's plans. Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45. Seven minutes later, Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi, a longtime colleague who was at another terminal at Logan Airport. They spoke for three minutes.

For weeks prior to the event I kept experiencing ‘visual disturbances.’ I felt when I was reading a newspaper or book a sense that my eyes were crossing. I’d feel aware right before it would occur and I would rush to look in a mirror only to discover my eyes were not crossing. I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me. Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside. I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower. While in the shower it occurred to him something might not be right. He came back to the table where I was struggling to lift myself from the chair. I put my hands on the table to lift my body and my left hand kept sliding off the edge. He finally got behind me and tried to lift me under my arms and I crumbled to the floor. He then called my OB and told him he thought I’d had a stroke. My OB immediately expressed his doubt but my husband was advised to call an ambulance to get me to the ER.

I get to the cinema every week or so, and regularly check out this site, but never before have I felt compelled to comment on a film. To my all time list of shockingly bad films - Last Man Standing, Spawn, The Bone Collector - I can now add the drivel that was 'Hollow Man'. From the awful opening titles - a ridiculously over-long run through of cast and crew put together with alphabetti spaghetti - through to the insulting finale - a world record number of cliches and some of the most absurd dialogue and acting to have ever made it to cinema - this film is dismal, and only the impressive computer graphics keep you from walking out long before the end. This isn't just my opinion - it was that of my friends, and everyone around us. When large sections of an audience are laughing and groaning during and after a serious thriller, its clear that the film is hopeless. Not only that, it was sick too. The director took the action beyond the bounds of realistic fare for a violent film, and into the realms of an over the top blood soaked B-movie. It's difficult not to imagine the director as some sort of dirty old man, because the extent of the invisible man's forays out of the lab and into the outside world extended only to two attempts at having a feel of some breasts. Perhaps sex could well be the first thing on a bloke's mind if made invisible, but aside from the aesthetic pleasures of the ladies involved, it hardly makes entertaining cinema. [spoilers follow] Get past the films sick exterior, and things are even worse. Whilst Kevin Bacon does a good job of acting increasingly twisted as 'hollow man', the rest of them - perhaps handicapped by a dire script - do an even better job of being hollow cast. One long time member of the team is found strangled in a locker by the invisible man, \\"He's finally snapped\\" shrugs one colleague without a hint of emotion. This is par for the course, and the lab team swing between sheer terror and complete indifference with such speed that you wonder how they got into acting. They pad their way through the lab corridors terrified, guns poised, but then seconds later one of the crew skips happily off back down the corridor to get blood for a hurt colleague. The lead female treats the invisible man with courtesy and good humour even after he's insulted and abused her, and there seems to be little reaction to his breakouts, even after he drowns the Pentagon chief, \\"He drowned in his pool last night\\" reports the same female, spectacularly failing to put two and two together. The script is littered with this kind of badly acted pedestrian dialogue, and the rest is just an A-Z of film cliches, which get laid on thicker and faster as the film progresses to the point of complete disbelief and amusement at the end. The 'eureka' moment at the computer, the female undressing at the window, the looped security video - the list really is endless - the predictable disregard for strength in numbers, the decision not to kill the two main stars but just put them in a place of probable impending death and leave them to their own devices, the almost-dead good guy appearing out of nothing to save the woman, the bomb and ubiquitous countdown timer, the fireball explosion which just burns up before reaching the heroes, the falling lift which just stops before hitting them, and more than anything else, the immortality of the bad guy. The invisible man is burnt to a shred with a makeshift flame-thrower, electrocuted, whacked round the head with a bar which had just sliced straight through one of the lesser actors, and then having apparently survived the explosion, fireball and total destruction of the labs, has more than enough life left to climb up through the fireball for one last pop at the films heroes - by which stage the disbelieving audience are cringing and looking at their watches. That this exceptionally bad film actually made it to the cinema is astounding. Even the name of the film is as hopeless as the movie itself, and not even impressive special effects come anywhere near saving this one, which should be avoided at all costs.

This is a fill-in-the-blank type problem where the <MASK> in the statement has to be replaced by a suitable word from the options. Since the options consist of years (2010, 1796, 2015, 2007 in Kannada script), and the statement seems to make a historical reference (Lindau Laureate Royal society's Royal Medal achievement), it can be inferred that the <MASK> is likely to stand for a year. To solve this, you need to understand the context of the sentence accurately. The sentence seems to make a reference to a significant event. To choose the right option, you need to know or find out in which among these years (2010, 1796, 2015, 2007) the referenced event occurred. This task requires knowledge on the specific historical event and might require you to research. It is not just a language comprehension task but also a fact-based question which cannot be solved only by linguistic knowledge. You'd have to use your analytical skills and infer which year fits the context of the sentence best. After you have chosen the year, you will output that word as the answer. If you lack the historical knowledge, you may not be able to solve this problem accurately as the language skills alone are not sufficient in this case."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve 254*l - 4538 - 5722 = 26*l for l.","completion":"Alright, little buddy, let's solve this math problem together! We have: 254 * l - 4538 - 5722 = 26 * l First, we want to simplify this equation by combining the two numbers we subtract: -4538 - 5722 = -10260 Now, our equation looks like this: 254 * l - 10260 = 26 * l Next, we want to make the l's (letter 'l') be together on one side of the equation. To do that, we'll move the 26 * l from the right side to the left side. And we do this by subtracting 26 * l from both sides: 254 * l - 26 * l - 10260 = 0 Now, we have: 228 * l - 10260 = 0 We want to get l by itself. So, we'll take the next step to add 10260 to both sides of the equation to remove it from the l side: 228 * l = 10260 Now we have: 228 * l = 10260 To find the value of 'l', we'll divide both sides by 228: l = 10260 ÷ 228 Now, if you divide 10260 by 228, you'll get: l = 45 And that's it! The value of 'l' in our equation is 45. Good job, little buddy!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Answer the following question given this paragraph: The movement of water molecules is not itself regulated by cells, so it is important that cells are exposed to an environment in which the concentration of solutes outside of the cells (in the extracellular fluid) is equal to the concentration of solutes inside the cells (in the cytoplasm). Two solutions that have the same concentration of solutes are said to be isotonic (equal tension). When cells and their extracellular environments are isotonic, the concentration of water molecules is the same outside and inside the cells, and the cells maintain their normal shape (and function). Osmosis occurs when there is an imbalance of solutes outside of a cell versus inside the cell. A solution that has a higher concentration of solutes than another solution is said to be hypertonic, and water molecules tend to diffuse into a hypertonic solution (Figure 3.8). Cells in a hypertonic solution will shrivel as water leaves the cell via osmosis. In contrast, a solution that has a lower concentration of solutes than another solution is said to be hypotonic, and water molecules tend to diffuse out of a hypotonic solution. Cells in a hypotonic solution will take on too much water and swell, with the risk of eventually bursting. A critical aspect of homeostasis in living things is to create an internal environment in which all of the body’s cells are in an isotonic solution. Various organ systems, particularly the kidneys, work to maintain this homeostasis. Q: What happens to cells in a hypertonic solution as water leaves the cell via osmosis?

I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying. He instructed my mother \\"To get me the Hell out of his office.\\" Needless to say my mother never took any of us to see this old, miserable bastard again.

Born Marilyn Ann Briggs in Providence, Rhode Island, Chambers was raised in Westport, Connecticut, in a middle-class household. It is often reported that she was born in Westport; however, in a 2007 interview Chambers confirmed she was born in Providence but grew up in Westport. Her father was in advertising and her mother was a nurse. She was the youngest of three children, including a brother, Martin Briggs (keyboardist for 1960s Boston band The Remains), and a sister, Jann Smith. Chambers dreamed of having a career in mainstream films and believed her celebrity as the star of Behind the Green Door and the Ivory Snow girl would be a stepping stone to other endeavors. \\"The paradox was that, as a result of Green Door, Hollywood blackballed me,\\" she said later. \\"[Green Door] became a very high-grossing film...But, to a lot of people, it was still a dirty movie; for me to do anything else, as an actress, was totally out of the question. I became known as a porno star, and that type of labeling really hurt me. It hurt my chances of doing anything else\\". Throughout the 1970s she was up for roles in several Hollywood films. Her biggest opportunity came in 1976 when it was announced in Variety that she was to star alongside Rip Torn in City Blues, a film about a young hooker defended by a seedy lawyer. The film was to be directed by Nicholas Ray. Ray had never seen Behind the Green Door or even screen-tested Chambers. Instead the two met and Ray was impressed. \\"I have a camera in my head,\\" he said, adding that Chambers would \\"eventually be able to handle anything that the young Katie Hepburn or Bette Davis could.\\" However, the project never came to fruition, in large part due to Ray's alcohol and drug abuse. Chambers claimed that Jack Nicholson and Art Garfunkel brought her in to talk about a role in the 1978 film Goin' South, then asked her for cocaine and grilled her about whether her orgasms in Behind the Green Door were real; she was angered to the point where she stormed out of the interview. She was going to be cast in the film Hardcore, opposite George C. Scott, but the casting director took one look at her and said she was too wholesome to be cast as a porn queen. \\"The Hardcore people wanted a woman with orange hair who chews gum, swings a big purse, and wears stiletto heels.

These could play for more than three and four minutes respectively, while contemporary cylinders could only play for about two minutes. In an attempt to head off the disc advantage, Edison introduced the Amberol cylinder in 1909, with a maximum playing time of 4½ minutes (at 160 rpm), which in turn were superseded by Blue Amberol Records, which had a playing surface made of celluloid, a plastic, which was far less fragile. Despite these improvements, during the 1910s discs decisively won this early format war, although Edison continued to produce new Blue Amberol cylinders for an ever-dwindling customer base until late in 1929. By 1919 the basic patents for the manufacture of lateral-cut disc records had expired, opening the field for countless companies to produce them. Analog disc records would dominate the home entertainment market until they were outsold by the digital compact disc in the late 1980s (which was in turn supplanted by digital audio recordings distributed via online music stores and Internet file sharing).\\" Answer: The answer is:","completion":"CDs took over the analog disc records in the late 1980s when they started outselling them.

Here is the answer: One of the primary reasons companies irradiate some fruits and vegetables before selling them to the public is to increase their shelf life and ensure food safety. Irradiation is a process in which foods are exposed to a controlled amount of ionizing radiation, such as gamma rays, x-rays, or electron beams. This treatment can effectively kill or inactivate microorganisms, such as bacteria, yeasts, molds, and insects, that could cause spoilage or foodborne illnesses. By reducing the number of these microorganisms on fruits and vegetables, companies can extend the products' shelf life. This helps them avoid food waste, reduce economic losses, and ensure a continuous supply of fresh produce to the market. Additionally, it can also lower the risk of consumers contracting foodborne illnesses from harmful pathogens like E. coli or Salmonella. In summary, irradiating fruits and vegetables helps improve their safety, quality, and longevity, benefiting both companies and consumers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Years later, adult Laura (Rueda) returns to the closed orphanage, accompanied by her husband, Carlos (Cayo), and their seven-year-old adopted son, SimÃ³n (PrÃ­ncep). She plans to reopen the orphanage as a facility for disabled children. SimÃ³n claims to see a boy named TomÃ¡s (Ãscar Casas). He befriends TomÃ¡s and draws pictures of him as a child wearing a sack mask. Social worker Benigna Escobedo (Montserrat Carulla) informs Laura that SimÃ³n's adoption file indicates that SimÃ³n is HIV positive. Incensed at Benigna's intrusion, Laura asks her to leave. She later finds Benigna in the orphanage's coal shed, but Benigna flees the scene. Later, SimÃ³n teaches Laura a game which grants its winner a wish. Clues lead the two to SimÃ³n's adoption file. SimÃ³n becomes angry, and says that his new friend told him that Laura is not his biological mother and that he is going to die soon. During a party at the orphanage, Laura and SimÃ³n argue, and SimÃ³n hides from her. While looking for him, she encounters a child wearing a sack mask who shoves her into a bathroom and locks her inside. Escaping, she finds that SimÃ³n is missing and she is unable to find him. That night Laura hears several loud crashes. Police psychologist Pilar (Mabel Rivera) suggests to Laura and Carlos that Benigna may have abducted SimÃ³n. Six months later, SimÃ³n is still missing. Searching in a Spanish city, Laura spots Benigna who is then struck and killed by a car. The police find evidence that Benigna once worked at the orphanage, and that she had a son named TomÃ¡s who was interned there. The children stole a mask that TomÃ¡s wore to conceal his deformed face. Embarrassed, TomÃ¡s hid in a local sea cave and was subsequently drowned. His death occurred weeks after Laura was adopted. Laura asks for the assistance of a medium named Aurora (Geraldine Chaplin) in the search for SimÃ³n. Aurora conducts a seance during which she claims to see the ghosts of the orphans crying for...

As the wreckage is inspected, Master Sergeant Sam Harper, one of the burnt bodies within, springs to life and kills a sergeant and a major, and returns to an inert state after muttering, \\"Don't be afraid, it's only friendly fire!\\" Weeks later, Sam's body is delivered to his hometown of Twin Rivers, which is preparing for Independence Day. Sam's wife Louise is given custody of the casket containing Sam's remains, which are left in the home of Sam's estranged sister Sally, who lives with her patriotic young son, Jody. Sam reanimates in the early hours of the Fourth of July, and proceeds to kill and steal the costume of a perverted Uncle Sam. Sam then makes his way to a cemetery, where he murders two of three juvenile delinquents who had vandalized tombstones, and desecrated an American flag. During the Independence Day celebration (which a corrupt congressman is visiting) Sam beheads the third delinquent, kills Jody's teacher (who had opposed the Vietnam War) with a hatchet, and shoots Sally's unscrupulous lawyer boyfriend in the head. Despite these deaths, the festivities continue, but are thrown into disarray when Sam uses the fireworks gear to blow up the congressman, and a flagpole to impale Louise's deputy boyfriend.

Article: As many as one in five US teenagers have some degree of hearing loss, according to researchers. They say the problem is growing. \\"Teenagers really don't pay attention to how much noise they are exposed to ,\\" Josef Shargorodsky of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston told Reuters. \\"Often people won't notice it, but even very little hearing loss may influence language development,\\" said Shargorodsky, one of the researchers. The study compared surveys from the early 1990s and the mid-2000s. Each included a few thousand teenagers. In the first survey, about 15 percent of teenagers had some degree of hearing loss. Some 15 years later, that number had risen by a third, to nearly 20 percent. \\"This certainly is big news,\\" said Alison Grimes, an ear doctor. \\"Hearing loss is very common in old people,\\" Grimes said, but she added that it was worrying to see it happen in the younger age group. In babies and young children, hearing problems are known to slow language development. The science is less clear for teenagers, but it is easy to imagine how being hard of hearing could influence learning, said Grimes. The reasons for the rise are still unclear. When researchers asked teenagers about noise exposure - on the job, at school or from activities, for example - the teenagers didn't report any change. But Shargorodsky said that might not be true. \\"We know from before that it is difficult to ask this age group about noise exposure - _ \\" Few people would call it noise when they listen to music on their MP3 player, for example. \\"There is a difference between what we think is loud and what is harmful to the ear,\\" said Grimes. Although it's not clear that the MP3 players cause teenagers' hearing loss, Grimes said it was still a good idea to turn down the sound and take short breaks from listening.

Walter left this message right away: .\\"Ryan is my hero.

Article: Facebook's stock sank to a record low Thursday as some of the social networking company’s investors got their first shot since the initial public offering to sell shares. Shares traded as low as 19.69 before coming to rest at 19.87, down 1.33 or more than 6%. More than 156 million shares traded hands, more than five times the average volume. The spike in trading amplified fears that insiders were fleeing a company that, before its IPO in May, was one of Silicon Valley’s brightest. Shares of the IPO were priced at 38; since then the stock has lost nearly half its value amid concerns over slowing revenue growth and its future moneymaking potential, particularly on mobile devices. It will be days before insiders have to disclose if they sold stock. But investors with a combined 271 million shares could have dumped their holdings Thursday when the first in a series of lock-ups expired. Among those who became eligible to sell shares: investment bank Goldman Sachs and venture capital firms Accel Partners and Greylock Partners. “Certainly some of them sold. The question is how many of them sold and how much of their holdings they sold,” Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser said. But, he said, “The big issue is, was and always will be November.” That’s when about 1.2 billion shares from insiders will be eligible to be sold. Kevin Landis, chief investment officer at Firsthand Capital Management in San Jose, bought Facebook shares late last year on the private market. He paid 31.50 apiece. “Lockup expirations have a lot to do with how Facebook will trade in the next couple of days and almost nothing to do with what the company will be worth a year or two from now,” Landis said. The lockup on Firsthand’s shares expires in November. Landis says he doesn’t yet know if he will sell. “Whatever happens this week is a dress rehearsal for November. That question is not going to be put to us this week. But in November that question will be put to us pretty hard,” Landis said. It has been a dramatic reversal of fortune for Facebook, which went from having one of history’s most hotly anticipated IPOs to one of the most botched. Its market value has plummeted by almost 50 billion. “I think Facebook has a lot of things going for it. Unfortunately the stock price has not been one of them,” S&P Capital IQ analyst Scott Kessler said. All told, more than 1.7 billion new shares will be released onto the market over the next nine months, said Sam Hamadeh, CEO of PrivCo, which researches privately held companies. He says the share value of the lockup expirations at about 20 a share is nearly 35 billion worth, roughly equivalent to the entire market value of companies such as Starbucks and Target. “There simply is no relief on the horizon for Facebook stockholders,” Hamadeh said. “It will get worse before it gets better.” ALSO: Facebook stock price could be hit by torrent of new shares German officials reopen inquiry into Facebook facial recognition How low will Facebook shares go? 'Lock-up' expires, stock plunges ||||| You need to enable Javascript to play media on Bloomberg.com Play The fortune of Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook Inc. (FB)’s co-founder and CEO, dropped to a new low today. Related Story: Facebook Falls to Record Low As Lockup End Frees Shares The 28-year-old’s net worth fell to 10.2 billion, its lowest point since the company’s May 17th initial public offering, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Facebook shares sank 6.3 percent today after the company freed up 271.1 million shares, a move that boosted the amount of stock available to trade by 60 percent. The shares closed at 19.87 in New York after dipping to a record low of 19.69 earlier in the day. “The market is not convinced of Facebook’s future,” David Kirkpatrick, author of “The Facebook Effect,” a history of the company, said in a telephone interview, adding that Zuckerberg probably isn’t worried about the sagging value of his own shares. “He thinks of it only in terms of how it affects the company’s strategic and tactical opportunities.” While Zuckerberg’s fortune swooned, the 40 richest people in the world added 1.9 billion to their collective net worth, as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index closed at its highest point since April. Facebook is down 48 percent from its 38 offering price. The world’s largest social-networking company raised 16 billion in its IPO, the largest ever for a technology firm. With a market capitalization of 48 billion, Facebook has lost more than 40 billion in value since the offering, making it the worst performer among all large IPOs on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Founders Falter The fortunes of Facebook’s other founders also took a hit. Co-founder Christopher Hughes, 28, owns about 22 million shares of Facebook, according to a person familiar with his holdings who asked not to be named because the matter is private. His stake is worth 437 million, down almost 400 million since the IPO. Dustin Moskovitz, 28, who started the company with Zuckerberg, Hughes and Eduardo Saverin from a dorm room at Harvard University, owns 133.7 million shares of the company’s Class B stock worth 2.7 billion, a decline of 2.4 billion. Saverin, 30, has a 1.1 billion stake, down 960 million since the offering. According to a regulatory filing dated May 17, he owns 53.1 million shares of the company. Facebook Inc. director Peter Thiel, who sold more than 16 million shares in the company’s initial public offering, converted more than 9 million shares to Class A from Class B, according to a document filed Aug. 10 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Thiel, a venture capitalist and hedge-fund manager whose proceeds from the IPO topped 630 million, still holds a stake worth about 550 million.

Miller at mmiller144@bloomberg.net |||||Summary:","completion":"Facebook's stock price went down a lot on Thursday because some people who invested in the company were allowed to sell their shares for the first time since Facebook went public. This made some people worried that the big investors are not confident in Facebook's ability to make money, especially with phones and other mobile devices. Some important investors, like Goldman Sachs and a couple of other big companies, were allowed to sell their shares. We don't know yet if they actually sold them or how many they sold, but the stock price went down anyway because so many people were trading shares. The stock price is important, but it doesn't change how valuable Facebook is as a company in the long run.

Both of them has large lakes or reservoirs, reservoir A and reservoir B. Since North Dakota has one the lowest unemployment rates in the country, it's hard to find an engineer to regulate and maintain the reservoirs. This year reservoir A could hire an engineer, but reservoir B failed to find an engineer. As a result, there is no one to regulate reservoir B. The engineer for reservoir A let the water out in the fall. But there was no one to do that for reservoir B. But I can use this background: The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year. What is an answer for this question: Which reservoir would most likely not casue damaged dock, reservoir A or reservoir B? Answer:","completion":"Reservoir A would most likely not cause damaged docks. This is because the engineer at reservoir A let out the water in the fall, reducing the risk of ice damage to the docks and other structures around the lake. On the other hand, reservoir B didn't have an engineer to regulate the water level, and the necessary action of letting out water in the fall wasn't taken, so it's more likely to cause damage to docks due to ice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Before Peyton purchased the locations, several restaurants reported sales of 3,000-4,000 on any given game day -- and that number has jumped up to roughly 5,000-6,000/day ... which equals about 60 pizzas an hour. One location reported a 25% increase in total sales since last year. It helps that Peyton's killing it on the field too -- his Papa John's locations offer 50% off on Mondays after a Broncos win, and so far they're undefeated. Fans recognize Peyton's stores because they all feature cutouts of PM and Papa John ... and he even makes personal visits from time to time. To compare, neighboring Papa John's locations NOT owned by Peyton reported no significant improvement in sales.

Allow your friend to vent their frustrations and disappointment. Make sure to respond in a manner that shows your empathetic understanding. 2. Validate their feelings: It's crucial to let your friend know that it's okay to feel upset or disappointed. Make sure they know that their feelings are valid, and it's perfectly normal to feel down after a job rejection. 3. Positivity and perspective: While it's important to validate their feelings, it's equally necessary to help your friend see the rejection from a positive perspective. This could mean reminding them that rejections are a part of life and especially a part of job hunting. Everyone faces setbacks, but they don't define our overall success. 4. Remind them of their worth: A job rejection can make someone question their abilities and self-worth. Remind your friend of their skills, capabilities, and past accomplishments to boost their self-esteem. It's important that they know a job rejection doesn't define their worth or potential. 5. Suggest Extracurricular Activities: Encourage your friend to engage in activities they love and enjoy. This can help boost their morale and also provide them with the opportunity to escape the stress of job hunting for a while. 6. Encourage persistence: It's essential to motivate your friend to keep applying to other jobs. Rejection can be disheartening, but it is the persistent effort that ultimately leads to success. 7. Share personal experiences: If you've faced similar situations in the past, share your personal experiences. Knowing that others have overcome the same obstacles can often inspire hope and resilience. 8. Offer assistance: If you feel comfortable doing so, offer help. This could include reviewing their resume, practicing interviews, or even just helping them search for new job opportunities. Just remember, it's key to approach the conversation with sensitivity and understanding.

Her characters struggle to lead lives not normally acceptable in society. \\"The nature of Jelinek's texts is often hard to define. They shift between prose and poetry and songs, they contain theatrical scenes and film script,\\" said the academy. The Nobel Prize was founded by Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel.

Q: Starting in Great Britain, Isabelle \\"Izzy\\" (Rebecca Rosso) and Annabelle \\"Annie\\" Woods (Camilla Rosso) are introduced as clever twin girls with a love for pink like their cousin, Elle Woods. They and their widowed father are moving to Southern California where they will be staying in Elle's home. Elle is now a successful Lobbyist. Awaiting the girls are a pair of chihuahua dogs, their giddiness is cut short when they find out they are going to attend Pacific Preparatory, Elle's alma mater, a private school requiring uniforms.Upon their first day, Izzy and Annie are registering themselves and they sign for ID cards. They also start off on the wrong foot with Tiffany Donohugh (Brittany Curran), the spoiled daughter of a primary funder of \\"Pac Prep.\\" And they also meet Chris, who is almost immediately smitten with Annie.Tiffany later apologizes for her rude behavior and befriends the twins, although she is doing it merely to \\"keep her enemies close.\\" Annie and Izzy believe Tiffany to be a sweet person, though she dislikes classmates on scholarship. However, her true colors come out, when she embarrasses Annie and Izzy at a formal dance, revealing that they are on partial scholarship at the school.Izzy and Annie rekindle their friendships with the other scholarship students, including Chris (Bobby Campo). Izzy wants to help Chris get closer to Annie, but in several instances, Annie believes Chris to like Izzy. The twins and their friends believe the uniforms are stifling their creativity and they redo their clothing while still cleverly abiding by the school's many rules.Chris and Izzy are later accused of cheating on a big history test and they all set out to prove the school wrong. Izzy and Annie suspect Tiffany and Justin are behind this and find that Chris and Tiffany have the same backpack that comes with a lock and key. In Chris's locked zipper he keeps a master-key that opens all doors in the school (and was found broken off in the lock their history teacher's office), for his work-studies to help pay off his scholarship. They discover that the keys and locks for the backpacks are the same, any key will open any lock. On the floor of the teacher's private office, where the answer key is kept, they discover red markings that match the marks that Justin's expensive shoes create. Tiffany told Justin the uber code to access the answers to the test.With this new piece of information, Annie and Izzy set to prove Izzy's innocence. In student court, Annie poses as Izzy when she is locked in the bathroom by Justin, and defeats her fear of public speaking. Even as Izzy escapes and returns to the court, Annie points out that Justin owns a new cell phone, one that has not yet been released to the public, and could only have gotten from one person, the daughter of the creator, Tiffany Donohugh. Justin, who is irritated by noises such as pencils being sharpened and pen clicks, struggles to hold himself together as the entire courtroom click their pens. He finally admits to framing Chris and Izzy on Tiffany's behalf and Tiffany, upon chewing him out for letting \\"a blonde make (him) crack\\", admits to masterminding the whole plot, though she protests that she cannot be punished since her father is a major funder and donor of the school.

Annie and Izzy and her friends are now popular in this prep school.

An Enclosure Act is a parliamentary authority to fence-off common land, thus making that land private property, while awarding commoners land in compensation. Inclosure is the name given to the parliamentary statute thus created. The enclosure process began in the 13th century and was supported by Acts of Parliament from 1640. In November 1833, the Isle of Ely intended to apply for Acts of Parliament to enclose the lands of Little Thetford. Officials arrived in the village armed with nothing more than a notice to be pinned on the Church of England's St. George's church door, but were prevented from doing so by a dozen villagers. They returned later with ten constables, authorised by Ely magistrates, and were confronted this time by 150 stick-wielding protesters, who continued to prevent due process. When the clergyman, Henry Hervey Baber, arrived the following afternoon, he was prevented from carrying out his normal Sunday service. Villagers may have rebelled against the church at this time, perhaps believing it was acting on behalf of the establishment in the enclosure acts. This event may have been the trigger that, five years later, encouraged a strong Baptist following amongst the poorer villagers. About half the total area of Little Thetford was eventually enclosed in 1844, seven years after that of Stretham.The village sent 61 men to fight in the First World War, which represents over 30 percent of the village population of 1911. Two villagers won Distinguished Conduct Medals. Thirteen villagers—over six percent of the... Answer:","completion":"61 men"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

To say that I was disheartened is putting it mildly. Despite its grand intentions and compelling subject matter, the film fell greatly short of expectations in terms of content and execution. Right from the start, the narration was disconcertingly off-track, choosing to play safe with a bare-bones depiction of the incredible real-life story of Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson. The fundamental spirit of thrill, adventure, courage and resilience associated with the protagonist's decision to scale the Dawn Wall of El Capitan in Yosemite National Park, considered the toughest climb in the world, was thoroughly diluted. The movie seemed to lack a clear motive. Instead of imposing brutally grand and stunningly beautiful instances of nature, it often drifted off into sentimental side stories and will-testing subplots, watering down a premise ripe with potential. The narrative pace was a significant issue as well, sluggish to the point of inducing dullness. A focus on building up the characters’ backstories was necessary, yes, but much screen time was spent on repellingly melodramatic depictions that diluted the intensity rather than enhancing the underlying human struggles. The cinematography could have been this film’s saving grace with majestic cliff faces and breathtaking landscapes as its backdrop. However, this fell short as well, oscillating inconsistently between stunning, vivid visuals and mediocre, almost amateurish filming moments. It's almost unfathomable to comprehend how such awe-inspiring landscapes could be rendered so utterly mundane and uninspiring in a film about climbing those very landscapes. In terms of performances, while there was no question about the authenticity of emotion from Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson, the documentary-style film lacked substantial, tangible content to support their efforts. Much of their interactions felt forced and awkward, further contributing to the overall discomfort and disconnect experienced when watching. \\"The Dawn Wall\\" was presented as an epic tale of human determination and perseverance, but it came off as an uninspired, lackluster depiction of a two-dimensional story. The film was sadly no tribute to these climbers and their monumental feat but instead diluted their journey into a tedious narration of an overly stretched-out saga. In conclusion, I was thoroughly disappointed with “The Dawn Wall”. The extraordinary true story needed a much more nuanced and competent treatment onscreen, one that could do justice to the gravity of the protagonists’ mission and the sheer magnitude of their achievements. As an audience member and climbing enthusiast, I felt let down on all counts, from storytelling to character development, from visuals to pace. Sadly, this promising premise turned out to be a colossal misfire."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Instead of lunches at Lut��ce, they caucus at the Palace Diner in Queens. Wooing clients means passing out fliers on street corners, not securing box seats at Madison Square Garden. To make ends meet, one partner stacks pipe and cleans the yard at a plumbing warehouse. Another handles urine samples in a hospital lab. A sign of failure, of a feeble economy, perhaps? Hardly. They are heeding the call of a growing pool of law schools, which are for the first time pointing graduates in a new direction and teaching them how to get there. Forget the lure of large firms, the security of a government post. Here is how to grapple \\"in the service of justice,\\" as many of the schools put it, instead. Convinced that corporate largess and government programs barely dent the nation's legal needs, the law schools are urging graduates to buck tradition, pass up big salaries and ignore mushrooming student debt to join tiny neighborhood practices or simply start their own, all with an eye toward charging no more than their clients can afford. This is not pro bono legal work; it is \\"low bono,\\" a term the schools coined to define the atypical kind of law career they are training students for. While its practitioners do charge for their services, they are also dead set on turning no one away - or at least as few as possible. \\"When you go into this kind of social justice law, it's really brutal and you're almost guaranteed to struggle for a couple of years before there's a light at the end of the tunnel,\\" said Fred Rooney, director of the Community Legal Resource Network at City University of New York School of Law, from which the lawyers of the newly formed Cates, Katalinic & Lund graduated last May. \\"But if our graduates don't do it, the millions of people who cannot access justice in this country will continue to soar.\\" The movement, primly called the consortium, started four years ago by CUNY, Northeastern University, the University of Maryland and St. Mary's Law School in Texas.

Ma had put a stack of clean clothes at the foot of the bed for me. I dressed without caring what I put on. The only important items were my cowboy boots and my Roy Rogers belt with two holsters for cap guns, even though I only had one cap gun left, and its trigger was broken. When I used the toilet, I sat on the front edge of the seat, watching the water beneath me, and scooted off as soon as I was done.

While many people in China will remember Confucius on his special day,few people in the United States will give him a passing thought.It's nothing personal.Most Americans don't even remember the birthdays of their own national heroes. But this doesn't mean that Americans don't care about Confucius.In many ways he has become a bridge that foreigners must cross if they want to reach a deeper understanding of China. In the past two decades,the Chinese study programs have gained huge popularity in Western universities.More recently, the Chinese government has set up Confucius Institutes in more than 80 countries.These schools teach both Chinese language and culture.The main courses of Chinese culture usually included Chinese art,history and philosophy.Some social scientists suggest that Westerners should take advantage of the old Chinese wisdom to make up for the drawbacks of Westerners philosophy.Students in the United States,at the same time,are racing to learn Chinese.So they will be ready for life in a world where China is an equal power with the United States.Businessmen who hope to make money in China are reading books about Confucius to understand their Chinese customers. So the old thinker's ideas are still alive and well. Today China attracts the West more than ever, and it will need more teachers to introduce Confucius and Chinese culture to the West. As for the old thinker,he will not soon be forgotten by people in the West,even if his birthday is. Question: The reason why few Americans remember Confucius on his birthday is probably that _ .

Governors wary of White House plan to place immigrant children with states June 25, 2014: A group of immigrants from Honduras and El Salvador who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally are stopped in Granjeno, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) State governors from both parties have reacted cooly to efforts by the Obama administration to gain their support for placing thousands of unaccompanied Central American children with friends or family members. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Matthews Burwell met privately with dozens of governors Sunday at the National Governors Association summer meeting in Nashville. According to those who attended the meeting, the governors expressed particular concerns about the costs to states, including that of providing public education for the children. Burwell left the meeting through a side door without talking to reporters. \\"Our citizens already feel burdened by all kinds of challenges. They don't want to see another burden come into their state,\\" said Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat. \\"However we deal with the humanitarian aspects of this, we've got to do it in the most cost-effective way possible.\\" Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad were among the most vocal Republican critics. They seized on the administration's plans to place the children with friends or family members without checking on their immigration status. Under current law, immigrant children from countries that don't border the United States and who cross into this country by themselves are turned over to HHS within 72 hours. From there, they often are reunited with parents or placed with other relatives already living in the country, while they wait for an immigration court to decide their future. The court process can take years. Neither Burwell's agency nor immigration officials check the immigration status of relatives who take custody of the immigrant children. Since Oct. 1 more than 57,000 children have crossed the border alone. Most are from Honduras, El Salvador or Guatemala. \\"We want to make sure they're placed in a safe and supportive home or placement, but also, it should be somebody that is legal and somebody that will be responsible to see that they show up for the hearing,\\" Branstad said. According to data from the Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review, about a quarter of immigrants facing deportations hearings don't show up as ordered. The no-show rate for the juvenile immigration court docket is about 46 percent. Amid the debate of what is causing the ongoing crush of child immigrants and how the government can stem the flow, two key lawmakers said President Barack Obama can take administrative action to relieve much of the crisis without waiting for what is likely to be a contentious and lengthy Congressional battle. At issue is a provision in a 2008 human trafficking law that puts the fate of these immigrants in the hands of immigration judges. The Obama administration has expressed some interest in asking Congress to change the law to give the administration more leeway in dealing with the crisis. But Rep. Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday that wholesale changes by Congress may not be necessary and that Obama has the authority to return the children to their native countries. Obama \\"has tools in his toolbox\\" to deal with humanitarian issues and deter more children from coming to the U.S., Rogers said. \\"We can safely get them home,\\" Rogers said on NBC's \\"Meet the Press.\\" He said, \\"And that's where the president needs to start. So he needs to re-engage, get folks who are doing administrative work on the border. They need to make sure they send a very clear signal.\\" Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the author of the provision in the human trafficking law, said a change in regulations, not the law, could speed the children's return. The law already allows HHS and the Homeland Security Department to write regulations to deal with \\"exceptional circumstances\\" that would allow officials to return the children more quickly to their home countries, Feinstein said Thursday at a hearing on a 3.7 billion emergency budget request from the White House to deal with the growing crisis on the border. Some of the money would go to help fund about 40 additional immigration judge teams. Federal immigration courts have a backlog of more than 375,000 cases. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Several sources indicate that during Muhammad's lifetime a large number of his companions had memorized the revelations. Early commentaries and Islamic historical sources support the above-mentioned understanding of the Quran's early development. The Quran in its present form is generally considered by academic scholars to record the words spoken by Muhammad because the search for variants has not yielded any differences of great significance.[page needed] University of Chicago professor Fred Donner states that \\"...there was a very early attempt to establish a uniform consonantal text of the Qurʾān from what was probably a wider and more varied group of related texts in early transmission.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What building the architect and owner of Portland's quarries design and build? ? Weymouth originated as a settlement on a constricted site to the south and west of Weymouth Harbour, an outlying part of Wyke Regis. The town developed from the mid 12th century onwards, but was not noted until the 13th century. By 1252 it was established as a seaport and became a chartered borough. Melcombe Regis developed separately on the peninsula to the north of the harbour; it was mentioned as a licensed wool port in 1310. French raiders found the port so accessible that in 1433 the staple was transferred to Poole. Melcombe Regis is thought to be the first port at which the Black Death came into England in June 1348, possibly either aboard a spice ship or an army ship. In their early history Weymouth and Melcombe Regis were rivals for trade and industry, but the towns were united in an Act of Parliament in 1571 to form a double borough. Both towns have become known as Weymouth, despite Melcombe Regis being the main centre. The villages of Upwey, Broadwey, Preston, Wyke Regis, Chickerell, Southill, Radipole and Littlemoor have become part of the built-up area. King Henry VIII had two Device Forts built to protect the south Dorset coast from invasion in the 1530s: Sandsfoot Castle in Wyke Regis and Portland Castle in Castletown. Parts of Sandsfoot have fallen into the sea due to coastal erosion. During the English Civil War, around 250 people were killed in the local Crabchurch Conspiracy in February 1645. In 1635, on board the ship Charity, around 100 emigrants from the town crossed the Atlantic Ocean and settled in Weymouth, Massachusetts. More townspeople emigrated to the Americas to bolster the population of Weymouth, Nova Scotia and Salem, Massachusetts; then called Naumking. There are memorials to this on the side of Weymouth Harbour and near to Weymouth Pavilion and Weymouth Sea Life Tower.

Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What is found in Prochlorococcus and essential for photosynthesis? Answer:","completion":"Prochlorococcus is a genus of tiny marine cyanobacteria, known for their significant contribution to primary production in the ocean. They form an integral part of the marine ecosystem. They are particularly noteworthy for their photosynthetic capabilities, which is the process of converting sunlight into chemical energy by plants and certain other organisms. Photosynthesis in Prochlorococcus, like in other photosynthetic organisms, is dependent on a suite of crucial components. The most essential of these include chlorophyll, phycobiliproteins, photosystems, and various nutrients. 1. Chlorophyll: Two different types of chlorophylls encountered in Prochlorococcus are Chlorophyll a and Chlorophyll b'. These pigments function by absorbing sunlight. In fact, different versions or types of Prochlorococcus contain different chlorophylls to adapt to various light intensities in different areas of the ocean. 2. Phycobiliproteins: Some strains of Prochlorococcus contain phycobiliproteins, which are light harvesting antennae of photosystems. 3. Photosystems: Prochlorococcus contains two types of photosystems – Photosystem I (PSI) and Photosystem II (PSII). These are responsible for the conversion of light energy into chemical energy. They are each composed of a core antenna complex that contains chlorophyll-a and chlorophyll-b', and surrounds the reaction center where the photochemistry takes place. 4. Nutrients: Several nutrients are essential for photosynthesis in Prochlorococcus. These include phosphorous, nitrogen, and trace metals like iron, which play significant roles in photosynthesis and are part of the several enzymatic reactions. For instance, phosphorous is a component of ATP, the energy currency of cells, and nitrogen is a building block of chlorophyll. 5. Carbon Dioxide: As in all photosynthetic organisms, carbon dioxide is a primary raw material for photosynthesis in Prochlorococcus. It is fixed through the process of carbon fixation to produce glucose, which serves as an energy source for the organism. 6. Light-Harvesting Complexes: The light-harvesting complexes are a group of proteins that assist with the absorption of light and the transfer of energy to the reaction centers. 7. Enzymes: A variety of enzymes are involved in the process of photosynthesis, with rubisco or Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, being perhaps the most important as it initiates the process of carbon fixation. In summary, photosynthesis in Prochlorococcus involves a complex cellular machinery, and in-depth knowledge of these components offers insight into the functioning and adaptability of these marine microorganisms that play a crucial role in Earth's carbon and energy cycles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? It is not your fault your parent is an addict. You can tell your mother how you feel and that you’d like her to get treatment, but you can’t change her. Often, the only thing that can help an addict is for her to want help for herself and admit she has a problem. If you've tried your best to help, but always end up being hurt or ignored, it's not your fault. Nothing you did made her start doing drugs and you must never blame yourself. You haven’t failed your mother or done anything wrong for her to use drugs. Recognize your own risks associated with drugs with a close family history. Kids that have a drug using parent tend to start using drugs and earlier and harder than kids that don’t have a drug-using parent. They are also more likely to develop drug disorders. You may feel so involved with the drug problem that you forget to take care of yourself. Make sure you spend time taking care of your own needs. You don’t need to give up your social life to take care of your mother. Remember, this is her problem and unfortunately, you’re involved in it but not responsible for her. Keep your body and mind healthy, hang out with friends, and do things that make you happy. Don’t let your entire life revolve around your mother. Part of taking care of yourself is making sure you have healthy outlets for you to take out your stress, anger, sadness, pain, etc. Being a teenager is hard enough, but having to deal with the stress of having a drug addicted mother makes things a lot harder for you. Engage in activities that make you feel good in your body and your mind. Some easy ways to deal with stress include spending time in nature, writing in a journal, playing with animals, and listening to music. Exercise is a great way to release stress and keep your body happy. Go for a walk, skip, or do some jump rope. You can join sport teams at school to keep you moving. Spend time with friends. One the best ways to bust stress is to surround yourself with fun and supportive people. It’s important to have someone in your life that you trust that you can talk to about your mother’s problems and how they affect you. It’s okay to talk about the hurt, frustration, embarrassment, anger, and fear associated with your mother’s use. This can be a coach, guidance counselor, spiritual leader, aunt/uncle, or therapist. It can be helpful to find an adult that has similar experiences to you to talk to. This person can encourage you, show you that you can make it through, and be an example that things can work well for you. It's important to have people to talk to about what's happening in your life and this is really important. If you feel uncomfortable talking with someone you know personally, then here are some hotline phone numbers, and websites to help you out. For family members of alcoholics, check out Al-Anon.org (https://www.al-anon.org). For family members of addicts, check out Nar-anon (https://www.nar-anon.org) For adult children of alcoholics and addicts, check out Adultchildren.org (https://www.adultchildren.org). It can be confusing to work through having a drug addicted mother while trying to be a normal kid, go to school, have friends, and have fun. If you’re struggling to keep that balance, it can be helpful to see a therapist. Even if you cannot afford to see an outpatient therapist, you can talk to your school counselor. Therapy can help you find ways to cope and support you through difficult times.

What is the answer: Which nuclear physicist is known as the ‘father of the atomic bomb’?","completion":"The nuclear physicist known as the 'father of the atomic bomb' is Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer. Born on April 22, 1904, in New York City, Julius Robert Oppenheimer was an American theoretical physicist who played a crucial role in the development of the first atomic bomb during World War II. Oppenheimer's significant contributions to the field of nuclear physics and his leadership during the development of the atomic bomb cemented his role in history. After receiving his PhD from the University of Göttingen in Germany, Oppenheimer held professorship positions at the University of California, Berkeley, and the California Institute of Technology. In 1942, he was appointed as the head of the secret weapons project that aimed to develop the first nuclear weapon, known as the Manhattan Project. The project brought together top scientists and engineers from across the United States to work at different research sites, such as the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. Under Oppenheimer's guidance and leadership, the researchers at Los Alamos designed and built the first atomic bomb. The first successful test of the atomic bomb, known as the Trinity test, was conducted on July 16, 1945. Subsequently, the United States dropped two atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, which led to Japan's surrender and the end of World War II. Despite his essential role in the development of the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer was haunted by the devastating consequences of his creation. He famously quoted a line from the Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita after witnessing the Trinity test, saying, \\"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.\\" After the war, Oppenheimer became a vocal advocate for international control over nuclear weapons and worked toward limiting their proliferation. J. Robert Oppenheimer's exceptional scientific achievements and his role in the construction of the first atomic bomb earned him the title \\"father of the atomic bomb.\\" However, his legacy is multifaceted, encompassing not only his scientific accomplishments but also his moral struggles and advocacy for nuclear disarmament."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: If you are sending a text, watching the TV or listening to the radio, you may want to stop and give this your full attention. Multi-tasking shrinks the brain, research suggests. A study found that men and women who frequently used several types of technology at the same time had less grey matter in a key part of the brain. University of Sussex researchers said, \\"Simultaneously using mobile phones, laptops and other media devices could be changing the structure of our brains.\\" The finding follows research which has linked multi-tasking with a shortened attention span, depression, anxiety and lower grades at school. The researchers began by asking 75 healthy men and women how often they divided their attention between different types of technology. This could mean sending a text message while listening to music and checking email, or speaking on the phone while watching TV and surfing the web. The volunteers were then given brain scans which showed they had less grey matter in a region called the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The findings held even when differences in personality were taken into account. The study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, is the first to make a link between multi-tasking and the structure of the brain. Researcher Kep Kee Loh said, \\"Media multi-tasking is becoming more common in our lives today and there is increasing concern about its impacts on our cognition and social-emotional well-being.\\" He added that more research is needed to prove that multi-tasking shrinks the brain. This is because it is also possible that people with less grey matter in the ACC are more drawn to using lots of small devices simultaneously. Scientists have previously demonstrated brain structure can be changed on prolonged exposure to new environments and experience.

Q: Paul Reynolds crisscrossed his sketchbook with furious strokes, filling the pages with images of the vengeance he would take on his former coworkers at Fear and Loading Games. He'd founded the company three years back and, just a few hours ago, his partners and erstwhile friends had fired him without cause or warning. He concentrated hard as his pen brought to life demonic figures from one of the best-selling comics he'd created, scythe wielding cyber-men called Myrmidons who tore into surprised computer programmers with fangs and claws. Elsewhere on the page, computers assembled themselves into 21st century Golems, rising up against traitorous CEO's and producers to crush them to bloody pulp as they cowered beneath their desks. Sitting at the bar in Señor Goldstein's Mexican Restaurant in San Jose, California, Paul's own artwork engaged him for the first time in months, maybe years. Under other circumstances, that would have made him happy. But today's circumstances allowed only two emotions: despair and a burning desire for revenge. Not wanting to succumb to the former, and not quite wanting to find a gun and go back to the office, he instead drew. He had turned to a fresh page and begun to sketch his most elaborate revenge-scheme yet when a woman walked into his line of vision. There were four or five other women in the restaurant already (most of them employees), but this one stood out. This one would've stood out anywhere. Her hair, cut short and spiky, was dyed a magenta so bright it nearly glowed. She wore a tight black t-shirt, baggy olive drab shorts that hung on shapely hips, and heavy black boots with two inch thick soles. She had a faded black messenger bag slung across her chest, the strap pressing between her breasts. If Paul had to guess, she wasn't wearing a bra. She definitely wasn't your average Silicon Valley techie on an early lunch break, and certainly not a restaurant employee.

In one account, Tweedy recalled: Around this time, I would say something into a microphone onstage, and afterward [Farrar would] pull me aside and say, \\"Don't you ever fucking talk into that microphone again.\\" He would misconstrue me talking into the microphone as more evidence of my out-of-control, rampant ego, more evidence of me feeling like I didn't have to be so fucking afraid anymore. Tweedy felt the new members gave him a new opportunity to contribute to the band, but Farrar felt disdain for Tweedy's new carefree attitude. Years later, Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy stroking the hair of Farrar's girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition. In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band. Farrar told Margherita that he was no longer having fun, and didn't want to work with Tweedy anymore. Soon after the breakup, Farrar explained his departure: \\"It just seemed like it reached a point where Jeff and I really weren't compatible. It had ceased to be a symbiotic songwriting relationship, probably after the first record.\\"Tweedy was enraged that he heard the news secondhand from Margherita, since Farrar decided not to tell him in person. The following day, the two singers engaged in a verbal confrontation. As a favor to Margherita—who had spent a substantial amount of money to keep the band running—Farrar agreed to a final tour with Uncle Tupelo in North America. Tweedy and Farrar again engaged in a shouting match two weeks into the tour, due to Farrar's refusal to sing harmony on any of Tweedy's songs.

He had given up. So, there, in the middle of class, before he could get away, I said “Well, yeah. You will certainly fail if you don’t even try.

Ferris frequently breaks the fourth wall, giving the audience advice on how to skip school, and to narrate about his friends. His younger sister Jeannie is less-convinced, but goes to school anyway. Dean of Students Edward R. Rooney notes and suspects Ferris is being truant again and commits to catching him. However, Ferris uses a computer to alter the school's records to indicate his absences from 9 to 2. Ferris convinces his friend Cameron Frye, who is absent due to illness, to report that his girlfriend Sloane Peterson's grandmother has died. Rooney doubts this, but they succeed as planned. Borrowing Cameron's father's prized 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder against Cameron's instinct, Ferris, Cameron, and Sloane drive into Chicago to sightsee. Leaving the car with two parking attendants, who promptly joyride it unknowingly to them, the trio visit the Art Institute of Chicago, Sears Tower, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and Wrigley Field. They then go to a French restaurant for lunch where Ferris poses as the \\"Sausage King of Chicago\\", Abe Froman, while narrowly avoiding his father, who is eating lunch at the restaurant. Meanwhile, after humiliatingly failing to find Ferris, Rooney visits the Bueller residence and fails to enter, being attacked by the family rotweiller as his car is towed. Jeannie, skipping class, returns home and discovers her brother's ruse, but encounters Rooney snooping. She kicks him and calls the police, who arrest her for false reporting after Rooney leaves. While at the station, Jeannie meets a juvenile delinquent, who advises her not to worry so much about Ferris. After a cab ride where Cameron exclaims disinterest, Ferris impromptu joins a parade float during the Von Steuben Day parade and lip-syncs Wayne Newton's cover of \\"Danke Schoen\\", as well as a rendition of The Beatles' \\"Twist and Shout\\" that gets the entire crowd dancing.

Please answer the following question: Two coastal Canadian towns, Hammond and Soundville decided to start sand mining to bring more money to their budgets. A few months later however, Hammond decided to stop all mining operations and find other sources of income. they wanted to protect the environment. Which village harmed fewer corals? Hint: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators. Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Hammond, the coastal Canadian town that decided to stop all mining operations after a few months, likely harmed fewer corals in comparison to Soundville. Sand mining, as mentioned, has numerous detrimental effects on the environment, particularly on coastal and underwater ecosystems. When sand is removed from beaches and the coastal areas, it has a direct impact on erosion patterns and can even pose a threat to vital physical coastal barriers such as dunes and the native flora and fauna that inhabit these areas. This disturbance not only disrupts nesting grounds for various animals, like the gharials in India, but also leads to increased water turbidity which makes it difficult for sunlight-dependent organisms, such as corals, to survive. Furthermore, the destruction of picturesque beaches due to mining can result in the loss of tourism, a vital economic resource for many coastal communities. Consequently, the continuation of sand mining in an area such as Soundville may lead to long-term financial and environmental consequences in addition to extensive coral damage and destruction. By deciding to stop sand mining operations and seeking alternative sources of income, Hammond managed to reduce its overall negative impact on the local environment, including the health of corals and the broader marine ecosystem. This proactive decision likely led to a lesser degree of coral disturbance in comparison to Soundville, where sand mining operations continued. In conclusion, by ceasing its sand mining operations within a few months, Hammond likely was more successful in preserving the delicate balance of its coastal and underwater habitats, and as a result, harmed fewer corals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. concrete foundations, several meters thick, had to be removed and therefore, possibly with a view to saving money, the ministry of defence left the door slightly ajar for a partial conservation of the installation. Please write the text above using proper case.","completion":"Concrete foundations, several meters thick, had to be removed and therefore, possibly with a view to saving money, the Ministry of Defence left the door slightly ajar for a partial conservation of the installation. The requirement to dismantle substantial concrete foundations posed a significant challenge during the deconstruction process. These foundations, which were several meters in thickness, played a vital role in supporting and maintaining the stability of the installation. However, complete removal of these structures would have led to a significant increase in project costs. As such, the Ministry of Defence opted for a more cost-effective solution by considering the possibility of partially conserving the installation. Leaving the door slightly ajar, the Ministry allowed for further discussions and assessments to take place, ensuring that all aspects of the operation were thoroughly reviewed before making a final decision. This move not only aimed to minimize expenses but also to strike a balance between conserving an important historical structure and fulfilling the objective of deconstructing the installation. Several factors contributed to the consideration of a partial conservation. One reason was the potential historical and educational value of the installation. Preserving a portion of the structure would allow future generations to learn from its design, engineering, and historical context. Additionally, partial conservation might also have provided opportunities for the local community, including the possible repurposing of the installation for alternative uses that could benefit the area. Moreover, the environmental impact of demolishing the concrete foundations needed to be taken into account. Removing these structures would require substantial resources and machinery, resulting in increased carbon emissions and waste production. In contrast, partial conservation would minimize these negative impacts while still fulfilling the primary objectives of the project. Ultimately, the Ministry of Defence demonstrated a willingness to explore alternative options and consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of partial conservation. By leaving the door slightly ajar, they provided an opportunity for stakeholders and experts to weigh in on the decision-making process and contribute to finding the most suitable solution for the installation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You can get a foam head from a wig store or beauty supply store or online for about 5. Rather than using your regular hair bush, get one made of stainless steel. Use it to carefully brush the wig hair, starting at the ends and working your way to the roots. Brushing the wig will “wake up” the fibers. Synthetic wigs are inexpensive and therefore aren’t made to last very long. However, using styling products can cause the wig to deteriorate even faster! Don’t use any products, like hairspray or heat protectants, on synthetic hair. Heat tools, like a curling iron or straightener will ruin the synthetic fibers. However, you can use steam to remove kinks or set a style. If you often wear synthetic wigs, you should invest in a handheld steamer, like the ones used to get wrinkles out of clothing. If you want to add curls to the wig, put the hair in foam rollers, then go over it with the steamer. Let the wig cool and dry, then remove the rollers.

News article: Big East Tournament: On a Familiar Court, St. John’s Again Exits With a Listless Showing It had been so long that even Coach Steve Lavin could not remember the last time St. John’s won a game in the Big East tournament. He had near-perfect recall of games he lost while at U.C.L.A. in overtime — who hit the shot, the time on the clock, the most minuscule of details — but the Red Storm’s record at Madison Square Garden in postseason play escaped him. That is what four straight years of short-lived tournament appearances will do. Not since 2011, Lavin’s first year, had the Red Storm lasted beyond a few short hours at the Garden, and the streak of early exits continued Thursday, when fifth-seeded St. John’s lost to Providence, the No. 4 seed, by 74-57. St. John’s play ranged from lackadaisical to disengaged to dreadful, with a few short bursts of energy but nothing sustained, nothing threatening. The Friars (22-10, 11-7), who won this tournament last year but lost to St. John’s (21-11, 10-8) twice this season, appeared sound, confident and perfectly content letting the Red Storm unravel themselves. For instance, there was a period in the first half in which St. John’s missed 15 consecutive shots, went 10 minutes 5 seconds without a field goal and committed six turnovers. At the end of that stretch, Providence led, 28-13, with seven minutes left in the half, and St. John’s looked panic-stricken. “We couldn’t buy a bucket,” guard Jamal Branch said. “They capitalized.” Of all St. John’s grotesque halftime statistics (26.7 percent shooting, 1 of 9 from 3-point range), its zero fast-break points seemed to jump out, at least for a team that had shown impressive athleticism and defensive energy earlier in the season. Providence Coach Ed Cooley said limiting the Red Storm’s ability to get out in transition was one of his keys to the win. “You can’t let St. John’s loose,” Cooley said. “You let them loose, you’re going to be in trouble.” St. John’s came no closer than 8 points in the second half. LaDontae Henton scored 20 points and had 12 rebounds, and Kris Dunn added 17 points, 11 assists, and 2 steals for the Friars, who will meet the top-seed Villanova on Friday night. “We feel like we can play with anybody,” Henton said. The Red Storm’s befuddling streak of uninspired play on their home court in the conference tournament could not be explained by Lavin, who went on to even besmirch himself by saying, “I’m a poor conference tournament coach.” He added that he did not necessarily believe that league tournament play indicated success or failure in the N.C.A.A. tournament. St. John’s has struggled in its last two games, however, losing by 37 points in a short-handed effort against Villanova before this latest demoralizing defeat. “Today we’re just disappointed as a group with our performance,” Lavin said. “We didn’t feel that we brought the aggressiveness. I thought we were tentative.” At this point, the Red Storm appears destined to make the N.C.A.A. tournament, having won 10 games in league play. Nothing, though, is certain until the brackets are announced Sunday night. “If they don’t put us in,” guard D’Angelo Harrison said, referring to the selection committee, “then that’ll be on them.” VILLANOVA 84, MARQUETTE 49 The top-seeded Wildcats tied a Big East tournament record with 17 3-pointers. The No. 4 Wildcats (30-2, 16-2), who have won 13 in a row, appear to be playing as well as any team in the country. In the second half of their last regular-season win, over St. John’s on Saturday, Villanova scored 55 points without committing a single turnover. On Thursday, they shot 59 percent from beyond the arc. “We just came out and we just made threes,” Villanova Coach Jay Wright said. “I thought that set the tone for the game.” Marquette (13-19, 4-14), which throttled Seton Hall by 22 in the opening round, did not have an answer for the Wildcats’ exceptional floor spacing, their altruistic approach to ball distribution and their dynamic shot-making. Marquette never came within 15 in the second half. The Golden Eagles’ 35-point defeat was its largest in the Big East tournament since 2006. Josh Hart finished with 20 points, on 7-of-10 shooting, off the bench, while Darrun Hilliard added 13 points and 8 assists. Six Villanova players hit at least one 3-pointer in the game. “I don’t know if they could play much better,” Marquette Coach Steve Wojciechowski said. “Certainly, I don’t think they could shoot much better than they did.” A version of this article appears in print on March 13, 2015, on page B12 of the New York edition with the headline: On a Familiar Court, St. John’s Again Exits With a Listless Showing.

There are all these torrents of passion flowing through you. Your job, as captain of your soul, is to erect dams to keep these passions in check. Your job is to just say no to laziness, lust, greed, drug use and the other sins. These days that model is out of fashion. You usually can't change your behavior by simply resolving to do something. Knowing what to do is not the same as being able to do it. Your willpower is not like a dam that can block the torrent of self-indulgence. It's more like a muscle, which tires easily. Moreover, you're a social being. If everybody around you is overeating, you'll probably do so, too. The 19th-century character model was based on an understanding of free will. Today, we know that free will is bounded. People can change their lives, but ordering change is not simple because many things, even within ourselves, are beyond our direct control. Much of our behavior, for example, is guided by unconscious habits. Researchers at Duke University calculated that more than 40 percent of the actions we take are governed by habit, not actual decisions. Researchers have also come to understand the structure of habits--cue, routine, reward. You can change your own personal habits. If you leave running shorts on the floor at night, that'll be a cue to go running in the morning. Don't try to ignore your afternoon snack craving. Every time you feel the cue for a snack, insert another routine. Take a walk. Their research thus implies a different character model, which is supposed to manipulate the neuralnetworks inside. To be an effective person, under this model, you are supposed to coolly examine your own unconscious habits, and the habits of those under your care. You are supposed to devise strategies to alter the cues and routines. Every relationship becomes slightly manipulative, including your relationship with yourself. You're trying to arouse certain responses by implanting certain cues. This is a bit... Which of the following is the first-to-none element in the 19th-century character model? A) Action. B) Capacity.

An Arkansas mother is pushing for a 'child abuse registry' to be implemented in her home state to protect other families from the 'monster nanny' who terrorized her child and may now be free to harm others. Whitney Matney, a 28-year-old lawyer from Springdale, Arkansas, went through every parent's worst nightmare in 2012 when, using a hidden camera, she caught her former-nanny Melissa Medema violently shaking and spanking her screaming one-year-old daughter Raylee. Melissa, also based in Springdale, was arrested and as part of a plea deal was sentenced to 90 days in jail and three years probation, after which she can have her record expunged and her past buried.

In 2012, Matney faced every parent's worst nightmare when she discovered, using a hidden nanny-cam, that her former nanny Melissa Medema violently shook and spanked her one-year-old daughter Raylee while she screamed. Springdale resident Melissa was arrested, and as part of a plea deal, received a 90-day jail sentence and three years probation. After completing her sentence, she can have her record expunged and her past buried. Whitney Matney used a device similar to the nanny-cam to record the incriminating footage that led to the arrest and conviction of Melissa Medema. This horrifying experience prompted Matney to campaign for the implementation of a child abuse registry in Arkansas, designed to prevent known child abusers from finding employment in childcare or having access to vulnerable children. Concerned for the safety of other families in her community, Matney shared her story with local news outlets and used social media platforms to raise awareness about the importance of proper background checks and the potential dangers of hiring caregivers without a comprehensive screening process. Through her relentless efforts, Matney garnered the attention and support of state legislators who were moved to consider the establishment of a child abuse registry. As discussions among policymakers continue, a bill proposing the creation of a child abuse registry is being drafted with input from child protection agencies, law enforcement, and the legal community. The proposed registry would list individuals who have been convicted of child abuse, providing accessible information to help parents and guardians make informed decisions when hiring child care providers, tutors, or other individuals who would be in close proximity to children. Opponents of the registry argue that it may infringe on the civil rights of those listed, placing undue stigmatization on registrants that might hinder their rehabilitation and reintegration into society. They stress that robust background checks and effective communication between law enforcement agencies, local governments, and child care providers are more practical solutions to safeguard children from potential abusers. Despite these concerns, support for the child abuse registry continues to grow, with advocates emphasizing the need to prioritize the safety and wellbeing of children in Arkansas and beyond. As Whitney Matney's campaign gains traction, it remains to be seen whether the implementation of a child abuse registry will become a reality in the state, but it is clear that her harrowing experience has ignited a fierce debate on the best methods for protecting families from repeat child abusers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fowey Rocks Light is located seven miles southeast from Cape Florida on Key Biscayne. In this sentence, the reference point for the location of Fowey Rocks Light is Cape Florida. It states that Fowey Rocks Light is situated seven miles to the southeast from Cape Florida. The phrase \\"on Key Biscayne\\" specifies that Cape Florida is a part of the island Key Biscayne. To clarify, this sentence implies that if you start at Cape Florida, which is on the island of Key Biscayne, and travel seven miles to the southeast, you would arrive at the location of Fowey Rocks Light. 2. Fowey Rocks Light is located seven miles southeast of Key Biscayne on Cape Florida. In this sentence, the reference point for the location of Fowey Rocks Light is Key Biscayne, which is an island in Florida. It states that Fowey Rocks Light is situated seven miles to the southeast of the entire island of Key Biscayne, not just Cape Florida. The phrase \\"on Cape Florida\\" specifies that Fowey Rocks Light is located on a particular land feature called Cape Florida. So, according to this sentence, if you move seven miles southeast of Key Biscayne, you would arrive at Cape Florida, where Fowey Rocks Light is situated. In conclusion, while both sentences describe the location of Fowey Rocks Light in relation to Key Biscayne and Cape Florida, they have slightly different meanings. The first sentence emphasizes the distance of Fowey Rocks Light from Cape Florida, which is on Key Biscayne. In contrast, the second sentence emphasizes the distance of Fowey Rocks Light from the entity of Key Biscayne and it's located on Cape Florida. The primary difference is the reference point used to describe the distance: Cape Florida in the first sentence, and Key Biscayne in the second."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Summarize: In the last Parliament, the Work and Pensions and Business Committees held spectacular hearings on the plight of the pensioners of the collapsed British Home Stores chain; the Foreign Affairs Committee had to be courted by David Cameron as he sought to ensure he got a Commons majority for military intervention in Syria; the Brexit Committee caused considerable ripples with its report on the status of EU nationals resident in the UK; the Health Committee pushed for a new tax on sugary drinks, and a pincer movement involving Health, Communities and the Public Accounts Committees highlighted the issue of NHS funding. So how will the system fare in the new Parliament of 2017? It will be a while before we find out. With talk of a delay before Parliament can open for business, while the Conservatives and DUP negotiate a \\"confidence and supply\\" deal, it now looks distinctly possible that the whole Commons select committee system may not begin work until October. Getting the system going was always a ponderous process. The secret of the committees' recent success is that the chairs and the members have been elected since 2010 - giving them much more authority that they enjoyed in the days when they were appointed by the party whips. But the two stage process of electing the chairs, and then the ordinary members could stretch into the Commons two week September sitting, before the conference breakâ€¦which could mean the first actual hearings might be in October. And because no government enjoys detailed scrutiny (imagine the select committees starting to take an interest in how much extra funding might be funnelled into Northern Ireland as the price of the DUP's support for the Conservative government), there's little incentive to speed the process up. There's probably little that can be done to hasten the process at the moment, but influential voices are beginning to murmur about changing the rules to ensure that the next government can't consign the process of setting up committee scrutiny to slow-motion, again. So how does the system work? First, the parties will have to agree a new share out of the committee chairs; the change in the composition of the Commons might mean some slight redistribution, perhaps with Labour gaining an extra chair. Some committees - Public Accounts and Backbench Business - automatically have an opposition MP in the chair, but the balance is not just a matter of numbers, because some committees carry greater weight than others. In the last Parliament, Labour had the chairs of Home Affairs, Brexit and Business and Industrial Strategy; they will want to keep all of those. Once a new share-out is agreed, the next step is for all MPs to elect the chairs of the committees. Tentatively, Commons officials were eying 5 July as election day for the committee chairs. But that was before the prospect of a later Queen's Speech. Each week of delay pushed back this timetable. And for some incumbents, there is another hurdle; the term limits imposed in standing orders, which limit chairs to serving for two parliaments or eight years, whichever is the longer. This could catch a number of the current titans of the committee corridor - Louise Ellman on the Transport Committee, David TC Davies (Welsh Affairs), Laurence Robertson (Northern Ireland), and Sir Bill Cash (European Scrutiny). If elected, they could only stay in office for a little under a year, before the eight year limit was reached - unless MPs were invited to vote on changing the rules to give them an extra lease of life. Another who would have been caught by the limit would have been the Treasury Committee Chair, Andrew Tyrie, and that was probably a major factor in his decision to stand down from the Commons. He never made the government's life easy, so his departure might make extending the terms of those who remain easier for ministers to stomach. In the case of another long-serving incumbent, Bernard Jenkin (Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs) there's another issue - at the start of the 2015 Parliament his Public Administration Committee had its remit expanded to cover constitutional issues - so he may be in a position to argue that the ban does not apply because his original committee has morphed into something else. In any event, there will be some important roles up for grabs. The chair of the Treasury Committee is always a major player in the world of Westminster, and the defeat of the Conservative chair of the Education Committee, Neil Carmichael, opens up another plum job - but all of the committees can carry considerable clout under the leadership of a chair who knows what they are doing. Some of the previous parliament's incumbents might be called to higher things; Yvette Cooper (Home Affairs) and Hilary Benn (Brexit) might, perhaps, be asked to rejoin Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet. But both Home Affairs and Brexit are hugely influential posts - and in a hung Parliament, where the terms of the UK's departure from the EU is the over-riding issue, the chair of the Brexit Committee, in particular, in could be fantastically important. But, in general, for a minority government the support or opposition of a select committee could tip the balance in a tight Commons vote. It is not a done deal that the incumbent chairs will be re-elected. Justice Committee Chair Bob Neill, for example, has been one of the most active pro-Remain rebels on the Tory benches, and might face retribution. The Health Committee chair, Sarah Wollaston has proved to be independent minded, on everything from a sugary drinks tax to the impact of Brexit on the NHS workforceâ€¦.so it is possible she could attract a challenger. There is now open electioneering for these posts (I still have Barry Gardiner's election literature from his run for the chair of the Environmental Audit Committee in the last Parliament) and a particular hazard is candidates lurking at the top of the escalator in Portcullis House - the big parliamentary office building - seeking to make eye contact with possible voters as they come into view. The elections for chairs are then followed by elections within the different party groups for membership of select committees - so, for example, the Conservative 1922 Committee makes arrangements to elect the Conservative members of the committees according to its own rules and timetable; similarly the Parliamentary Labour Party, the SNP and Lib Dems will generate their quota of committee members according to their particular custom and practice. The committees then have to meet and agree a work programme - and a few really ambitious chairs might try to get an actual hearing scheduled in advance, with the obvious play being a \\"getting to know you\\" session with their particular departmental Secretary of State. They could even make the first moves on that before their committee had been fully elected - because for most committees it would be an obvious and completely uncontroversial thing to do. Summary:","completion":"The UK Parliament's select committees, which scrutinise the work of individual governmental departments, are unlikely to begin working until October, due to delays as the Conservative Party and the Democratic Unionist Party negotiate a \\"confidence and supply\\" deal. Although the impact and influence of select committees has increased since chairs and members began to be elected in 2010, the system still takes a significant amount of time to organise. Additionally, the recent general election may lead to a reorganising of the committees and specific members. Select committees have previously pushed for governmental changes such as a new tax on sugary drinks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His main focus is to reconcile with his estranged wife, Nikki (Brea Bee). She has moved away and obtained a restraining order against him after Pat had found her in the shower with another man and nearly beat him to death. His therapist, Dr. Patel (Anupam Kher), does his best to convince him to keep taking his medication, as a repeat of his violent outbursts might send him back to the clinic.

Because of this, it can be a good idea to consume bitter herbs with meals. Bitter herbs can stimulate digestion and change stomach acid levels, possibly lowering the chances of a future acne outbreak. Most extracts will have the appropriate dosage listed on the bottle. Some examples of bitter herbs include dandelion leaf and root, yarrow, wormwood, and gentian. Always consume bitter herbs with meals. Try adding dark, bitter greens to your meals or salads. For example, adding arugula can be a simple way to consume more bitters. Eating some dandelion leaves with your meal can be a simple way to add bitters to your meal. Many acne treatments may help reduce the effects of an outbreak, but can be harmful or rough on your skin. Using rhassoul clay may help to reduce the chances of future outbreaks without causing additional damage. Try applying some rhassoul clay to affected areas to help slow down oil production and possibly even prevent further outbreaks. Mix 1 teaspoon (about 3.5 g) of rhassoul clay with warm water to create a paste. This can be worn as a face mask. You can try mixing other herbs into the clay for a greater effect. Green tea leaves can be a good addition if your face is oily. Adding chamomile can help with redness. Try to use rhassoul clay daily. Remove it if your skin starts to feel dry or tight. Your diet has a wide range of effects on your health and wellbeing. Diet can also have an effect on how likely you are to have an acne outbreak. Making some simple changes to your diet can be a natural way for you to lower the severity and frequency of acne outbreaks. Keep some of the following ideas in mind when reviewing your diet: Try to steer clear of processed foods. Eat more whole foods instead, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Lower your intake of dairy products. Foods that are high in carbohydrates may trigger acne outbreaks. These include things like bread and pasta. . Stress may also cause acne outbreaks, so it is important to keep your stress under control. Whenever possible, try to reduce the amount of stress in your daily life to help lessen the severity of any acne problem. You might try meditation or exercise to lower stress. Going for a peaceful walk outdoors can be a good way to relax. If possible, avoid any situations that you find stressful.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A lack of orexin is thought to be the cause of narcolepsy for most cases. You may be able to naturally boost production in your body by exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet, and reducing inflammation in your body. Some easy ways to increase this chemical in your body include: Buying bright lights for your home. Eating fermented food and drinks such as Kombucha Identifying food allergies that may be causing inflammation Going outside Diet can affect symptoms of narcolepsy. Eating a healthy diet, low in heavy foods, can result in symptoms improving. Keep a food diary to help you track how certain foods affect your symptoms. Heavy meals should be avoided. Try to eat 5 to 6 small, light meals throughout the day instead of 3 heavier meals. Foods with a low glycemic index, such as white breads and processed foods, can cause a temporary spike in insulin that results in fatigue shortly after meals. These types of foods can make anyone drowsy, but the effect can be more intense if you suffer from narcolepsy. Try to focus on eating vegetables and sources of lean protein, such as eggs or meat. Large meals eaten 3 to 4 hours before bedtime can cause indigestion which can affect your ability to sleep. Try to keep late light meals light and healthy. An autoimmune diet, such as the paleo diet, may benefit people with narcolepsy since autoimmunity is thought to be a cause of narcolepsy. These substances can be very disruptive for sleep. Try to minimize use if you suffer from narcolepsy. Smoking can be particularly dangerous if you suffer from narcolepsy. Not only is nicotine a stimulant, it can be very dangerous to fall asleep with a cigarette in hand. Many people with narcolepsy feel smoking helps them stay alert throughout the day, but cigarettes are best avoided if you have narcolepsy. Alcohol can help you fall asleep faster, but the sleep you get will be less restful. Less restful sleep can result in fatigue during the day. Even moderate alcohol consumption can be discouraged if you have narcolepsy. Caffeine is often used by narcoleptics to manage feelings of fatigue throughout the day. However, caffeine does not replace sleep. It merely alters brain waves to block sleep inducing chemicals from entering the brain. As caffeine stays in the body for about six hours, keep caffeine consumption light and only drink, coffee, soda or energy drinks early in the day. Exercising can help you to stay alert, awake and focused. Exercising 3 or 4 times a week for 30 to 40 minutes can help with your sleep schedule. However, as exercise produces adrenaline avoid working out 3 to 4 hours before bedtime. Try low intensity activities like yoga, Tai Chi, or Qi-gong at night. These can help calm down your central nervous system. Stress can exacerbate symptoms of narcolepsy. Trying to keep your stress levels under control can result in a lessening of symptoms. There are a variety of activities you can participate in that result in a reduction of stress. Practicing breathing exercises. There are certain deep breathing exercises designed to slow heart rate and other physical symptoms of stress. Meditate. Meditation can help reduce stress by placing your thoughts in the present moment. Meditating each day can help with symptoms of narcolepsy. Try yoga. Practicing yoga gets all of the parts of your body to work together and can help clear your mind. Yoga has the added benefit of being a form of exercise, which can help regulate your sleep schedule. Narcolepsy is a chronic condition that can be difficult to manage. People suffering from narcolepsy often develop psychiatric problems, like depression and anxiety, as a result of their disorder. Seeing a therapist can help you manage the emotional toll of narcolepsy. You should also have a team of doctors to help you manage the physical aspects of your narcolepsy. You may want to have a team of practitioners that includes a primary care provider, neurologist, nutritionist, and therapist. Ask your regular doctor for a referral for a therapist if you're experiencing a chronic low or anxious mood as a result of your narcolepsy. If you're a student, you may be entitled to free counseling from your college or university. Look out for support groups, whether online or in person as well. As narcolepsy is not a well understood disorder, many people feel isolated or frustrated. Talking to others who've experienced similar issues can help. Summary:","completion":"Narcolepsy is when people feel very sleepy and might fall asleep suddenly. To help with this, it is important to exercise, eat healthy food, avoid heavy meals, and try not to eat too much sugar. Also, try not to smoke, drink alcohol, or have too much caffeine. Doing relaxing activities like yoga and meditation can help reduce stress and make people with narcolepsy feel better.

The English Premier League has decided to dispense with the traditional pre-match handshakes before Sunday's clash between Chelsea and Queens Park Rangers due to the legal case involving John Terry and Anton Ferdinand. Chelsea captain Terry is accused of racially abusing QPR defender Ferdinand during a match between the two teams at Loftus Road back in October. At a preliminary hearing in February, Terry's lawyer entered a not guilty plea and the judge decided to adjourn the case until July 9 -- after the Euro 2012 finals. After the case was put back, Terry was stripped of the England captaincy, triggering the turn of events that eventually led to Fabio Capello's resignation as coach. But ahead of the two players coming face-to-face at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge stadium, the Premier League has decided to abandon their usual pre-match ritual, given the legal complexities involved. A statement on their official website read: \\"The Premier League position on the pre-match handshake convention remains consistent. In all normal circumstances it must be observed. \\"However, after discussions with both Chelsea and Queens Park Rangers about the potential and specific legal context in relation to John Terry and Anton Ferdinand the decision has been taken to suspend the handshake convention for Sunday's match.\\" When the teams met in the English FA Cup in January, the Football Association dispensed with the pre-match handshake to \\"diffuse further tensions.\\" The handshake ritual caused huge controversy earlier in the Premier League season when Liverpool's Uruguayan striker Luis Suarez refused to shake the hand of Manchester United's French defender Patrice Evra. This was after Suarez had been banned for eight games by the Football Association after being found guilty of racially abusing Evra in an earlier match. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson called Suarez a \\"disgrace\\" after the game. The striker later apologized, as did his club. Terry has remained Chelsea captain and was part of the side that made it into the European Champions League final at the expense of Barcelona on Tuesday, though he was sent off for an off the ball incident and will miss the final against Bayern Munich on May 19.

Given the two facts above, flooding can cause what to leave an environment? Select from: a). fish b). animals c). ducks d). plants e). threatened f). kill them g). Sediment h). coastlines The answer is:","completion":"b). animals Flooding can cause animals to leave an environment because of various reasons. As the most common natural disaster, flooding can significantly impact ecosystems and the animals that inhabit them. When a flood occurs, it can lead to habitat loss or degradation, making it difficult for animals to survive in their usual environment. Flooding can also cause animals to seek higher ground, moving them into unfamiliar territories and causing stress due to new surroundings, competition for resources, and potential exposure to new predators. Additionally, the increased water level can lead to a decline in water quality, affecting aquatic life. Furthermore, certain species, such as fish and ducks, may be less affected by flooding than others due to their adaptation to water environments. However, it is still essential to recognize that flooding can impact a broad range of animals, covering species from different habitats such as terrestrial, aquatic, and even aerial species. Although some animals have evolved to cope with the changes brought about by flooding, for more vulnerable and less adaptable species, flooding events can lead to significant displacements and even death. Overall, flooding can cause animals to leave an environment, facing various challenges that may jeopardize their survival and long-term stability of the ecosystem.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Asus: iPad Rivals On The Way With just a few days remaining before Apple's first tablet computer hits stores, iPad hype is at a fever pitch. But on a recent visit to the U.S. Jonney Shih, chairman of Apple competitor Asus, was his usual tranquil self. The likely reason for Shih's calm? Asus is about to roll out its own iPad rivals. In an interview with Forbes, Shih revealed that Asus is planning to release \\"at least two\\" tablet PCs in the coming months. The Computex trade show in June is a good bet for the debut. Asus has long used the Taipei conference to unveil significant new products, including its original Eee PC netbook in 2007. Shih, who is widely credited with introducing the masses to netbooks, said he is still enthusiastic about the lightweight, low-cost portable computers that helped propel Asus' growth over the past two-and-a-half years. But he also sees a market for an iPad-like device from Asus. \\"Netbooks are the best combination of personal computing and cloud computing,\\" Shih said. \\"But between netbooks and smartphones and e-readers, we think there will be a space for something like a tablet or slate PC.\\" The company's aim, however, is not to make an iPad clone. Shih said one Asus tablet will likely run Google ( GOOG - news - people ) software, such as the upcoming open-source operating system, Chrome, or the mobile operating system, Android. The other will probably be based on Microsoft's ( MSFT - news - people ) Windows platform. The flexible approach will differentiate Asus' products, noted Shih. \\"There will be an Apple ( AAPL - news - people ) camp [in tablets], but Asus always tries to address the open camps of Google and Microsoft,\\" he said. Like the iPad, however, Asus' tablets will emphasize multimedia capability. \\"Content will play a very important role on tablets,\\" said Shih. \\"The Google tablet will have a lot of media.\\" It may seem like folly for Asus to challenge mighty Apple, but for the past three years the electronics maker has been polishing its brand and enhancing its design to take on better-known competitors. \\"Asus' culture originated from an engineering spirit with a focus on fundamentals and results,\\" explained Shih. \\"But a good engineer also has to master theory, architecture, innovation and aesthetics.\\" Analysts, including IDC's PC research manager Richard Shim, point to this shift in describing Asus as an up-and-comer. \\"They can do the value stuff, but are also exploring segments that are higher margin and have more advanced features,\\" said Shim. Shih is counting on these new initiatives to boost Asus, currently the number-six PC maker, to number three by the end of this year and number three by the end of 2011. Tablets are only part of the plan. In early March Asus showed off its first electronic reader, the 9-inch DR-900. The company has also created an unusual gadget--essentially a computer embedded in a full-size keyboard--called the Eee Keyboard that it expects to begin selling in April. And it is producing phones for U.S. consumers through a partnership with GPS productmaker Garmin ( GRMN - news - people ). Shih personally carries one of these Asus-made Garmin handsets. Even as new projects beckon, Eee PCs remain a big focus. Asus says it continues to work on making the devices thinner, more reliable and more battery-efficient and is expanding the line, known for its casual, intuitive software, to be more business-oriented. \\"The netbook market is getting more mature, so segmentation is more important,\\" said Shih. \\"We're trying to address more commercial customers.\\" Asus now asks its employees to follow \\"human-centered design thinking\\" called STS across all its products. The approach stresses a transition from thinking about device features or \\"specs\\" to \\"scenarios,\\" meaning how a consumer will actually use the product. The strategy inspired Asus to bulk up its audio technology staff while developing its NX90 laptop, a sleek, aluminum-covered device meant to serve as a multimedia hub in a living room. These employees, known internally as the \\"Golden Ear Team,\\" fine-tuned the notebook's audio-frequency software so that someone listening to classical music would be able to easily follow the strains of a violin, if desired. After it conquers the living room Asus wants to place its products throughout consumers' homes. \\"There will be many different form factors, depending on different scenarios,\\" said Shih. \\"We're interested in making anything that can improve your life experience.\\" Summary:","completion":"Taiwanese tech giant Asus is planning to launch at least two tablet computers in the coming months to rival Apple's iPad.

It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River.

In his first reaction, reaction A, he uses sodium oxide as the reactant in the form of small particles. In his second reaction, reaction B, he uses sodium oxide as the reactant in the form of large chunks of material. Both reactions use the same total weight of sodium oxide. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which reaction, reaction A or reaction B, will occur at a faster rate? Hint: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants.

Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe's southwestern extremity. The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves, is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts.

His father helped him set up his private practice by contacting Gardiner Greene Hubbard, the president of the Clarke School for the Deaf for a recommendation. Teaching his father's system, in October 1872, Alexander Bell opened his \\"School of Vocal Physiology and Mechanics of Speech\\" in Boston, which attracted a large number of deaf pupils, with his first class numbering 30 students. While he was working as a private tutor, one of his most famous pupils was Helen Keller, who came to him as a young child unable to see, hear, or speak. She was later to say that Bell dedicated his life to the penetration of that \\"inhuman silence which separates and estranges.\\" In 1893, Keller performed the sod-breaking ceremony for the construction of the new Bell's new Volta Bureau, dedicated to \\"the increase and diffusion of knowledge relating to the deaf\\".

He shows that they were not just painted by a contemplative monk in a peaceful monastery. They were painted in the midst of the bustling life and terrible cruelty of medieval Russia, a land of ignorant peasants, cruel princes and Tartars invading thrice a year.Part I (86 mins.)Chapter 1 Hot-Air BalloonChapter 2 The Buffoon, 1400 AD. The opening image is of three monks who set off for Moscow across a harvested field: Kirill, Andrei and Danila. They take shelter from a rainstorm in a barn/inn. There, a buffoon is entertaining peasants with a song mocking the local boyar (lord). Then, some soldiers come and arrest the buffoon.Chapter 3 Theophanes the Greek, 1405 AD. This begins with the grisly scene of a man shouting as he is dragged to the wheel to be broken. The scene ends with the gory aftermath: the bloodied body lying on the wheel. An artistic discussion occurs between Theophanes the Greek and Father Kirill. Theophanes asks him to become his assistant. Kirill says he will, if the master will come to the monastery and ask for him personally, in front of all the monks. To his bitter disappointment, he sends someone else, to ask for Andrei instead. Andrei agrees to go, but Danila refuses, when Andrei asks him to accompany him. Andrei is devastated. The next morning, he goes to Danilas cell and confesses, We have shared the same cell for years. I cant paint without you. I look with your eyes; I listen with your ears. Danila replies with tears in his eyes, You silly man, go with my blessing! Andrei kneels and kisses Danila's hand. Meanwhile, Father Kirill leaves the monastery in disgust, past a huge wall of logs, shouting You brood of vipers! You have made his temple a den of thieves.Chapter 4 The Passion according to Andrei, 1406 AD The chapter opens with Father Andrei walking through a forest with his apprentice, Foma.

Summarize this article in one sentence. This is standard procedure. Your parent or legal guardian will need to call the school and explain that you cannot or will not be coming in that day. Most schools only require your parent or legal guardian to say that you will not be coming into class that day. Some stricter schools, however, might require a specific excuse, so be sure to check your school’s handbook. The idea behind this practice is to reduce the amount of unexcused absences and to keep tabs on the sorts of illnesses going around. Many schools require a parent or legal guardian of a student to call in regardless of that student's age, but some will allow a student who is a legal adult (age 18 or older) to make the phone call on his or her own behalf. For prolonged periods of illness, your school might require you, a parent, a guardian, or a family member to bring a signed doctor's note stating that you are legitimately ill and needing more time to recover. A physician's note becomes necessary after your illness extends beyond a certain period of time. The exact amount of time can vary by district, so you will need to check your school's rules to know at what point the note becomes a necessity.

They are not true bone structures but they usually grow in symmetrical pairs. In most species, only the male grows antlers and the antlers primarily function in sexual selection as attractions to females and as weapons in fights for control of harems. In many temperate zone species, antlers are shed and regrow each year, while horns are permanent. - Deer (singular and plural) are the ruminant mammals forming the family Cervidae. The two main groups are the Cervinae, including the muntjac, the fallow deer and the chital, and the Capreolinae, including the elk, reindeer (caribou), the Western roe deer, and the Eurasian elk (moose). Female reindeer, and male deer of all species (except the Chinese water deer), grow and shed new antlers each year. In this they differ from permanently horned antelope, which are in the same order, Artiodactyla. - The Capreolinae, Odocoileinae, or the New World deer are a subfamily of deer. Alternatively, they are known as the telemetacarpal deer, due to their bone structure being different from the plesiometacarpal deer subfamily Cervinae. The telemetacarpal deer maintain their distal lateral metacarpals, while the plesiometacarpal deer maintain only their proximal lateral metacarpals. The Capreolinae are believed to have originated in the Late Miocene, between 7.7 and 11.5 million years ago, in central Asia. - The chital or cheetal (\\"Axis axis\\"), also known as spotted deer or axis deer, is a deer found in the Indian subcontinent. The species was first described by German naturalist Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in 1777. A moderate-sized deer, male chital reach nearly and females at the shoulder. While males weigh , the lighter females weigh . The species is sexually dimorphic: males are larger than females, and antlers are present only on males. The upper parts are golden to rufous, completely covered in white spots. The abdomen, rump, throat, insides of legs, ears and tail are all white. The antlers, three-pronged, are nearly long. - The European roe deer (\\"Capreolus capreolus\\"), also known as the western roe deer, \\"chevreuil\\", or simply roe deer, is an Eurasian species of deer. The male of the species is sometimes referred to as a roebuck. The roe deer is relatively small, reddish and grey-brown, and well-adapted to cold environments. The species is widespread in Europe, from the Mediterranean to Scandinavia and from Britain to the Caucasus. It is distinct from the somewhat larger Siberian roe deer. - Cephenemyiini is a tribe within the family Oestridae which includes large flies , parasitic on deer and related ungulates . Tribe Cephenemyiini Genus Cephenemyia Latreille , 1818 C. apicata Bennett and Sabrosky , 1962 C. auribarbis ( Meigen , 1824 ) C. grandis C. jellisoni Townsend , 1941 C. kaplanovi C. macrostis Brauer , 1863 C. phobifer ( Clark , 1815 ) C. pratti ( Clark , 1815 ) C. stimulator Hunter , 1916 C. trompe ( Modeer , 1786 ) C. ulrichii Brauer , 1863 Genus Pharyngomyia Schiner , 1861 P. picta ( Meigen , 1824 ) - Muntjacs, also known as barking deer and Mastreani deer, are small deer of the genus \\"Muntiacus\\". Muntjacs are the oldest known deer, thought to have begun appearing 1535 million years ago, with remains found in Miocene deposits in France, Germany and Poland. - The elk, or wapiti (\\"Cervus canadensis\\"), is one of the largest species within the deer family, Cervidae, in the world, and one of the largest land mammals in North America and Eastern Asia. This animal should not be confused with the still larger moose (\\"Alces alces\\") to which the name \\"elk\\" applies in British English and in reference to populations in Eurasia. Apart from the moose, the only other member of the deer family to rival the elk in size is the south Asian sambar (\\"Rusa unicolor\\"). - The water deer (\\"Hydropotes inermis\\") is a small deer superficially more similar to a musk deer than a true deer. Native to China and Korea, there are two subspecies: the Chinese water deer (\\"Hydropotes inermis inermis\\") and the Korean water deer (\\"Hydropotes inermis argyropus\\"). Despite its lack of antlers and certain other anatomical anomaliesincluding a pair of prominent tusks (downward-pointing canine teeth), it is classified as a cervid. Its unique anatomical characteristics have caused it to be classified in its own genus (Hydropotes) as well as its own subfamily (Hydropotinae). However, a study of mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences placed it near \\"Capreolus\\" within an Old World section of the subfamily Capreolinae. Its prominent tusks (elongated canines), similar to those of musk deer, have led to both being colloquially named vampire deer in English-speaking areas to which they have been imported. The species is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - The reindeer (\\"Rangifer tarandus\\"), also known as caribou in North America, is a species of deer with circumpolar distribution, native to Arctic, Subarctic, tundra, boreal and mountainous regions of northern Europe, Siberia, and North America. This includes both sedentary and migratory populations. - The fallow deer (\\"Dama dama\\") is a ruminant mammal belonging to the family Cervidae. This common species is native to western Eurasia, but has been introduced to Antigua & Barbuda, Argentina, South Africa, Fernando Pó, São Tomé, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte, Réunion, Seychelles, Comoro Islands, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Cyprus, Israel, Cape Verde, Lebanon, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, the Falkland Islands and Peru. Some taxonomers include the rarer Persian fallow deer as a subspecies (\\"D. d. mesopotamica\\"), while others treat it as an entirely different species (\\"D. mesopotamica\\"). - The Cervinae or the Old World deer (denoting their place of origin, not their current distribution), are a subfamily of deer. Alternatively, they are known as the plesiometacarpal deer, due to their ankle structure being different from the telemetecarpal deer of the Capreolinae. - An antelope is a member of a number of even-toed ungulate species indigenous to various regions in Africa and Eurasia. Antelopes comprise a wastebasket taxon (miscellaneous group) within the family Bovidae, encompassing those Old World species that are not cattle, sheep, buffalo, bison, or goats.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Place your pattern onto your chosen material and outline the edges of the panel. Before cutting any material, understand that the edges of each panel will need to be stuck together and then sewn. Once you have outlined your pattern onto your material, including battens and seams, you may now cut out your pattern. When creating a seam with shape, you want the shape to be about 35% from the luff. Move from panel to panel while leaving extra cloth at the external edges of the sail. It’s best to trim and adjust the sail shape once all panels are sewn together. Stick and sew two panels at a time until the sail is all in one piece. You can now trim it to your design on the table and draw on the batten pockets. Using dacron tape or reinforced monofilm tape, reinforce the seams. You can also glue a layer of cloth on either side of the material for added strength. There will be a high degree of force applied to these areas so ensure that they can withstand that amount of tension. Depending on the type of sail, attach the luff once you have dealt with the batten pockets. Measure the width of existing sails and adjust your sail accordingly. Sleeves can either be a single piece or made from a number of pieces of material but ensure that the head is reinforced and capable to withstand the strain from the mast tip. Create your sleeve so it fits down to the foot batten. Create an adjustable head for your sleeve if this is your first attempt at a sail. Use pulleys from old sails or get them from a sail maker.","completion":"The article provides a step-by-step guide on creating a custom sail, including outlining and cutting patterns, sewing panels together, reinforcing seams, and attaching luff and sleeves, while ensuring the sail can withstand the necessary tension and strain."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text. Q: By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor It will follow a current trial in which World Cup football matches are being shown via iPlayer using the next-generation TV technologies. However, this time the BBC also plans to make select matches available in 4K - but not HDR - to Sky Q customers. One expert said the tech offered huge benefits but had not been glitch-free. \\"The World Cup streams have suffered a few technical teething problems - stuttering and buffering with some devices,\\" said John Archer, a TV reviewer for Forbes and Techradar. \\"[There have also been] a few issues with adapting effectively to broadband speeds that are close to the BBC's 40Mbps and 20Mbps streaming quality 'tiers'. \\"When the streams have worked well, though, the results have been spectacular.\\" The reaction on social media has also been largely positive, although some have reported problems. \\"The trial has given us valuable feedback allowing us to improve our systems,\\" said a BBC spokesman. PlayStation Pro Once again, the BBC intends to offer the trial on a \\"first-come first-served\\" basis, saying it will be limited to \\"tens of thousands of people\\" to help deal with the extra bandwidth required. Few, if any, people have found themselves blocked, however, from accessing the ultra-high definition World Cup games. A list of compatible TVs and set-top boxes is being maintained online. Although it is not mentioned yet, support for the PlayStation Pro was recently added, although it only screens the World Cup games in 4K and not HDR. The Sky Q coverage will be limited to the men's and ladies' singles semi-final and final matches and will be delivered via satellite rather than the internet. Users will be given the option to access the Ultra HD feed via a pop-up message. Brighter, sharper The term 4K refers to the fact that an image contains four times as many pixels as a 1080p high definition picture. This can reveal details that would otherwise be difficult to pick out. During Wimbledon, this could potentially make it easier to see whether close-call shots are in or out and help viewers recognise famous faces in the crowd. HDR takes advantage of the fact modern TVs can go brighter and/or darker than they used to, providing a greater dynamic range. It can help reveal detail in the shadows and prevent highlights from \\"blowing out\\". In addition, HDR adopts a \\"wider colour space\\", meaning millions more colours can be displayed if the screen used is classed as \\"10-bit\\" or above. At Wimbledon, late-day games - when shadows can creep across courts creating exposure problems if other parts are still bathed in sunlight - in particular should benefit from HDR's better handling of contrast. For movies and drama-based TV shows, many experts have judged HDR to offer the greater benefit over 4K. But Mr Archer said he had found the opposite to be true during the World Cup tests, at least on larger screens. \\"Detail and sharpness have been hugely superior to the HD broadcast streams, making the action feel more immediate and much less tiring to watch,\\" he said. \\"Being able to see more of the pitch via the 4K camera is also a great feature for serious football fans. \\"The use of HDR has been quite subtle by comparison, but has still undoubtedly enhanced the sense of 'being there' that's so important when you're watching sport.\\" The Wimbledon Championships begin on 2 July.

Given the question: Expressing yourself in public without wearing pants will likely result in what? - happiness - blank stares - communication - getting arrested - stage fright The best answer is The answer is:","completion":"Getting arrested Expressing yourself in public without wearing pants refers to exposing oneself indecently in a public area, which is considered a violation of public decency laws in most jurisdictions. While the reactions of others to such behavior may vary – and could include happiness, blank stares, communication, or stage fright – the most significant and probable outcome would be getting arrested. When a person engages in indecent exposure, they knowingly and intentionally display their private parts in a public setting where such conduct is likely to be observed by others who would be offended or alarmed by the act. This behavior is typically prohibited by law, as it goes against the societal norms and expectations of maintaining a reasonable level of public decency. The specific consequences of this action depend on the jurisdiction in which it occurs, but in many places, it constitutes a criminal offense. Consequences might include arrests, fines, probation, or even jail time if the individual is a repeat offender or the circumstances are especially egregious. Additionally, if one is convicted of indecent exposure, they may be required to register as a sex offender, depending on the jurisdiction and the severity of the offense. It is essential to note that the reactions of others to someone not wearing pants in public may indeed vary. Some people might find it amusing (happiness), while others could simply be confused and not know how to react (blank stares). There may also be those who try to communicate their disapproval or concern to the individual (communication). However, even in cases where bystanders do not express their discomfort or alarm, law enforcement officers would likely still take action to enforce public decency laws. In the case of stage fright, this response might not be relevant as a consequence of expressing oneself without wearing pants in public, but it might be a potential side effect experienced by the individual, especially if they are confronted or challenged by onlookers or authorities due to their indecent exposure. In conclusion, the best answer to the question of what would likely result from expressing oneself in public without wearing pants is getting arrested, as it is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. Other possible responses such as happiness, blank stares, communication, or stage fright may also occur, but the legal and societal consequences of indecent exposure take precedence over these reactions."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Together with his dim-witted sidekick, Dip (Dan Moran), they celebrate with some prostitutes â George is ecstatic when treated to the oral talents of Glorice (Candis Cayne), the new girl on the docks. When they realize they've forgotten mob boss Joey \\"The Heart\\" Aorta's (Tony Sirico) birthday, George suggests a date with the beautiful Glorice. But the date doesn't go well, and Aorta ends up with plate of spaghetti on his head. Fortunately, Aorta likes Glorice's tough style, and George and Dip celebrate. Their festivities are cut short when they discover that Glorice is a transsexual woman. The two try introducing Aorta to other women, but none can match up to Glorice because, as Aorta says, \\"She's got balls\\". The Mafia Don even thanks George with a kiss, and George panics, thinking he's received the ominous \\"Kiss of Death\\". But his fear is unfounded as Aorta promotes George to consigliere and throws him a party with a cake made by Mickey the Baker (Gerry Cooney). As the assistant and new friend to the boss, George is forced to drive the two on a date which ends with Aorta on the receiving end of Glorice's oral talents. Aorta announces his engagement to Glorice with George to be best man, and the beautiful moll reveals to George her plan of blackmail. So George decides to hire hitman Briles (Jerry Grayson), an expert assassin. But he fails when Glorice recognizes the hitman as a long-lost uncle, and the hitman is unwilling to kill a nephew in a dress. George, dejected, walks the streets when he's suddenly tackled by a draft detective. George proves his undraftable 4-F status by showing his flat feet.

The following article contains an answer for the question: Where did the man who took the Karluk into the ice organize a march to? , can you please find it? The last voyage of the Karluk, flagship of the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913–16, ended with the loss of the ship in the Arctic seas, and the subsequent deaths of nearly half her complement of 25. In August 1913, Karluk, a brigantine formerly used as a whaler, became trapped in the ice while sailing to a rendezvous point at Herschel Island. After a long drift across the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, in January 1914 the ship was crushed and sunk. In the ensuing months, the crew and expedition staff struggled to survive, first on the ice and later on the shores of Wrangel Island. In all, eleven men died before rescue. The Canadian Arctic Expedition was organised under the leadership of Canadian anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and had both scientific and geographic purposes. Shortly after Karluk was trapped, Stefansson and a small party left the ship, stating that they intended to hunt for caribou. However, the ice carried Karluk westwards, far from the hunting party who found it impossible to return to the ship. Stefansson reached land and then devoted himself to the expedition's scientific objectives, leaving the crew and staff on board the ship under the charge of its captain, Robert Bartlett. After the sinking, Bartlett organised a march across the ice to Wrangel Island, 80 miles (130 km) away. Conditions were difficult and dangerous; two four-man parties were lost before the island was reached. From the island, Bartlett and an Inuk companion set out across the frozen sea for the Siberian coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent. Before their eventual rescue in September 1914, three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances; 14 were rescued. Historians have divided views on Stefansson's decision to leave the ship. Some of the...

Choices: - pollutants - catalysts - carcinogens - mutagens A:","completion":"The term for environmental causes of mutations is \\"mutagens.\\" Mutagens are substances or agents that can cause an increase in the rate of genetic mutations in an organism's DNA. These environmental factors can interfere with the normal replication or repair of DNA, leading to errors in the genetic code and potentially affecting an organism's phenotype, health, or other characteristics. Mutagens can be classified into two main categories: chemical mutagens and physical mutagens. 1. Chemical mutagens: These are chemicals or compounds that can directly or indirectly cause genetic mutations. Some examples of chemical mutagens include: a. Alkylating agents: These chemicals can donate an alkyl group to the DNA molecule, leading to mistakes in DNA replication or repair. Examples include certain chemotherapeutic agents, mustard gas, and some industrial chemicals. b. Base analogs: These are chemicals that resemble the natural building blocks of DNA (known as nucleotide bases) and can be mistakenly incorporated into the DNA molecule during replication. Examples include the drug 5-bromouracil, which acts as a base analog for thymine. c. Deaminating agents: These chemicals can remove the amino group from the basic structure of a nucleotide, causing it to be misread during replication or repair. An example of this is nitrous acid. d. Intercalating agents: These molecules can insert themselves between the stacked bases of the DNA double helix, causing insertions or deletions of base pairs. Examples include ethidium bromide and certain chemotherapeutic agents, such as doxorubicin. 2. Physical mutagens: These are agents that can cause mutations through physical interactions or by inducing chemical changes in the DNA molecule. Examples of physical mutagens include: a. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation: UV light can cause the formation of pyrimidine dimers within DNA, leading to replication errors and potential mutations. b. Ionizing radiation: X-rays, gamma rays, and other forms of ionizing radiation can damage the DNA molecule by inducing the formation of reactive chemical species or by causing breaks in the phosphate backbone. This can lead to mutations during DNA replication or repair. c. High temperatures: Exposure to high temperatures may cause DNA to denature or replicate incorrectly, leading to potential mutations. In addition to these two main categories, there are also some biological agents, such as certain viruses and bacteria, that can induce genetic mutations in host organisms. These agents are known as transposons or \\"jumping genes\\" and can insert themselves into the host genome, potentially causing mutations or altering gene expression. It is important to note that not all mutagens are harmful to an organism. Some mutations can be neutral or even beneficial, depending on the specific change and the organism's environment. However, some mutagens are also carcinogens, meaning they can cause cancer by inducing mutations in the DNA of a cell that lead to uncontrolled cell growth and the formation of tumors. For this reason, it is crucial to understand and manage exposure to mutagens and their potential impacts on human health and the environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A large tumor had formed on the bottom of one lung, they found 4 tumors in her brain, another large one in her stomach and several more throughout her intestinal track. She rarely complained about physical problems and I knew something was wrong when she said she needed to go to the hospital ER. She died exactly 30 days later.

I stayed in the hospital with her because it seemed like every week I would have to take her in for something that required a 3 or 4 day stay. And the final trip to the ER was May 1st. An MRI showed that one of the tumors in her intestines had torn a hole in her bowel. The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends.

These people were part of \\"foraging societies.\\" Foraging means looking for food, like picking berries or nuts from plants in the forest. These people didn't have big stores or restaurants like we do now, so they had to find their food outside. Can you believe that the people in Peru used to chew on leaves called \\"coca leaves?\\" Yes! Scientists have found new special clues called \\"archaeological evidence,\\" which tells us about the things that happened a long, long time ago. So, what are coca leaves, and why did people chew them? Coca leaves come from a plant called the coca plant, which grows in places like Peru. These leaves may look like regular leaves from other plants, but they have special features! When people chew coca leaves, they start to feel more awake and full of energy, which we call \\"alertness.\\" This can be very helpful when people need to work hard for a long time, like when they have to climb mountains or walk long distances to find food. Isn't it amazing how something as simple as a leaf can do so much for people? The archaeological evidence helps us learn about how people from a long, long time ago, like those who lived in foraging societies, used natural things around them to have more energy and make their lives better. So, the next time you see a leaf on a tree, remember that even thousands of years ago, people in Peru used special leaves like coca leaves to help them stay active and find their food. And this might make you curious about what other things from nature we still use today!"},{"prompt":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: In the opening scene, a woman named Ruth is walking her dog on Los Angeles, California's Venice Beach, and is suddenly pulled under the sand of the deserted beach by an unseen force. The woman's screams for help are heard by Harry Caulder, a harbor patrol officer who is swimming nearby. Harry reports Ruth's disappearance to two LAPD detectives, Royko and Piantadosi, who claim that without a body, there is little they can do. The next day, Ruth's estranged daughter, Catherine, arrives from San Francisco after Harry calls her regarding her mother's disappearance. Meanwhile, the mysterious and crazed Mrs. Selden, who resides in an abandoned section of the Santa Monica Amusement Pier, witnesses the attack and disappearance (and others throughout the film), but does not come forward. That night, while staying in Ruth's house, Catherine hears Ruth's dog barking on the beach near the location where Ruth disappeared. Catherine investigates and finds the dog beheaded, near a small sinkhole. Royko and Piantadosi, as well as Harry, are called to the scene, but police pathologist Dr. Dimitrious cannot accurately determine a cause of death for the dog.

The next morning, a teenage girl is buried in the sand at the beach, and begins screaming. Her friends pull her out of the sand, only to see that her legs have been injured from an attack by an unseen creature.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Settlement in Apple Case Over E-Books Is Approved A federal judge on Friday approved a settlement in which Apple could begin paying 400 million to as many as 23 million consumers related to charges that it violated antitrust law by conspiring with publishers to raise e-book prices and thwart efforts by Amazon. In the hearing on Friday, Judge Denise L. Cote of Federal District Court in Manhattan approved an unusual settlement reached this summer in which Apple agreed to pay 400 million to consumers in cash and e-book credits, and 50 million to lawyers. Those figures could still change, however, if an appeals court overturns a 2013 verdict in the case, in which Apple was found to have conspired with five major publishers to fix the price of e-books. The court, which will hear Apple’s challenge on Dec. 15, is not expected to change its previous ruling. In the event the court overturns the verdict and returns the case to Judge Cote, Apple would pay 50 million to consumers and 20 million to the lawyers. Apple initially agreed to pay up to 400 million to settle the class action in June, ahead of a damages trial set for two months later in which attorneys general in 33 states and class-action lawyers were expected to seek up to 840 million. In the hearing, Judge Cote called the deal an “unusually structured settlement, especially for one arrived at on the eve of trial.” The Justice Department initiated the suit in 2012. The settlement appeared to reflect fatigue by Apple, the Justice Department, state attorneys general and class-action lawyers eager to conclude a case that has dragged on, largely because of delays by Apple. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the deal. The suit accused Apple of being a “ringmaster” of a conspiracy with the five major publishers to raise the average price of e-books from the 9.99 price that Amazon had made standard for new e-book releases. Simon & Schuster, HarperCollins and the Hachette Book Group settled the day the case was filed; Penguin and Macmillan settled months later. The 400 million will be paid on top of earlier settlements with publishers in the case, which provided 166 million in damages for consumers of e-books. The government’s lawsuit focused on 2010, when Apple entered the digital book industry with the introduction of the iPad and the iBookstore. At that time, publishers’ agreements to sell e-books were made under the so-called wholesale model of print books; publishers charged retailers about half the cover price for a book, and the retailers then set their own prices. But with the iPad and iBookstore, Apple offered publishers a new business model. The government said Apple’s co-founder and then chief, Steve Jobs, persuaded publishers to agree to the so-called agency model for selling books, which let publishers set their own prices for e-books. The case was first tried before Judge Cote in July 2013. In her verdict, she concluded that Apple had been fully aware of the publishers’ frustration with Amazon’s pricing of 9.99 for new releases because it was eroding the perceived value of their books. She said Apple used that leverage, combined with a tight deadline for the introduction of the iPad, to pressure publishers into agreeing to sell their books through Apple’s iBookstore. “Apple seized the moment and brilliantly played its hand,” Judge Cote wrote in that ruling. Mr. Jobs’s words were resurrected throughout the trial and ultimately proved to be the most damning. The Justice Department presented his statements and emails as crucial evidence of a conspiracy. In one instance, Mr. Jobs made comments to a reporter after he introduced the iPad and the iBookstore in January 2010. When asked why consumers would buy an e-book from Apple’s bookstore instead of Amazon.com, Mr. Jobs replied, “The prices will be the same.” A version of this article appears in print on November 22, 2014, on page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Settlement in Apple Case Over E-Books Is Approved.

Introduction The world of sports has witnessed many extraordinary events, record-breaking achievements, and intense rivalries throughout its existence. From heart-stopping matches to breathtaking finishes, these moments echo through time and are etched into the memories of fans and spectators alike. Among numerous records in sports, the question of the highest halftime score in history has piqued the interest of many. In this article, we will explore various sports and uncover the highest score ever recorded at halftime. Basketball In the sport closest to our headline today, we will look at basketball where a not-so-well-known application of scoring regularly presents new records to challenge previous achievements. NBA: In the history of the NBA, the highest halftime score was registered by the Phoenix Suns on November 10, 1990, against the Denver Nuggets. The Suns managed to score an astounding 107 points by halftime, securing a comfortable lead. By the end of the game, the Suns won 173-143, establishing a memorable moment in NBA history. College Basketball: In NCAA college basketball, the record for the highest halftime score is held by the men's basketball team from Troy State University (now Troy University). On January 12, 1992, during a game against DeVry University, Troy State put up 123 points on the scoreboard by halftime. The game ended with an even more astonishing 258-141 final score, setting the all-time scoring record in college basketball. European Basketball: The highest halftime score in EuroLeague history occurred during the match between CSKA Moscow and Real Madrid on November 15, 2002. CSKA Moscow scored 74 points in the first half and won the game 141-127, breaking the previous EuroLeague halftime record. American Football In American football, scores can be more spread out due to the defensive nature of the game. But that doesn't mean we don't see high halftime scores on occasion. NFL: The Washington Redskins hold the record for the highest halftime score in an NFL game. On November 27, 1966, they scored 45 points in the first half against the New York Giants, eventually winning the match by a whopping 72-41. College Football: In NCAA college football, the highest halftime score is held by the Houston Cougars. They achieved this feat on November 17, 2018, in a game against the Rice Owls. Houston managed to score 59 points in the first half, with the final score being 69-29 in favor of the Cougars. Soccer Soccer, played all around the world, is known for its relatively lower-scoring nature. Nevertheless, high halftime scores still stand out as notable achievements. Premier League: The highest halftime score in Premier League history happened on May 9, 1998, during a match between Newcastle United and Sheffield Wednesday. Going into the half, Newcastle United had scored an incredible 7 goals against their opposition. The final score was 8-0 in favor of Newcastle United. World Cup: The highest halftime score in FIFA World Cup history took place in the 1954 match between Austria and Switzerland. The Austrian national team led 5-3 at halftime and ended up winning the game with a final score of 7-5. Conclusion While different sports have their respective highest halftime scores, it is important to appreciate that these records illustrate the dynamic and unpredictable nature of athletic competition. Each sport mentioned above comes with its unique definition of what constitutes a high halftime score, considering playing conditions, team dynamics, and the ever-changing strategies employed by coaching staff. The highest scores at halftime are not only a testament to the skills of the players involved but also how the sports have evolved and achieved new heights over time. As the world of sports continues to progress, we eagerly await the potential toppling of these records in search of even more compelling and unbelievable moments."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

I'm surprised. Why would they want to do that?\\" Investigators spent the morning snapping photos while a police dog sniffed around, looking for the suspect's trail. The cleaning, meanwhile, is being performed by a special historic preservation team. Fortunately, there is no permanent damage. \\"I can tell you it is on the base of the statue. It is also on the lap of the statue. It is not solid, let's put it that way. It is a splatter,\\" said NPS spokeswoman Carol Johnson. This is not the first time vandalism has been reported at the site of one of the National Mall's memorials. Back in 2007, an oily substance was found on the memorial wall of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Police determined the case to be an act of vandalism and not an accident, The Washington Post reported. The removal process took weeks to complete. Two additional incidents of vandalism have been reported at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in the past. In 1993, the directory stands at the entrance of the memorial were burned, and a swastika and scratches were found etched in two of the memorials panels in 1988. Both panels were replaced. Other than those incidents, Johnson said she cannot recall any other cases of vandalism at the National Mall. The Lincoln Memorial, which was dedicated in 1922, is open to the public 24 hours a day. U.S. Park Police Union President Ian Glick released the following statement: \\"This type of reprehensible act is unfortunate but it did not permanently damage the memorial and this incident further underscores the need for the National Park Service to provide more funding and more personnel so as to provide a higher level of deterrence through officer presence.

Independent expenditures are payments made by individuals or entities in support or opposition of a candidate without any coordination with a candidate's campaign. Step 2: Analyze the given information The statement tells us that independent expenditures are not reported to the FEC. This implies that the FEC does not have information on these specific types of expenses. Step 3: Consider the question The question asks if we can conclude that the FEC is receiving expense reports from members of Congress based on this information. To determine this, we need to examine whether the origin of independent expenditures is related to members of Congress reporting their expenses to the FEC. Step 4: Analyze the relationship between independent expenditures and members of Congress reporting expenses Independent expenditures are made without coordination with a candidate's campaign and may not necessarily be paid by members of Congress themselves. Thus, knowing whether independent expenditures are reported to the FEC does not give us enough information to conclude that members of Congress are reporting their expenses to the FEC. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \\"The FEC is receiving expense reports from members of Congress.\\" It is important to have additional information or evidence to support such a conclusion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Most of the issues were fixed after Google notified Samsung, but some have yet to be addressed. One independent expert said the bugs \\"significantly weakened the security\\" of Google's operating system. \\"There is definitely a tension between Google and the handset manufacturers because Google wants to protect its Android brand, and when it comes to security, Android has been quite tarnished,\\" added Dr Steven Murdoch, a security researcher at University College London. \\"Some of that is down to the extra software that handset manufacturers add.\\" A statement from Samsung said the three remaining bugs would be fixed via a security update later this month. \\"Maintaining the trust of our customers is a top priority\\", said the company. Details of the bugs were disclosed by Google's Project Zero team, whose job is to hunt out previously unknown computer security flaws. It said that several of the flaws would have been \\"trivial to exploit\\". \\"Over the course of a week, we found a total of 11 issues with a serious security impact,\\" the team blogged. \\"The majority of these issues were fixed on the device we tested via an OTA [over the air] update within 90 days. \\"It is promising that the highest severity issues were fixed and updated on-device in a reasonable timeframe.\\" Among the vulnerabilities was a weakness found in Samsung's email software that could have allowed hackers to forward a victim's messages to their own account. Another allowed attackers to alter the settings of Samsung's photo-viewing app by sending the handset a specially encoded image. But Google said the most interesting issue was the existence of a \\"directory traversal bug\\" in a wi-fi utility built in to the phone. \\"If someone provided malicious data to the software, they could then change other files on the system and interfere with other functions, in particular security functions,\\" said Dr Murdoch. To do this, he said, a hacker would also need to convince their target to install a malicious app, which might appear to have very limited access to the phone's other functions. But by exploiting the flaw, the malware could then escalate its privileges. \\"This would only happen as part of a chain of events, but eventually it could allow someone to take over the entire phone,\\" Dr Murdoch added. \\"Android tries to have layers of protection, so even if you break past one level of protection there's another one. \\"This removed some quite important layers of that protection.\\" Samsung confirmed it had addressed this particular issue in a security update released last month. \\"Samsung encourages users to keep their software and apps updated at all times,\\" added a spokesman.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: North Sister, also known as \\"Faith\\", is the oldest and most highly eroded of the three, with zigzagging rock pinnacles between glaciers. It is a shield volcano that overlays a more ancient shield volcano named Little Brother. North Sister is 5 miles (8 km) wide, and its summit elevation is 10,090 feet (3,075 m). Consisting primarily of basaltic andesite, it has a more mafic composition than the other two volcanoes. Its deposits are rich in palagonite and red and black cinders, and they are progressively more iron-rich the younger they are. North Sister's lava flows demonstrate similar compositions throughout the mountain's long eruptive history. The oldest lava flows on North Sister have been dated to roughly 311,000 years ago, though the oldest reliably dated deposits are approximately 119,000 years old. Estimates place the volcano's last eruption at 46,000 years ago, in the Late Pleistocene.North Sister possesses more dikes than any similar Cascade peak, caused by lava intruding into pre-existing rocks. Many of these dikes were pushed aside by the intrusion of a 980-foot (300 m)-wide volcanic plug. The dikes and plug were exposed by centuries of erosion. At one point, the volcano stood more than 11,000 feet (3,400 m) high, but erosion reduced this volume by a quarter to a third. The plug is now exposed and forms North Sister's summits at Prouty Peak and the South Horn. answer the following question: What is the alias of the volcano that has deposits rich in palagonite?

To understand electronegativity, it's important first to understand what a \\"bond\\" is. Any two atoms in a molecule that are \\"connected\\" to each other on a molecular diagram are said to have a bond between them. This means that they share a set of two electrons with each atom contributing one electron to the bond. The exact reasons for why atoms share electrons and bond are a little beyond the scope of this article. If you want to learn more, try this article on the bond basics or WikiHow's own How to Study the Nature of the Chemical Bond (Chemistry). When two atoms share a set of two electrons in a bond, they don't always share them equally. When one atom has higher electronegativity than the atom it's bonded to, it pulls the two electrons in the bond closer to itself. An atom with very high electronegativity may pull the electrons all the way to its side of the bond, barely sharing them at all with the other atom. For example, in the molecule NaCl (sodium chloride), the chloride atom has a fairly high electronegativity and the sodium has a fairly low one. Thus, the electrons will get pulled towards the chloride and away from the sodium. An electronegativity table of the elements has the elements arranged exactly like in a periodic table, except that each atom is labeled with its electronegativity. These can be found in a variety of chemical textbooks and technical articles as well as online. Here is a link to an excellent electronegativity table. Note that this uses the Pauling electronegativity scale, which is most common. However, there are other ways to measure electronegativity, one of which will be shown below. If you don't have an electronegativity table handy, you can still estimate the strength of an atom's electronegativity compared to the strength of another element's atom based on where it is located on a normal periodic table. Although you will not be able to calculate a number value, you can evaluate the difference between the electronegativities of 2 different elements. As a general rule: An atom's electronegativity gets higher as you move to the right in the periodic table. An atom's electronegativity gets higher as you move up in the periodic table. Thus, the atoms in the top right have the highest electronegativities and the atoms in the bottom left have the lowest ones. For example, in the NaCl example from above, you can tell that chlorine has a higher electronegativity than sodium because it's almost all the way in the top right. On the other hand, sodium is far to the left, making it one of the lower-ranking atoms. Summary:","completion":"Electronegativity, influenced by an atom's position on the periodic table, refers to the unequal sharing of electrons in a chemical bond, resulting in one atom pulling the electrons closer to itself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

According to the survey by I Love Rewards and Experience, nearly 28% of college students plan to use LinkedIn for job hunting, a significant increase from 5% the previous year. Slightly more than 7% of students plan to utilize Facebook for the same purpose, up from 5%. This shift to online platforms is a result of the increasing reliance on digital tools to find their dream jobs. Instead of solely relying on visiting campus recruiters to learn about job possibilities, students are taking a proactive approach in their job search. They are leveraging digital tools such as LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter to learn about employers, their company culture, and available job openings. In addition, they read comments by past and current employees on job-oriented websites to gather more information about potential employers. To make sure they are visible to these job seekers, companies need to have an updated online image, including an interactive and accurate website, active social media profiles, and representation on professional networking sites like LinkedIn. Being visible online and having a strong digital presence is crucial for companies in order to stand out in the increasingly competitive search for the best and brightest talent. According to a survey by job-search site Monster.com, more than four in ten employers are now using \\"different\\" recruiting tactics to reach Generation Y, nearly 60% of whom have reported that they plan to use social-networking sites to connect with potential job candidates. This shift toward using social media for recruitment is driven by the belief that it is where the candidates are most active and engaged. Employers like UPS have experienced significant success by leveraging social media and other digital tools as part of their recruitment strategy. In 2010, UPS was able to hire 955 employees through these updated recruitment techniques, compared to just 29 employees the previous year. In conclusion, as the use of digital tools and social media for job searching become more prevalent, particularly among college students and recent graduates, the answer to the question, \\"In order to find their dream jobs, more American graduates like to use?\\", would be C) the Internet. The internet, through the use of platforms such as LinkedIn, Facebook, and various job-related websites, provides job seekers with a wealth of information and access to potential employers in a way that traditional media like newspapers, magazines, and radios cannot compete with.

Write an article based on this \\"Since its founding, the Turkish Republic has endured its share of military intervention in politics, and seen four coups - two of them forced a change of government without taking over.\\"","completion":"Title: The Turkish Republic: A History of Military Intervention and Coups Introduction Since the founding of the Turkish Republic in 1923, the nation has witnessed a continuous struggle between the military and civilian governments. The army has played a crucial role in shaping the political landscape of the country and has participated in four major coups, two of which resulted in a change of government without a full military takeover. This article aims to examine the historical context behind these military interventions, analyze each of the four coups, and explore their consequences on the political development of the Turkish Republic. I. Historical Context The Turkish Republic, founded by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, was built on the foundations of secularism, democracy, and nationalism. The military assumed the role of the guardian of these principles, believing that their duty was to protect and enforce the structure of the young republic. This perception laid the groundwork for their future involvement in the nation's politics. II. The First Military Coup: 1960 The first military intervention occurred on May 27, 1960, when the military removed the government led by Prime Minister Adnan Menderes. This coup was motivated by concerns that Menderes' government was undermining secularism and democracy through authoritarian measures suppressing opposition parties, and by attempts to increase religious influence in public life. As a direct consequence of the coup, a new constitution was introduced which aimed to strengthen democratic institutions, reduce the powers of the executive, and introduce a system of checks and balances. However, it also granted the military a more significant role in politics, particularly via the National Security Council, which intended to give the military leverage to influence civilian governments. III. The Second Military Coup: 1971 The military intervened in Turkish politics once again on March 12, 1971. This time, the military presented an ultimatum to the civilian government rather than carrying out a full-fledged takeover. This was rooted in concerns surrounding social and political unrest, economic problems, and the perceived threat of communism. The military forced the resignation of Prime Minister Süleyman Demirel's government but allowed a technocratic government to be formed with the intent of implementing reforms. However, this intervention did not lead to any substantial changes in the political landscape, as democracy and civilian rule were soon resumed. IV. The Third Military Coup: 1980 The military again took power in Turkey on September 12, 1980, in response to political instability and escalating violence between far-left and far-right factions. This coup was led by General Kenan Evren, who became the head of the military junta and later the President of Turkey. The junta dissolved the existing political parties and established a new constitution in 1982, which centralized power in the executive branch and further solidified the role of the military in the political sphere. In the years that followed, the military relinquished control to a civilian government, marking the end of the 1980 coup. Religious and ethnic parties became more prominent in Turkish politics, and tensions between secularism and Islamism emerged as one of the critical challenges for the country. V. The Fourth Military Coup Attempt: 2016 The most recent military intervention unfolded on July 15, 2016, when a faction of the Turkish Armed Forces attempted to overthrow President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's government. The coup failed, and its aftermath led to a significant crackdown on the military and alleged coup plotters by the Erdoğan administration. The government also used this opportunity to assert control over the military by introducing new reforms and reshuffling its leadership. VI. Conclusion The history of the Turkish Republic has been marked by the recurring intervention of the military in the nation's politics. These interventions were often driven by the military's belief in its duty to protect the core principles of secularism, democracy, and nationalism. While some coups led to substantial political and constitutional changes, their long-term consequences have been mixed. Today, the relationship between the military and civilian governments of Turkey remains complex and delicate, shaped significantly by the legacy of these past interventions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which one of the following options would the answer to this be?","completion":"In 1993, Manchester United made some significant signings, including the acquisition of Roy Keane, whose transfer fee played a big part in the total amount spent by the club during that year. To provide a comprehensive answer, I will need to break down the notable signings and their corresponding transfer fees. Major signings by Manchester United in 1993: 1. Roy Keane (from Nottingham Forest) - Transfer fee: £3.75 million Roy Keane was the most significant signing made by Manchester United in 1993. The Irish midfielder was highly sought after, and his arrival at Old Trafford cost the club a reported £3.75 million, which was a British transfer record at the time. Other signings and their fees are not so widely reported, but some additional players who arrived at Manchester United in 1993 include: 2. David May (from Blackburn Rovers) - Transfer fee: Approximately £1.2 million. 3. Graeme Tomlinson (from Bradford City) - Transfer fee: (youth contract, exact fee not disclosed) 4. Michael Appleton (from youth team) - Transfer fee: (promoted, so no transfer fee) Considering the available information, it seems safe to presume that Manchester United spent at least £5 million on transfers in 1993, chiefly due to the signing of Roy Keane and the acquisition of David May. The exact figure, however, might be open to slight variation due to unspecified fees involved in youth contracts and development costs. Please note that the original question didn't provide answer options to choose from, so I have provided a detailed response based on the information available."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Which place was NOT a destination of the Great Migration? Context: Detroit, like many places in the United States, developed racial conflict and discrimination in the 20th century following rapid demographic changes as hundreds of thousands of new workers were attracted to the industrial city; in a short period it became the 4th-largest city in the nation. The Great Migration brought rural blacks from the South; they were outnumbered by southern whites who also migrated to the city. Immigration brought southern and eastern Europeans of Catholic and Jewish faith; these new groups competed with native-born whites for jobs and housing in the booming city. Detroit was one of the major Midwest cities that was a site for the dramatic urban revival of the Ku Klux Klan beginning in 1915. \\"By the 1920s the city had become a stronghold of the KKK,\\" whose members opposed Catholic and Jewish immigrants, as well as black Americans. The Black Legion, a secret vigilante group, was active in the Detroit area in the 1930s, when one-third of its estimated 20,000 to 30,000 members in Michigan were based in the city. It was defeated after numerous prosecutions following the kidnapping and murder in 1936 of Charles Poole, a Catholic Works Progress Administration organizer. A total of 49 men of the Black Legion were convicted of numerous crimes, with many sentenced to life in prison for murder.

The modern Republic of Turkey dates only from 1923, but the history of the land within its borders stretches back to the dawn of humanity. Widespread finds of Stone Age implements in cave excavations show that Anatolia was already inhabited during the Middle of the Palaeolithic period (about 200,000 to 40,000 years ago). By Neolithic times, organized communities had arisen, such as the one at Çatalhöyük, near Konya, Turkey's most important prehistoric site. This town, which flourished between 6500 and 5500 b.c. , had flat-roofed houses of mud and timber decorated with wall-paintings, some of which show patterns that still appear on Anatolian kilims. The advent of the Bronze Age (about 3200 b.c. ), and the spread of city-states ruled by kings, is marked by the appearance of royal tombs containing bronze objects in such places as Troy in the west, and Alacahöyük near Ankara. Around this time the Sumerian civilization living in Mesopotamia (the region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in present-day Iraq) founded and developed the cuneiform script, the world's oldest form of writing on record. The technique was introduced by Assyrian traders 1,000 years later in­to Anatolia, where it was qui­ck­ly adopted by the indigenous Hatti people, who, at this point, had already reached an ad­­vanced state of civilization. The Hittites: The capital of the Hatti was Kanesh (modern Kültepe, near Kayseri). Cuneiform tablets found here record the arrival in Anatolia of warlike invaders around the second mill­ennium b.c. Their origins remain a my­s­tery (their written language was finally deciphered in 1915), but they came from the direction of the Caucasus moun­tains, spreading destruction and disorder throughout Anatolia. It was two hundred years before they were firmly entrenched in their newly conquered empire. The newcomers were the Hittites, and their domination of Anatolia can be divided into three distinct periods: the Old Kingdom (c. 1600–1450 b.c. ), then the New or Empire Period (c. 1450–1200 b.c. ), and the Late Hittite Period (c.

Anthony Quinn","completion":"Title: The Last Lion of Libya Genre: Historical Action Drama Plot: Set in the early 20th century, the story follows the life of legendary freedom fighter Omar Mukhtar, played by Anthony Quinn. As the leader of the Libyan resistance against Italian fascist forces aiming to colonize Libya, Mukhtar's wisdom, military acumen, and resilience become a symbol of hope for his people. The film opens with the Italian invasion of Libya in 1911. Mukhtar, a schoolteacher and a devout devotee to the Quran, initially has no greater inclination than to maintain peace. However, as the cruelty of the occupying forces under General Rodolfo Graziani (played by Rutger Hauer) grows unbearable, Mukhtar feels compelled to do something. Mukhtar organizes a local force of resistance fighters and utilizes his knowledge of the onerous desert terrain to wage a guerrilla war against the Italians. The resistance, with Mukhtar at its forefront, gains support from the Libyan people, drawing together a disparate group of tribes under the common cause of freedom. Mukhtar's loyal friend and second-in-command, Saleh, is played by Omar Sharif. As the struggle continues, Mukhtar gains further respect from his followers for his humane treatment of prisoners and adherence to the principles of the Quran. He becomes known as the \\"Last Lion of Libya\\" for his fearlessness in the face of the enemy. Despite being heavily outnumbered and outgunned, Mukhtar's guerrilla tactics frustrate and embarrass the Italian troops, who are unable to fully subdue Libya. Growing impatient, Graziani hatches a plan to tighten his grip on the Libyan provinces and weaken Mukhtar's resistance movement. He orders the construction of a massive barbed-wire fence to encircle and isolate Mukhtar's forces. The enemy converts the scorched desert into a treacherous minefield, and Mukhtar's men struggle to find physical and emotional sustenance. Realizing that the odds are against them, Mukhtar devises a daring final assault - a do-or-die mission against the Italian headquarters. The attack is partially successful, yet ultimately the resistance fighters are outnumbered and overwhelmed. In the climactic scene, Mukhtar is captured and brought to Graziani, who sentences the Lion of Libya to death by hanging. As the noose tightens around his neck, Mukhtar remains defiant, uttering his famous last words, \\"We do not surrender; we win, or we die.\\" The film's epilogue reveals that Mukhtar, although defeated, became a symbol of resistance not only to the Libyan people but also to every colonized nation seeking independence. Only two decades after his death, Libya ultimately gained independence from Italy in 1951, and Omar Mukhtar's legacy lived on. The Last Lion of Libya is an epic tale of courage, sacrifice, and unwavering leadership, with Anthony Quinn delivering a powerful and heartfelt portrayal of a dedicated and devout freedom fighter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Can you tell me the answer to the passage of the kansas-nebraska act led directly to the establishment of which political party??","completion":"To answer this question, I will perform the following steps: Step 1: Understand the Kansas-Nebraska Act. The Kansas-Nebraska Act was passed in 1854. It created the territories of Kansas and Nebraska and allowed the settlers there to decide whether they wanted to allow slavery within their borders or not. This led to violent conflicts between pro-slavery and anti-slavery settlers in these territories, known as \\"Bleeding Kansas.\\" Step 2: Identify the political climate before and after the Act. Before the Kansas-Nebraska Act, there were existing political parties like the Democratic Party, the Whig Party, and the Free Soil Party. However, the Act led to new alignments in American politics, as the issue of slavery increasingly became a central focus for political debates. Step 3: Determine the political party that emerged after the Act. After the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, the Republican Party was formed. It was established as a direct response to the Act and the escalating conflict over the issue of slavery in the United States. Step 4: Present the answer based on the established information. The passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act led directly to the establishment of the Republican Party. The party was founded in opposition to the Act and aimed to prevent the spread of slavery into new territories and states."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Movie title: Stroszek Context: Bruno Stroszek (Bruno S.) is a Berlin street performer. Released from prison and warned to stop drinking, he immediately goes to a familiar bar where he comforts Eva (Eva Mattes), a prostitute down on her luck, and lets her stay with him at the apartment his landlord kept for him. They are then harried and beaten by Eva's former pimps, who insult Bruno, pull his accordion apart and humiliate him by making him kneel on his grand piano with bells balanced on his back. Faced with the prospect of further harassment, Bruno and Eva decide to leave Germany and accompany Bruno's eccentric elderly neighbour Scheitz (Clemens Scheitz), who was planning to move to Wisconsin to live with his American nephew Clayton. After sightseeing in New York City they buy a used car and arrive in a winter-bound, barren prairie near the fictional town of 'Railroad Flats'. There Bruno works as a mechanic with Clayton and his Native American helper, Eva as a waitress at a truck stop and Scheitz pursues his interest in animal magnetism.

Henry John Deutschendorf Jr. (December 31, 1943 - October 12, 1997), known professionally as John Denver, was an American singer-songwriter, record producer, actor, activist, and humanitarian, whose greatest commercial success was as a solo singer. After traveling and living in numerous locations while growing up in his military family, Denver began his music career with folk music groups during the late 1960s. Starting in the 1970s, he was one of the most popular acoustic artists of the decade and one of its best-selling artists. By 1974, he was firmly established as one of America's best-selling performers, and AllMusic has described Denver as \\"among the most beloved entertainers of his era\\". Denver's first marriage was to Anne Martell of St. Peter, Minnesota. She was the subject of his hit \\"Annie's Song,\\" which he composed in only ten minutes as he sat on a Colorado ski lift after the couple had an argument. They lived in Edina, Minnesota, from 1968 to 1971. Following the success of \\"Rocky Mountain High,\\" inspired by a camping trip with Anne and some friends, Denver purchased a residence in Aspen, Colorado. He lived in Aspen continuously until his death. The Denvers adopted a boy, Zachary John, and girl, Anna Kate, who Denver would say were \\"meant to be\\" theirs. Denver once said, \\"I'll tell you the best thing about me. I'm some guy's dad; I'm some little gal's dad. When I die, Zachary John and Anna Kate's father, boy, that's enough for me to be remembered by. That's more than enough.\\" Zachary, who is African-American, was the subject of \\"A Baby Just Like You,\\" a song that included the line \\"Merry Christmas, little Zachary\\" and which he wrote for Frank Sinatra. Denver and Martell divorced in 1982. In a 1983 interview shown in the documentary John Denver: Country Boy (2013), Denver said that career demands drove them apart; Anne said that they were too young and immature to deal with John's sudden mega-success. The ensuing property settlement caused Denver to become so enraged, he nearly choked Martell, then used a chainsaw to cut their marital bed in half. Denver married Australian actress Cassandra Delaney in 1988, after a two-year courtship. Settling at Denver's home in Aspen, the couple had a daughter, Jesse Belle. Denver and Delaney separated in 1991 and divorced in 1993. Of his second marriage, Denver would later recall that \\"before our short-lived marriage ended in divorce, she managed to make a fool of me from one end of the valley to the other\\". In 1993, Denver pleaded guilty to a drunken driving charge, and was placed on probation. In August 1994, while still on probation, he was again charged with misdemeanor driving under the influence after crashing his Porsche into a tree in Aspen. Though a jury trial in July 1997 resulted in a hung jury on the second DUI charge, prosecutors later decided to reopen the case, which was closed only after Denver's accidental death in October 1997. In 1996, the FAA decided that Denver could no longer fly a plane, due to medical disqualification for failure to abstain from alcohol, a condition that the FAA had imposed in October 1995 after his prior drunk-driving conviction. Denver's talent extended beyond music. Artistic interests included painting, but because of his limiting schedule he pursued photography, saying once \\"photography is a way to communicate a feeling\\". Denver was also an avid skier and golfer, but his principal interest was in flying. His love of flying was second only to his love of music. In 1974, he bought a Learjet to fly himself to concerts. He was a collector of vintage biplanes, and owned a Christen Eagle aerobatic plane, two Cessna 210 airplanes, and in 1997, an experimental, amateur-built Rutan Long-EZ.

Summarize: Media playback is not supported on this device Sunday's 1-1 draw against West Ham at Old Trafford means Mourinho's side are sixth and 11 points behind leaders Chelsea. They were second at this stage last season under Louis van Gaal. \\"It's a big club and we are used to big clubs - we also know how to take a team to win,\\" said Faria. What we are chasing will arrive for sure \\"We know that we will do it.\\" Mourinho won three Premier League titles during two spells at Chelsea, who sacked him last December as they lay 16th, having lost nine of their first 16 league games. He has also won league championships with Porto, Inter Milan and Real Madrid. Mourinho was sent off by referee Jon Moss on Sunday after kicking a water bottle as he reacted to Paul Pogba being shown a yellow card for diving. The France midfielder will now be suspended for Wednesday's EFL Cup quarter-final against West Ham. It was the second time Mourinho has been dismissed in a month, after Mark Clattenburg sent him to the stand during the 0-0 home draw with Burnley. He was banned and fined for that, and in a separate case was fined £50,000 for comments made about referee Anthony Taylor before United's match with Liverpool. The Football Association will wait for Moss' report before deciding what action to take against Mourinho. Faria said: \\"I think everyone saw his frustration in the situation where it should be a free-kick for us. \\"And there's the issue about the yellow card for Paul, which means he'll be suspended, so there is maybe reasons to express some frustration.\\" Mourinho was dismissed after two goals were scored in the opening quarter of the match. West Ham took the lead in the second minute when Diafra Sakho headed in from Dimitri Payet's free-kick. Zlatan Ibrahimovic was partly at fault for the goal but made amends in the 21st minute when he nodded in from Pogba's dinked delivery. United have drawn five of their past seven league matches. Mourinho's men are 11 points shy of leaders Chelsea following their fifth draw in seven league matches. In that period, they have only won one game. Any feelings of euphoria that Manchester United had following Thursday's 4-0 Europa League win have quickly disappeared. Asked if their title chances had gone, Faria said: \\"We are looking to the team and trying to get the best results. We knew the job was not an easy job and we fight to change the things and it's what we'll keep doing. \\"We believe in the players, we believe in the team and we believe things will change. And what we are chasing will arrive for sure.\\" Summary:","completion":"A big soccer game happened on Sunday, and the teams Manchester United and West Ham played and tied 1-1.

Please answer the following question: Rain, the young man is thinking. Of course it would be raining. Not a heavy, cleansing rain that leaves the streets steaming and the neatly sculptured yards lush and fragrant. This is a gray drizzling rain. A rain that makes him think of places like England and Scotland as they appear in those disturbing late night films on cable, the ones in black and white that weren't particularly memorable when they were made and are even less so now. Still, it rains and the air is cool. All he has to shelter him is a think nylon jacket. The jacket is soaked. It feels both chilly and coarse against his skin. His hair hangs in flat and sodden wings, falling into his eyes. It's long in the back, almost to his shoulders, and he thinks that the cars that pass him on the street, the occupants of those cars, might look at him and see only that he is wet and not that he is dirty as well. Can they tell that his hair has been unwashed for days? That his clothes are the same ones he's worn for more than a week? It doesn't matter. He's invisible to them as soon as they pass, taking any assumptions they might make with them. They might just mistake him for one of those hoity-toity college kids, one of those clean limbed and beaming have's who has happened to find himself caught out without his umbrella. He makes a desultory attempt to straighten his shoulders, to lift his eyes from the buckled sidewalk. To look like he might have a purpose or a destination. It doesn't help. He has become the day. He has internalized the environment. He did that years ago, in fact. That's all I can do. Not his words, of course, but he understands them. He is intimately acquainted with his limitations. What is his jacket made out of? - Nylon - Leather - not enough information - Denim Answer:","completion":"The young man's jacket is made out of nylon. This is mentioned explicitly in the text: \\"All he has to shelter him is a thin nylon jacket.\\" As he walks through the rain, the jacket has become soaked and feels both chilly and coarse against his skin, failing to provide him with adequate protection from the dreary weather conditions. It is worth noting that the man is aware of how his appearance might be perceived by others, wondering if they can tell that his hair has been unwashed for days and that his clothes are the same ones he has been wearing for more than a week. In this passage, the man's wet nylon jacket and overall disheveled appearance serve to emphasize his current state of vulnerability and the sense of alienation he feels from the world around him. As he walks, he attempts to straighten his shoulders and lift his eyes from the sidewalk in the hope that people might mistake him for a well-to-do college student instead of someone who has been struggling and grappling with his limitations. The man has come to accept his circumstances and has internalized his environment, which is reflected in his damp and uncomfortable state caused by the drizzling rain. Despite his efforts to appear more presentable, he realizes that this does not change the reality of his situation.

(CNN) -- Since \\"The Tree of Life,\\" reclusive filmmaker Terrence Malick's fifth film in four decades, premiered at Cannes earlier this week, the 2½-hour long impressionistic tone poem has elicited mixed reactions ranging from scattered boos to walkouts to long standing ovations. When the film took the coveted Palme d'Or at the end of the festival, the buzz was deafening. So what's the big deal? Let's get the things we already know about the ambitious film out of the way first: It stars Brad Pitt as a stern but ultimately disappointed father of three boys in 1950s Texas, Jessica Chastain as his luminescent wife and Sean Penn as one of their grown-up sons many years later; there is little in the way of linear narrative or dialogue outside of breathy voiceovers contemplating the existence and disposition of God; there are lengthy sequences of volcanoes erupting, cells dividing and many other awe-inspiring natural phenomena that recall both \\"Nova\\" and \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\"; and, yes, there are CGI dinosaurs. Or, as the film's stars put it at a press conference in Cannes: \\"It's like ( OPTIONS: - A Space Odyssey) is waiting with a butterfly net to catch what was going by that day,\\" Pitt said. - Brad Pitt) is waiting with a butterfly net to catch what was going by that day,\\" Pitt said. - CGI) is waiting with a butterfly net to catch what was going by that day,\\" Pitt said. - CNN) is waiting with a butterfly net to catch what was going by that day,\\" Pitt said. - Cannes) is waiting with a butterfly net to catch what was going by that day,\\" Pitt said. - God) is waiting with a butterfly net to catch what was going by that day,\\" Pitt said. - Jessica Chastain) is waiting with a butterfly net to catch what was going by that day,\\" Pitt said. - Nova) is waiting with a butterfly net to catch what was going by that day,\\" Pitt said. - Palme d'Or) is waiting with a butterfly net to catch what was going by that day,\\" Pitt said. - Penn) is waiting with a butterfly net to catch what was going by that day,\\" Pitt said. - Sean Penn) is waiting with a butterfly net to catch what was going by that day,\\" Pitt said. - Terrence Malick) is waiting with a butterfly net to catch what was going by that day,\\" Pitt said. - Texas) is waiting with a butterfly net to catch what was going by that day,\\" Pitt said. - The Tree of Life) is waiting with a butterfly net to catch what was going by that day,\\" Pitt said.","completion":"Or, as the film's stars put it at a press conference in Cannes: \\"It's like (A Space Odyssey) is waiting with a butterfly net to catch what was going by that day,\\" Pitt said.

Before Elmo and Carsie got together, Elmo and Macy used to spend hours almost every night in that room. Some nights he had almost kissed her. She left her milk and cookies on the kitchen counter and went down another flight of stairs, which came out in the Recreation Room. Macy could hear the sound of the TV coming from Media Room. She tiptoed to the open doorway and peeked in. There she was--that conniving slut--sitting where Macy should have been. How could Elmo have replaced her like that?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Well, as Goethe once said, there really isn't any point in trying to pass a negative judgement that aspires to be objective on \\"something that has had a great effect\\". \\"La Maman et La Putain\\" has surely passed into history as an influence on much of what's been done in France and elsewhere in the past thirty years and no one interested in the history of film, certainly, should be dissuaded from watching it. To express a purely subjective judgement, however, I feel compelled to disagree with almost every other review posted here and say to people: \\"Don't watch it; it's a waste of hours of your time that will just leave you feeling rather sick and angry.\\" And by that I don't mean \\"sick and angry\\" about \\"the human condition\\" or anything so general and profound as that, because that is exactly the line that most critics have adopted in their fulsome praise of the film - \\"an ordeal to watch in its ruthless dissection of our emotional cowardice and cruelty\\" and so on - and, if it really managed to put across a universally or even broadly relevant message of this sort, then the director would have good reason to be satisfied with himself, however pessimistic his conclusions may be. My beef with the film is rather that I don't see this hours-long record of empty vanity and petty treachery as being justified or excused by any GENERALLY relevant message at all. All three main characters are deeply morally unattractive individuals: Alexandre to the greatest degree, of course, because we see by far the most of him and because he seldom shuts up for more than thirty seconds; Marie perhaps to the least degree, because we see the least of her. Alexandre's affected and pretentious monologues have a kind of amusement value, of course, but the amusement wears thin as one comes more and more clearly to realize that Jean-Pierre Léaud is most likely not even acting and that, with absurd remarks like \\"un homme beau comme un film de Nicholas Ray\\", he really was just reproducing word-for-word opinions that were accepted as authentic and profound by the milieu in which he, along with the director Eustache, had been living for about ten years by the time of the making of the film. I suppose if the tone of relentless superficiality and triviality had been sustained throughout 100% of the film, it might have worked as a long sardonic comedy about a particularly shallow, worthless and despicable post-'68 milieu. What made, however, this viewer at least extremely angry with the director was his granting of at least one lengthy scene each to Alexandre and Veronika in which we are clearly expected to empathize with and feel for them as if they shared a moral universe with us. If a man can get away with living in the flat of and professing to love one woman, sleeping (mostly in this very flat) with another, and running around Paris proposing marriage to yet a third, well, I suppose I can wish him the best of luck in the dog-eat-dog world he's chosen to create for himself. What I can't, however, in all conscience do is listen even for a moment to maudlin monologues from him in which he speaks about his \\"anxiety\\" and his \\"despair\\". The same goes double for the even more despicable Veronika, whom we are shown barging drunk into the apartment and even the bed shared by Marie and Alexandre and behaving there with an infantile inconsistency tantamount to the most savage and heartless cruelty. As I say, if \\"La Maman et La Putain\\" is intended to be nothing more nor other than a portrait of Alexandre, Veronika and Marie, three individuals whom any even halfway decent person would never admit into their company let alone their home, then I suppose there is a kind of legitimacy in praising the director for being \\"unflinching\\" (though why one should even feel like \\"flinching\\" once one had consciously opted to create such thoroughly repellent characters to filmically observe I can't imagine). The problem, however, is that the director is clearly convinced - and appears to have succeeded in convincing generations of critics - that Alexander, Veronika and Marie are somehow representative of human beings in general and of the limits of human beings' emotional capabilities. This latter idea, however, is arrant and offensive nonsense. There may indeed be an inherent fallibility and tendency to tragedy in human relations in general and sexual relations in particular. But the nature and degree of this fallibility and tendency to tragedy can only possibly be determined by people who make a sincere and serious effort to make such relations work. It surely needs no cinematic or authorial genius to convey to us the information that a man who behaves like Alexandre is going to end up hated, miserable, and alone, or that women who insist on expecting love from a man like Alexandre are going to end up disappointed and bitter. Watch \\"La Maman et La Putain\\" if you're historically interested in what passed for culture and human interaction in a certain post-'68 Parisian milieu which was probably, unfortunately, not restricted to just a few particularly anti-social types like these. But please don't make the mistake of believing that what is recorded here has any general relevance for humanity in the way that a film by Jean Renoir or Martin Scorsese might be argued to have.

He starts the chase, until he runs into a large truck. Wile E. runs the other way, and the truck shows the credit. The chase ends in a win for the truck, and the Coyote emerges battered. A box with director Chuck Jones' credit then squashes him. The Coyote throws the box away, and the shot freezes: COYOTE - Eatius Birdius. He resumes the chase, which freezes to show the Road Runner: Delicius-Delicius. The chase continues down the road until the Road Runner makes a U-turn. The Coyote turns around, then stops. The Road Runner completes the circuit around, meanwhile, and beeps as the Coyote turns around, causing him to leap back. The Road Runner starts off down the road and loosens it from its hinge briefly. Wile E. points worriedly and displays an \\"EGAD\\" sign, then an \\"!!\\" sign.

Turteltaub (a pseudonym of Harry Turtledove). The books center around cousins Menedemos and Sostratos who work as seaborne traders in the years following the death of Alexander the Great. The series is notable for a high degree of historical accuracy. - Alexander III of Macedon (20/21 July 356 BC 10/11 June 323 BC), commonly known as Alexander the Great (\\"Aléxandros ho Mégas\\" ), was a king (\\"basileus\\") of the Ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon and a member of the Argead dynasty. Born in Pella in 356 BC, Alexander succeeded his father, Philip II, to the throne at the age of twenty. He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented military campaign through Asia and northeast Africa, and by the age of thirty he had created one of the largest empires of the ancient world, stretching from Greece to northwestern India. He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history's most successful military commanders. - Harry Norman Turtledove (born June 14, 1949) is an American novelist, best known for alternate history, historical fiction, fantasy and science fiction. - The Sacred Land is the third book in the Hellenic Traders series by H N Turteltaub . Like the others in the series it is a work of historical fiction concerning the adventures of a pair of Greek traders from Rhodes . What is the relationship between 'the sacred land' and 'novel'? Answer:","completion":"The relationship between 'The Sacred Land' and 'novel' is that 'The Sacred Land' is a novel itself. It is the third book in the Hellenic Traders series written by H.N. Turteltaub (a pseudonym of Harry Turtledove). The series falls under the category of historical fiction, which is a literary genre where the plot takes place in a historical setting. In the case of 'The Sacred Land,' the historical setting is ancient Greece, and the story follows the adventures of two Greek traders from Rhodes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The expedition crossed the border on the night of April 21, 1919. The goals were to capture Lodeynoye Pole, Petrozavodsk and the Murmansk railroad. The troops were divided into three groups and were made up of 1000 volunteers. The southern group advanced to Lodeynoye Pole in just three days, but was pressed back behind River Tuulos by Bolshevik troops. The northern group captured Prääsä. At this time it became obvious that there weren't enough troops to complete the goals of the expedition. A new round of recruiting 2000 new volunteers was started and Mannerheim made Aarne Sihvo the new commander of the expedition. Major Paavo Talvela's regiment started an attack aimed at Petrozavodsk on June 20, but was beaten by Red Army and Finnish Red Guard forces just outside the town. The British troops that operated along the Murmansk railroad were quite close by, but did not participate. The Finns had hoped that the Karelian population would have joined the troops as volunteers but only a few did and their morale was never very high. The initiative now passed to the Bolsheviks. On June 26 over 600 Finns of the Red Officer School in Saint Petersburg made a landing at Vitele across Lake Ladoga behind the Finnish lines. The southern group was forced to retreat to Finland after suffering heavy losses. Talvela's group was also forced to retreat back to Finland.

I'm 22 been working in software sales since last June so about 8 months. My job right now is to primarily call up prospects and see if they're interested in our product and set a meeting for an account exec (closer) to actually sell them the product. The VP of sales in our company called me a phone monkey (I'm brown) last week as a joke I think and my co-worker who sits beside me heard it. He said something along the lines of hey phone monkey, did you get my email earlier? Now I don't really think its racist as people do refer to my job in the industry as being a phone monkey but just the way he said it he knew he fucked up right away. Didn't apologize but I just looked at him and said oh yeah I got it and he basically darted away. The next day what do you know I'm in a meeting with HR, the CEO of the startup and the VP of sales. The VP first says he's very sorry about what he said it just slipped out and he'd never say it again. CEO just also aplogized and made me aware I could take some time off outside of vacation days to cope with this. I thought about just blurting out oh it was no problem I didn't even think it was racist, but I put on a sad face and said its been a hard day since and I don't know how I'm gonna get over this. The look on the VP's face and the CEO was hilarious they were scared shitless, HR lady asks if I have any reccomendations on how we could all move forward from this. I said that I know I've only been in my current role for 8 months and usually the promotion to a closing role (account exec) comes after 16-24 months but I am doing very well and I think I would feel a lot better about my job and my role here if I were to get that promotion immediately. They all look at each other and say they need me to step out for a sec, I agree and go to the bathroom. When I get back the CEO shook my hand and the VP shook my hand and said welcome to the big leagues and they gave me the promotion. I ushered them to sit back down and negotiate the terms then and there with HR present. I negotiated an extra 10k base salary and a few more days of vacation, which no newly promoted account exec has ever done here I'm pretty sure. I got the offer letter today and everything was in proper shape so I signed and I moved into a bigger cube today. I went over to the VP of sales who's still my boss and said great to be working even more close to you again all is forgiven now lets all make some serious commission.

How many General Elections did Harold Wilson win as leader of the Labour Party","completion":"Harold Wilson, a British Labour Party politician, served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in two separate non-consecutive tenures from 1964 to 1970 and 1974 to 1976. As leader of the Labour Party, Wilson won four General Elections. Here is a summary of those victories: 1. 1964 General Election: The 1964 General Election occurred on October 15, 1964, with Harold Wilson leading the Labour Party against the incumbent Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home of the Conservative Party. The Labour Party won the election with 317 out of 630 seats in the House of Commons, while the Conservative Party secured 304 seats. Wilson emerged victorious in this election, albeit with a narrow majority of only four seats, becoming the Prime Minister for his first term. 2. 1966 General Election: Harold Wilson called for an early General Election on March 31, 1966, in an attempt to increase the Labour Party's majority in the House of Commons. Running against the new Conservative leader, Edward Heath, Wilson won this election convincingly by securing 363 seats out of 630. The Conservative Party captured 253 seats. With a majority of 96 seats, Wilson continued his tenure as Prime Minister, hoping to fulfill his domestic and foreign policy ambitions. 3. February 1974 General Election: After losing to Edward Heath in the 1970 General Election, Harold Wilson faced the incumbent Prime Minister in a rematch on February 28, 1974. This election resulted in a hung parliament, with no party achieving an outright majority. The Labour Party won 301 seats out of 635, while the Conservative Party secured 297 seats. Despite winning fewer votes nationally than the Conservative Party, the Labour Party had the most seats, and Wilson formed a minority government, thus returning as Prime Minister for his second tenure. 4. October 1974 General Election: In an attempt to solidify the Labour Party's position in the House of Commons and break the hung parliament impasse, Harold Wilson called another General Election on October 10, 1974. The Labour Party won 319 seats out of 635, while the Conservative Party obtained 277 seats. Although Wilson fell short of a decisive majority, the Labour Party's position improved with a slim majority of three seats. This victory enabled Wilson to form a majority government and continue his second term as Prime Minister. In summary, Harold Wilson won four General Elections as leader of the Labour Party: in 1964, 1966, February 1974, and October 1974. These victories established him as one of the prominent politicians of the post-World War II era in the United Kingdom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They were both into collecting rare specimens of plants and wildlife. They would often complain about the weather. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which friend experienced more weather fronts? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively determine which friend, Joe or Jim, experienced more weather fronts. However, some general information about the climate of East Antarctica and West Antarctica can provide an educated guess. East Antarctica is colder and drier than West Antarctica due to its higher elevation and position farther from the ocean. This area mainly experiences the strong and consistent flow of catabatic winds, which descend from the high interior of the Antarctic Plateau, creating a relatively stable weather pattern. West Antarctica, on the other hand, is more influenced by maritime weather systems, which might bring more varying weather conditions and a higher chance of encountering weather fronts. The coastal area of West Antarctica tends to have a more moderate and moist climate, with more frequent precipitation, cyclonic storms, and weather fronts due to its closer proximity to the ocean. Based on this information, it is likely that Jim, living in West Antarctica, would experience more weather fronts compared to Joe in East Antarctica. However, without specific details of their exact locations and the actual weather conditions they encountered, it remains an educated assumption rather than a conclusive answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve -356*v + 727*v + 869*v = 1081 - 7281 for v.","completion":"To solve the given equation -356v + 727v + 869v = 1081 - 7281 for v, we'll follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides On the left-hand side of the equation, we have three variables v with different coefficients. We'll add those coefficients to get the total coefficient for v: -356v + 727v + 869v = (-356 + 727 + 869) * v This results in: 1240v On the right-hand side of the equation, we simply subtract the numbers: 1081 - 7281 = -6200 So now we have: 1240v = -6200 Step 2: Isolate the variable Now, we need to isolate the variable v. To do this, we will need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of v, which is 1240. 1240v / 1240 = -6200 / 1240 The coefficient 1240 will cancel out on the left-hand side, leaving us: v = -6200 / 1240 Step 3: Simplify Now, we'll simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator, which will help us reduce the fraction to its simplest form. The GCD of 6200 and 1240 is 1240. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD: v = (-6200 / 1240) ÷ (1240 / 1240) v = -5 So, the solution for the equation -356*v + 727*v + 869*v = 1081 - 7281 is: v = -5"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which city exposed fewer people to asthma? Hint: Air pollution is harmful to human beings and other living things. About 22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can also harm the environment. A:","completion":"Given the information provided in the paragraph, it can be concluded that Leaf City exposed fewer people to asthma as compared to Tree City. The primary reason for this conclusion lies in the difference in their approaches to energy consumption and environmental protection. Tree City, as mentioned, burned lots of gas and other fossil fuels. The burning of such fuels leads to higher levels of air pollution, releasing harmful gases and particulate matter into the atmosphere. Air pollution is known to have severe negative effects on human health, including an increased risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Additionally, air pollution can exacerbate other health issues and puts children at a higher risk due to their developing lungs and higher air intake relative to their size. On the other hand, Leaf City was very protective towards its environment. This implies that the city followed practices that minimized the reliance on fossil fuels, leading to lower levels of air pollution and, consequently, a lower risk of exposure to asthma for its inhabitants. By adopting environmentally friendly policies and practices, Leaf City ensured better air quality for its residents and reduced the likelihood of adverse health effects related to poor air quality. Therefore, given the difference in environmental policies and the direct relationship between air pollution and asthma, Leaf City exposed fewer people to asthma compared to Tree City."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She had a marvellous drey high up a spruce tree, carved out long ago by a woodpecker, and since extended into a two-chambered home full of bright things. The journey along the sky-road to her drey did not take long. When Patch looked inside, he saw a hundred colours glittering in the sunlight, shining from bits of metal and glass set into Silver's walls and floor. But his mother was not there. He could tell by the faintness of her smell that no squirrel had been here in some time. There were two faint traces of scent, several days old; that of Silver, and that of another squirrel, a musky scent that Patch did not recognize. A scent that made his tail stiffen as if danger was near. Patch stared into his mother's empty drey for a moment. It wasn't normal for a squirrel to abandon her drey for days, not in the middle of winter. And he hadn't seen Silver for three days. Not since all the acorns had disappeared from the earth. Patch ran back to his own tree, and then to the maple tree next door, to his brother Tuft's drey. He ran very fast. He was hungrier than ever, and he was beginning to be very worried. He was relieved when he looked into Tuft's drey and found it occupied. Tuft himself was not present, but Brighteyes was, and their babies, and it was clear from the smells that Tuft had only just departed. \\"Hello, Patch,\\" Brighteyes said weakly. \\"Would you like to come in?\\" Patch entered. Brighteyes was curled up with her babies in the drey's deepest, warmest corner. The last time Patch had visited, a week ago, this had been a den of noise and chaos, with all Brighteyes' four babies running and jumping and playfighting. Today they lay weakly beside Brighteyes, and the once-shining eyes from which their mother had taken her name were dim and clouded. Question: Why Patch's tail felt stiffen?

Q: Fact 1: Adult sponges produce eggs and sperm. Fact 2: Sexual reproduction involves sperm and an egg. Given the two facts above, what reproduces sexually? A:","completion":"Given Fact 1: Adult sponges produce eggs and sperm and Fact 2: Sexual reproduction involves sperm and an egg, it can be concluded that sponges reproduce sexually. Sponges encompass a diverse group of sessile aquatic animals belonging to the phylum Porifera. They are found in various habitats, including oceans and freshwater sources, and exhibit a range of forms and structures. Sponges exhibit a unique and relatively simple body plan, comprising a network of canals and specialized cells called choanocytes which help in filtering water for nutrients. Reproduction in sponges can occur both asexually and sexually. Asexual reproduction involves budding, fragmentation, or the formation of specialized structures called gemmules. These methods involve the growth of new individuals from a fragment or an outgrowth of the parent sponge without the fusion of sperm and egg. Sexual reproduction, on the other hand, is the process in which two haploid gametes (sperm and egg) fuse to form a diploid zygote, which subsequently develops into a new individual. In sponges, sexual reproduction typically involves a single adult sponge functioning as a hermaphrodite, producing both eggs and sperm, although some species have separate male and female individuals. The production of both gamete types usually occurs sequentially to reduce the likelihood of self-fertilization, although cross-fertilization between different individuals is more common. The sperm cells are released into the water column, where they are captured by other sponges through their water filtration system. The sperm cells then travel through the canals of the recipient sponge, fertilizing the eggs internally. Fertilized eggs develop into ciliated, free-swimming larvae called parenchymella, which are eventually released into the water. The larvae float in the water column, seeking a suitable substrate to attach and metamorphose into a new adult sponge, thereby completing the life cycle. In summary, sponges are capable of reproducing sexually, as evidenced by the fact that adult sponges produce eggs and sperm (Fact 1), and sexual reproduction involves the fusion of sperm and an egg (Fact 2). This mode of reproduction enables genetic diversity and adaptation to different environmental conditions, providing sponges with an evolutionary advantage in their various habitats."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Birth of Israel - A History Is Revisited - NYTimes.com Revisionist studies by Israeli scholars, published recently here and in Britain, have been reinterpreting many of the events surrounding the creation of the state of Israel in the years 1947 to 1949. In general, the new books tend to place greater blame on Israel for the Palestinian problem - as well as for the turmoil, the human cost and the continued political impasse in the Middle East - than have most earlier Israeli studies. Three books, all of which have exploited newly available documents, raise a host of questions about the period when Israel came into existence as an independent state, fighting a victorious war over neighboring Arab countries while roughly 700,000 Palestinian left their homes. Many of the Palestinians ended up in refugee districts, where they remain, their sense of grievance a contributing factor in the violence in the occupied territiories that began in December. One of the books, ''The Birth of Israel: Myths and Realities'' by Simha Flapan, is viewed by Middle East specialists here as militantly anti-Zionist, a book designed to erode one of the major Western perceptions of the Israeli-Arab conflict - the notion that Israel has always held itself to a higher moral standard than its neighbors did. A new book by Bennie Morris, the diplomatic correspondent for The Jerusalem Post, entitled ''The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947-1949,'' examines the departure of Arabs from Israeli controlled territory on a city by city and village by village basis, and concludes that there were a host of factors that led to the exodus. Israeli Scholar at Oxford In ''Collusion Across the Jordan: King Abdullah, The Zionist Movement, and the Partition of Palestine,'' Avi Shlaim, an Israeli scholar who is a fellow of St. Antony's College at Oxford, recounts in detail the story of early Jordanian-Israeli relations. Taken together, the books seem to continue a trend toward a more self-critical approach on the part of Israeli students of the Middle East conflict, an area in which much previous scholarship tended to present one side or the other in the conflict as the repository of pure good or of unadulterated evil. ''In the 1950's and 1960's, the histories were extreme on both sides,'' Daniel Pipes, the director of the Foreign Policy Research Institute and a Middle East scholar, said. ''The scholarship of today is much more nuanced. The Israeli side ranges from mildly self-critical to heavily self-critical, and even on the Arab side there is somewhat less of a tendency to parrot the party line. ''It was a complex human situation,'' Mr. Pipes said of the birth of Israel. ''Mistakes, evil and virtue existed on both sides, though perhaps not in equal proportion.'' ''All this interest in the 1948 period,'' Mr. Pipes said, ''is due to the fact that the Arab-Israeli conflict has gone back to where it was. It was primarly then between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Then, after that, all the other states got involved. Now, it's reverted to where it was before.'' The Palestinian Flight Among the key events scrutinized in the books are the Palestinian flight from the territory brought under Jewish control and the invasion of Israel by five Arab armies the day after independence was declared. Mr. Flapan, whose book was published by Pantheon in this country, argues that earlier Israeli beliefs about these and other events amount to ''myths'' whose effect was to cover up Israeli responsibility. In all, Mr. Flapan, a Polish-born early Zionist pioneer who died last year, identifies seven such ''myths,'' among them the contention that the flight of Palestinians from Jewish areas ''came in response to a call by the Arab leadership to leave temporarily, in order to return with the victorious Arab armies.'' Mr. Flapan argues that the Palestinian exodus was both desired and prompted by Jewish leaders ''who believed that Zionist colonization and statehood necessitated the 'transfer' of Palestinian Arabs to Arab countries.'' His argument is that despite public statements by Israel's leaders to the effect that all Arabs living in Israeli territory were urged to stay, their real motivation was to reduce Arab numbers as far as possible. Mr. Flapan's book has been criticized by other scholars who say, among other things, that it marks a growing tendency both among Israelis and foreigners to scrutinize Israeli behavior and actions far more than those of any other country. In the view of the critics, the mere notion that Israeli Jews, who, in their view, were fighting for their lives, sometimes behaved in a less than exemplary manner should not come as a shocking revelation. Called Product of Warfare Other recent studies, while also critical of Israeli behavior and policy, stop far short of some of Mr. Flapan's conclusions. The Morris book - ''The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947-1949,'' - contends that both the conventional Arab view of the exodus - that it was caused by Jewish aggression - and the Israeli ''myth'' -that it was urged on the Palestinian population by Arab leaders - are incorrect. The exodus emerges in Mr. Morris's view as an almost inevitable product of ''civil and guerrilla warfare between the two highly intermingled communities.''

What is the solution?","completion":"Alright, little buddy, we have a math problem with the letter \\"j.\\" Let's solve for j together! First, we have -3509 * j = -2908 * j + 49282. Now we want to get all the j's on one side and the numbers on the other side. To do this, we will add 3509 * j to both sides. It's like if we take 3 apples from the left side, we also need to take 3 apples from the right side. So when we add 3509 * j to both sides, we get: 0 = (3509 * j - 3509 * j) + (-2908 * j + 3509 * j) + 49282 Now, let's simplify the j's: 0 = 601 * j + 49282 Next, we want to get j by itself. To do that, we need to remove the 49282 from that side. We can do this by subtracting 49282 from both sides: -49282 = 601 * j Now, to find j, we just need to divide by 601, like sharing 601 candies equally: j = -49282 / 601 After calculating the division, we find: j = -82 So our answer for j is -82.

The one-pound bags contained no warnings “that consumption of the black licorice product can lead to heart conditions” so Goldberg munched away. But in October 2017 the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning that glycyrrhizin — which occurs naturally in black licorice — could prompt heart problems for adults over 40. “Defendant knew for years that its black licorice candy posed a health threat,” yet didn’t warn consumers, the suit says.

The lawsuit states that while Goldberg had been “consuming at least one standard size bag [of black licorice candy] per week” for years, the bags contained no warnings of potential health risks and “that consumption of the black licorice product can lead to heart conditions.” Black licorice is one of the most divisive candies out there. Shutterstock stock Goldberg claims in the suit that while he stills suffers from heart issues today, he is otherwise a “healthy individual who is not obese” and “has never had any heart conditions,” according to documents filed in Manhattan's Supreme Court in October. Though Hershey's products may not contain any visible warnings, in October 2017, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did issue a warning that glycyrrhizin, a naturally occurring ingredient in black licorice, does put older adults at risk for heart issues. At the time, the FDA stated, \\"If you’re 40 or older, eating 2 ounces of black licorice a day for at least two weeks could land you in the hospital with an irregular heart rhythm or arrhythmia.\\" The lawsuit blames the Hershey Company for failing to disclose this information to consumers stating, “Defendant knew for years that its black licorice candy posed a health threat,” but did not warn consumers they were putting themselves at risk by buying and eating it. In 2017, Goldberg was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and put on medication. The suit claims that since his diagnosis, the plaintiff “has stopped eating black licorice, however his condition has not improved.\\" But is the licorice really to blame here? \\"The ingredients are listed on the package so that consumers are aware of what they are putting into their bodies,\\" Emily Clarke, a registered nurse who works at University Hospital in Newark, New Jersey, (and has not treated Goldberg) told TODAY Food. \\"It's our responsibility to research those ingredients, educate ourselves and understand healthy food choices.\\" In Clarke's opinion, the licorice alone was likely not enough to cause the condition. She added that \\"one food choice doesn't cause heart disease. It would take a string of poor consumption choices and possibly genetics, along with a handful of other factors about this man's lifestyle.\\" When reached via email, a representative for Hershey's provided TODAY Food with the following statement: \\"We are not going to comment on the specific claims as this is pending litigation, but all of our products are safe to eat and formulated in full compliance with FDA regulations, including the agency’s regulation affirming the safety of licorice extract for use in food.\\" Hershey's black licorice does contain licorice extract, which the company says is derived from a \\"natural flavor obtained from the root of the licorice plant.\\" Regardless of health concerns, licorice still remains a divisive candy across social media, with many either loving or hating its pungent anise flavor. Litigation connecting food to potential health risks continues to make headlines. LaCroix has recently been sued over claims that its \\"natural\\" sparkling water contains insecticides and Canada Dry has been sued over its Ginger Ale not actually containing pure ginger root. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"A man named David Goldberg is suing the Hershey Company because he believes that eating lots of black licorice-flavored Twizzlers caused him to get heart disease. He says he ate at least one bag of the candy each week for many years, but the bags did not have any warnings about possible health risks. In 2017, the Food and Drug Administration warned that a natural ingredient in black licorice could cause heart problems for adults over 40. David now has a heart condition called atrial fibrillation and takes medication for it. He stopped eating black licorice, but his condition has not improved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Closing in on a planet, the ship is attacked by a mysterious weapon (a red blobby field) which drives the crew insane. Three escape pods launch during the attack, but the ship crashes into the atmosphere of the planet and is destroyed. Meanwhile, smuggler Stella Star and her sidekick Akton run into the Imperial Space Police, led by robot sheriff Elle. Akton and Stella escape by jumping into hyperspace. When they emerge, they discover an escape pod from the attacked starship, and in it, a sole survivor. Before they can escape, they are apprehended by the police, who tracked their hyperspace trail. Tried and convicted of piracy, they are each sentenced to life in prison on separate prison planets. When a riot breaks out at Stella's prison, she uses the diversion to escape the prison, which explodes shortly afterwards. Police Chief Thor recaptures her and she is taken to an orbiting ship, where she is reunited with Akton. They are contacted holographically by the Emperor of the Galaxy, who thanks them for recovering the starship survivor. They are offered clemency if they help find three more missing escape pods, one of which may contain the Emperor's only son.

In the fourth quarter, the Cardinals regained the lead with QB Tim Rattay completing a 2-yard TD pass to rookie TE Ben Patrick.

However, it does provide relevant information that can help us infer the answer to the question. The sentence informs us that Catalan shares many traits with other closely related Romance languages. This indirectly implies that Catalan is a variety of Romance languages, even though it does not explicitly state it. To properly answer the question, it could be reformulated in the following way: Catalan is a variety of Romance languages, specifically belonging to the Western Romance group. It shares many linguistic traits with other closely related Romance languages, such as Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese, as they all evolved from Latin, the language of the Roman Empire. Some of these shared traits include similar vocabulary, grammatical structures, and phonetic features. Catalan emerged in the Middle Ages in the region known today as Catalonia, which encompasses parts of modern-day Spain, France, and Italy. Over time, the language has evolved to develop its own unique characteristics and dialects while still retaining its Romance roots. In addition to Catalonia, Catalan is also spoken in the Balearic Islands, Valencia, the eastern part of Aragon, Roussillon in France, and the city of Alghero on the island of Sardinia in Italy. Due to historical and political reasons, the status and usage of Catalan vary significantly across these regions. Despite these variations, Catalan as a whole continues to be a part of the broader Romance language family, connected through their shared history and linguistic features."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated. This marked the end of the castle's role in the rebellion, and the fortification was probably abandoned shortly afterwards.

However, I was surprised to learn that even in a classroom with fewer students, social segregation happened. The entire class crowded around a table just to avoid one or two other students sitting by themselves on the other side of the room. Students refer to one as the \\"cool\\" one and another as the \\"loser\\". There were only three tables. After witnessing this, I made a new classroom rule. Every day at lunch, we would put all the tables together and everyone including me would sit around the big table. Students could sit wherever they wanted at the table.

Students who didn't usually talk to each other during free time started to share conversations. Students were occasionally requested to bring something for others to taste.

Mannion's depression began after the birth of daughter. Friends say she gave no indication she was contemplating. harming herself. Coroner recorded an open verdict.","completion":"Title: Unveiling the Tragic Story of Linzi Mannion: A Tale of Undisclosed Sorrow Lance Sergeant Robert Kopicki faced one of the darkest and most tragic moments of his life when he discovered the lifeless body of Linzi Mannion, a tale that continues to cast a pall of sorrow and distress over a community still grappling with the loss. The untimely passing of Miss Mannion, a woman whose life was marred by a lingering cloud of depression lurking behind her perceived happiness, serves as a stark reminder of the invisible battles many continue to fight in silence. A life marked by extremes, Linzi Mannion transitioned from the joy of new motherhood to the depths of depression. Friends, family, and even the inquest were told that Miss Mannion's downward spiral into despair became apparent only after the birth of her daughter. It's a narrative that is all too common, as postnatal depression continues to be a silent assailant on many new mothers, attributable to a combination of hormonal changes, psychological adjustment to motherhood, and fatigue. It is reported that Mannion received medical attention for her condition, but the depth and vagacity of her internal turmoil were under-realized. Those closest to Linzi, stunned by her passing, say she gave no indication she was contemplating harming herself. They testify to her composed exterior and how skilfully she masked her internal strife. In many ways, this makes Linzi’s story all the more heart-wrenching. Her ability to maintain a façade of normalcy, even when grappling with dark thoughts, underscores the devastating complexity of mental health issues. It highlights the fact that even those who may outwardly appear joyous and content can be silently battling immense emotional pain. It serves as a potent reminder that we must take extra care in understanding, recognising, and supporting those, who behind their brave smiles and buoyant demeanour, could be waging a secret war against depression and despair. Following a comprehensive review of the circumstances surrounding Miss Mannion's demise, the coroner recorded an open verdict. This means that even after an in-depth investigation, given the existing evidence, the coroner could not definitively categorize Mannion’s death as suicide, accident or another cause. It is an unsatisfactory ending to a distressing sequence of events that started with joy and ended in grief. As a society, it is our duty to work towards dispelling the stigma that continues to shroud mental health, a daunting villain that took from us, Linzi Mannio, a loving mother and a cherished friend. This tragic story should further propel the conversation about mental health, underlining the importance of providing better support structures, improving mental health education and raising awareness for postnatal depression. It is crucial to remind every individual silently struggling, that there is help available and that they don’t have to walk this painful path alone. In a world that relentlessly pursues resilience and cheer, let the tale of Linzi Mannion be a cautionary tale, compelling us to stop, to listen, to understand, and above all, to extend our empathy to those around us.

They believed that He was coming again in a very little while during their own life-time, in a few months or years, to make an end of the world and to judge the quick and the dead. And as they waited for His coming, one generation after another, and yet He did not come, a sadness fell upon them. Christ seemed to have left the world. The little while that He had promised to be away seemed to have become a very long while. Hundreds of years passed, and yet Christ did not come in glory. And, as I said, a sadness fell on all the Church. Surely, they said, this is the time of which Christ said we were to weep and lament till we saw Him again--this is the time of which He said that the bridegroom should be taken from us, and we should fast in those days. And they did fast, and weep, and lament; and their religion became a very sad and melancholy one--most sad in those who were most holy, and loved their Lord best, and longed most for His coming in glory.

When their younger sister Polly asks Tom if the Queen is coming to their house, Tom says that she only exists in the story. However, the Snow Queen really does live in an icy palace in the North Pole with her three troll servants: Eric, Baggy, and Wardrobe. Her plan is to set up her huge magic mirror on a mountain to reflect the sunlight away so the entire world will become her kingdom. But the mirror falls down the mountain and lands on the trolls' flying machine where it shatters into pieces. Two of the pieces hit Tom in the eye and the heart that he falls into an evil curse. The Snow Queen sends her bats to retrieve the pieces. As they cannot take the two that are inside Tom, the Queen goes out to kidnap him. Ellie and Tom connect their sleds to a bigger sled that is revealed to be driven by the Snow Queen. She takes Tom to her palace and cuts Ellie off of her sled, causing her to fall onto a talking bird named Peeps. Ellie goes out to save Tom from her and Peeps reluctantly decides to go with her. In a snowy forest, they find a house belonging to an old woman, who appears nice, but is actually an evil witch but traps them to use Ellie's heart for her elixir of life so she can be eternally young. Peeps tricks the witch's cat, Cuddles, into chasing after him and knocking over the elixir of life, and uses the confusion to unlocks Ellie's cell. Ellie and Peeps escape and trap the witch in the basement. They then meet two humanoid birds named Les and Ivy, who, from Ellie's description of Tom, tell her that Tom is going to marry the princess, so Ellie becomes a member of the staff to serve the princess her food.

He took his coffee and walked up the stairs to the second floor. There were about fifty people standing in the hallway outside the courtroom making small talk. He recognized a few of them, but was in no mood to start a conversation. Only four more jurors and two alternates were needed. With a little luck, he would soon be sent on his way. The coffee tasted bitter, but he continued to sip on it anyway, just to occupy himself. After a few minutes, a woman walked out of the courtroom and spoke to the crowd in monotone. \\"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We are ready to get started.

The earthquake did indeed measure 6.9 on the moment magnitude scale and lasted around 10–15 seconds. As for the survivors, the aftermath of the Loma Prieta earthquake led to multiple responses including recovery efforts, financial assistance, and changes in building codes to minimize damages in future earthquakes. Here's a brief summary of what happened to survivors: 1. Immediate earthquake response: Emergency services, organizations, and volunteers provided aid by rescuing trapped individuals, offering medical assistance, and securing damaged infrastructure. 2. Government and financial assistance: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Office of Emergency Services, the Small Business Administration, and other government agencies provided financial resources to affected individuals and businesses for rebuilding and recovery. 3. Emotional support: Mental health services, counseling, and support groups were provided to help earthquake survivors cope with the trauma, loss, and emotional impact of the disaster. 4. Updated building codes: After the earthquake, local and state officials revised building codes to enhance safety and seismic resilience in newer constructions. The goal was to prevent extensive damages and fatalities in future earthquakes. The lives of the survivors of the 1989 California earthquake varied greatly, and their specific experiences depended on multiple factors like personal situations, economic status, and the level of support they received in the aftermath of the disaster. In general, survivors had to rebuild their lives and adapt to the changes brought about by the major disaster."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Read this article and answer this question Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, MK was in essence a political pressure group rather than a true political party, with members being able to join other political parties as well. It campaigned for the establishment of a Cornish University, a Cornish Industrial Board, and the repatriation of Heligoland Fresians whose land was used by the British government as a bombing range in the mid-1950s. It published numerous policy papers to support its positions. MK gained popularity in the 1960s, when it campaigned against 'overspill' housing developments in Cornwall to accommodate incomers from Greater London. In April 1967, Colin Murley was elected for MK onto Cornwall County Council for the seat of St Day and Lanner; he had stood on an anti-overspill platform. In 1968, the first edition of Cornish Nation was published; this is the party's magazine. However, by the 1970s the group developed into a more coherent and unified organisation. During this decade, MK began contesting Westminster parliamentary seats as well as local government ones. It held rallies in support of Cornwall's fishing industry and against regional unemployment and nuclear waste; in the 1980s, these rallies were aggravated by the policies of the incumbent Thatcher government. The party grew to become the leading champion for Cornish nationalism, superceding the Stannary Parliament in this respect. The party opposed the Common Market. MK contested the 1979 European Parliament election, winning 5.9% of the vote in the constituency of Cornwall and West Plymouth.

Given the below context: Peace between England and the Netherlands in 1688 meant that the two countries entered the Nine Years' War as allies, but the conflict—waged in Europe and overseas between France, Spain and the Anglo-Dutch alliance—left the English a stronger colonial power than the Dutch, who were forced to devote a larger proportion of their military budget on the costly land war in Europe. The 18th century saw England (after 1707, Britain) rise to be the world's dominant colonial power, and France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage.The death of Charles II of Spain in 1700 and his bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire to Philippe of Anjou, a grandson of the King of France, raised the prospect of the unification of France, Spain and their respective colonies, an unacceptable state of affairs for England and the other powers of Europe. In 1701, England, Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the Holy Roman Empire against Spain and France in the War of the Spanish Succession, which lasted until 1714. At the concluding Treaty of Utrecht, Philip renounced his and his descendants' right to the French throne and Spain lost its empire in Europe. The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained Newfoundland and Acadia, and from Spain, Gibraltar and Menorca.

With the German occupation of Western Europe, the intensification of submarine and air attack on Britain's sea communications was feared by the British. Such an event would have serious consequences on the future course of the war, should the Germans succeed. Liverpool and its port became an important destination for convoys heading through the Western Approaches from North America, bringing supplies and materials. The considerable rail network distributed to the rest of the country. Operations against Liverpool in the Liverpool Blitz were successful. Air attacks sank 39,126 long tons (39,754 t) of shipping, with another 111,601 long tons (113,392 t) damaged. Minister of Home Security Herbert Morrison was also worried morale was breaking, noting the defeatism expressed by civilians. Other sources point to half of the port's 144 berths rendered unusable, while cargo unloading capability was reduced by 75%. Roads and railways were blocked and ships could not leave harbour. On 8 May 1941, 57 ships were destroyed, sunk or damaged amounting to 80,000 long tons (81,000 t). Around 66,000 houses were destroyed, 77,000 people made homeless, and 1,900 people killed and 1,450 seriously hurt on one night. Operations against London up until May 1941 could also have a severe impact on morale. The populace of the port of Hull became 'trekkers', people who underwent a mass exodus from cities before, during, and after attacks. However, the attacks failed to knock out or damage railways, or port facilities for long, even in the Port of London, a target of many attacks.

Which sport is thought to derive its name from the French for ‘take it’ (and thus ‘play’)????","completion":"The sport that is thought to derive its name from the French for \\"take it\\" (and thus \\"play\\") is tennis. The origin of the word tennis goes back to the French term \\"tenez.\\" The history of tennis is quite fascinating and spans centuries, with its roots dating back to ancient times. The term \\"tenez\\" was used by the French in the 11th or 12th century when the sport first emerged as \\"jeu de paume\\" or the game of palm. In this early version of tennis, players would use their bare hands, or later, a padded glove, to strike a ball back and forth over a net or a marked space. As the game evolved, racquets were introduced - making it more recognizable as the sport we know today. Players would begin each point by shouting \\"tenez,\\" which means \\"take it\\" or \\"play,\\" to their opponent to indicate they were about to serve the ball. Given the popularity of the sport among French-speaking nobility, it is believed that the word tennis originated from the repeated use of this term. Tennis began to gain widespread attention and enthusiasm throughout Europe between the 16th and 17th centuries. It was during this time that the sport was often referred to as \\"royal tennis.\\" Many famous historical figures, including kings, popes, and other members of the nobility, were known to have been avid tennis players. The modern game of tennis, with the rules and equipment we are familiar with now, began to emerge in the late 19th century, as the sport's popularity spread to other English-speaking countries like the United States, Australia, and England. Major Walter Clopton Wingfield, a British army officer, played a crucial role in modernizing the sport in 1873 when he patented a game called \\"scriber,\\" which consisted of an hourglass-shaped court, a net, and the use of rubber balls. This game was designed to be adaptable to different outdoor environments and was easily playable in lawns or gardens, as the name \\"lawn tennis\\" suggests. As tennis continued to evolve, so did its rules and regulations. In 1877, the first Wimbledon championship took place in London, paving the way for the future of the sport, including global competitions and grand slam tournaments. Today, tennis is enjoyed and played by millions worldwide, both as a recreational activity and as a professional sport."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The adjustable intensity slider allows me to find the perfect level of illumination for any situation, whether I need just a soft glow to avoid waking up my spouse or a powerful beam to light up the entire backyard. 3. Efficiency: I have found that using the com.colinmcdonough.android.torch app does not quickly drain my phone's battery life compared to other flashlight apps. It utilizes the device's hardware features such as the LED flash efficiently, allowing for prolonged usage without worrying about my phone dying. 4. Strobe Function: The app includes a strobe function that I have found particularly useful in emergencies or situations where I need to signal for help. With a simple swipe, I can change the flashlight mode to the blinking strobe, making my device easy to spot in the dark. Cons: 1. Ads: Unfortunately, one aspect that detracts from the overall experience of using the com.colinmcdonough.android.torch app is the presence of ads. Although I understand that ads help to keep the app free, sometimes they can be obtrusive and affect my ability to use the flashlight quickly. 2. Lack of Additional Features: As a minimalistic app, it does not boast an extensive list of features like some other flashlight apps do. Users looking for features like the color-changing flashlight, SOS mode, or other specialized functions might be left feeling unsatisfied. Final Thoughts: Overall, the com.colinmcdonough.android.torch app is a reliable flashlight tool that gets the job done. Its simplicity and ease of use, paired with the customizable brightness levels and strobe function, make it ideal for those who just need a quick, reliable source of light. The app could benefit from the removal or reduction of ads and consider adding some innovative features in future updates. But with that said, this flashlight app has performed admirably and has earned a 4 out of 5-star rating from me."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It is the story of a young boy named Pi who spends 227 days at sea with a small group of animals after disaster strikes their ship and is an account of his journey of survival and hardship. Piscine \\"Pi\\" Molitor Patel, on whom Life of Pi is based, is a young boy living in Pondicherry, India, where his father owns a zoo. The story starts when Patel's family decide to move to Canada, along with their zoo animals for their new home. However, because of the bad weather, the ship sinks. Pi along with an orangutan , an injured zebra, a hyena and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker are the only survivors who take shelter in a small lifeboat. Both the injured zebra and the orangutan are soon killed and eaten by the hyena. The tiger in turn kills and eats the hyena, leaving just the two of them alone on the boat now. In an effort to avoid being eaten by Richard Parker, Pi acts himself as the head of the group and remains safe from harm. Since he does not want the tiger to die for fear of going mad by being alone on the boat, he fishes and feeds the two of them in order to stay alive. The life of Pi then enters its third stage when their lifeboat washes up on the shores of Mexico and the tiger escapes into a nearby forest leaving Pi alone. After the Mexicans refuse to believe Pi's story, he changes his tale by replacing the animals with his mother, a cook and a sailor and asks the Mexicans which one they prefer. They prefer hearing the first story though they do not believe a word of it. In my view, Life of Pi is a must read book for all those who love reading. 1.

She was always stressed from her studies, pressure and job, so she would go out, most oftenly with me, to places and times we shouldn’t have been. She would just decide, in the middle of the night, even as early as 2 in the morning that we should just race the city, see places… She always had those cravings to do stuff at strange times, getting to sport events with me at the other bit of the country… This crazy kind of life got us in a big lot of troubles. People trying rape her, attack us and much many more. it was happening too often and I often had to be quite violent to these people so she stays in one piece. I had to fix a lot of crap in order for her to live fully her fantasy. But I was more worried for her than me and I wanted us settle down, calm and have children we could raise peacefully. There was that one night where, we both came back very late from a sport competition, we had to travel dangerous roads very late at night sometimes by bus, foot and other times subway. At one point that night, two drug addicts tried to rape her, so I did what I had to do, but still I didn’t kill them. Then I shoved her and I really mean shove, inside a taxi, got in there too and asked it back home. When I arrived, she was denying the danger, denying anything wrong with her way to behave. So I really snapped, I just pulled my ring and chains away, threw them on the table in front of her and I told her the sentence I mentionned up there. I was harsh on her that night in my words and symbol but I just couldn’t take that way anymore According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: How to be positive and realistic, at the same time Kathy Cramer is a psychologist and leadership consultant who specializes in helping leaders and their teams make small shifts in thinking to produce large impacts. She is also the author of the new book “Lead Positive: What Highly Effective Leaders See, Say & Do.” Cramer spoke with Tom Fox, a guest writer for On Leadership and vice president for leadership and innovation at the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service. Fox also heads up their Center for Government Leadership. Q. What do you consider to be the top skills that create long-term success as a leader in government? A. I think optimism and confidence are two assets that really help a leader go the distance. I also believe the ability to empathize and inspire are key. Lastly, when looking at a leader in a time of crisis, it is important for employees to see a high degree of resilience. This is proof that a leader can be proactive after a big setback. Q. What's the concept of “lead positive”? A. In the book, we’ve identified the chain reaction of see, say and do. The first component, see, is a leader’s ability to grab the spotlight of attention and then focus it on something worthwhile. Strong leaders look for possibilities more often than problems and, as a result, they have the ability to see the upside. The say piece is how leaders start the conversation around an action. And then the do is the ability to take action in order to leverage that upside. When what you see, say and do is aligned to capitalize on the possibilities, you are “leading positive.” Q. Federal leaders are facing intense pressure to deliver results in an uncertain and tight fiscal environment. What techniques can they use to see the positive despite the challenges? A. Leaders should acknowledge the obstacles, but then make it clear that the organization intends to prevail in spite of the challenges. Use your mission and cause to inspire people, and make them invest and support one another with a culture of can-do and sacrifice. People will feel proud of making a sacrifice if the end gain is worth it. You see that especially in the public sector. People in this sector are used to doing more with less, and there’s nothing like a setback to wake you up and make you more creative. I like to call it realistic optimism. When you put what you cannot control out of the picture, what you’re optimistic about is human ingenuity. Q. How can individuals facing tough situations be realistically optimistic? A. Although it may seem difficult, harnessing a setback and using it to propel you forward can be exceptionally rewarding. For instance, I helped the Air Force when they decided to downsize for the first time. Some of their employees had planned for a 20-year career that was now abruptly ending, so I joined forces with Family Support Center to work not only with the enlisted people but also with the families. It takes an amount of adaptation time to figure out what you’re going to create for the rest of your life, but if you’re in a structured process that helps you, chances are that the end result will be very successful. Q. How do you define resilience? A. I see resilience as when you’ve had a big setback, in the form of either a big moment or a small moment, and it causes you to hit the reset button. You’ve been stopped on your way to an important goal, and the goal is blocked and there is no way around it. Resilience is figuring out what new goal, what new aspirations you are going to tap into so that you can keep going. Resilience is also about being analytical and creative simultaneously. You have to analyze and ask yourself, “Is this setback really it?” I tend to think of continuing down the same path as determination. I think of resilience as “I’m really stopped, and I have to figure out a new way.” Q. How can federal leaders more effectively communicate with their employees? A. Leaders do not realize how important they are in driving the change. They have a ripple effect that they often underestimate. People follow people, not just great ideas. Leaders have to put themselves into the equation – you are as important if not more so than any other strategy. People need to look at you, hear from you, and they need to know how much they matter. I like to tell people that substance is critically important. It’s your credibility card. You have to give people details about the substance — the details about how life and this organization will be different. The second element is the sizzle. You need to weave a story that has emotional value to your employees, whether it is an elevator speech or an hour town-hall meeting. The third element, soul, is the why: why you, the leader, care and why they, the audience, should care. It’s the leader’s skin in the game. How to take charge of your career Like On Leadership?

The Local Government (Northern Ireland) Act 1972 (1972 c. 9) was an Act of the Parliament of Northern Ireland that constituted district councils to administer the twenty-six local government districts created by the Local Government (Boundaries) Act (Northern Ireland) 1971, and abolished the existing local authorities in Northern Ireland. Can we infer the following? Northern Ireland has several localized government districs Select from the following. (I) Yes (II) It's impossible to say (III) No The answer is:","completion":"(I) Yes. The Local Government (Northern Ireland) Act 1972 did create twenty-six local government districts to be administered by district councils. This could be viewed as establishing several localized government districts in Northern Ireland. The Act reorganized the way local government was carried out in Northern Ireland, replacing the previous system of local authorities. These new local government districts would each be run by a district council which would have responsibility for a range of local services. These could have included housing, planning, waste management, and cultural or environmental services. This move can be seen as a decentralization of powers, pushing the responsibility for certain services and decisions down to a local level. This development would have had important implications for the governance of Northern Ireland, not only in terms of structures and systems of local administration, but also potentially in terms of the political dynamics within and between various districts. This act was part of a wider program of local government reform in the United Kingdom around this time, which included similar measures being taken in England, Wales, and Scotland. It's important to note that local government in Northern Ireland, as in other parts of the UK, operates within a larger governmental and administrative structure which includes regional and national levels of government, such as the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Westminster. The details of how these local government districts have operated since their creation by this Act in 1972, including their relationship with other levels of government and how these relationships have evolved over time, would be a complex matter that would likely depend on a range of factors, including political, demographic, and economic factors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Companies, communities, families, clubs, and other clumps of humans all have some inherent social dynamics. At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that. Many leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance. This is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP. As such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization. Sadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in. So much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn’t be…frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach. I believe though, that there are a lot of relatively simple things we can do to make organizations feel more engaging. social dynamics cause frustration in the organization when - The gap widens between ground folks and senior leadership - the founder lack skills to take their vision to actionable work - the employee followers lack structure - not enough information A:","completion":"Social dynamics can cause frustration in an organization when: 1. The gap between ground-level employees and senior leadership widens: As a company grows, it's common for a disconnect to emerge between the top management and the employees working on the frontlines. This gap can result in distrust, miscommunication, and a lack of understanding of each other's perspectives. 2. Founders or leaders lack the skills to turn their vision into actionable work: Visionary leaders may have great ideas, but if they are unable to effectively communicate or implement those ideas, it can cause frustration among team members. Employees may struggle to understand the direction or goals of the organization, resulting in confusion and decreased motivation. 3. Employee followers lack structure: While some employees thrive in open-ended environments, many require structure and guidance in order to be most effective in their roles. When there is inadequate structure provided by management, employees can feel lost, disorganized, and overwhelmed, leading to frustration. 4. Inadequate information sharing: Communication is key in any organization. When information is not shared effectively or is withheld, either intentionally or unintentionally, it can create tension and misunderstandings among team members. This lack of transparency can lead to distrust and frustration, as employees may feel excluded or left in the dark about important decisions or processes. To mitigate these issues, organizations should prioritize open communication, encourage collaboration, provide structure and support when needed, and promote an inclusive environment where all employees feel valued and heard. By addressing these social dynamics, organizations can enhance employee satisfaction, performance, and overall success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Delirious, he stumbles across the North African desert into the Empress of Britain, a small, isolated hotel owned by Farid (Akim Tamiroff). The staff consists of just Frenchwoman Mouche (Anne Baxter), as the cook has fled and the waiter Davos was killed the night before by German bombing. Before Farid and Mouche can decide what to do with the newcomer, the swiftly advancing Germans take over the hotel to use as headquarters for Field Marshal Rommel (Erich von Stroheim) and his staff. Bramble assumes the identity of Davos to save himself. When Rommel summons him to a private chat, Bramble is stunned to discover that Davos was a valued German spy, but manages to play along. He learns that he is to be sent to Cairo next. Later, he steals a pistol from genial, music-loving Italian General Sebastiano (Fortunio Bonanova), planning to serve the field marshal a bullet rather than coffee the next morning. Not wanting trouble, Mouche steals the pistol and waits on Rommel herself. When some captured British officers are brought to the hotel for a luncheon with Rommel, one of them (a past guest) realizes that Davos has been replaced. Bramble privately explains who he is and what he plans to do. The officer orders him to use his position of trust to instead gather military intelligence. At the luncheon, Rommel teases his guests, allowing them to ask him twenty questions about his future plans. Bramble listens with interest. From the conversation and later remarks by Rommel, he eventually deduces that the field marshal, disguised as an archeologist before the war, had secretly prepared five hidden supply dumps, the \\"Five Graves to Cairo\\", for the conquest of Egypt.

Title: Domestic Disturbance Movie plot: Susan Morrison (Teri Polo), recently divorced from her husband Frank (John Travolta) who is a struggling boat builder, is getting married to an industrialist who is younger and wealthier. His name is Rick Barnes (Vince Vaughn). Danny (Matt O'Leary), Susan and Frank's 12 year old son is clearly unhappy with his mother re-marrying.

I read this background article the other day: An apex predator, also known as an alpha predator or top predator, is a predator at the top of a food chain, with no natural predators.Apex predators are usually defined in terms of trophic dynamics, meaning that they occupy the highest trophic levels. Food chains are often far shorter on land, usually limited to being secondary consumers – for example, wolves prey mostly upon large herbivores (primary consumers), which eat plants (primary producers).

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: One piece is perpendicular to the other, with one pointy end lined up with the slot in the top center of the other piece. Both pieces should be face down, so that the corners want to fold in to the table you're working on rather than out into the air. Make sure to choose the appropriate corner and slot so that the squares at the center of each piece are now positioned perfectly next to each other. The diagonal line on the bottom triangle of the white piece should perfectly line up with the diagonal line going across the center of the red piece. It should also be face down and even with the center of the red piece. The diagonal corner of the blue piece should be parallel to the diagonal line pointed out in the step above. The two diagonal lines pointed out above should now meet to form just one diagonal line going from the corner of the red square to the corner of the white triangle, with the blue triangle sitting along the line. The three squares at the center of each piece should be lined up in the shape of an L with the red at the corner, so that the red square borders the other two and the white and blue squares only touch at one corner. The white corner is the end of the diagonal line referred to above. Slip it into the nearest blue pocket. This will create a half cube, formed by three squares which all border each other. Each side should also be half its original color and half the color of the piece that got tucked into it. The figure will now be 3D, so that it can no longer sit flat on the table. When you position the cube with one side on the table, the leftover corners should form diagonal halves of the last three sides of the cube. From this position, you can easily add the next side. Make sure it's lined up the right way. The top triangle will line up perfectly with the triangle from the earlier piece of the same color so that those two triangles together will form a square on one of the other sides left to be filled. The other triangle, the bottom one of the piece you're putting in, should tuck into a fold on a side already in place. Here, slide the white corner into the blue pocket to attach the blue piece. Where possible, tuck loose corners into the corresponding pockets on the sides they should attach to. Again, make sure the piece is lined up such that its triangular corners can slip into the pockets on the sides they should attach to. Tuck loose corners into their corresponding pockets. At this point, you should have two loose flaps on the only side left to add; everything else should be tucked in. Again, line it up such that the loose flaps will fit into the pockets of the piece.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings.

Parents should avoid leaving children under five unsupervised in front of the TV, the creator of Jackanory and Play School warned today. Joy Whitby, 82, who launched the BBC shows in the Sixties before working at ITV, is worried about ‘the glutting amount for children from early morning six till six’. The Oxford history graduate, who gained a job on Play School after writing about how the Watch With Mother slot could be refreshed, said she was saddened by today’s ‘noisy, meretricious cartoons’. Concerns: Joy Whitby (pictured second left at a London Weekend board meeting in 1969), now aged 82, is worried about 'the glutting amount for children from early morning six till six' ‘If I had a child under five at home again, I wouldn’t want to leave him in front of the television set unsupervised if I could possibly help it,’ Ms Whitby told the Daily Telegraph. She said small children should not be ‘endlessly watching’, adding: ‘I have been to houses where that happens and I am horrified, because I think “I’m not sure you’re watching anything worthwhile”.’ Ms Whitby claimed the proliferation of children’s TV content during the day has resulted in a 'total loss of the sense of occasion’ and youngsters can’t look forward to a show they can get all the time. She did praise the Horrible Histories series on CBBC but told the Daily Telegraph that the worst programmes on TV nowadays ‘exploit stereotypical characters’ and have ‘no real story’.

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump disclosed in a financial report filed with the government’s ethics watchdog Tuesday that he had reimbursed his personal lawyer more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses. In his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had “fully reimbursed” his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of 100,000 to 250,000 in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment. The disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a “reportable” liability, Trump chose to list it “in the interest of transparency.” It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn’t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year. The Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met “the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability” under the Ethics in Government Act. Under the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of 10,000 during the previous reporting period. “Knowingly or willfully” falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties. Trump listed several hundred million dollars in liabilities in his financial report. Critics seized on... How long ago did Trump probably pay Cohen 130,000?

Information: - Food additives are substances added to food to preserve flavor or enhance its taste and appearance. Some additives have been used for centuries; for example, preserving food by pickling (with vinegar), salting, as with bacon, preserving sweets or using sulfur dioxide as with wines. With the advent of processed foods in the second half of the twentieth century, many more additives have been introduced, of both natural and artificial origin. - In chemistry, pH (potential of hydrogen) is a numeric scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution. It is approximately the negative of the base 10 logarithm of the molar concentration, measured in units of moles per liter, of hydrogen ions. More precisely it is the negative of the logarithm to base 10 of the activity of the hydrogen ion. Solutions with a pH less than 7 are acidic and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic. Pure water is neutral, at pH 7, being neither an acid nor a base. Contrary to popular belief, the pH value can be less than 0 or greater than 14 for very strong acids and bases respectively. - Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances. - In mathematics, the logarithm is the inverse operation to exponentiation. That means the logarithm of a number is the exponent to which another fixed number, the base, must be raised to produce that number. In simple cases the logarithm counts factors in multiplication. For example, the base logarithm of is , as to the power is; 10 is used as a factor three times. More generally, exponentiation allows any positive real number to be raised to any real power, always producing a positive result, so the logarithm can be calculated for any two positive real numbers and where is not equal to . The logarithm of to \\"base\\" , denoted , is the unique real number such that For example, as , then: - Petroleum (from : \\"rock\\" + \\"oleum\\": \\"oil\\". ) is a naturally occurring, yellow-to-black liquid found in geological formations beneath the Earth's surface, which is commonly refined into various types of fuels. Components of petroleum are separated using a technique called fractional distillation. - Sunset Yellow FCF ( also known as Orange Yellow S , or C.I. 15985 ) is a petroleum - derived orange azo dye with a pH dependent maximum absorption at about 480 nm at pH 1 and 443 nm at pH 13 with a shoulder at 500 nm . When added to foods sold in the US it is known as FD&C Yellow 6 ; when sold in Europe , it is denoted by E Number E110 . - Fractional distillation is the separation of a mixture into its component parts, or fractions, separating chemical compounds by their boiling point by heating them to a temperature at which one or more fractions of the compound will vaporize. It uses distillation to fractionate. Generally the component parts have boiling points that differ by less than 25 °C from each other under a pressure of one atmosphere. If the difference in boiling points is greater than 25 °C, a simple distillation is typically used. - A hydrogen ion is created when a hydrogen atom loses or gains an electron. A lone positively charged hydrogen ion (or proton) can readily combine with other particles and therefore is only seen isolated when it is in a gaseous state or a nearly particle free space. Due to its extremely high charge density of approximately 2×10 times that of a sodium ion, the bare hydrogen ion cannot exist freely in solution as it readily hydrates, i.e., bonds quickly. The hydrogen ion is recommended by IUPAC as a general term for all ions of hydrogen and its isotopes. Depending on the charge of the ion, two different classes can be distinguished: positively charged ions and negatively charged ions. - Distillation is a process of separating the component or substances from a liquid mixture by selective evaporation and condensation. Distillation may result in essentially complete separation (nearly pure components), or it may be a partial separation that increases the concentration of selected components of the mixture. In either case the process exploits differences in the volatility of the mixture's components. In industrial chemistry, distillation is a unit operation of practically universal importance, but it is a physical separation process and not a chemical reaction. - A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure. As such, it is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape. A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular bonds. Water is, by far, the most common liquid on Earth. Like a gas, a liquid is able to flow and take the shape of a container. Most liquids resist compression, although others can be compressed. Unlike a gas, a liquid does not disperse to fill every space of a container, and maintains a fairly constant density. A distinctive property of the liquid state is surface tension, leading to wetting phenomena. - A mordant or dye fixative is a substance used to set dyes on fabrics or tissue sections by forming a coordination complex with the dye which then attaches to the fabric or tissue. It may be used for dyeing fabrics, or for intensifying stains in cell or tissue preparations. The term mordant comes from the present participle of French \\"mordre\\", \\"to bite\\". In the past, it was thought that a mordant helped the dye bite onto the fiber so that it would hold fast during washing. A mordant is often a polyvalent metal ion. The resulting coordination complex of dye and ion is colloidal and can be either acidic or alkaline. - Molar concentration, also called molarity, amount concentration or substance concentration, is a measure of the concentration of a solute in a solution, or of any chemical species, in terms of amount of substance in a given volume. A commonly used unit for molar concentration used in chemistry is mol/L. A solution of concentration 1 mol/L is also denoted as 1 molar (1 ). - A dye is a colored substance that has an affinity to the substrate to which it is being applied. The dye is generally applied in an aqueous solution, and may require a mordant to improve the fastness of the dye on the fiber. - Fiber or fibre (from the Latin fibra) is a natural or synthetic substance that is significantly longer than it is wide. Fibers are often used in the manufacture of other materials. The strongest engineering materials often incorporate fibers, for example carbon fiber and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene. - An aqueous solution is a solution in which the solvent is water. It is usually shown in chemical equations by appending (aq) to the relevant chemical formula. For example, a solution of table salt, or sodium chloride (NaCl), in water would be represented as Na(aq) + Cl(aq). The word \\"aqueous\\" means pertaining to, related to, similar to, or dissolved in water. As water is an excellent solvent and is also naturally abundant, it is a ubiquitous solvent in chemistry. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Oleum (Latin \\"oleum\\" = \\"oil\\"), or fuming sulfuric acid, is a solution of various compositions of sulfur trioxide in sulfuric acid, or sometimes more specifically to disulfuric acid (also known as pyrosulfuric acid). Oleum is idenfied by the CAS number 8014-95-7. - In computer science, ACID (\\"Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability\\") is a set of properties of database transactions. In the context of databases, a single logical operation on the data is called a transaction. For example, a transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single transaction. - E numbers are codes for substances that are permitted to be used as food additives for use within the European Union and Switzerland. The \\"E\\" stands for \\"Europe\\". Commonly found on food labels, their safety assessment and approval are the responsibility of the European Food Safety Authority. - A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases chemical or nuclear energy as heat or to be used for work. The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion). - Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color \\"categories\\", with names such as red, yellow, purple, or bronze. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of light. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc. Human trichromacy is the basis for all modern color spaces that assign colors numerical coordinates and associate corresponding distances between colors. - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life.

But 130 out of 179 hospital trusts are reporting rates exceeding this for general hospital beds. Hospital managers said the problem was causing \\"deeply worrying\\" delays for these patients. They are people who have already faced a wait to be seen in A&E but whose condition is deemed to be so serious they need to be admitted on to a ward. About one in five people who come to A&E fall into this category and it includes the frail elderly and patients with chest pains, breathing problems and fractures. 11% of emergency patients face a 4 hour \\"trolley wait\\" 5x increase in numbers waiting over 4 hours for a bed since 2011 474,453 patients waited +4 hours for a bed 2015-16 97,559 patients waited +4 hours for a bed 2010-11 The BBC analysed official NHS England figures and found 473,453 patients waited more than four hours for a bed between October 2015 and September 2016 - 11% of the 4.2 million patients admitted in total during the period. More than 1,400 of them faced delays of more than 12 hours. It compares with 97,559 \\"trolley waits\\" in 2010-11 - although NHS England pointed out a small fraction of the rise could be attributed to a change in the way the waits were measured in December 2015. Directly comparable figures are not available for other parts of the UK, although data suggests there is an increasing strain on beds. While the delays are known as \\"trolley waits\\" not all patients find themselves on one. Hospitals use all sorts of areas, including side rooms, seats in the A&E department and spare cubicles depending on what is available. Rupert Nathan, 55, was rushed to hospital in an ambulance when he started suffering chest pains at home in June. He had previously had two angioplasties - one in 2000 and one in 2001 - because of angina and feared he was having a heart attack. He was taken by ambulance to Barnet Hospital in north London and was given blood and heart tests. At that point, staff decided to admit him for further checks. But he spent more than five hours waiting for a bed. \\"I was left in a waiting area with my girlfriend. I was in pain and really concerned. There was little contact with staff and it was after midnight when I was finally found a bed.\\" He asked for morphine and was told he would undergo scans in the morning. But when morning came, he was in a much better state and was discharged. \\"I was told the delays were because it was very busy. I could see that, but it's still not acceptable.\\" Mr Nathan has made a complaint about his care. The hospital said it was sorry about the long wait, but said this can happen at busy times. It said it had to prioritise patients and maintained the way he was cared for was \\"appropriate\\". Siva Anandaciva, of NHS Providers which represents hospitals, said: \\"These figures are deeply worrying. We are heading into winter in a more fragile state than I have seen in the past 10 years or so. \\"Even the historically top-performing trusts are being challenged, which shows that this is an issue affecting all parts of health. \\"No-one wants to see people waiting in corridors, side rooms and emergency bays when they should be admitted to a hospital bed. These patients are still under the care of doctors and nurses of course, but it is not ideal for them and we know overcrowding leads to worse outcomes.\\" Dr Chris Moulton, of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, echoed the concerns. \\"Patients who are delayed like this are still being monitored by staff. But we know that the overcrowding we are seeing is dangerous. It leads to worse outcomes for patients - higher infection rates, patients ending up on the wrong wards and generally a negative experience.\\" Dr Moulton believes there are too few beds. There are just over 100,000 general beds in England - a fall of 40,000 in the past 20 years. \\"We simply don't have enough. If you compare us to other European countries we are really short and the demands being placed on the health service means we are now struggling to cope,\\" he added. A spokesman for NHS England said \\"growing demand\\" was putting pressure on the system - the number of emergency admissions having risen by more than 500,000 in five years to 4.2 million. But he added it was \\"a tribute to front-line staff\\" that the NHS was able to handle so many patients.

Hospitals have special places called wards, where people can stay until they feel better. Sometimes there are a lot of sick people, and there aren't enough beds for everyone. In the UK, many hospitals have this problem. People might have to wait in other places, like hallways or small rooms, until a bed is available. Doctors and nurses still take care of them, but it's not the best situation.

Summarize: There's also another \\"banned\\" BBC programme on the digital shelf, the 1976 Dennis Potter drama Brimstone and Treacle which was withdrawn from transmission after the director general at the time, Alasdair Milne described it as 'brilliantly made' but \\"nauseating\\". The launch of BBC Store is a sign that as the years go by programmes can go from being impossible to show to being a way of generating a little extra revenue. So - beyond the familiar classic series over the BBC's history what programmes ought to be picked out from the archive? Here's a collection of a few programmes that were in their time on the BBC's \\"do not show under any circumstance\\" list and a few that will probably never appear on the store. A documentary about Harold Wilson and the Labour Cabinet after losing the 1970 election. The mocking tone and the questions about money making from Wilson's memoirs so enraged the former Prime Minister that it wasn't shown on the BBC for 42 years. It's now been shown in full on BBC Parliament. Ray Winstone and Phil Daniels starred in a violent tale about a young offenders institute. The violence, gang rape and racism were too much for the BBC controller Billy Cotton who banned it in 1977. It was finally shown in 1991. The film that followed it and caused a similar level of disquiet was The Firm about football hooligans. It was subjected to a number of cuts before it was shown but still caused a furore. It's now on the BBC store. At the time it was a jolly jape with Prince Edward and Princess Anne as team captains in a royal celebrity version of \\"It's a Knockout'. Toyah, George Lazenby, Su Pollard, John Travolta, John Cleese and Meatloaf all took part in the programme that has never been repeated. The show was anything but regal. There is also the now very uncomfortable presence of Stuart Hall - the presenter has been convicted for a string of sexual assaults on young girls. Chances of being released from the BBC vault? Low. The first series was shown in 1965 and never shown again. The witch was considered far too scary for younger viewers.","completion":"The article discusses various BBC programmes that were once banned or withheld from transmission due to their controversial content. One such programme is the 1976 Dennis Potter drama Brimstone and Treacle, which was considered \\"nauseating\\" by the BBC's director general at the time, Alasdair Milne. The launch of the BBC Store has allowed such programmes to go from being prohibited to generating revenue for the network. Among the programmes mentioned are a documentary about Harold Wilson, the former Prime Minister, and the Labour Cabinet after losing the 1970 election. The documentary, which mocked Wilson and questioned the financial gains from his memoirs, was banned from the BBC for 42 years. The content has since been aired in full on BBC Parliament. Another controversial programme is a violent tale about a young offenders institute featuring Ray Winstone and Phil Daniels. The violence, gang rape, and racism depicted in the programme were deemed too much for BBC controller Billy Cotton, and it was banned in 1977. The film eventually made it to the screens in 1991. The Firm, a separate film about football hooligans, faced a similar fate but has since found its way onto the BBC Store. One unique and largely forgotten show on the list was a royal celebrity version of \\"It's a Knockout,\\" featuring team captains Prince Edward and Princess Anne, and participants such as Toyah, George Lazenby, Su Pollard, John Travolta, John Cleese, and Meatloaf. The programme has never been repeated due to its lack of regal decorum and the involvement of presenter Stuart Hall, who has been convicted of multiple counts of sexual assault. Lastly, a children's series from 1965 featuring a witch proved too scary for young audiences and was never shown again after its initial airing."},{"prompt":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Joel, a nerdy bookworm who also does not fit in, becomes interested in Wednesday. Debbie and Fester become engaged. At their bachelor and bachelorette parties, Debbie is horrified by the Addams family. On their honeymoon, she tries to kill Fester by throwing a radio in the bathtub, but he survives. Frustrated by his resilience, Debbie forces him to sever ties with his family; when they try to visit Fester at Debbie's mansion, they are removed from the premises. At home, the Addams find to their alarm that Pubert has transformed into a rosy-cheeked, golden-haired baby.

Single/multi-select question: Does the sentence \\"From the early 13th century, the dominant sacred musical form had been the motet; a composition with text in several parts.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What was the dominant sacred musical form in the early 13th century?\\" Select from: A). yes; B). no;","completion":"A). Yes The sentence explicitly states that \\"From the early 13th century, the dominant sacred musical form had been the motet.\\" This clearly answers the question \\"What was the dominant sacred musical form in the early 13th century?\\" by identifying the motet as the primary musical form of that time period. The motet, in historical context, is a key component of early music, specifically within the realm of sacred sounds. Originating from the Medieval period, where voices and instruments were combined to create harmonies, motets were the predominant form of composition, especially in the realm of ecclesiastical or sacred music. In the 13th century, motets were essentially polytextual, meaning they contained more than one text sung simultaneously, often in Latin, with each voice in a different vernacular language. Frequently, these compositions were religious in nature, and would often featured multiple, contrasting musical themes or melodies. Therefore, when the sentence defines the motet as the \\"composition with text in several parts,\\" it is referring to this historical period where motets were the primary form of sacred music and were marked by their polytextual structure. Thus, the sentence not only provides a valid answer to the question posed, but it does so with an ample level of detail about the characteristics of the motet as a dominant sacred musical form during the early 13th century."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context: Martin's first recording session with the Beatles took place at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London on 6 June 1962. Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place. Already contemplating Best's dismissal, the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them. A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of \\"Love Me Do\\" featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"P.S. I Love You\\".Martin initially selected the Starr version of \\"Love Me Do\\" for the band's first single, though subsequent re-pressings featured the White version, with Starr on tambourine. Released in early October, \\"Love Me Do\\" peaked at number seventeen on the Record Retailer chart. Their television debut came later that month with a live performance on the regional news programme People and Places. After Martin suggested rerecording \\"Please Please Me\\" at a faster tempo, a studio session in late November yielded that recording, of which Martin accurately predicted, \\"You've just made your first No.1.\\"In December 1962, the Beatles concluded their fifth and final Hamburg residency. By 1963, they had agreed that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group. Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist. Epstein, in an effort to maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing. Lennon recalled him saying, \\"Look, if you really want to get in these bigger places, you're going to have to change – stop eating on stage, stop swearing, stop smoking ...\\" Lennon said: \\"We used to dress how we...

Plot title: Carnival of Souls Movie plot: Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) is riding in a car with two other young women when some men challenge them to a drag race. As they speed across a bridge, the women's car plunges over the side into the river. The police spend three hours dragging the murky, fast-running water without success. Mary miraculously surfaces, but she cannot remember how she survived. Mary then drives to Utah, where she has been hired as a church organist. At one point, she can get nothing on her car radio but strange organ music. She passes a large, abandoned pavilion sitting all by itself on the shores of the Great Salt Lake; it seems to beckon to her in the twilight. Shortly thereafter, while she is speeding along a deserted stretch of road, a ghoulish, pasty-faced figure (never identified, but called \\"The Man\\" in dialogue and played by director Herk Harvey, uncredited) replaces her reflection in the passenger window and stares at her. When The Man suddenly appears in front of her, she swerves off the road. At a gas station, the attendant tells her the pavilion was first a bathhouse, then a dance hall, and finally a carnival before shutting down. In town, Mary rents a room from Mrs. Thomas; John Linden, the only other lodger, wants to become better acquainted with the blonde newcomer, but she is not interested.

Instead, an appropriate answer would address the health conditions and diseases that were common or exacerbated due to the Great Depression. For example, the Great Depression led to increases in malnutrition, infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, and mental health issues like anxiety and depression as a result of high unemployment, poverty, and a lack of access to quality healthcare. Illnesses related to malnutrition, like pellagra and rickets, also became more widespread due to limited food sources and a lack of knowledge about proper nutrition. Poverty and overcrowding in urban areas made it easier for infectious diseases to spread, and a lack of resources and inadequate funding for public health programs made it difficult for health officials to address these concerns. Moreover, since people were struggling to meet basic needs, preventative healthcare and timely medical treatment were often neglected, thereby worsening health outcomes. In conclusion, the suggested statement does not provide a suitable answer to the question about diseases during the Great Depression.

A state house staffer who left his loaded handgun in the men's bathroom at the Capitol building is facing calls for his resignation. Dave Evans, a legislative assistant. to Republican House Speaker Tim Jones, left the loaded 9mm pistol on top of a. toilet paper dispenser in a men’s bathroom in the Missouri State Capitol. last Friday. Another House staffer found the gun and reported it to police. A gun safety group today called for Evans to be fired after he left the gun in the basement bathroom in Jefferson City, Missouri. Danger: Dave Evans (left), a legislative assistant to House Speaker Tim Jones (pictured right), left a loaded handgun in a bathroom at the State Capitol building in Missouri on Friday. A gun safety group is calling for a Missouri House staffer to be fired after he left a loaded handgun unattended in a Capitol bathroom in Jefferson Ci. Rebecca Morgan, spokeswoman for the Missouri chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said: 'Any child could’ve found that gun, or someone could’ve found it and resold it.' According to the police report, Evans has a concealed-carry permit. Police returned the gun to him, and no charges were filed. A 2011 law allows legislative staff with concealed-carry permits to bring firearms into the Capitol. Tom Smith, Jones’ chief of staff, said in a statement on Tuesday that Evans will take a gun safety course in the next few weeks as a result of the incident. 'He is extremely remorseful about this unfortunate incident and willing to take full accountability for his mistake,' Mr Smith said. Ms Morgan said the Missouri chapter of Moms Demand Action has asked Jones to issue an apology and to fire Evans. The. organization is also calling schools and asking them to cancel their. planned field trips to the Capitol, which houses the Missouri State. Museum. Dave Evans, left a Kahr CM9 9 mm gun, in a public bathroom stall at the Capitol building in Missouri (stock image) The museum received more than 470,000 visitors last year, according to its website. Of those, 30,000 were children on guided tours, according to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. Morgan said that just as mothers call their children’s friends’ houses before play dates to make sure all firearms are secured, parents and schools should be aware of safety risks within the Capitol building. 'My son is supposed to go later in the school year, and I don’t feel safe sending him to the Capitol,' she said. The Moms Demand Action group hopes its effort will help change the 2011 concealed-carry law. 'If (Evans) can have his fully loaded, ready-to-shoot, unattended gun in a restroom and there’s no law against it, the law needs to change,' Morgan said. She said the organization received no direct response from the Capitol. Moms Demand Action describes itself as a grassroots organization that formed nationwide after the December 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. 'It’s just a crying shame,' Morgan said of the unattended gun. 'It’s our responsibility as parents and as legislators to make sure that it doesn’t take losing a child’s life to change this law.'

Use sandpaper, steel wool, or anything else abrasive to clean away any grime or dirt from any areas of your pipes and fittings that need to be soldered. This will let your solder hold more tightly to the pipe and result in a more sturdy connection. You should only need to clean around 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of the piping to give you room to solder easily. If you're using a larger pipe fitting, you may need to clean more to ensure the point of overlap between the pipe and the fitting is prepared for soldering. Use 120-grit sandpaper or grade 1 steel wool for cleaning your pipe fittings. This should be enough to strip away dirt and grime without damaging the pipes themselves. If you plan on cutting and soldering a lot of pipes, you might benefit from a specialised pipe cleaner. This will let you more easily scrub away any impurities on the inside and outside of your pipes. Ask at your local hardware store or look online to find one that suits your needs. Use a small paintbrush to cover the ends of your pipes and the insides of your pipe fittings with a thin layer of flux. Look around the edges of the pipe for any large lumps of flux and brush them away. Any type of flux that you have will work when soldering pipes together. Acid flux will be more corrosive, but may damage pipes that are too fragile. Tinning flux will help hold your pipes together more strongly, but may be more difficult to find or more expensive. If you're unsure, ask at your local hardware store for advice on the best type of flux to use for the job you're working on. Hold the two sections you need to connect together in each hand, keeping them off of your work surface to prevent any flux from rubbing off. Push the two ends together securely until they are fully connected. Wipe away any flux that comes off with a clean paintbrush. You should connect a section of a few pipes together before you begin to solder them. Working one at a time may be very slow, and trying to deal with a long section all at once may be very difficult! Work with a few pieces at a time. Heat will make the metal expand, so you should always heat the larger sections of your pipes up before the smaller sections. Hold a soldering iron to the pipe, or use a blowtorch to heat the metal up until the soldering flux melts into the joint and begins to bubble slightly. When the flux is just starting to bubble and the pipe is hot, press the tip of the solder to the opposite side as you are holding the blowtorch. The solder should melt immediately and work into the joint to hold it together. Pull the torch away and quickly run the solder around the circumference of the joint to completely seal it. You should only need to use around 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) of the solder to completely seal the pipe. If the solder doesn't run into the joint and forms small beads that roll away from it instead, you might have burnt the flux or may not have cleaned the pipe properly. Wait until the pipes are cooled, disconnect them and start again. It's easier to reach around the back side of the pipe if you bend a small hook in the solder wire before you begin soldering. Grip the solder far enough away from the tip that you won't risk melted solder getting on your hands. For extra safety, wear fire-resistant gloves as you work. Once the pipes have cooled a little, look around the edges of the joints to make sure they are evenly coated with solder. If you notice any sections without solder, apply a small amount of flux on the area and let it melt with the residual heat of the pipes. Use the blowtorch to heat the pipe up again and apply a small amount of solder to the bare area. It may take a while to get a good feel for when pipes are completely soldered. As a general rule of thumb, as long as there is a thin, silvery trim around the edges of your fittings, the pipe should be fully soldered.","completion":"This article provides a step-by-step guide on preparing, connecting, and soldering pipes using sandpaper or steel wool for cleaning, choosing the right type of flux, connecting sections together, and properly applying heat and solder to ensure sturdy and sealed pipe connections."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I can use this background: What does popping bubble wrap have to do with science? Actually, it demonstrates an important scientific law, called Boyle’s law. Like other laws in science, this law describes what always happens under certain conditions. Boyle’s law is one of three well-known gas laws, which state the relationships among temperature, volume, and pressure of gases. (The other two gas laws are Charles’ law and Amontons’ law.) According to Boyle’s law , if the temperature of a gas is held constant, then decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressure—and vice versa. That’s what happens when you squeeze the bubbles of bubble wrap. You decrease the bubbles' volume, so the air pressure inside the bubbles increases until they pop. Now, I have a new situation: Except for their color, there are two identical inflatable chairs in a grade school classroom that the children can use during free time. Today, Patrick and Mark, who weighs much more than Patrick, are allowed to use the chairs. Patrick chooses to sit on the red chair, and Mark sits on the green chair. The boys have fun reading books while they sit on their comfortable inflatable chairs. Answer this question please: Which chair has a lower air pressure? The answer to this question is:","completion":"To determine which chair has a lower air pressure, we need to consider the effect of the boys' weights on the inflatable chairs and apply Boyle's law. Here's a step-by-step analysis: 1. The two inflatable chairs are identical, meaning they have the same initial volume and air pressure before the boys sit on them. 2. Boyle's law states that if the temperature is constant, decreasing the volume of a gas increases its pressure, and vice versa. 3. When Patrick and Mark sit on the chairs, their weights apply a force on the chairs, causing them to compress, which affects the volume of the air inside the chairs. 4. Since Mark weighs more than Patrick, the force he applies to the chair is greater, causing the volume of air inside the green chair to decrease even more. 5. As the volume of air inside the green chair decreases more than in the red chair, the pressure inside the green chair increases (according to Boyle's law). Based on the analysis, the red chair, the one Patrick is sitting on, has a lower air pressure as compared to the green chair on which Mark is sitting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Albanians first appear in the historical record in Byzantine sources of the late 11th century. At this point, they were already fully Christianized. Islam later emerged as the majority religion during the centuries of Ottoman rule, though a significant Christian minority remained. After independence (1912) from the Ottoman Empire, the Albanian republican, monarchic and later Communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. Albania never had an official state religion either as a republic or as a kingdom. In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy, and ultimately eradicated during the 1950s and 1960s, under the state policy of obliterating all organized religion from Albanian territories. The Communist regime that took control of Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely banned religion to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first atheist state. Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992. Albania joined the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in 1992, following the fall of the communist government, but will not be attending the 2014 conference due a dispute regarding the fact that its parliament never ratified the country's membership. Albanian Muslim populations (mainly secular and of the Sunni branch) are found throughout the country whereas Albanian Orthodox Christians as well as Bektashis are concentrated in the south and Roman Catholics are found in the north of the country. The first recorded Albanian Protestant was Said Toptani, who traveled around Europe, and in 1853 returned to Tirana and preached Protestantism. He was arrested and imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities in 1864. Mainline evangelical Protestants date back to the work of Congregational and later Methodist missionaries and the work of the British and Foreign Bible Society in the 19th century. The Evangelical Alliance, which is known as VUSh, was founded in 1892. Today VUSh has about 160 member congregations from different Protestant denominations. VUSh organizes marches in Tirana including one against blood feuds in 2010. Bibles are provided by the Interconfessional Bible Society of Albania. The first full Albanian Bible to be printed was the Filipaj translation printed in 1990. After reading the above, is \\"Communist\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What Regime took control of Albania after WWII and prior to 1992?\\"?","completion":"Yes, according to the text, the Communist regime took control of Albania after World War II and prior to 1992.

Moreover, the time frame until 1992 is indicated by the statement \\"Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992,\\" confirming that a new regime started post-1992.

Given the following context: The concert took place on Saturday, September 19, 1981, on the Great Lawn, the central open space of Central Park. The first spectators, many carrying chairs or picnic blankets, arrived at daybreak to secure a good spot. The Parks Department originally expected about 300,000 attendees. Although rain fell throughout the day and continued until the start of the concert, an estimated 500,000 audience members made this the seventh-largest concert attendance in the United States in history.The stage backdrop depicted an urban rooftop with water tank and air outlet, symbolic of New York's skyline. At twilight, the backing band went onstage, followed by New York's mayor, Ed Koch, who announced, \\"Ladies and gentlemen, Simon and Garfunkel!\\" The duo entered through a side stage door, took center stage amid audience applause, looked at each other and shook hands, and began the concert with their 1968 hit \\"Mrs. Robinson\\". After the second song, \\"Homeward Bound\\", Simon delivered a short speech which began, \\"Well, it's great to do a neighborhood concert.\\" He then thanked the police, the fire department, the park administration and finally Ed Koch. The audience booed at the mention of Koch but applauded as Simon continued. Simon & Garfunkel played twenty-one songs in total: ten by the duo, eight by Simon, one by Garfunkel, a cover of The Everly Brothers' \\"Wake Up Little Susie\\", and the medley version of \\"Maybellene\\". Each performer sang three songs alone, including one new song apiece. Garfunkel sang the Simon & Garfunkel classic \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" and \\"April Come She Will\\", and \\"A Heart in New York\\", a song written by Gallagher and Lyle that appeared on his album Scissors Cut, which had been released the previous month. Simon's solo performances were the title song of his 1975 album Still Crazy After All These Years, the number-one single \\"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover\\", and the unreleased \\"The Late Great Johnny Ace\\", which would appear on his 1983 album Hearts and Bones. answer the following question: Whose album was called Hearts and Bones?

There are several reasons as to why getting in shape is essential: 1. Good health: Regular exercise and staying active can help lower the risk of developing various health issues like obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer. Exercise helps strengthen your immune system, enabling your body to better fight off diseases. 2. Jogging: This is an excellent form of cardiovascular exercise that has numerous benefits for your overall health. Jogging can help improve your heart and lung function, increase endurance, and burn calories to maintain a healthy weight. It also boosts mental health by releasing endorphins - the 'feel-good' hormones. 3. Exercise: Engaging in regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy lifestyle and supports your body's natural functions. Exercise not only helps you lose weight, but also improves muscle strength, flexibility, and bone density. Furthermore, it can help in stress management and improve mental well-being. 4. Sweat: Sweating is an essential process for our body, as it plays a vital role in regulating body temperature, especially during exercise. Through sweating, our bodies can release toxins and maintain a healthy balance, ensuring overall good health. 5. Feel better: Regular exercise positively impacts emotional well-being and mental health. As mentioned earlier, physical activity releases endorphins, which naturally elevate mood and help relieve stress, anxiety, and depression. In summary, getting in shape is essential for maintaining good health, well-being, and a better quality of life. By participating in activities such as jogging and other exercises, you'll sweat more, promoting the release of toxins, and ultimately feel better both physically and mentally."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The band's third album, Fables of the Reconstruction (1985), demonstrated a change in direction. Instead of Dixon and Easter, R.E.M. chose producer Joe Boyd, who had worked with Fairport Convention and Nick Drake, to record the album in England. The band members found the sessions unexpectedly difficult, and were miserable due to the cold winter weather and what they considered to be poor food; the situation brought the band to the verge of break-up. The gloominess surrounding the sessions worked its way into the context for the album's themes. Lyrically, Stipe began to create storylines in the mode of Southern mythology, noting in a 1985 interview that he was inspired by \\"the whole idea of the old men sitting around the fire, passing on ... legends and fables to the grandchildren\\".They toured Canada in July and August 1985, and Europe in October of that year, including The Netherlands, England (including one concert at London's Hammersmith Palais), Ireland, Scotland, France, Switzerland, Belgium and West Germany. On October 2, 1985, the group played a concert in Bochum, West Germany, for the German TV show Rockpalast. Stipe had bleached his hair blond during this time. Fables of the Reconstruction performed poorly in Europe and its critical reception was mixed, with some critics regarding it as dreary and poorly recorded. As with the previous records, the singles from Fables of the Reconstruction were mostly ignored by mainstream radio. Meanwhile, I.R.S. was becoming frustrated with the band's reluctance to achieve mainstream success.For its fourth album, R.E.M. enlisted John Mellencamp's producer Don Gehman. The result, Lifes Rich Pageant (1986), featured Stipe's vocals closer to the forefront of the music. In a 1986 interview with the Chicago Tribune, Peter Buck related, \\"Michael is getting better at what he's doing, and he's getting more confident at it. And I think that shows up in the projection of his voice.\\" The album improved markedly upon the sales of Fables of the Reconstruction and reached number...

The answer to the question should be unambiguous and a phrase in the paragraph. Most questions can have only one correct answer. Q: Passage: Another common myth is that none of the survivors of the Willie or Martin handcart companies ever complained and they never apostatized from the church. The most popular source came from William Palmer, who paraphrased a comment Francis Webster had made in a Sunday School class in Cedar City. He writes: ... did you ever hear a survivor of that company utter a word of criticism? Not one of that company ever apostatized or left the church because everyone of us came through with the absolute knowledge that God lives for we became acquainted with him in our extremities. This was later quoted by David O. McKay in 1948, and later by Gordon B. Hinckley, James E. Faust and was taught to children. However, several people in the Willie or Martin handcart companies did leave the church, including John Chislett, John Ahmanson, Elizabeth Sermon, Henry Augustus Squires, Henry Kemp and Deborah Jane Chapman. Many of the survivors complained.Palmer gave the quote during a radio series of Men You Should Know describing the life of Webster about forty years after Webster died. Palmer said that he was paraphrasing Webster, and given the lapse of time and the casual nature of a Sunday School class, Orton believes it unlikely to be an exact quote. Orton believes Palmer was trying to emphasize Webster's character, rather than give a definitive statement on the faithfulness of all the members of the Willie Martin handcart company, and finds it unlikely that it was an exact quote. Orton also finds it unlikely that Webster knew all of the survivors, given that they spread throughout Utah after they arrived and didn't have a reunion until after Webster's death. Orton believes Webster was only referring to the pioneers in Cedar City, where the quote was given. Question: What is the first name of the person who gave a quote during a radio series of Men You Should Know?

(I). talks about a black car driving the snow outside, and then a yellow car following it. But it's not related to the person shoveling, so it doesn't make a good story. (II). tells us that a black car pulls into the clean driveway, and the people keep shoveling. This makes sense because it continues the story of shoveling. (III). is about a car washing snow off by driving over a puddle, but the story is about the person shoveling, so it's not a great fit.

The three Kansas militiamen planned to blow up an apartment complex housing Somali refugees during the 2016 presidential election, unleashing what one of them called \\"Crusades 2.0.\\" But their plan was foiled after their arrest just weeks before the election, highlighting the changing enemy list of a movement founded on the back of anti-government activism a generation ago. And with the election of a president whose policies many militia members support, the urge to confront the government appears to have lost some of its urgency. Instead of railing at the government, they have in recent years turned their venom against new-found foes: Muslims, immigrants, the Antifa. \\"Some of the militia groups have been refocusing their attention on secondary enemies for the movement,\\" said Mark Pitcavage, who researches extremism at the Anti-Defamation League civil rights group. Often lumped together with other right-wing groups, the anti-government movement comes in different forms. There are the \\"preppers,\\" so called because they stockpile water, food and other essentials in preparation for civil unrest. There are the \\"survivalists,\\" people who learn skills to “live off the land” in case of a disaster. There are “sovereign citizens” such as the suspect in the recent shooting at a Waffle House in Tennessee who are opposed to paying taxes and believe they should decide which laws to follow. And then there are the militiamen who conduct regular military-style training to resist a government they see as engaged in a global plot to take away their guns and constitutional rights. The modern militia movement dates back to a series of events in the early 1990s, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Can be categorized into several types: These include \\"preppers\\" who stockpile essentials, \\"survivalists\\" who acquire skills for self-sufficiency, \\"sovereign citizens\\" who reject certain laws and taxes, and militiamen who undergo military-style training to resist perceived government threats. 3. Originated in the early 1990s: The Southern Poverty Law Center traces the origins of the modern militia movement back to incidents such as Bill Clinton's election and the FBI raid on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas. 4. Saw their membership rise during Democratic presidencies: The context mentions that membership in these groups grew under Bill Clinton, and it implies that growth might have slowed with the election of a president whose policies many militia members support. 5. Are concerned about losing their constitutional rights: Anti-government groups often view the government as a threat to their fundamental rights, such as the right to bear arms. 6. Are sometimes associated with extremist ideologies: Organizations like the Anti-Defamation League research extremism-related activities among these groups. It is essential to note that while these generalizations apply to some anti-government groups, individual groups and members may have different beliefs, goals, and motivations."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person whose troops surprised a British contingent holding some prisoners near the Lake George landing? Following the British capture of Ticonderoga, it and the surrounding defenses were garrisoned by 700 British and Hessian troops under the command of Brigadier General Henry Watson Powell. Most of these forces were on Mount Independence, with only 100 each at Fort Ticonderoga and a blockhouse they were constructing on top of Mount Defiance. George Washington sent General Benjamin Lincoln into Vermont to \\"divide and distract the enemy\\". Aware that the British were housing American prisoners in the area, Lincoln decided to test the British defenses. On September 13, he sent 500 men to Skenesboro, which they found the British had abandoned, and 500 each against the defenses on either side of the lake at Ticonderoga. Colonel John Brown led the troops on the west side, with instructions to release prisoners if possible, and attack the fort if it seemed feasible. Early on September 18, Brown's troops surprised a British contingent holding some prisoners near the Lake George landing, while a detachment of his troops sneaked up Mount Defiance, and captured most of the sleeping construction crew. Brown and his men then moved down the portage trail toward the fort, surprising more troops and releasing prisoners along the way. The fort's occupants were unaware of the action until Brown's men and British troops occupying the old French lines skirmished. At this point Brown's men dragged two captured six-pound guns up to the lines, and began firing on the fort. The men who had captured Mount Defiance began firing a twelve-pounder from that site. The column that was to attack Mount Independence was delayed, and its numerous defenders were alerted to the action at the fort below before the attack on their position began. Their musket fire, as well as grapeshot fired from ships anchored nearby, intimidated the Americans sufficiently that they never launched an assault on the defensive positions on Mount Independence.

Does \\"Though argued from scripture, and hence logically consequent to sola scriptura, this is the guiding principle of the work of Luther and the later reformers.\\" correctly answer the question of What was Luther's main principle?","completion":"While the statement does provide some insight into the main principle driving Martin Luther and the later reformers, it is not a complete answer. To provide a more detailed and comprehensive answer, we should delve deeper into the historical context, the core beliefs of the Reformation, and the primary motivations of its key figures. Martin Luther, a German theologian and monk, initiated the Protestant Reformation in the early 16th century. His primary objective was to challenge and reform the practices and doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church, which he believed had long deviated from the teachings of the Holy Scriptures. Luther's main principle can be better encapsulated in the concepts of \\"Sola Scriptura,\\" \\"Sola Fide,\\" \\"Sola Gratia,\\" and \\"The Priesthood of all Believers.\\" 1. Sola Scriptura (Scripture Alone): Luther asserted that the Bible alone should be the ultimate authority on Christian beliefs, practices, and faith. This principle stands in contrast to the Catholic tradition, where authority was derived not only from the Scriptures but also from Church hierarchy, tradition, and the Pope's authority. By emphasizing sola scriptura, Luther aimed to refocus Christian faith on its original source — the Word of God. 2. Sola Fide (Faith Alone): Luther was particularly troubled by the prevalent practice of indulgences in the Catholic Church, a system in which people could essentially buy their way into heaven by purchasing pardons for sins or by aiding the construction of churches. Luther believed that salvation was not obtained through good deeds, the purchase of indulgences, or participation in Church rituals. Instead, it was obtained solely through faith in Jesus Christ and his sacrificial atonement for humanity's sins. This principle of sola fide was fundamentally based on the teachings found in the New Testament. 3. Sola Gratia (Grace Alone): This principle emphasizes that God's grace, rather than human efforts or merits, is the ultimate source of salvation. Luther argued that although human beings are inherently sinful and undeserving, God, through his kindness and generosity, offers the free gift of salvation by grace alone. This belief was a direct challenge to the Catholic Church's stance on the role of good works, sacraments, and penance in achieving salvation. 4. The Priesthood of all Believers: Luther believed that each individual believer should have direct access to God without the need for ecclesiastical mediators, such as priests. This was a radical departure from the hierarchical structure of the Catholic Church, where the clergy was set apart as a privileged group with unique access to divine grace. By embracing the priesthood of all believers, Luther advocated for a personal relationship with God, with each believer actively engaging in the study of the Scriptures and serving as a minister to others. In conclusion, Martin Luther's main principle transcends the single statement provided. It can more accurately be described as a combination of principles – Sola Scriptura, Sola Fide, Sola Gratia, and The Priesthood of all Believers – which aimed to challenge corruption, restore the authority of the Bible, and emphasize the importance of faith and grace in achieving salvation. These principles became the foundation for the teachings of Luther and the later reformers, eventually giving rise to the various Protestant denominations we know today."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Raiders, the Eagles flew to FedExField for a Week 7 NFC East duel with the Washington Redskins on Monday night. Philadelphia took flight in the first quarter with wide receiver DeSean Jackson's 67-yard touchdown run and linebacker Will Witherspoon (recently acquired from the Rams) returning an interception 9 yards for a touchdown. In the second quarter, the Eagles increased their lead with a 47-yard field goal from kicker David Akers. The Redskins would get on the board with quarterback Jason Campbell completing a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Devin Thomas, yet Philadelphia answered with Akers nailing a 44-yard field goal and quarterback Donovan McNabb completing a 57-yard touchdown pass to Jackson. Washington would close out the half with a 47-yard field goal from kicker Shaun Suisham. In the third quarter, both defenses fought back and forth and the period ended with no points. In the fourth and final quarter, Jason Campbell completed a one-yard touchdown pass to tight end Fred Davis for the only score of the second half The Eagles defense held on and, with the win, Philadelphia improved to 4-2. Question: How many yards longer was David Akers' longest field goal than his shortest? Answer:","completion":"To find the difference between David Akers' longest and shortest field goals in this game, we can follow these steps: 1. Identify the lengths of David Akers' field goals: David Akers made a 47-yard field goal and a 44-yard field goal. 2. Calculate the difference between the two field goals: Subtract the shorter field goal distance from the longer field goal distance. 47 yards (longest) - 44 yards (shortest) = 3 yards So, David Akers' longest field goal was 3 yards longer than his shortest field goal."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After all, she was the expert, and my goal was to become fitter and healthier. As she explained, oats are a great source of nutrients, including fiber, vitamins, and minerals, which can contribute to a balanced and nutritious diet. I was hesitant at first because I had always been a meat-lover, but I reminded myself of my objective - to improve my overall health.

This helped me to gain a deeper appreciation of her recommendation. Step 2: Find oat-based recipes Next, I searched for various oat-based recipes to include in my meals. This was necessary because I wanted to diversify and enjoy my diet, even if it meant cutting back on meat. Step 3: Monitor the transition As I started to incorporate more oats into my daily meals, I carefully observed how my body responded to the changes. I kept track of my energy levels, digestion, and overall sense of well-being.

Write an article based on this \\"Northern Ireland construction workers are calling for political intervention to solve a cross-border problem involving health and safety training.\\"","completion":"Title: Health and Safety Training Crisis in Northern Ireland's Construction Sector: The Need for Political Intervention Introduction: Northern Ireland's construction industry is currently grappling with a major issue surrounding health and safety training for its workers. In the recent times, there have been increased calls for political intervention to tackle this cross-border problem promptly. Construction workers in the region have cited concerns over inconsistencies in standards, skills recognition, and enforcement. This article aims to shed light on the current situation, the implications of this issue, and the possible solutions to address the problem. Background: The construction industry in Northern Ireland – and the United Kingdom at large – is subject to stringent health and safety regulations. These regulations are designed to ensure workers' safety and minimize accidents on construction sites. In line with this, construction workers are required to undergo health and safety training courses periodically. However, recent issues have emerged regarding the recognition and validity of these training courses, especially in the context of Northern Ireland's shared border with the Republic of Ireland. The Problem: The primary concern for Northern Irish construction workers is that health and safety training courses completed in the Republic of Ireland are often not recognized by construction companies and regulators in Northern Ireland. This essentially means that workers who have completed the necessary training and hold valid certification are being denied the opportunity to work on construction projects on Northern Ireland soil. Conversely, Northern Irish workers may need to retake courses to validate their qualifications once in the Republic of Ireland. Employers and regulators argue that differences in health and safety training standards and enforcement mechanisms make it difficult to ascertain the credibility and equivalence of qualifications obtained across the border. This situation creates confusion and frustration for construction workers, leading to potential exploitation in the workforce and hindering the construction sector from reaping the full benefits of cross-border cooperation. The Need for Political Intervention: Addressing this problem requires not only collaboration within the construction industry but also intervention by political representatives. Politicians have the power to influence standards and regulations to ensure better alignment of health and safety requirements between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. They can promote dialogues between certification bodies, regulators, and construction companies in both jurisdictions to identify areas of commonality and establish mutual recognition of skills and qualifications. Furthermore, politicians can scrutinize and amend existing legislative frameworks to better safeguard the needs of construction workers. This process might entail the introduction of legal provisions that compel construction companies to recognize the validity of health and safety training courses from both regions. Political intervention can drive transparency and consistency, leading to a fairer system and facilitating labor mobility in the sector. Conclusion: The cross-border health and safety training crisis in Northern Ireland's construction sector represents a significant barrier to growth, skill development, and worker protection. Addressing the issue necessitates concerted efforts by multiple stakeholders, particularly political representatives, to align standards and regulations across the region. Ultimately, through effective collaboration and political intervention in this matter, the construction sector can strive towards a more unified cross-border environment that promotes worker safety and enhances opportunities for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

My girlfriend (at the time) and I were planning to go on a day trip on a Saturday, and so the Friday night before, we decided to celebrate our mini vacation by having a few drinks at a local bar. It was a known hangout for bikers, and had a reputation of being a rowdy place, but I was on good terms with a few of the regulars, and felt safe enough. As the night wore on, I started getting out of control, and didn’t even realize it. I loved my girlfriend deeply, and had no desire to be with anyone else, but that night I was most definitely not myself. I was told that I openly flirted with the barmaid in front of my girlfriend, bet and lost on the pool table several times, and tried to start fights with some of the patrons, as I strongly suspected that someone had slipped something into my drink. At the time, I was a seasoned drinker, and the amount of alcohol I had consumed that night was pretty minimal in comparison, so naturally I was convinced that someone was messing with me. To this day I’m still not sure if my drinks were spiked, or it was just one of those nights. I do know that I hadn’t eaten prior to that, so I would tend to choose the latter culprit, even though it pained me to admit it. I woke up the next afternoon in my own bed, with no memory of the trip home, a screaming hangover headache, and no girlfriend. She eventually forgave me, and we were together off and on for a few more years before we grew apart. I haven’t set foot in that bar since, so I have no idea if I’m barred, or how the people there felt about me. I hope they’ve moved on, but I’m still too scared to find out. It’s an experience I never want to repeat, even though I didn’t actually experience anything. :/ Who had a blackout at the bar?

She wanted to be a math teacher but became an architect instead, because the","completion":"demand for architects was much higher than for math teachers at the time. The decision was a pragmatic one, yet her passion for mathematics never waned. In fact, she found ways to incorporate her love for math into her architectural designs, making them innovative and unique. Step 1: Reflect on the existing text to understand the direction of the story. Justification: It is important to first understand the context and the story's progression to ensure the continuity and consistency of the narrative. Step 2: Develop the character's background and identify potential conflicts or themes to be explored. Justification: Adding depth to the character and their story can make the narrative more engaging and relatable for the reader. In her architectural projects, she would often integrate mathematical concepts, such as symmetry, proportions, and tessellation, which garnered attention from critics and the general public alike. Her unique perspective earned her a reputation as a forward-thinking architect. Step 3: Establish the character's motivations and aspirations, while showing how the protagonist faces challenges in their chosen field.

He left the Dorking house and they took a lease of 10 Hanover Terrace, Regent's Park, London. It was the year of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation; Vaughan Williams's contribution was an arrangement of the Old Hundredth psalm tune, and a new setting of \\"O taste and see\\" from Psalm 34, performed at the service in Westminster Abbey. Having returned to live in London, Vaughan Williams, with Ursula's encouragement, became much more active socially and in pro bono publico activities. He was a leading figure in the Society for the Promotion of New Music, and in 1954 he set up and endowed the Vaughan Williams Trust to support young composers and promote new or neglected music. He and his wife travelled extensively in Europe, and in 1954 he visited the US once again, having been invited to lecture at Cornell and other universities and to conduct. He received an enthusiastic welcome from large audiences, and was overwhelmed at the warmth of his reception. Kennedy describes it as \\"like a musical state occasion\\".Of Vaughan Williams's works from the 1950s, Grove makes particular mention of Three Shakespeare Songs (1951) for unaccompanied chorus, the Christmas cantata Hodie (1953–1954), the Violin Sonata, and, most particularly, the Ten Blake Songs (1957) for voice and oboe, \\"a masterpiece of economy and precision\\". Unfinished works from the decade were a cello concerto and a new opera, Thomas the Rhymer. The predominant works of the 1950s were his three last symphonies. The seventh—officially unnumbered, and titled Sinfonia antartica—divided opinion; the score is a reworking of music Vaughan Williams had written for the 1948 film Scott of the Antarctic, and some critics thought it not truly symphonic. The Eighth, though wistful in parts, is predominantly lighthearted in tone; it was received enthusiastically at its premiere in 1956, given by the Hallé Orchestra under the dedicatee, Sir John Barbirolli.

Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"when is fog common?\\" with the following options: - summer end - before thunderstorms - The area was once underwater - dry and hot - It used to be covered by water - never - outer space - under water Answer:","completion":"Fog is common before thunderstorms. This can be inferred from the given facts, which state that cold fronts cause thunderstorms as they pass by, and fog is common in the cold air ahead of the front. When a cold front approaches, it displaces warm air, causing the temperature and humidity levels to change. The cooler air near the ground mixes with the warmer, moisture-laden air above it, leading to the formation of fog. Fog is a natural meteorological phenomenon that occurs when water droplets or ice crystals are suspended in the air just above the Earth's surface, causing a reduction in visibility. It is often observed in areas where there are sudden temperature changes, like the transition from land to water or different air masses meeting. Therefore, it is common before thunderstorms when a cold front is moving in, and the environmental conditions are suitable for fog formation. In the context of the provided options: - Summer end: Fog can occur at any time of the year. However, it might be less common at the end of summer as warmer weather patterns would not cool the air as quickly, leading to less likelihood of fog forming before a thunderstorm. - The area was once underwater / It used to be covered by water: While these options might seem relevant because fog is created by the presence of water droplets, they focus more on the geological history of an area than on the meteorological conditions necessary for fog formation. - Dry and hot: Fog is less likely to form under dry and hot conditions, as the warm air would evaporate the moisture required for fog formation. - Never: This option is incorrect, as fog is a common meteorological phenomenon and can occur under specific environmental conditions, such as before thunderstorms. - Outer space: Fog cannot form in outer space due to the lack of atmosphere, air, and moisture needed for fog to form. - Underwater: Fog does not occur underwater. However, the underwater equivalent of fog does exist, known as turbidity, which is the decrease in visibility caused by the presence of suspended particles in the water. In conclusion, given the provided options and the meteorological facts presented, fog is common before thunderstorms when cold fronts approach and create the necessary environmental conditions for fog to form."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Being pictured with friends could boost your perceived attractiveness as people tend to 'average out' everyone's facial features when looking at group photos. Observers perceive each individual's face as more average than they would otherwise - and average faces are deemed more attractive. The phenomenon is dubbed the 'cheerleader effect'. Tulisa shows her support to Little Mix by attending their gig at G-A-Y earlier this month 'Average faces are more attractive, likely due to the averaging out of unattractive idiosyncrasies,' says","completion":"Dr. Drew Walker, a psychologist at the University of California, San Diego, who led the study. The research involved several experiments in which participants rated the attractiveness of people in photographs - both in group settings and as individuals. Consistently, participants found the individuals to be more attractive when they were part of a group. In light of these findings, people may start to rethink their social media strategies - perhaps prioritizing group photos over selfies to improve their online attractiveness. Dr. Walker suggests that being seen in a group setting, whether it's online or in person, could have practical benefits when it comes to dating, networking, or even job hunting. While it might seem counterintuitive to make one's own face less distinctive in order to appear more attractive, the cheerleader effect proves that sometimes, blending in works to our advantage. The effect reveals the power of context in shaping our perceptions of attractiveness and provides a simple strategy for those looking to put their best face forward.

The missing word is the one we'll need to fill in using one of the multiple choice options. Part #2: Understand the context of the sentence Usage: After identifying the sentence and the missing word, we must understand what the sentence is saying - to understand the context and the topic of the sentence. The sentence \\"Coating is non-reactive and lasts at least ____ times as long as filament sources.\\" talks about the lasting time or durability of a non-reactive coating in comparison to 'filament sources'. Hence, we need a word that would make sense within this specific context. Part #3: Look at each answer option Usage: The options given are a) ten, b) eight, c) one, d) zero. We need to assess each option and decide which one correctly fills the blank. In this case, we are talking about something that is longer than another. So logically, it can't be 'zero' and since it's being compared as longer than the filament sources it can't be 'one'. So it's either 'ten' or 'eight'. Part #4: Choose the best option that fills the blank Usage: Determining the 'best' answer requires judgement and depends on the specific context of the sentence. Here, without any further information either 'ten' or 'eight' could fit but 'ten' is more likely to be used in this kind of comparison so the answer would be a) ten. This is the best choice because this number is often used in comparative phrases like 'ten times more', 'ten times as much', etc., which suggests that the coating lasts significantly longer than the filament sources.

Kitty Empire wrote in The Observer that these conspiratorial government connections to Google and the thoughts of Dzhennet Abdurakhmanova, the Russian teenager who bombed Moscow's tube system in revenge for the death of her husband, were inner-world issues pondered in \\"Lovalot\\" with \\"a mixture of nonsense rhyme, militant posturing and pop-cultural free-flow; her London glottal stop mischievously turns 'I love a lot' into 'I love Allah' \\". Ann Powers in the Los Angeles Times said that \\"M.I.A. turns a call to action into a scared girl's nervous tic. Synths click out a jittery, jagged background. The song doesn't... A:","completion":"The album on which M.I.A. opted to sing, as opposed to rap, on several tracks is not explicitly mentioned in the given article. However, we can deduce information about the album based on the details provided. The album is described as being different from her previous album, with M.I.A. wanting to produce something that had \\"more emphasis on production.\\" She was inspired by the film Food, Inc. and aimed to create an album about \\"exploring our faults and flaws\\" and being proud of them. Some tracks mentioned in the article are \\"Space\\", \\"Lovalot\\", \\"XXXO\\", \\"Teqkilla\\", \\"It Takes a Muscle\\", and \\"The Message\\".

Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary. In February 2014, another new U2 song, the single \\"Invisible\\", debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS. Bono called the track a \\"sneak preview\\" of their pending record.On 9 September 2014, U2 announced their thirteenth studio album, Songs of Innocence, at an Apple product launch event, and released it digitally the same day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost. The release made the album available to over 500 million iTunes customers in what Apple CEO Tim Cook called \\"the largest album release of all time.\\" Apple reportedly paid Universal Music Group and U2 a lump sum for a five-week exclusivity period in which to distribute the album and spent US100 million on a promotional campaign. Songs of Innocence recalls the group members' youth in Ireland, touching on childhood experiences, loves and losses, while paying tribute to their musical...
