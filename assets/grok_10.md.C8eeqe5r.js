Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. One of the leading contemporary recording artists, she is known for narrative songs about her personal life, which have received widespread media coverage. Born and raised in Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee at the age of 14 to pursue a career in country music. She signed with the label Big Machine Records and became the youngest artist ever signed by the Sony/ATV Music publishing house. One of Swift's earliest musical memories is listening to her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing in church. As a child, she enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: \\"My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own\\". Swift has said she owes her confidence to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child. She also attributes her \\"fascination with writing and storytelling\\" to her mother. Swift was drawn to the storytelling of country music, and was introduced to the genre by \\"the great female country artists of the '90s\\"--Shania Twain, Faith Hill and the Dixie Chicks. Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence. Hill was Swift's childhood role model: \\"Everything she said, did, wore, I tried to copy it\\". She admired the Dixie Chicks' defiant attitude and their ability to play their own instruments. The band's \\"Cowboy Take Me Away\\" was the first song Swift learned to play on the guitar. Swift also explored the music of older country stars, including Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette. She believes Parton is \\"an amazing example to every female songwriter out there\\". Alt-country artists such as Ryan Adams, Patty Griffin and Lori McKenna have inspired Swift. Swift lists Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, Kris Kristofferson, and Carly Simon as her career role models: \\"They've taken chances, but they've also been the same artist for their entire careers\\". McCartney, both as a Beatle and a solo artist, makes Swift feel \\"as if I've been let into his heart and his mind ... Any musician could only dream of a legacy like that\\". She admires Springsteen for being \\"so musically relevant after such a long period of time\\". She aspires to be like Harris as she grows older: \\"It's not about fame for her, it's about music\\". \\"[Kristofferson] shines in songwriting ... He's just one of those people who has been in this business for years but you can tell it hasn't chewed him up and spat him out\\", Swift says. She admires Simon's \\"songwriting and honesty ... She's known as an emotional person but a strong person\\". Swift has also been influenced by many artists outside the country genre. As a pre-teen, she enjoyed bubblegum pop acts including Hanson and Britney Spears; Swift has said she has \\"unwavering devotion\\" for Spears. In her high school years, Swift listened to rock bands such as Dashboard Confessional, Fall Out Boy, and Jimmy Eat World. She has also spoken fondly of singers and songwriters like Michelle Branch, Alanis Morissette, Ashlee Simpson, Fefe Dobson and Justin Timberlake; and the 1960s acts The Shirelles, Doris Troy, and The Beach Boys. Swift's fifth album, the pop-focused 1989, was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Annie Lennox, Phil Collins and \\"Like a Prayer-era Madonna\\".","completion":"This text is about Taylor Alison Swift, who is an American singer-songwriter.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Two islands of identical size with similar ecosystems experienced different destinies. Caribu island, inhabited by more natives, hunted a few of the animal species there, contributing to the extinction of a few. People from Hiji island, were pescotarian, and hardly ever fished. But I can use this background: Biodiversity loss is the extinction of species (plant or animal) worldwide, and also the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat. The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration / ecological resilience or effectively permanent (e.g. through land loss). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible. Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, also for humankind.[1] What is an answer for this question: Which island experienced more environmental degradation? A:","completion":"Based on the provided information, it appears that Caribu Island experienced more environmental degradation than Hiji Island. Both islands are of identical size and have similar ecosystems; however, the key difference lies in the way the inhabitants of each island utilized their natural resources. On Caribu Island, the natives hunted various animal species, which led to the extinction of some species. This reduction in species diversity has several consequences. First, it disrupts the natural balance of the ecosystem and may result in the loss of vital interactions between species, such as pollination and seed dispersal. Second, the extinction of one species can lead to coextinction, where other species that depend on the extinct species for survival also face the risk of becoming extinct. Such changes can have a domino effect on the entire food web, eventually leading to a decrease in overall biodiversity. Furthermore, reduced biodiversity can have a negative impact on ecosystem services, such as climate regulation, water purification, and nutrient cycling, which are essential for maintaining a healthy environment. The loss of species and reduced biodiversity may also pose a threat to food security for the inhabitants of Caribu Island. On the other hand, the people of Hiji Island were pescotarian and hardly ever fished. This way of life indicates a more sustainable approach to utilizing their natural resources. By not overexploiting their environment, Hiji Island presumably helped maintain a more balanced ecosystem with a higher level of biodiversity compared to Caribu Island. Additionally, the reliance on fishing instead of hunting terrestrial animals might have contributed to a lesser extent of habitat degradation on Hiji Island. In conclusion, from the given information, it can be inferred that Caribu Island experienced more environmental degradation than Hiji Island. The main contributing factor appears to be the unsustainable hunting practices adopted by the natives of Caribu Island, which led to the extinction of a few animal species and subsequent decrease in biodiversity. This loss of biodiversity can have significant negative consequences on the overall health and stability of the island's ecosystem, making Caribu Island more environmentally degraded compared to Hiji Island, where inhabitants maintained a more sustainable approach to resource use."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of woody allen","completion":"The sentiment of the sentence, \\"emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of Woody Allen,\\" can be interpreted as predominantly positive with a slight touch of silliness or absurdity. The word \\"hilarious\\" plays a significant role in determining the overall sentiment of this statement. It has an inherently positive connotation, implying that the subject matter, potentially a film or a performance, is highly entertaining and evokes laughter in the audience. Another aspect to consider is the reference to Woody Allen, a renowned filmmaker and comedian known for his wit and humor. Mentioning his name in the context of \\"hilarious lunacy\\" suggests that the speaker appreciates the humorous and eccentric outcome achieved by Allen. However, the term \\"lunacy\\" introduces a slight element of absurdity or irrationality. While this might be seen as negative in some circumstances, within this particular context, it lends an air of playful and whimsical charm to the subject. The combination of humor and absurdity can be a powerful and engaging approach, and the statement highlights the unique, quirky perspective that Woody Allen has brought to the subject matter. Therefore, while the comment could be interpreted as being slightly tongue-in-cheek, the overall sentiment expressed is positive. The statement acknowledges the effective and enjoyable humor that Woody Allen has delivered, albeit through an unconventional and perhaps unexpected approach."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which is the best coaching institute for NET/JRF exam in political science in delhi? Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"While the two questions are quite similar, they are not exactly the same. Both are asking for recommendations on the best coaching institute, but each question specifies a slightly different context and location. The first question asks for the 'best coaching institute for UGC-NET preparation in political science'. Here, the emphasis is on preparation for the University Grants Commission National Eligibility Test (UGC-NET), specifically in the subject area of political science. This question does not specify a particular city or region, hence an answer to this question could encompass the whole country or even online platforms that provide coaching for UGC-NET in political science. The UGC-NET exam is a national level test conducted in India to determine eligibility for college and university level lecturership and for the award of Junior Research Fellowship (JRF) for Indian nationals. Candidates who pass this test are considered eligible to apply for faculty positions in Indian universities and colleges. UGC-NET is considered to be one of the toughest exams in India, with a very low qualification rate. The second question asks for the 'best coaching institute for NET/JRF exam in political science in Delhi'. This question is also asking about preparation for the National Eligibility Test (NET) and the Junior Research Fellowship (JRF), like the first question. However, it specifically focuses on institutes located in Delhi. It's restrictive to a particular geographical area. To thoroughly answer both questions, one needs to identify the top coaching institutes offering UGC-NET and JRF preparation in political science across India then narrow down to those that are based in or have branches in Delhi. It's worth noting that the quality of a coaching institute cannot be purely measured by its brand or popularity. Therefore, the 'best' institute can be subjective and may depend on specific parameters such as teaching methodology, faculty experience, past results, fees, course structure, and the individual student's learning style and constraints. So, in essence, while both questions are closely related and concern the same exam and subject area, one question has a wider scope (all India, or possibly online) and the other question is specifically about institutes in Delhi. As such, the two questions are not exactly the same."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Adam W. Purinton, 51, allegedly shot Srinivas Kuchibhotla, 32; Alok Madasani, 32, of Overland Park, and another bar patron, 24-year-old Ian Grillot of Grandview. Kuchibhotla died at a hospital after the 7:15 p.m. shooting in Austins Bar & Grill near 151st Street and Mur-Len Road.

SUBSCRIBE NOW Purinton also is charged with two counts of attempted first-degree murder in the shootings of Madasani and Grillot. Witnesses said Grillot was shot after he intervened. Madasani was released Thursday from a hospital, where Grillot is improving. The two even talked with each other Thursday. In a video released by the University of Kansas Health System, Grillot spoke about how he jumped at the shooter. “It wasn’t right, and I didn’t want the gentleman to potentially go after somebody else,” Grillot said. (See sidebar.) Johnson County District Attorney Steve Howe announced the charges against Purinton during a press conference at Olathe police headquarters. He was joined by federal law enforcement officials who said that they are investigating in conjunction with Olathe police to determine if the shooting was a bias-motivated hate crime in violation of the victims’ civil rights. At least one witness reportedly heard the man yell “get out of my country” shortly before shooting Kuchibhotla and Madasani. The man fled on foot. A manhunt ensued. Five hours later, Purinton reportedly told a bartender at a bar in an Applebee’s in Clinton, Mo., that he needed a place to hide out because he had just killed two Middle Eastern men, The Star has learned. The bartender called police, and Purinton was arrested without incident, Assistant Clinton Police Chief Sonny Lynch said. Purinton was not armed. “It was a tragic and senseless act of violence,” said Olathe Police Chief Steven Menke. After his arrest in Clinton, Purinton — a Navy veteran, IT specialist, former pilot and air traffic controller who lives in a comfortable suburban home — was booked into the Henry County Jail. Purinton appeared before a judge in Henry County and waived his right to fight extradition. Bond was set at 2 million. It was not known how soon he would be returned to Johnson County. Both Howe and Eric Jackson, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Kansas City office, cautioned they were too early in their investigation to assign a motive or call it a hate crime. “We’re less than 24 hours in,” Howe said. “We want to be sure of the facts versus speculation.” Jackson said it was not “uncommon” for joint federal and local law enforcement investigations into possible hate crimes. Tom Beall, acting U.S. attorney for the District of Kansas, said his office would be evaluating the case as more facts are gathered in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Justice. “There will probably be more to come later from us,” Beall said. SHARE COPY LINK Jon Cassat, vice president of communications for Garmin, speaks about employees who were victims of Wednesday's shooting in Olathe. Two associates of the Aviation Systems Engineering team, Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani, were shot. Kuchibh Garmin engineers Kuchibhotla and Madasani were employees of the Aviation Systems Engineering team at Garmin Ltd., headquartered in Olathe. Garmin officials broke the news to employees in an email Thursday morning. “Unfortunately, two associates on our Aviation Systems Engineering team, Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani, were shot. We are devastated to inform you that Srinivas passed away and Alok is currently recovering in the hospital,” Garmin said in the email. In a public statement, Garmin said, “We’re saddened that two Garmin associates were involved in last night’s incident, and we express our condolences to the family and friends of our co-workers involved. Garmin will have grievance counselors on-site and available for its associates today and tomorrow.” Kuchibhotla posted on LinkedIn in 2014 that he managed helicopter programs. He had a master’s degree in electrical and electronics engineering from the University of Texas at El Paso. He earned his bachelor’s degree at the Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University in India. A 2014 post on LinkedIn said Madasani was an aviation program coordinator manager at Garmin. He studied at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and at Vasavi College of Engineering in India. Two GoFundMe pages have been set up for the Garmin workers and a third for Grillot. One, for Kuchibhotla’s family, said “Srini was the kindest person you would meet, full of love, care and compassion for everyone. He never uttered a word of hatred, a simple gossip, or a careless comment. He was brilliant, well mannered and simply an outstanding human being. “His wife Sunayana and his family are now faced with incredible grief and a multitude of expenses. “We’ve set up this fund to help them with the funeral expenses and other ongoing grief/recovery support costs. This includes the very expensive process of carrying his mortal remains back to India, so his parents can say goodbye one last time to their beloved son.” By Thursday evening, contributors had exceeded the 150,000 goal for Kuchibholta’s fund. The other GoFundMe page was set up by a western Shawnee man who was not personally connected to either of the victims or their families but was upset about what appeared to be “a vicious hate crime.” “Madasani will likely face extensive medical bills and the family of Kuchibhotla will now have to deal with the death of their beloved son, both financially and emotionally,” Brian Eric Ford wrote on the page. “Let’s send a message that we will support those who are targeted — and stand against all who wish to spread hate — by raising funds to help the victims of this horrendous act of senseless violence.” Ford said he planned to present the money raised to Garmin. Contributors had pledged more than 19,000 of the 50,000 goal by Thursday evening. A third victim, Ian Grillot, was shot in the hand and chest. A GoFundMe site had been set up for him and had raised 67,000 of its 80,000 goal. On Wednesday night, Kuchibhotla and Madasani had been at the bar for about 30 minutes or so. Around that same time, Grillot, a sometimes daily regular who either stops for a drink or grabs something to eat, was in the parking lot. “Ian’s a really good guy,” said Garret Bohnen, who has served him at Austins. “He’s been going there forever. We’ve always had a good time with him. He’s always one to defuse stuff.” Witnesses said Purinton was drinking and spouting racial slurs at Kuchibhotla and Madasani. At one point, Purinton is thought to have been kicked out of the bar before coming back and shooting. Grillot stepped in and was shot. SHARE COPY LINK Ian Grillot is recovering after he was shot Wednesday night at Austins Bar & Grill in Olathe. Grillot intervened after a man was yelling racial slurs at two men he reportedly thought were Middle Eastern. One of those men died. This footage is from Community grieves The Kansas chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations on Thursday called for prosecutors to file hate crime charges against Purinton at both the state and federal level. Moussa Elbayoumy, board chairman of the Kansas chapter, said that doing so would “send a strong message that violence targeting religious or ethnic minorities will not be tolerated.” He noted that two southwest Kansas men were sentenced in federal court on Wednesday in connection with a hate attack on three Somali Muslims outside an African grocery store in Dodge City in 2015. And CAIR’s national headquarters in Washington, D.C., has seen an unprecedented increase in hate incidents targeting Muslims and other minority groups since the Nov. 8 election, Elbayoumy said. Indeed, he said, a report about to be released on Islamophobia in America is expected to show that last year was the worst on record for incidents of bias toward mosques. Olathe Mayor Michael Copeland on Thursday said he was shocked and saddened. “We pray that those in mourning will find comfort in the outpouring of love and support across our community,” Copeland said. Austins remained closed Thursday, a day after the shooting. Owner Brandon Blum, family and staff gathered there Thursday afternoon. In a statement later Thursday, Blum expressed empathy for the victims and their families. “We are so sorry that this happened on our premises,” Blum said. “We have never experienced any sort of tragedy like this in our 30 years. For all of our loyal friends and patrons, we want to thank you for your ongoing support.” Blum said the bar would re-open Saturday to give staff and patrons some time to process the shooting. “We will be working diligently doing anything we can to support and help the parties that were involved,” he said. Flowers adorned a makeshift memorial in front of the bar as a reminder of the tragedy. ||||| CORRECTS LAST NAME TO PURINTON - This undated photo provided by the Henry County Sheriff's Office in Clinton, Mo., shows Adam Purinton, of Olathe, Kan., who was arrested early Thursday, Feb. 23, 2017,...

(Associated Press) OLATHE, Kan. (AP) — A man opened fire at a crowded Kansas bar, killing one man and wounding two others before he was arrested in Missouri, police said Thursday about an attack that some witnesses suggested had racial overtones. Adam Purinton, 51, of Olathe, was arrested in Henry County, Missouri after the shooting Wednesday evening at Austins Bar and Grill in the Kansas City suburb of Olathe. He waived extradition from Henry County Thursday and was expected to be returned to Kansas, said Maj. Rob Hills of the Henry County Sheriff's Office. The Kansas City Star reported the suspect uttered racial slurs and yell \\"get out of my country\\" before he opened fire, citing witnesses at the shooting. Srinivas Kuchibhotla died at an area hospital and Alok Madasani and Ian Grillot were hospitalized. Witnesses said Grillot had stepped in and tried to stop the shooter. Police declined to provide details about the attack. The FBI referred calls to the Olathe Police Department. Garret Bohnen, a bartender at Austins, told the Star that Kuchibhotla and Madasani work at Garmin Ltd., and stopped at Austins for a drink once or twice a week. \\"From what I understand when he was throwing racial slurs at the two gentlemen (Kuchibhotla and Madasani), Ian stood up for them,\\" Bohnen said. \\"We're all proud of him.\\" The shooting happened around Wednesday evening while people were watching the University of Kansas-TCU basketball game at Austins, said Olathe Police Sgt. Logan Bonney. Purinton was taken into custody just after midnight on Thursday morning at an Applebee's about 70 miles to the southeast in Clinton, Missouri, authorities said. Assistant Clinton Police Chief Sonny Lynch said an Applebee's bartender summoned police to the bar where the man was drinking because he said he'd been involved in a shooting. The unarmed Purinton was taken into custody and interviewed by detectives from Olathe. \\"He mentioned he had been involved in a shooting and we went out there and picked him up,\\" Lynch said. GPS-maker Garmin, which is headquartered in Olathe, confirmed in an email to employees that two of the victims work or worked for the company. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A man named Adam Purinton, who lives in Olathe, did something very bad. He went to a bar and shot at some people, who were engineers from India. He told them to \\"get out of my country\\" before he shot them.

Help as much as you can. Sugar--free beets that still taste sweet, tastier tomatoes and brighter-colored fruits and vegetables that stay ripe longer are all foods that are being grown now. How can they carry traits, such as being tastier, brighter, and riper? They are genetically engineered. Genetic engineering is like making a change in a recipe. For example, when you make cakes, you mix together all of the usual ingredients. If you add an extra ingredient, like salt, the cakes will taste differently. Genes are ingredients in the recipe for life. They carry the traits of living things. Your genes dictate what color hair and eyes you'll have, how tall you'll be, as well as many other traits. Genes carry traits for plants, too. By adding genes to a plant, you can sometimes create new traits. For example, adding a certain gene to a potato plant can make the potato plant distasteful to bugs . This makes some farmers happy because they don't have to use chemicals to keep bugs away from their plants. It sounds great, but some people are opposed to the idea of food that is genetically engineered. Ronnie Cummins, from the Campaign for Food Safety, is against it. He says that one of the major concerns is allergies . Supermarkets don't always label foods that are genetically engineered. A customer could unknowingly buy food that has an added gene from another plant that he or she is allergic to. It could be dangerous. Gary Burton from Monsanto, a seed company that engineers food, disagrees. He says his company tests for allergies. Burton believes that genetic engineering is a valuable tool for making better food. The technology can help farmers use less insecticide and grow healthier crops. Burton thinks there are many advantages. But Cummins says that we just don't know what will happen in the future if we keep adding genes to foods. We could mistakenly create a monster.

Choices: - gel - combine - repel - dissolve A: Answer:","completion":"Dissolve Water's polar nature plays a critical role in its ability to dissolve various solutes. Let's take a detailed look at why this happens and the mechanisms behind it. Being a polar compound means that water has an uneven distribution of electron density, which results in a molecule with distinct positive and negative regions. Water is often referred to as a universal solvent because its polar nature allows it to dissolve a wide range of solutes. The process of solvation involves the interaction between solvent and solute particles in a solution. For water, this involves hydrogen bonding, which is a relatively strong intermolecular force. Because water has a highly polar nature, it can readily interact with charged solute particles, as well as other polar covalent and ionic compounds. In general, substances that are also polar or ionic are more likely to dissolve in water as the saying \\"like dissolves like\\" implies. To further explain this, let's consider the process of dissolution. When an ionic compound comes into contact with water, the negatively charged oxygen atoms of the water molecules surround the positively charged cations from the solute, and the positively charged hydrogen atoms of the water molecules surround the negatively charged anions. Essentially, the solute particles are \\"pulled apart\\" by water and become distributed evenly throughout the solution. This process is called ion-dipole interaction, and it occurs when a polar molecule interacts with an ion in a solvent. In the case of polar covalent molecules, such as sugar, which dissolve in water as well, the polar regions of the two substances interact. Positive and negative regions of the water molecules attract the corresponding negative and positive regions of the sugar molecules, leading to the dissolution of sugar. However, not all substances dissolve in water. Nonpolar molecules, such as oil or wax, do not have a substantial interaction with the polar water molecules and therefore are insoluble or sparingly soluble in water. So, in summary, water's polar nature causes most solutes to dissolve due to the interactions between the water molecules and the charged or polar solute particles. This ability to dissolve a wide range of solutes is one of the reasons why water is so essential to life on Earth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While the quote provided above refers to a specific creative collaboration between Curt Swan, George Pérez, and Kurt Schaffenberger, it does not fully address the broader context of important moments and happenings in the life of Superman throughout the comics. Some notable storylines and changes in Superman's narrative include: 1. Superman's origin story: Being born as Kal-El on the planet Krypton, Superman was sent to Earth by his parents just before Krypton's destruction. Adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent, he grew up in Smallville and was named Clark Kent. Discovering his powers, Clark took on the mantle of Superman and dedicated himself to fighting for truth and justice. 2. \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\" (1985): This major DC Comics crossover event caused a significant reboot and reshuffling of the universe. Pre-Crisis and Post-Crisis versions of Superman were created, defining different timelines, histories, and power sets for the character. 3. \\"The Death of Superman\\" (1992): A well-known storyline in which Superman faces off against the unstoppable villain Doomsday, resulting in the death of both characters. Superman's death had a far-reaching impact on the DC universe and led to a number of follow-up storylines, including \\"Funeral for a Friend,\\" \\"Reign of the Supermen,\\" and eventually his resurrection. 4. New 52 (2011): DC Comics rebooted their entire comic book line, resetting many characters and their backstories. This reset included changing Superman's costume and his relationship with Lois Lane, as well as altering his power levels to make him more vulnerable. 5. DC Rebirth (2016): A major initiative which sought to restore much of the pre-New 52 history of characters, including Superman. This resulted in the return of classic elements of Superman's character, such as his relationship with Lois Lane and their son, Jon Kent, who would eventually become Superboy. These key moments and storylines represent some of the most significant changes and developments in Superman's comic book history.

Her great-grandmother, Constance, Lady of Aitona, was an illegitimate daughter of Peter II of Aragon. This connection made Elisenda and her husband second cousins once removed. In terms of her succession, Elisenda became Queen consort of Aragon upon her marriage to King James II of Aragon in 1322. She was James II's fourth and last wife, who was thirty years her senior. As queen consort, Elisenda became the stepmother to James' ten children from his previous marriage to Blanche of Naples. During her reign as queen consort, Elisenda and her husband, James II, founded the Monastery of Pedralbes in 1326. This period was, however, short-lived as King James II passed away in November 1327. The couple did not have any children together. Following her husband's death, Elisenda retired to the Monastery of Pedralbes Palace in 1328. Although she was never a nun, Elisenda was endowed with significant powers and authority over the internal workings of the monastery. She spent the rest of her life in the monastery. Elisenda of Montcada passed away on 19 June 1364. Her tomb, an example of Catalan Gothic architecture, can be found at the Monastery of Pedralbes.

What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who said the speaker in Touch Me I'm Sick! declares himself to be the viral, 'AIDS-bearing,' 'polluting' person of contemporary fantasy?\\" from the following article ? \\"Touch Me I'm Sick\\" has a straightforward garage punk structure with a simple repeating power chord riff played at a high tempo. This is accompanied by a blunt bass line and frenetic drumming. The song's dirty sound was produced using an Electro-Harmonix Big Muff distortion pedal, which is augmented by a second guitar providing more distortion. Music writer Brian J. Barr referred to this noisy sound as \\"the sonic equivalent of an amplified comb scraping against paper\\".Critics have noted a Stooges influence in \\"Touch Me I'm Sick\\", typical of Mudhoney's early material. Turner said: \\"In retrospect, it's The Yardbirds' 'Happenings Ten Years Time Ago' by way of The Stooges' 'Sick of You'. At the time I was trying for the stuttering R&B guitar of The Nights and Days.\\" The song is also reminiscent of the hardcore punk of Black Flag. In his book Loser: The Real Seattle Music Story, Clark Humphrey accuses the song of being a copy of \\"The Witch\\" by The Sonics. The band have dismissed this claim, and questioned the writer's knowledge of music.Arm's lyrics, according to critic Steve Huey, are a rant about \\"disease, self-loathing, angst, and dirty sex\\". In an essay called \\"'Touch Me I'm Sick': Contagion as Critique in Punk and Performance Art\\", Catherine J. Creswell suggests that some of the lyrics refer to AIDS.

Creswell, who also believes the song parodies the theme of seduction in contemporary rock music, points to lyrics that refer to impotence (\\"If you don't come, if you don't come, if you don't come, you'll die alone!\\") and violent possession or forcing (\\"I'll make you love me till the day you die!\\").

The movie, which was directed by Tate Taylor, primarily focused on the life of the legendary musician James Brown, who was famously referred to as \\"The Godfather of Soul.\\" Jamarion Scott's role as the young James Brown showcased the early life of the singer, specifically portraying his tough childhood as he navigated through poverty and various challenges. The film also depicted how the love and passion for music paved the way for Brown's eventual rise to stardom and the enormous influence he had on future generations of musicians. One of the unique aspects of \\"Get On Up\\" is that it narrates Brown's life in a non-linear manner, which provides an in-depth insight into his journey as an artist. Aside from Jamarion Scott portraying the young James Brown, the film starred Chadwick Boseman in the lead role, chronicling his rise to greatness as a groundbreaking singer, songwriter, and performer. Chadwick Boseman garnered significant praise for his remarkable portrayal of James Brown, capturing the spirit, essence, and energy of the iconic artist. Unfortunately, Boseman passed away in August 2020, leaving behind a legacy of memorable performances, with his role in \\"Get On Up\\" being one of his most acclaimed works.

Afterward all the local newspapers carried many human-interest stories featuring some of the families who suffered the hardest. One Sunday, a particular picture especially touched me. A young woman stood in front of an entirely shattered mobile home, a depressed expression twisting her features. A young boy, seven or eight years old, stood at her side, eyes downcast. Clutching at her skirt was a tiny girl who stared into the camera, eyes wide with confusion and fear. The article that went with the picture gave the clothing sizes of each family member. With growing interest, I noticed that their sizes closely matched ours. This would be a good opportunity to teach my children to help those less fortunate than themselves. I taped the picture of the young family to our refrigerator, explaining their difficulty to my seven-year-old twins, Brad and Brett, and to three- year-old Meghan. \\" We have so much. And these poor people now have nothing,\\" I said.\\"We'll share what we have with them.\\" I brought three large boxes down from the room upstairs and placed them on the living room floor.

Meghan watched quietly as the boys piled up discarded toys and games. \\"I'll help you find something for the little girl when I'm done with this,\\" I said. The boys placed the toys they had chosen to donate into one of the boxes while I filled the third box with clothes. Meghan walked up with Lucy, her worn, faded, much-loved rag doll hugged tightly to her chest.

Endless lines of citizens march through the building and up and down its iconic spiral staircases seeking help. One government worker frustrates Ahmed particularly, because he is constantly praying in a show of alleged piousness to avoid getting any work done. This leads to a scuffle between the two, and eventually Ahmed ends up with a rifle from a guard and shots are fired in the resulting confusion. A mass spontaneous evacuation of the building ensues, Ahmed inadvertently takes the building hostage, and subsequently is assumed to be a terrorist. He is joined in his \\"takeover\\" by a few other \\"misfits,\\" including Hind, a prostitute played by Yousra. Ahmed and his new compatriots negotiate with the Minister of Interior, who fears the building will be blown up, and he demands kebab for all the hostages, as meat is too expensive for most Egyptians. Writer Wahid Hamed has described the symbolic meaning of the demand: \\"People don't know what they want ... They are crushed, their dreams are impossible, they can't believe their demands can be fulfilled, so they ask for kebab.\\"[5] As the film draws to a close, Ahmed orders the \\"hostages\\" to leave the building, and he will wait behind to meet up with the military police now ready to swarm the building, assuming he will be killed.

According to the statement, there are two royal symbols present on the club's crest: the Crown of Aragon and the bat of King James. The Crown of Aragon is an important royal symbol in the history of Spain. It represents the historical dynastic union between the kingdoms of Aragon and Catalonia, which came to be known as the Crown of Aragon. The inclusion of the Crown of Aragon in the club's crest symbolizes its historical ties to this royal lineage, which has played a significant role in the development of the region where the club is located. The bat of King James is another prominent royal symbol featured on the club's crest. King James I of Aragon, sometimes referred to as James the Conqueror, was the driving force behind the Reconquista on the eastern peninsula, where he established the Kingdom of Valencia and expanded the territories of the Crown of Aragon. The bat is a heraldic symbol associated with King James and has been adopted by various cities and institutions within the Valencian Community. Its inclusion on the club's crest serves as a reminder of the essential role King James played in the region's history, as well as a tribute to the achievements and conquests led by the king. In summary, the presence of both the Crown of Aragon and the bat of King James on the club's original crest indeed answers the question regarding the royal symbols featured on the crest. These symbols represent the strong historical connections between the club and the region's royal past, embodying the values of unity, strength, and pride in the club's heritage."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Step 3: Construct the question based on the provided answer and context Question: In the experimental study, which technique was employed to identify the presence of hyaluronic acid receptors in the vocal fold, and where were they found to be concentrated? Step 4: Explain how the guidelines were used to create the question 1. The question is unambiguous as it clearly focuses on the identification technique (immunohistochemistry) and the location of the hyaluronic acid receptors. 2. The passage provides the necessary information to answer the question: \\"We used immunohistochemistry, and evaluated the slides [...] presence of hyaluronic acid receptors in the epithelium [...] concentrated in the central region of the vocal fold.\\" 3. The answer to the question is unique, as it is given in detail: \\"immunohistochemistry, used to assess the distribution of hyaluronic acid receptors in the central portion of the vocal fold, proved it to be present in the vocal fold epithelium and it prevailed in its middle third.\\" 4. The question uses text phrases from the passage: \\"immunohistochemistry,\\" \\"presence of hyaluronic acid receptors,\\" and \\"central region of the vocal fold.\\" The question avoids using the same words or phrases given in the passage and can be answered correctly without understanding the entire passage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Therefore, it provides a concrete contradiction to the proposed conclusion. Apart from the infeasibility due to the age of the actor involved, the actual timeline for the release of The Hobbit film trilogy also contradicts the conclusion. The films in the series were released over a span of three consecutive years, starting from 2012 and concluding in 2014.

Peter Jackson directed and produced the movies alongside producers Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens for Warner Bros and New Line Cinema.

Bass player Gaines described their sound as \\"a cross between [the] Stone Temple Pilots and Nirvana\\". Can we infer the following? Tim Gaines was a bass player for Stone Temple Pilots.","completion":"No, we cannot infer that Tim Gaines was a bass player for Stone Temple Pilots. Tim Gaines was actually the bass player for Stryper and later Sin Dizzy. When he described the sound of Sin Dizzy, he mentioned that their sound is \\"a cross between [the] Stone Temple Pilots and Nirvana.\\" This statement only provides a comparison to characterize the style and sound of Sin Dizzy, and should not be understood as an indication of Tim Gaines being associated with Stone Temple Pilots as a bass player. To provide further context, let's discuss the bands mentioned in the question: 1. Stryper: Stryper is a Christian heavy metal band formed in the early 1980s. The band's lineup included Michael Sweet (vocals, guitar), Robert Sweet (drums), Oz Fox (guitar), and Tim Gaines (bass). They were known for their distinct yellow and black costumes, as well as their Christian message. Stryper disbanded in the early 1990s, with its members pursuing other projects. 2. Stone Temple Pilots: Stone Temple Pilots, also known as STP, is an American rock band that formed in the late 1980s. The band's original lineup consisted of Scott Weiland (vocals), Dean DeLeo (guitar), Robert DeLeo (bass), and Eric Kretz (drums). They gained significant popularity in the 1990s, becoming one of the most commercially successful rock bands of that era. Their sound incorporates alternative rock, hard rock, and grunge influences. 3. Nirvana: Nirvana was an American rock band formed in the late 1980s by singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic. With drummer Dave Grohl joining in 1990, the trio went on to release several groundbreaking albums, including \\"Nevermind\\" (1991), which featured the iconic hit \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\\" Nirvana is widely regarded as one of the most influential bands in the history of alternative rock, and their music defined the grunge movement of the early 1990s. 4. Sin Dizzy: As mentioned in the question, Sin Dizzy was a Christian metal band co-founded by former Stryper members Oz Fox and Tim Gaines in the mid-1990s. The band's sound was influenced by contemporary rock bands, such as Stone Temple Pilots and Nirvana. While they didn't achieve the same level of commercial success as Stryper, Sin Dizzy allowed its members to continue exploring and creating music within the Christian metal and rock genres.

Please answer this question: Gerry Goffin was the husband of which singer?","completion":"Gerry Goffin was the husband of Carole King, an American singer-songwriter, and pianist. Carole King is widely recognized as one of the most successful and influential songwriters and performers in the history of popular music. Gerry Goffin and Carole King met in the late 1950s at Queens College in New York, where they were both studying. Their shared passion for music led them to form a songwriting partnership in the legendary Brill Building, a hub for songwriting during the late 1950s and early 1960s. The two young songwriters crafted hits for various artists, churning out timeless classics, including \\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\\" for The Shirelles, \\"Take Good Care of My Baby\\" for Bobby Vee, and \\"Up on the Roof\\" for The Drifters. As collaborators, Goffin and King complemented each other's strengths. Goffin's poetic, emotionally charged lyrics were a perfect match for King's rich, evocative melodies. Throughout their partnership, their songwriting process involved Goffin creating the lyrics while King composed the music. The couple married in 1959 but eventually divorced in 1968. Despite their personal issues, their extraordinary professional partnership endured for several more years. In 1960, Goffin and King established their own music publishing company, called Aldon Music, along with several other Brill Building songwriters. Their joint creative output flourished under the new venture. Carole King eventually launched her solo recording career in the late 1960s, with her first album, Writer, released in 1970. However, it was her 1971 album, Tapestry, that became a landmark record of the singer-songwriter movement. This iconic album featured King's own versions of some of the hits she had co-authored with Goffin, as well as new compositions. Tapestry remained on the Billboard charts for an astonishing six years and won four Grammy Awards, propelling Carole King to superstardom. Even though the Goffin-King partnership faced turbulence in their personal relationship, they left an indelible mark on the world of popular music. The legacy of their creative union contributed significantly to the American songwriting landscape. In 1990, they were inducted together into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and in 1997, they were awarded the prestigious Grammy Trustees Award for their contributions to the music industry. Furthermore, their story and enduring songs have inspired the Broadway musical, Beautiful: The Carole King Musical, which celebrates their lasting impact on music lovers around the world."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Family Jewels is a compilation DVD by the hard rock band AC/DC, the second disc contains material from the era (1980–1991) of which English singer and songwriter?

B). yes.","completion":"A) No. The two questions do not have the same meaning. The first question, \\"Which Hogwarts house are you?\\" is a personal question directed at the individual being asked. More specifically, it's inquiring about which house within the universe of \\"Harry Potter\\" the person identifies with the most. The Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in J.K. Rowling's \\"Harry Potter\\" series is divided into four houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house represents distinct characteristics and values: - Gryffindor: Bravery, daring, nerve, and chivalry. - Hufflepuff: Hard work, patience, loyalty, and fair play. - Ravenclaw: Wit, learning, and wisdom. - Slytherin: Cunning, resourcefulness, and ambition. The question likely expects an answer that falls within one of these four categories. On the other hand, the second question, \\"Why does Hogwarts have houses?\\" looks for an explanation or rationale behind the existence and purpose of having different houses in the Hogwarts school system. It's more about understanding the conceptual foundations of the Hogwarts houses, maybe from a world-building perspective or a narrative function. The answer to this question could delve into both the in-universe explanation and the narrative, thematic, and emblematic reasons J.K. Rowling may have had for creating the houses. In Rowling's series, houses function to create a sense of competition, camaraderie and identity among students whilst also serving as a major plot device. Thus, these two questions expect different types of responses - one personal, asking for the respondent's self-identification with Hogwarts houses, and the other expository or explanatory, seeking an understanding of the reasons behind the existence of Hogwarts houses within the Harry Potter series."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What work was a pretext for nude paintings by English artists?, using the article: By the time Etty exhibited Musidora, the theme was becoming something of a cliche, such that by 1850 it was described by The Literary Gazette as \\"a favourite subject for a dip of the brush\\". As interest in studies of Musidora waned, its role as a pretext for nude paintings by English artists was replaced by Lady Godiva, who had become a topic of increased interest owing to Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem Godiva. After the death of William Wordsworth in 1850, James Thomson ceased to be a major influence on writers. From the 1870s his popularity with readers waned, and by the end of the 20th century his works other than Rule, Britannia! were little known.When Etty died in 1849, despite having worked and exhibited until his death, he was still regarded by many as a pornographer. Charles Robert Leslie observed shortly after Etty's death that \\"[Etty] himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\\". Interest in him declined as new movements came to characterise painting in Britain, and by the end of the 19th century the value of his paintings had fallen. It is likely that the composition and style of John Everett Millais's controversial The Knight Errant was influenced by Musidora, but other than Millais, and Etty's admirer and imitator William Edward Frost, few other artists were directly influenced by Etty's work. In 1882 Vanity Fair commented on Musidora that \\"I know only too well how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. I have seen the gangs of workmen strolling round, and I know that their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing.\\" By the early 20th century Victorian styles of art and literature fell dramatically out of fashion in Britain, and by 1915 the word \\"Victorian\\" had become a derogatory term. Frederick Mentone's The Human Form in Art (1944) was one of the few 20th-century academic works to favourably view Musidora., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The work that served as a pretext for nude paintings by English artists was Musidora. However, as interest in studies of Musidora waned, its role was replaced by Lady Godiva, who had become a topic of increased interest owing to Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem Godiva."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Reuven's bitter, widowed father, David Malter, is a Talmudic scholar, college professor, and a practicing Zionist whom supports the establishment of a Jewish homeland in the hopes that he and his only son will return to someday to live for good and be free from worldwide persecution.Danny is a Hasidic Jew, and the first-born son of Reb Isaac Saunders, a Rabbinic sage and tzaddik who moved to the USA with his family and congregation from Russia before the 1917 October Revolution. Danny is also highly intelligent with a photographic memory, and interested in psychology (particularly Freudian psychoanalysis) but lacking in aptitude for mathematics. He wants to become a psychologist, but he feels trapped by the Hasidic tradition which forces him into the role as next in line to succeed his father as Rabbi.Reuven and Danny meet for the first time as rivals in a softball game between their high school teams that turns into a spiritual war.

Identify the type of fabric and stain: First, determine the type of fabric your furniture is made of, as this will affect the cleaning method. Check for a manufacturer's label or tag for specific care instructions. Different fabrics may require different treatments, and the type of stain (e.g., grease, ink, food) will also affect the cleaning process. 2. Vacuum the area: Before applying any cleaning solutions, vacuum the stained area to remove any loose dirt or debris. This will ensure that you are not further embedding dirt into the fabric while attempting to remove the stain. 3. Test the cleaning solution: In a small, inconspicuous area, test your chosen cleaning solution to ensure that it does not cause any damage or discoloration to the fabric. If the test spot is negatively affected, try a different cleaning solution. 4. Apply the cleaning solution: Once you have determined a safe cleaning solution for your fabric, apply it to the stain. If you're using a commercial cleaner, follow the instructions on the product label. If you're using a homemade solution, such as a mixture of equal parts water and white vinegar, gently dab the solution onto the stain using a clean cloth. 5. Blot, don't rub: While working on the stain, avoid rubbing the fabric, as this may further embed the stain into the material. Instead, gently blot the area with a clean, dry cloth, working from the outside of the stain toward the center. This will help to lift the stain from the fabric. Reapply more cleaning solution if needed and continue blotting until the stain is removed. 6. Rinse the area: Once the stain appears to be gone, dampen a clean cloth with water and gently dab the area to remove any remaining cleaning solution. Be careful not to saturate the fabric, as this may damage it. 7. Dry the area: Use a clean, dry towel or cloth to pat the area dry. If possible, use a fan or open a window to help the drying process go faster. 8. Vacuum again: After the fabric is completely dry, vacuum the area one more time to restore its appearance to a pre-stain condition. 9. Evaluate the results: If the stain still remains, you may want to consult with a professional upholstery cleaner for further assistance. Note: Sometimes, it's best to consult with professionals for specific types of stains, especially if the furniture fabric is delicate or expensive. However, this step-by-step plan should work for most common stains found on fabric furniture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This despite the fact that Moon was, with The Who, anyway, one of rock's greatest drummers. Of course, there's zero indication of that on his solo album. Go figure. Moon did enlist an all star cast to assist, but apparently they were way too wasted to make any difference. There is one acceptable track, 'One Night Stand', which was a cover of one of Rick Nelson's finest '70's singles. Nelson himself is more discernible vocally than Moon, so that explains it's relative quality, I suppose. Skip this disc unless you are either a Who fanatic or a Nelson completist.

A:","completion":"The missing first step of the process is: 1. Weathering and erosion of rocks or other materials In this step, rocks or other geological materials are broken down and worn away through various processes, such as chemical reactions, freeze-thaw cycles, wind, and water flow. This weathering and erosion cause the geological materials to break into smaller particles and sediments, which then sets the stage for the rest of the process. So, the complete process would look like this: 1. Weathering and erosion of rocks or other materials - The rocks and materials start breaking down into smaller particles due to various natural processes. 2. The sediment breaks down into small particles - As a result of the weathering and erosion, the rocks and materials become even smaller particles called sediment. 3. Wind or water picks up the sediment - Forces such as wind and water transport the sediment from its original location. 4. The sediment travels along the same route as the wind or water - The sediment gets carried by the wind or water along a specific path. 5. The sediment is deposited at new locations by the wind or water - Once the wind or water slows down or stops, the sediment is deposited in a new location. 6. The sediment is picked up again by new wind or water - In some cases, the sediment may be picked up again by different wind or water forces. 7. The sediment travels further - The newly picked-up sediment continues to travel as it is carried by the wind or water. 8. The sediment is deposited again in a new place - The sediment is ultimately deposited in a new location, where it may become part of new rock formations or contribute to the landscape of that area."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article with the title: \\"Workers in U.S. Face Stagnant Incomes and Cooling Job Prospects\\"","completion":"Title: Workers in U.S. Face Stagnant Incomes and Cooling Job Prospects Introduction The American dream has long been built on the foundation of well-paying jobs, quality education, and financial stability. However, recent years have seen a stark reality in the United States' labor market - stagnant incomes and cooling job prospects. This article will discuss the factors that have led to the decline in the quality of U.S. employment, the impact on various segments of the population, and the implications for the future of the American workforce. I. Stagnant Incomes and a Widening Income Gap Over the past few decades, income inequality in the United States has increased dramatically. The rise in disparity between the highest and lowest earners is a consequence of several factors, including technological advancements, the decline of unionization, and globalization's effect on the workforce. Stagnant incomes, particularly among the working class, have become the norm rather than the exception. A significant driver behind wage stagnation is the shift from high-paying manufacturing jobs to lower-paying service sector positions. Technological advancements have led to increased automation, resulting in a decline in the demand for labor in sectors such as manufacturing and transportation. As these jobs disappear, people are left with limited options beyond lower-wage service jobs that often lack benefits and growth opportunities. Another contributor to this widening income gap is the decline of unions and collective bargaining. In the past, organized labor gave workers more negotiating power to demand better wages, hours, and working conditions. However, with eroded bargaining power, many employees now lack the leverage to negotiate higher pay. II. Cooling Job Prospects and Stunted Economic Growth In addition to income stagnation, job prospects in the United States are also cooling. The labor market has experienced a significant decrease in high-quality job opportunities, and as a result, jobseekers are often left to compete for lower-wage positions with little chance for advancement. This trend has contributed to relatively slow economic growth since the Great Recession. A critical factor in diminishing job prospects is globalization. As multinational corporations shift labor-intensive production jobs to countries with lower production costs, American workers are often left unemployed or underemployed. This \\"race to the bottom\\" has led to negative consequences for communities that relied on these industries for economic stability and upward mobility. Moreover, technological advancements, which have the potential to be a boon for productivity, have led to job displacement. While some sectors, like the technology industry, have experienced growth, the positive impact on job creation is stifled by automation assuming the roles of many traditional labor-intensive occupations. III. Impacts on the American Workforce and Society Stagnant wages and diminished job prospects have diverse and far-reaching effects on the United States' population. Primarily, declining economic stability threatens to erode the middle class, widening the gap between the \\"haves\\" and \\"have-nots.\\" As a result, social mobility has become increasingly difficult, with children becoming more likely to earn less than their parents. Rising income inequality has also led to decreased consumer spending, perpetuating slow economic growth. Struggling households that lack disposable income often cannot afford to support local businesses, leading to more significant challenges for small business owners and stifling job creation in local economies. Lastly, stagnant incomes and limited job opportunities also have socioeconomic implications. Marginalized communities, excluded from economic growth and stable job prospects, are more susceptible to crime, reduced educational attainment, and poorer health outcomes. IV. Addressing the Problem To address the problem of stagnant incomes and cooling job prospects, policymakers and business leaders must work together to develop sustainable solutions. Some suggested approaches involve increasing the minimum wage, providing job retraining programs, investing in education, and adopting forward-thinking policies that support working families, such as paid family leave and affordable childcare. Emphasis must also be placed on promoting entrepreneurship and supporting small businesses, which can spur local economic growth and create new job opportunities. Policymakers should also focus on combating structural inequality and committing to strengthening social safety nets to ensure that no segment of society is left behind. Conclusion The United States faces significant challenges in addressing stagnant incomes and cooling job prospects. Achieving economic growth and stability requires a collective effort on the part of both the public and private sectors. By acknowledging the issues and taking appropriate action, the United States can revitalize its workforce and strengthen the foundation of the American dream. If left unaddressed, however, these challenges threaten to exacerbate income inequality and erode the very fabric of American society."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Crowded House are a rock band formed in Melbourne, Australia, in 1985. The founding members were New Zealander Neil Finn (vocalist, guitarist, primary songwriter) and Australians Paul Hester (drums) and Nick Seymour (bass). Later band members included Neil Finn's brother, Tim Finn, and Americans Mark Hart and Matt Sherrod. Originally active from 1985 to 1996, the band had consistent commercial and critical success in Australia and New Zealand and international chart success in two phases, beginning with their self-titled debut album, which reached number twelve on the US Album Chart in 1987 and provided the Top Ten hits In 2006 Neil Finn asked Nick Seymour to play bass on his third solo album. Seymour agreed and the two joined up with producer and multi-instrumentalist Ethan Johns to begin recording. As the recording sessions progressed it was decided that the album would be issued under the Crowded House band name, rather than as a Neil Finn solo album. In January 2007, the group publicly announced their reformation and on 23 February, after 20 days of auditions, former Beck drummer Matt Sherrod joined Finn, Seymour and Mark Hart to complete the new line up. As Sherrod and Hart had not participated in the initial sessions, four new tracks were recorded with producer Steve Lillywhite including the album's first single \\"Don't Stop Now\\". On 17 March 2007 the band played a live show at their rehearsal studio in front of around fifty fans, friends and family. The performance was streamed live as a webcast. The two-and-a-half-hour set included some new tracks, including \\"Silent House\\" co-written by Finn with the Dixie Chicks. A concert onboard The Thekla, moored in Bristol, followed on 19 March. Crowded House played at the Marquee Theatre in Tempe, Arizona on 26 April as a warm-up for their appearance at the Coachella Festival on 29 April in Indio, California. They also played at the Australian Live Earth concert in Sydney on 7 July. The next day, Finn and Seymour were interviewed on Rove Live and the band, with Hart and Sherrod, performed \\"Don't Stop Now\\" to promote the new album, which was titled Time on Earth. The single was a minor hit in Australia and the UK. The album was released worldwide in June and July. It topped the album chart in New Zealand and made number 2 in Australia and number 3 in the UK. On 6 December 2008 Crowded House played the Homebake festival in Sydney, with warm up gigs at small venues in Hobart, Melbourne and Sydney. For these shows the band were augmented by multi-instrumentalist Don McGlashan and Neil's younger son, Elroy Finn, on guitar.

Following the conquest of the temple fort , later known as Jaromarsburg, on Arkona in 1168 by the Danes under King Valdemar I and Bishop Absalon of Roeskilde, the princes of Rügen had to recognise Danish suzerainty. On their accession to power, the Rügen princes were forced to confirm their allegiance to the Danish king and were obliged to provide military support to the Danes. In 1304 Vitslav III of Rügen gained sole lordship over the territory on the death of his brother, Sambor. Because he had no issue at that point in time, there existed the possibility that Rügen's princely house could become extinct. As a result, in 1310 he agreed a contract of inheritance at Ribnitz with the Danish king, Eric VI Menved, his feudal lord. The agreement was that in the event of Vitslav dying without issue, the fiefdom of Rügen would be returned to the Danish crown. At that time, Eric VI Menved was attempting to extend his power in the southern Baltic Sea region in order to reduce the influence of Hanseatic towns like Stralsund. To assist him, in addition to the princes of Rügen, the king also had Prince Henry II of Mecklenburg as a vassal. After the death of Eric VI Menved in 1319, the 1310 treaty lapsed and Vitslav III sought allies in the Pomeranian dukes. On 5 May 1321 dukes Otto I of Pomerania, Vartislav IV of Pomerania-Wolgast and Barnim II of Pomerania-Stettin agreed a mutual inheritance contract with Vitslav III of Rügen. But in an alliance agreement that had been previously concluded on 25 October 1315 between Vartislav IV, the son of Vitslav's sister, Margaret, and Eric's brother, Christopher of Halland, who later became King Christopher II of Denmark, Vartislav IV had already been promised the Rügen fiefdom. Answer this question based on the article: How many people had made an agreement with Vartislav IV for the Rügen fiefdom?","completion":"Based on the article, there were two people who made an agreement with Vartislav IV for the Rügen fiefdom.

You’ve won again on “Jeopardy!” — now go have a taco to celebrate. While Rogers muffed the Final Jeopardy round on Wednesday’s episode of the syndicated game show, he still handily defeated his two opponents, raking in 20,600 for the day. That brought his seven-day total to an impressive 278,300. The Final Jeopardy category, American Plays, bore the clue, “The latitude and longitude given by the narrator of this 1938 play would set it in Massachusetts, not New Hampshire.” Also Read: 'Jeopardy!' Contestant and Bearded Bartender Austin Rogers Crosses 250,000 Total With Massive Final Bid (Video) The correct answer was “Our Town,” and Rogers’ response was a far cry from that — he offered up “What is a taco?” It may have been coincidence, but Rogers coughed up that answer for an episode that aired on National Taco Day. Likely, the episode taped so far in advance that Rogers wasn’t aware of it at the time, but who knows — he looks like a man who really enjoys his tacos. During the episode, Rogers also got dinged for mispronouncing “sherbet” as “sherbert” — a standout moment that had fans rushing to Rogers’ defense on social media.

Judging by the reaction to the New York bartender’s seven-days-and-counting run on the game show, he’s also won the attention of the show’s fans, who have lit up Twitter over his performances. While most of the response has been in admiration of his “Jeopardy!” skills and quirky antics, as with anything, there has been some trollery tossed in Rogers’ direction. TheWrap spoke to Rogers on Thursday to discuss, among other things, how he handles the criticism, what he plans to do with his “Jeopardy!” windfall and the now-infamous “sherbert” flub. Also Read: Austin Rogers Extends 'Jeopardy!' Winning Streak Despite 'Sherbet,' Taco Flubs You’ve received mixed reactions from the public on social media. How do you react to the criticism? You know what? It’s been overwhelmingly positive, and I take the Haterade with a grain of salt. And I also will engage you if you are not playing ball. Not in a mean-spirited way, but in a snarky, self-deprecating way. People are like, “He is so annoying,” and I’m like, “I know; I feel the same way too.” There was one like, “I hate Austin Rogers,” and I go, “Me too; I wake up feeling that way every morning.” What else are you going to do? And some of those tweets have turned into converts from that sort of self-deprecation. That’s all you can do with the haters, because they’re going to be there anyway. Yeah. What’s up with people not liking winning? Also Read: 'Jeopardy!' Contestant and Bearded Bartender Austin Rogers Crosses 250,000 Total With Massive Final Bid (Video) People have really reacted to your antics — such as your feigning a phone call during your introduction on Wednesday’s episode. How much of that is planned, or is it off the cuff? They’re completely off the cuff. While you’re up there, before the camera pans over to you, you forget that, “Oh no, I’ve got 11 seconds.” I forgot every single time. Every single time I stepped up to position No. 1 [and] they introduced the other two contestants and I go, “Oh, no; I’ve got 11 seconds to stare awkwardly into the camera.” It is an unbearably long time; it’s like; “…and Austin Rogers, a bartender from New York, whose six-day winnings total 200 and blah-bity blah blah, blah-bity blah blah.” Do you see how long that just was? When you’re staring at a red light on a camera for that, you can’t hold a real smile that long, you can’t fake a smile for that long. because it just looks fake. So I’m just like, “Oh; crap; I forgot. So what am I going to do? I’m just going to do something to kill this time.” It’s not so much showmanship, it’s really awkward to stand still and stare at the camera for 11 and a half seconds. Also Read: 'Jeopardy' Contestant and Bearded Bartender Austin Rogers Just Won 65,600 in a Single Game (Video) As a bartender, you’re probably used to getting free drinks. Have you been getting a lot more of them since you’ve been appearing on the show? Oh, no! The bars I go to, they still charge me! Of course. They’re all my friends, of course they’re gonna charge me, because they know I’m gonna tip the hell out of them! And they’re aware you have some cash on you these days. Got a little bit of the cash; got a little bit of the cash flow. You taped these episodes months in advance. So it was complete serendipity that you came up with the “What is a taco?” reply during Final Jeopardy on National Taco Day? Complete randomness. One hundred percent kismet, serendipity, randomness. Have you heard from Ken Jennings or any of the big winners of the past? On Twitter, they’re talking about me obliquely, but not directly. I have met some of the other big players in the history of the game, because as word of my momentum spread, they started coming to my tapings. Also Read: 'Jeopardy' Winner Ken Jennings Under Fire for Mocking Barron Trump in Tweet Have they been supportive or offered advice to you? There is this intimate fraternity of “Jeopardy!” players, and they’re all immensely, immensely supportive. Every single one has been really supportive and enthusiastic in meeting me and finding out that I’m the one who unseated them from such-and-such a record. Or I’m the one who surpassed them at such-and-such a total. No one in this “Jeopardy!’ fraternity is ever jealous. Everyone is always, “It’s fantastic to see someone who out-excelled me.” When another person beats another person in “Jeopardy!” it’s almost exclusively, “Wow, you deserve that.” No one is ever like, “I got robbed, I want a replay.” It’s really enthusiastic. I like that a lot. What has been your most disappointing moment during your “Jeopardy!” run? “Sherbert” is disappointing. [During Wednesday’s episode, Rogers was penalized for pronouncing “sherbet” as “sherbert.”] It didn’t even occur to me; I saw the phrasing, I saw what they were going for, but that’s just how I say that word. By the way, Twitter is overwhelmingly on my side. I thought it was maybe a Northeast regional dialect, but I’m seeing people from Idaho, and Iowa and Georgia and California all chiming in, saying, “We say ‘sherbert.'” Also Read: Watch Alex Trebek Rap Kanye West, Drake, Kendrick Lamar on 'Jeopardy!' What do you plan to do with all of the money you’ve won on “Jeopardy!”? I am going to be incredibly judicious. You hear all these terror stories of lottery winners bankrupt within years, blah blah blah blah blah. I have to pay my taxes, and therefore I am not touching a single dime of the money until all of my tax obligations are fulfilled. Unlike most other contestants, I have zero encumbrances. I do not have a mortgage. I do not have a kid. I do not have college debt. I do not have car payments. I do not have grandma in the hospital. This is just literal free money for me. So I can use it for leisure, or I can more likely, and better-thinking, use it for the foundation for a future of something bigger, beyond “Jeopardy!” This is now the concrete structure upon which I can build the home.

Champion Goes Viral With Quirky Style, Big Bets Austin Rogers is not your typical Jeopardy! champion. Sure, he's got brains — answering rapid-fire trivia in the form of a question to the tune of 278,000 in winnings. YouTube But Rogers, a New York City bartender, has also got plenty of flair (not to mention hair!). His goofy contestant intro segments are far from the stiff pose and awkward smile that have become a mainstay of America's Favorite Quiz Show. In one, he pretends to be talking on a phone; in another, he shifts to profile and mimes opening a bottle. Whenever he gets an answer correct, he breaks into what he describes as \\"celebratory histrionics.\\" And to top it all off, he bets big! Some say he's the best thing to happen to the game show since IBM's Watson trounced its human Jeopardy! opponents six years ago. Rogers has even spawned his own trending hashtag, #austinonjeopardy. \\"He's got hair; he's got chutzpah. He's got broad-based knowledge,\\" Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek says. Elsewhere, Rogers has been described as a cross between actor Zach Galifianakis and Martin Prince, the teacher's pet character from The Simpsons. Shorn of his signature mop-top, Rogers told ABC's Good Morning America on Thursday that he doesn't own a television but nonetheless found ways to watch \\"hundreds upon hundreds of episodes\\" of the game show in preparation for his first appearance. \\"I'm not going to say that there's a system or a code, but if you watch enough, you'll start seeing things repeat,\\" he says. Example? \\"If it ever says 'sculptor' it's probably going to be Auguste Rodin. If it ever says 'American sculptor,' it'll probably be Alexander Calder. If it ever says 'Romanian poet,' it'll be Eminescu.\\" \\"I have no idea who Eminescu is, but I've seen that come up three times in episodes across the decades,\\" he says. Asked by Trebek how he got to be so smart, Rogers replies drolly: \\"Genetics. Luck. Karma.\\" What about school? \\"School? Nah!\\" he scoffs with a wave of the hand. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"This is all about a man named Austin Rogers who has been doing really well on a TV game show called Jeopardy!

Summarize this article in one sentence. It makes a difference if you had the open or laparoscopic tubal reversal. The amount of pain and discomfort you are having will determine your ability to do things like returning to work, doing housework, or walking up stairs. You may go home the same day or the next day after the laparoscopic procedure because the incisions are small and there is less pain. You will have to stay in the hospital for several days after the open procedure. Your doctor will give you pain medicine when you go home. You should not lift anything heavier than 10 to 15 pounds for 4 to 6 weeks. It takes this long for the tissues in the abdominal wall to heal. Expect to do everything sooner than later if you have undergone the laparoscopic procedure. These serious symptoms include heavy vaginal bleeding, severe abdominal pain, persistent nausea and vomiting, excessive thirst or sweating, failure to pass gas or urine, severe bloating and/or constipation, and drainage, bleeding, or redness around the incision site. Heavy vaginal bleeding, requiring more than one pad per hour, combined with severe abdominal pain may be a sign of uncontrolled bleeding from the site of your tubal reversal. Excessive thirst and sweating can be a sign of bleeding, too. You want to drink liquids because your body needs to replace the fluids lost due to the bleeding. Sweating is your body’s response to the stress of losing a lot of blood. Remember that calling emergency services is always an option. Nausea and vomiting can be caused by anesthesia or your pain medication. Your body clears out the medications used during anesthesia in about 24 hours. Your doctor can give you a medication to help with the nausea and vomiting to get you through this period. If your doctor thinks the pain medication is the problem, she will prescribe a different one. An ileus occurs when your intestines stop pushing food and gas forward through the intestines. This happens after abdominal surgery, especially an open procedure. You will have nausea, vomiting, bloating, abdominal pain, and pass less gas. Anti-nausea medications should not be used. Time resolves the ileus. You can drink small amount of liquids until your intestines recover. Call your doctor if your symptoms get worse instead of getting better over time. Pain medications can cause severe constipation. Eat high fiber foods, vegetables or whole grain products, and take a stool softener. Call the doctor if you completely stop passing gas and stool. You want your wound to stay dry and clean so that it can heal well. Look at the wound to make sure there are no signs of an infection, such as drainage (including blood), fever (temperature greater than 101 degrees), and/or redness and warmth around the wound(s). Increasing abdominal pain and fever could be a sign of a serious infection inside the abdomen. Call your doctor so that she can examine you, order the appropriate tests, and decide how to treat the infection. Your doctor will have specific instructions. The general rule is to wait 2 to 3 days before taking the dressing off the wound(s). It takes that long for the skin portion of the wound to seal and protect deeper tissue from infection. If you have a special waterproof dressing on the wound(s), you can shower immediately. Otherwise, stand at the sink and wash around your dressing until the 2 to 3 days have passed. You can shower after this time. Letting soapy water gently run over your wound(s) helps keep it clean. Just dry it off after you are done. Do not take a bath for about a month. Most doctors will want to see you around two weeks after the tubal reversal. Expect this to be the first of many as you heal and then try to get pregnant. The first visit is about making sure you are healing as expected. She will examine your wound and look for any signs of infection. She will press on your abdomen and make sure your pain is decreasing appropriately. Most couples get pregnant in the first 6 months after the tubal reversal. If you do not get pregnant, she will schedule a hysterosalpingogram to make sure your tubes are open and functioning properly. A majority of the time, your tubes will be opened. You will try other methods to get pregnant. You will keep track of when you ovulate and plan to have sex around that time. The doctor can use drugs to make it more likely you will ovulate or she could have your partner give a sample of his semen so that she can put in inside your uterus. IVF will be discussed at some point if you continue to have difficulty getting pregnant.","completion":"The article discusses the differences in recovery time for open and laparoscopic tubal reversal procedures, emphasizing pain management and post-operation symptoms, as well as the importance of follow-up appointments to monitor healing and potential fertility success."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Nearly 900,000 veterans have pending health care requests, watchdog says WASHINGTON – Nearly 900,000 military veterans have officially pending applications for health care from the Department of Veterans Affairs, the department's inspector general said Wednesday, but \\"serious\\" problems with enrollment data make it impossible to determine how many veterans were actively seeking VA health care. About one-third of the 867,000 veterans with pending applications are likely deceased, the report says, adding that \\"data limitations\\" prevent investigators from determining how many now-deceased veterans applied for health care benefits or when. The applications go back nearly two decades, and officials said some applicants may have died years ago. More than half the applications listed as pending as of last year do not have application dates, and investigators \\"could not reliably determine how many records were associated with actual applications for enrollment\\" in VA health care, the report said. The report also says VA workers incorrectly marked thousands of unprocessed health-care applications as completed and may have deleted 10,000 or more electronic \\"transactions\\" over the past five years. Linda Halliday, the VA's acting inspector general, said the agency's Health Eligibility Center \\"has not effectively managed its business processes to ensure the consistent creation and maintenance of essential data\\" and recommended a multi-year plan to improve accuracy and usefulness of agency records. Halliday's report came in response to a whistleblower who said more than 200,000 veterans with pending applications for VA health care were likely deceased. The inspector general's report substantiated that claim and others, but said there was no way to tell for sure when or why the person died. Similarly, deficiencies in the VA's information security — including a lack of audit trails and system backups — limited investigators' ability to review some issues fully and rule out data manipulation, Halliday said. The VA has said it has no way to purge the list of dead applicants, and said many of those listed in the report are likely to have used another type of insurance before they died. VA spokeswoman Walinda West said Wednesday the agency has publicly acknowledged that its enrollment process is confusing and that the enrollment system, data integrity and quality \\"are in need of significant improvement.\\" Sens. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., chairman and senior Democrat of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, said in a joint statement that the inspector general's report pointed to \\"both a significant failure\\" by leaders at the Health Eligibility Center and \\"deficient oversight by the VA central office\\" in Washington. The lawmakers urged VA to implement the report's recommendations quickly to improve record keeping at the VA and \\"ensure that this level of blatant mismanagement does not happen again.\\" As of June 30, VA has contacted 302,045 veterans by mail, asking them to submit required documents to establish eligibility, West said. To date, VA has received 36,749 responses and enrolled 34,517 veterans, she said. \\"As we continue our work to contact veterans, our focus remains on improving the enrollment system to better serve veterans,\\" West said. The Health Eligibility Center has removed a \\"purge-and-delete functionality\\" from a computer system used to track agency workloads, West said. VA will provide six months of data to demonstrate that any changed or deleted data on VA workloads has undergone appropriate management review, with approvals and audit trails visible, she said.","completion":"The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has nearly 900,000 pending applications for health care from military veterans.

Here's a breakdown of these aspects for the given review along with the appropriate rating for each: 1. Clarity of expression: 2.5 The review seems to be quickly typed and does not strictly adhere to proper grammar and punctuation. Some phrases might not be immediately understandable, such as \\"every I open\\" and \\"rotate otomaticaly.\\" It would benefit from some proofreading to improve the clarity of the message. However, the reviewer's sentiment (dislike for the app) comes across clearly, so it is not entirely confusing. 2. Specifics of the issue: 3.5 The reviewer expresses two main issues with the app: freezing and automatic rotation. These issues provide some specific insights into the app's performance, which could be helpful for potential users and the app developer. However, the reviewer could have explained the circumstances or instances in which they experienced the problems in more detail for further clarity. 3. Constructiveness of the feedback: 2.5 Although the reviewer mentions two specific issues, there is no elaboration on how these problems could be addressed or if they tried any troubleshooting steps.

The guantlet to the Eagle boss was easy with 3 tanks . The fight on the Eagle boss was easy too and he was down well within the timer . On to the Bear boss . Answer the following question: Why was they Eagle boss not a difficult foe ?","completion":"The question revolves around the experience the team had in the game Zul'Aman (ZA), a 10-player raid dungeon in World of Warcraft (WoW), specifically pertaining to the encounter with the \\"Eagle boss,” Akil'zon. The ease of the encounter with the Eagle boss, in this case, seems to be the result of a few specific factors that played an integral part in the strategy employed by the group: 1. **Team Configuration:** The make-up of the raid group is stated to be unconventional, including 3 tanks (2 warriors and a paladin), 3 healers, and only 4 DPS. Generally, teams place significant emphasis on their DPS lineup to ensure the boss is downed quickly, but in this case, the extra tank and healer compensate for the reduced DPS by increasing the group's sustainability in the encounter. 2. **Advantage of Having Multiple Tanks:** Having three tanks instead of the conventional two is likely a big reason why this boss fight proved to be manageable for the group. Tanks are designed to draw the boss's attention and damage away from other, more vulnerable raid members, like healers and damage dealers. By having an extra tank, the group would be able to switch aggro more efficiently, thus reducing the overall incoming damage and providing an extra layer of group resilience. 3. **Effective Healing:** With three healers present, the team were quite likely able to keep up with any damage that the Eagle Boss was throwing at them. More healers mean a greater capacity to respond to incoming damage, providing a safety net for the group and allowing tanks to maintain boss aggro for longer periods. 4. **Familiarity and Expertise:** The text suggests that the group had attempted the raid before, as the entry is phrased in a way that suggests a return to Zul'Aman. Therefore, the group's previous experience and knowledge about the mechanics of the Eagle boss fight would certainly play a critical role in rendering it an easy encounter. This, combined with the strong understanding of their individual class roles within the group, might also have made the encounter well within their capabilities. 5. **Performance within Timer:** The Eagle boss was defeated \\"well within the timer,\\" indicating that the DPS classes, despite being fewer in number than is typical, are still delivering substantial amounts of damage to down the boss quickly. Winning such strategies in MMORPGs like WoW doesn't just boil down to having high damage output; it's about having a balanced team that collectively copes with the mechanics of each boss fight. Here, the team's unconventional composition, their collective experience, and the effective execution of their roles led the Eagle boss to turn out as an easy adversary."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Celenda's manservant had purchased two of the biggest and strongest oxen in Fena Kef and they now roasted over the hall's two huge braziers. The smell filled Celenda's nostrils. She closed her eyes and laid back on her silk divan, enjoying the sights and sounds. Her finger fiddled with a torn seam on the divan's armrest and her pleasure faded. She would have flogged her seamstress for allowing such a thing but the woman had fled a year ago. She could barely afford clothing acceptable to a woman of her position, though few could say for certain what that position was, so she simply wore less clothes overall. She raised her arms behind her back and let the warmth of the braziers flow over her body. Though the number shrank, many still enjoyed Celenda's frequent celebrations. Some laughed and shouted on one side, some coupled in the dark shadows and behind silk curtains. Most feasted and drank and everyone partook in the red lotus. Celenda beckoned a thin slave boy, one of her last few, and he came holding a bronze bowl. Dried red leaves covered the bottom of the bowl. 'Why is this bowl not full?' she shouted at the boy. He cringed but she could tell he was not really frightened. She could not afford to injure or kill him and everyone knew it. She slapped him, but not hard.

Make this lower case","completion":"To sew the fabric 3 decorative strip and the fabric 2 facing to the fabric 1 back as described for the front, follow these detailed instructions: 1. Gather your materials: You will need fabric 1 (the back piece), fabric 2 (the facing), fabric 3 (the decorative strip), coordinating thread, sewing pins, scissors, a sewing machine, and an iron. 2. Prepare the fabric pieces: Begin by pressing each fabric piece with an iron to remove any wrinkles. This ensures accurate cutting and sewing. Then, lay fabric 1 right side up on your workspace. 3. Prepare the fabric 2 facing: On the fabric 2, measure and mark the seam allowance along the entire length. Before attaching the facing to fabric 1, press the seam allowance under with an iron to create a clean edge. 4. Attach the fabric 2 facing: Position the prepared fabric 2 facing on fabric 1 with the right sides together and the pressed edge of the facing pointing towards the bottom of fabric 1. Align the edges and pin in place. Sew along the pinned edge with the appropriate seam allowance, and press the seam open. 5. Prepare the fabric 3 decorative strip: Press the fabric 3 strip with an iron. Fold it in half lengthwise with the wrong sides together, making sure the edges are even. Press again to create a crease along the fold. 6. Attach the fabric 3 decorative strip: Lay the fabric 3 strip on top of fabric 1, with the folded edge positioned over the seam where the fabric 2 facing is attached. The raw edges of fabric 3 should be aligned with the raw edge of the fabric 1 and 2 seam. Pin the fabric 3 strip in place, catching both fabric 1 and the fabric 2 facing underneath. 7. Sew the fabric 3 decorative strip: Using a coordinating thread, sew the fabric 3 decorative strip to fabric 1, sewing close to the folded edge. This line of stitching will hold the decorative strip in place, and will also reinforce the seam between fabric 1 and the fabric 2 facing. 8. Finish the edge: If desired, you may want to finish the raw edge of fabric 1, 2, and 3 with either a serger or zigzag stitch on your sewing machine. To do this, simply run the edge through your machine, trimming away any excess fabric and finishing the edge with your chosen stitch. 9. Press the fabrics: After sewing, press fabric 1, 2, and 3 with an iron so that they lay smooth and flat. This ensures a professional-looking finish. 10. Repeat these steps for the other side of the garment: To complete the process, follow the same instructions for attaching the fabric 2 facing and fabric 3 decorative strip to the fabric 1 front. By following these detailed steps, you can achieve a well-sewn and beautiful garment that features a decorative strip and attractive facing on both the front and back pieces."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose family had strong left-wing political commitments? Many critics have noted the extraordinary development of Dylan's songwriting immediately after completing his first album. One of Dylan's biographers Clinton Heylin connects the sudden increase in lyrics written along topical and political lines to the fact that Dylan had moved into an apartment on West 4th Street with his girlfriend Suze Rotolo in January 1962. Rotolo's family had strong left-wing political commitments; both of her parents were members of the American Communist Party. Dylan acknowledged her influence when he told an interviewer: \\"Suze was into this equality-freedom thing long before I was. I checked out the songs with her.\\"Dylan's relationship with Rotolo also provided an important emotional dynamic in the composition of the Freewheelin' album. After six months of living with Dylan, Rotolo agreed to her mother's proposal that she travel to Italy to study art. Dylan missed her and wrote long letters to her conveying his hope that she would return soon to New York. She postponed her return several times, finally coming back in January 1963. Critics have connected the intense love songs expressing longing and loss on Freewheelin' to Dylan's fraught relationship with Rotolo. In her autobiography, Rotolo explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as \\"chicks\\", and she resented being regarded as \\"a possession of Bob, who was the center of attention\\".The speed and facility with which Dylan wrote topical songs attracted the attention of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on WBAI in June 1962, Pete Seeger described Dylan as \\"the most prolific songwriter on the scene\\" and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, \\"I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff. In fact, I wrote five songs last night but I gave all the papers away in some place called the Bitter End.\\" Dylan also expressed the impersonal idea that the songs were not his own creation.

Large banks and hotels faced the main streets, with fine townhouses in the east end of Collins Street, contrasting with tiny cottages down laneways within the blocks.

Introduced diseases: The arrival of European settlers led to the introduction of new diseases, particularly smallpox, to which the Aboriginal population had no immunity. This caused widespread illness and death among the Aboriginal communities. 2. Frontier violence: The expansion of European settlements and the establishment of new towns often led to violent conflicts between the Aboriginal people and the settlers. Such confrontations resulted in casualties and further reduced the Aboriginal population. 3. Dispossession from their lands: As European settlers took over and developed more lands for agriculture, mining, and other industries, the Aboriginal people were forcibly removed from their ancestral lands.

Pour sparkling water onto the grease. Sprinkle coarse salt onto the grease and rub it in. Add some soap and continue rubbing. Use a stain remover pen. Lay your jeans out to dry. Article:","completion":"Title: Effortlessly Remove Grease Stains from Your Jeans: The Ultimate Guide Introduction Whether you're a mechanic who's spent a long day working on a car or just someone who's accidentally spilled some oil during a meal, grease stains can be a stubborn and frustrating problem. Not only do they leave unsightly marks on your clothes, but they also tend to be difficult to remove. Lucky for you, we've compiled a step-by-step guide on how to effectively remove grease stains from your jeans, leaving them looking as good as new. Step 1: Soak Up the Grease with a Paper Towel As soon as you notice a grease stain on your jeans, take immediate action to minimize the damage. Grab a few sheets of paper towel and gently press them onto the affected area, making sure to blot up as much of the grease as possible. It is imperative to avoid rubbing the stain in, as it will only make matters worse by spreading the grease around. Repeat this process with a fresh piece of paper towel until you've soaked up as much grease as you can. Step 2: Pour Sparkling Water onto the Grease-stained Area After blotting up the majority of the grease, it's time to introduce some carbonation to help break down the grease on a molecular level. Grab a bottle of sparkling water and gently pour it onto the grease-stained area. The carbonation from the sparkling water will help to lift the grease from the fabric fibers, making it easier to remove in the subsequent steps. Step 3: Sprinkle Coarse Salt onto the Grease and Rub It In Now that you've utilized the power of carbonation, it's time to take advantage of the abrasiveness of coarse salt. Sprinkle a generous amount of coarse salt over the grease-stained area and gently rub it into the fabric using your fingertips or a soft cloth. As the salt grinds against the grease, it will help to break it up and lift it away from the fabric fibers. It's essential to be gentle during this process to avoid damaging the fabric. Step 4: Add Some Soap and Continue Rubbing Once you've thoroughly worked the salt into the stain, it's time to incorporate some detergent. Apply a few drops of dish soap or laundry detergent onto the stain and continue rubbing it in. The soap will help to emulsify the grease, making it easier to remove. If the stain is persistent, you might consider using a soft-bristled toothbrush to scrub the area gently. Step 5: Use a Stain Remover Pen for Extra Support If you find that the stain is particularly stubborn, feel free to enlist the help of a stain remover pen. These handy tools are specifically designed to target and break down stains from a variety of surfaces. Follow the manufacturer's instructions and gently apply the stain remover pen to the grease-stained area. Let the solution sit for a few minutes before proceeding to step 6. Step 6: Rinse and Lay Your Jeans out to Dry Once you've completed steps 1-5, rinse the treated area of your jeans under cold water until all the soap and grease residue is gone. Make sure to avoid using hot water, as it may set the stain permanently into the fabric. After rinsing, gently squeeze out any excess water and lay your jeans out flat to dry. It's best to avoid using a dryer, as the heat can also set the stain further into the fabric. Conclusion Don't let a pesky grease stain ruin your favorite pair of jeans. By following these simple steps, you can effectively remove grease stains and restore your jeans to their former glory. With a little patience and some readily available household items, you'll be able to tackle even the most stubborn of stains with ease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What's the full name of the man the militant atheist is trying to replace as Mayor? from the following article ? Christmas has always been an exceptional time of love and tradition in the small town of Trapper Falls, Alaska. Hometown of Mayor Dan Reed looks forward to each year with enthusiasm to all the events, friends and family that fill this special season. Together with his brother Greg, they dedicate time away from their adventure tour company to drape the town is Christmas cheer. When Dan's old high school rival Mitch Bright, a mean-spirited and embittered militant atheist returns home after 20 years, Dan is immediately suspicious. Mitch is a highly successful big city lawyer who has never wanted anything to do with Trapper Falls. The rivalry re-ignites when the frustrated Mitch takes offense to what he sees as the town's violation of his rights. Mitch wants the Nativity scene removed from the front of City hall and the word Christmas switched to Happy Holidays on all signs. Fifty years of tradition are now challenged not by an outsider, but a former member of the community. As the conflict escalates, it goes beyond one person's opinion but magnifies into an entire town problem when Mitch enters into the mayoral race to have Dan replaced. In the heat of the legal battle and facing certain defeat, Dan's wife Kristen and their daughter Makayla, wanting to show what she believes to be the true meaning of Christmas, are inspired to launch a \\"Christmas with a Capital C\\" campaign as an effort to keep the town together. In doing so they discover the secret behind Mitch's return: he is looking for love and acceptance, but can't find it in the world of high-flown success.

Would the answer to this question be an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric value? Available choices: + description. + entity. + abbreviation. + human. + numeric. + location.","completion":"The answer to the question \\"Why is the grass green?\\" would fall under the category of a description. This detailed explanation involves the scientific understanding of how plants, like grass, absorb light and the role that a specific molecule called chlorophyll plays in this process. In order to perform photosynthesis, plants absorb light from the sun. This light contains a range of colors, each containing different amounts of energy. Chlorophyll, a green pigment found within the cells of plants, is critical in this process. It has the ability to absorb light most efficiently in the blue and red portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, allowing it to power photosynthesis, which is a process where plants transform sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose (sugar) and oxygen. However, chlorophyll does not absorb the green portion of the spectrum effectively. This green light is reflected by the chlorophyll molecules, which in turn is detected by our eyes as the color green. Therefore, the grass appears green to us since chlorophyll reflects the green light instead of absorbing it. In summary, the grass is green primarily due to the presence and function of chlorophyll, a green pigment in plant cells set to capture sunlight efficiently for photosynthesis while reflecting green light. This explanation falls under the category of a description, as it details the scientific processes that lead to the color we perceive in grass."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Background: Law enforcement officers are often unfamiliar with information technology, and so lack the skills and interest in pursuing attackers. There are also budgetary constraints. It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as DNA testing, and improved forensics mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a network administrator or a system administrator) requires a search warrant and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant. Paragraph: Two neighboring police Departments took different approaches to fighting crime, Greenville P.D. did not invest in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology, while Grayville took extensive measures of that nature.

On the other hand, Greenville P.D. chose not to invest in those advanced technologies, which could result in less ability to identify and track criminals using modern techniques. Both approaches have their pros and cons, and the overall efficiency would depend on various factors such as crime trends, budget management, and the departments' abilities to leverage other traditional methods for fighting crime."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Hedren was born on January 19, 1930, in New Ulm, Minnesota, to Bernard Carl and Dorothea Henrietta (nee Eckhardt) Hedren. For much of her career, Hedren's year of birth was reported as 1935. In 2004, however, she acknowledged that she was actually born in 1930 (which is consistent with the birth registration index at the Minnesota Historical Society). Her paternal grandparents were Swedish immigrants, while her maternal ancestry is German and Norwegian. On October 13, 1961, she received a call from an agent who told her a producer was interested in working with her. When she was told it was Alfred Hitchcock who, while he was watching The Today Show, saw her in a commercial for a diet drink called Sego, she agreed to sign a seven-year contract. During their first meeting, the two talked about everything except the role he was considering her for. Hedren was convinced for several weeks it was for his television series, Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Hitchcock later said, \\"I was not primarily concerned with how she looked in person. Most important was her appearance on the screen, and I liked that immediately. She has a touch of that high-style, lady-like quality which was once well-represented in films by actresses like Irene Dunne, Grace Kelly, Claudette Colbert, and others but which is now quite rare.\\" Hitchcock put Hedren through an extensive color screen test that lasted two days and cost 25,000, doing scenes from his previous films, such as Rebecca, Notorious and To Catch a Thief with actor Martin Balsam. According to Balsam, Hedren was very nervous but studied every line, did every move she was asked to, and tried to do everything right. Hitchcock asked costume designer Edith Head to design clothes for Hedren's private life and he personally advised her about wine and food. He also insisted for publicity purposes that her name should be printed only in single quotes, 'Tippi'. The press mostly ignored this directive from the director, who felt that the single quotes added distinction and mystery to her name. Hitchcock was impressed with Hedren. As production designer Robert F. Boyle explained, \\"Hitch always liked women who behaved like well-bred ladies. Tippi generated that quality.\\" Afterward, Hedren was invited to lunch with Hitchcock, his wife, Alma, and Lew Wasserman, head of Universal, at one of Hitchcock's favorite restaurants, Chasen's. There she was presented with a golden pin of three birds in flight, adorned by three tiny seed pearls, and was asked by Hitchcock to play the leading role in his upcoming film The Birds. \\"I was so stunned. It never occurred to me that I would be given a leading role in a major motion picture.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person whose monument says they died at 51? In 1754, Belton was inherited by Sir John Cust, the son of previous owner Viscount Tyrconnel's widowed sister. Cust was a distinguished politician active during the politically turbulent 1760s, and his monument at Belton blames his death at the age of 51 to the \\"unusual fatigues of his office\\". His heir was created Lord Brownlow in 1776, and Belton was owned by successive Lords Brownlow for the next 200 years.In the last three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money restoring Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.At the beginning of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and the largest and most drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established in the southern part of Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and Grantham railway station on the East Coast Main Line. The depôt was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920. Little sign of the Machine Gun Corps's stay remains in the park, but plaques and inscriptions can be followed from the south gate of Belton park to the memorial gate on the way from there to the town centre and in the north aisle of Grantham parish...

Elevations range from 1,562 feet (476.1 m) at the creek's mouth to 9,495 feet (2,894 m) at the summit of Mount McLoughlin, with an average of 3,528 feet (1,075 m). About 56 percent is federally owned by the Bureau of Land Management and the United States Forest Service, 44 percent is privately owned, and a small fraction belongs to the City of Medford.The Big Butte Creek watershed experiences a Mediterranean climate. Temperatures range from 10 °F (−12 °C) in the winter to 100 °F (38 °C) in the summer. Precipitation averages between 35 and 80 inches (890 and 2,000 mm) annually. Most precipitation occurs between November and March. Nine percent of the watershed's surface runoff is collected from rain, 35 percent from rain on snow, and 56 percent from snow. The watershed contains the largest groundwater source in the entire Rogue River basin; one major outlet is at Big Butte Springs.The watershed is split into two geographic regions: the High Cascades and the Western Cascades, both volcanic in origin. The Western Cascades compose the western two thirds of the watershed. This region is highly eroded, being between 17 and 38 million years old. Its unstable slopes are primarily made of pyroclastic rock. Due to the rock's high ability to absorb moisture, earthflows are common. The High Cascades are much younger, around three to seven million years old. Mount McLoughlin is the most prominent High Cascade volcano in the watershed, last erupting between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago. Basalt and andesite are the most common rock types in this region.Nearby watersheds include Little Butte Creek to the south, small Klamath River tributaries such as Fourmile Creek to the east, the South Fork Rogue River to the east and north, and minor tributaries of the Rogue River including Reese and Indian creeks to the west. contains an answer for the question: What type of rock has a high ability to absorb moisture?, what is it ?

What is the answer to this question? who did mel in eastenders have a baby with?","completion":"The character Melanie Owen (Mel), portrayed by Tamzin Outhwaite, in the British soap opera EastEnders had a baby with Ian Beale, a longstanding character played by Adam Woodyatt. Melanie Owen first appeared on the show in 1998, and during her time on EastEnders, she had a few notable relationships, including those with Phil Mitchell and Steve Owen. However, it was her relationship with Ian Beale that led to her becoming pregnant. In 1999, Mel and Ian got engaged, but their relationship faced various problems, such as Mel having an affair with Phil Mitchell. Nevertheless, the couple proceeded with their wedding, only for Mel to leave Ian at the altar after discovering his lies. Soon afterward, Mel found out that she was pregnant with Ian's child, ultimately giving birth to a baby boy named Hunter Owen. The character Mel Owen left the show in 2002, along with her son Hunter. They later returned to EastEnders in 2018, when it was revealed that Steve Owen, Mel's ex-husband, had actually adopted and raised Hunter as his own son, even though Ian was his biological father. Hunter's storyline became increasingly darker as the show progressed, culminating in him going to prison after accidentally killing his step-father, Ray Kelly. Tragically, Hunter Owen was killed in a dramatic prison siege storyline, leaving both his mother Mel and his biological father Ian devasted. To sum up, Mel Owen in EastEnders had a baby with Ian Beale, although her son Hunter was eventually adopted and raised by Steve Owen before the character's untimely death."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Sentence: \\"What place did you travel to?\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","completion":"A linguist would generally rate the sentence \\"What place did you travel to?\\" as acceptable linguistically, but with some considerations. First, let us analyze the components and structure of the sentence: 1. \\"What\\" - an interrogative pronoun used to introduce a question. 2. \\"place\\" - a noun referring to a specific location or area. 3. \\"did\\" - an auxiliary verb helping to form questions in the simple past tense. 4. \\"you\\" - a pronoun referring to the person being addressed. 5. \\"travel\\" - the main verb in its base form, describing the action of going somewhere. 6. \\"to\\" - a preposition indicating a destination or point of arrival. From a syntax perspective, the sentence is well-formed. It follows the standard English question word order of an interrogative pronoun (what), auxiliary verb (did), subject (you), and main verb (travel) in its base form. However, some linguists might argue about the usage of the preposition \\"to\\" at the end of the sentence. In formal English, it is generally not recommended to end a sentence with a preposition. This rule is known as “preposition stranding” and can lead to more conservative linguists regarding the sentence as less acceptable. According to this view, a more acceptable sentence would be: \\"To what place did you travel?\\" That said, the rule against ending a sentence with a preposition has become more flexible over time, and contemporary English usage often allows for sentences like \\"What place did you travel to?\\" to be considered acceptable, particularly in casual or spoken contexts. Another point to consider is that the sentence is somewhat ambiguous regarding the type of journey or trip the speaker wants to know about. Travel can refer to local or short journeys, long-distance journeys, vacations, business trips, and more. The question \\"What place did you travel to?\\" could be interpreted in various ways depending on the context in which it is asked. In summary, a linguist would likely rate the sentence \\"What place did you travel to?\\" as acceptable linguistically, especially in informal and spoken contexts. While some might argue that ending the sentence with a preposition is not ideal, modern English usage has become more lenient on this point. Regardless, it is crucial to consider the context surrounding the sentence, as it could lead to different interpretations depending on the intended meaning of \\"travel.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You have two options to help you with this: Option 1: You can use bleach spray for cleaning, which is a strong solution that helps to remove dirt, stains, and even some germs.

Be careful with bleach, as it might be harmful if it gets on your skin or eyes. You may want to wear gloves when using it. Option 2: If you want a gentler option, you can use window spray instead. Window spray is made to clean glass surfaces, but it can also work on other surfaces like walls. It might be a better option for sensitive skin and will not damage the paint.

Article: SAN DIEGO — Mitt Romney laid down a marker for a prospective presidential campaign in 2016, telling a Republican audience here Friday night that the party can win the White House with a conservative message that stresses security and safety for the American people, opportunity for all regardless of background and a plan to lift people out of poverty. In his first public appearance since his surprise announcement that he will seriously consider a third campaign for the White House, Romney offered an economic message that represented a dramatic departure from the themes he sounded in losing the 2012 campaign to President Obama. “Under President Obama, the rich have gotten richer, income inequality has gotten worse and there are more people in poverty than ever before,” Romney said. “Under this president, his policies have not worked. Their liberal policies are good every four years for a campaign, but they don’t get the job done.” In his last campaign, Romney was hampered by an image, pushed by the Democrats, that he was a wealthy business executive who was out of touch with ordinary Americans. On Friday, he seemed determined to send a signal that he would try to deal with that problem from the start, should he run. “It’s a tragedy -- a human tragedy – that the middle class in this country by and large doesn’t believe the future won’t be better than the past or their kids will have a brighter future of their own,” Romney said. He added, “People want to see rising wages and they deserve them.” As with others in his party, he raised the issue of social mobility and the difficulty of those at the bottom from rising into the middle class. He cited former president Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty half a century ago. Johnson’s intentions were good, he said, but his policies had not worked. He argued that Republicans must persuade voters that conservative policies can “end the scourge of poverty” in America. Beyond a focus aimed more at struggling middle-class families and those in poverty, Romney’s brief remarks Friday included comments about the work he had done as a lay pastor in the Mormon Church, a topic he rarely spoke about in his past campaigns. He invoked his wife Ann, who stood on the stage with him. “She knows my heart in a way that few people do,” he said. “She’s seen me not just as a business guy and a political guy, but for over 10 years as you know I served as a pastor for a congregation and for groups of congregations... She’s seen me work with folks that are looking for better work and jobs and providing care for the sick and the elderly. She knows where my heart is.” Romney joked also that the question he’s been asked most frequently in recent days is what Ann thinks about another campaign. “She believes that people get better with experience,” he joked. “Heaven knows I have experience running for president.” The one element of Romney’s substantive remarks that did not mark a departure from his last campaign was criticism of Obama on foreign policy. Citing threats across the globe to U.S. security, Romney said, “The results of the Hillary Clinton-Barack Obama foreign policy have been devastating, and you know that. Terrorism is not on the run.” Romney’s appearance came aboard the USS Midway, an aircraft carrier museum docked in downtown San Diego, where the Republican National Committee held a reception to conclude its winter meeting here. His appearance drew a throng of reporters, with about two dozen cameras awaiting him and his wife when they arrived shortly before 7 p.m. PT. Before taking the stage, Romney mingled with RNC members and reminisced about happy times on the campaign trail in 2012. When he saw some friends from Puerto Rico, he recalled the thunderous rally he attended in San Juan during the territory’s primary campaign. “I don’t think anybody thought we’d be getting any delegates in Puerto Rico, but we got ‘em all, thanks to you,” Romney said. Ann chimed in, “That was the most extraordinary night.” Ann told a few reporters she was excited to be back on the campaign trail, but said this was a “time to think.” Asked whether her husband would run again, she said, “We don’t know yet.” As the Romneys walked to their SUV to leave the aircraft carrier, a few fans asked Mitt to autograph a few baseballs. \\"Look at this,\\" he said with a smile and a chuckle. \\"Isn't that nice to get the chance to sign a baseball again?\\" He signed a few, but then told them, \\"One more. I don't want to flood the market with these -- might drop the price below 50 cents again.\\" His last words as he got into the waiting SUV were: “I’m thinking – thinking about it. Giving it consideration.” Romney’s remarks came at the end of a tumultuous week in the Republican presidential race — and a roller-coaster ride for the 2012 nominee. His declaration that he will seriously consider running again generated both surprise and excitement within GOP circles. The announcement foreshadowed a potentially dramatic clash between the former Massachusetts governor and former Florida governor Jeb Bush. Romney and his inner circle worked the phones in an effort to gauge interest and potential support for a third campaign, and to begin to reassemble the team that carried him to the nomination and into the general election. But within days, another reality set in, which was resistance to his possible candidacy. A few one-time Romney supporters expressed public skepticism while others privately said they hoped he would not go forward. There was criticism as well about the way the rollout was handled, which appeared to have been little planned and caught even some close to Romney by surprise. There was criticism as well about the rationale that some of those around Romney were using to justify a new campaign. Many Republicans, however fond they are of Romney personally, are unforgiving about the campaign he ran, arguing that Obama was highly vulnerable and that a more skilled campaign and candidate would have won. Romney quickly came under pressure to explain not only the substance behind his belief that he should be the 2016 nominee but also to show that a new campaign would be run differently, with new faces and an expanded operation. ||||| Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney sought to cast himself as a champion of the nation’s poor Friday, as he announced he is giving a third presidential campaign “serious consideration.” Addressing the GOP’s elite at the winter meeting of the Republican National Committee aboard the U.S.S. Midway, Romney premiered a brand new stump speech, laying out the themes of his proto-campaign and for the party in the “post-Obama era.” “First, we have to make the world safer,” Romney said. “Second, we have to make sure and provide opportunity for all Americans regardless of the neighborhood they live in. And finally, we have to lift people out of poverty. If we communicate those three things effectively, the American people are going to be with us—be with our nominee and with our candidates across the country.” Romney received a warm welcome from the members of the RNC in his first appearance with them since his Nov. 2012 loss to President Barack Obama. “It’s nice to appear with friends like this, I gotta tell ya,” he said over the clamor of applause as he took the stage. In strikingly personal terms for the famously wooden candidate, Romney spoke about his service as a “pastor” in the Mormon Church helping the poor, saying of his wife, Ann, “She’s seen me work with people who are very poor to help them get help.” Romney aides said that should he formally announce he would be more comfortable showing his warmer private persona in public. “Under President Obama, the rich have gotten richer, income inequality has gotten worse, and there are more people in poverty in America than ever before,” Romney said. “People want to see rising wages, and they deserve them,” he added. He argued that conservative principles would best address the problem. “The only policies that will reach into the hearts of American people and pull people out of poverty and break the cycle of poverty are Republican principles, conservative principles. They include family formation, and education and good jobs and we’re going to bring them to the American people and finally end the scourge of poverty in this great land.” The focus on poverty reflected a significant change of tune for Romney, a multimillionaire private equity executive who famously told a group of donors that 47 percent of Americans would never vote for him because they are dependent on government and “believe that they are victims.” Romney’s 2012 campaign even prevented his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, from incorporating a discussion of poverty into his stump speech. But Romney continued to echo his infamous line, as well as his assertion after the election that Obama won in 2012 because he gave “gifts” to minority voters, saying of Democrats, “Their liberal policies are good every four years for a campaign, but they don’t get the job done.” Romney, who believes his 2012 critiques of the Obama foreign policy have been vindicated, sharply criticized the president’s handling of global crises and geopolitical threats. “The world is not safer six years after Barack Obama has been in office,” he said, referencing last week’s terrorist attacks in France, Nigeria, and Yemen. “Terrorism is not on the run.” Romney indicated that his wife is on board with a potential third campaign. “She believes that people get better with experience, and heaven knows I have experience running for president,” he quipped, adding, “Me, I’m giving some serious consideration to the future.” Romney said regardless of his decision, he would work to support the Republican Party’s nominee in 2016. In his introduction, RNC Chair Reince Priebus effusively praised Romney in his introduction, crediting him for his help for GOP candidates in 2014. “Governor Romney was the man over these last two years,” Priebus said. “I just want to thank him for all of the work that he did, beside the life-changing experience of being the nominee, Mitt Romney was a person who spent the next two years helping our party, helping our party rebuild, and helping our party grow.” But Romney, who faced a skeptical, if friendly audience, did not put an end to doubts that his candidacy would be in the party’s best interests. “We heard some new themes tonight from Governor Romney, but we heard many other candidates’ new themes this week,” said South Carolina Chairman Matt Moore. “What’s clear is that this primary is going to be seriously competitive—whether Governor Romney gets in, or not.” “I think he was talking about supporting the team,” said Rep. Darrell Issa, discounting Romney’s talk that he’s seriously considering a bid. “Obviously he’s doing a trip around to ask people whether they think he should be the candidate, but the important thing:, he made a strong commitment to the RNC here tonight that regardless of the outcome he’d be supporting the nominee.” Issa would not say whether he thought Romney should launch a third bid for the White House. ||||| SAN DIEGO (AP) — Mitt Romney is offering a rare glimpse of his softer side as he marches toward an unlikely third presidential bid focused on poverty and the middle class.

(Associated Press) Mitt Romney, the former Republican presidential nominee, speaks during the Republican National Committee's winter meeting aboard the USS Midway Museum Friday, Jan. 16, 2015, in San Diego. (AP Photo/Gregory... (Associated Press) Conceding that he's giving \\"serious consideration to the future,\\" the Republican Party's 2012 presidential nominee on Friday cited the support of his wife, Ann, as he addressed the closing reception of the Republican National Committee's winter meeting aboard a retired aircraft carrier. \\"The last few days, the most frequently asked question I get is, 'What does Ann think about all this?'\\" Romney said as his wife looked on. \\"She believes that people get better with experience. And heaven knows I have experience running for president.\\" He later added, \\"She knows where my heart is.\\" Romney earned a standing ovation for his remarks, his first public acknowledgement of 2016 ambitions since privately signaling interest with donors a week earlier. However, RNC members and his prospective opponents were far less welcoming in the days leading up to his appearance. \\"The country moves on,\\" said Henry Barbour, a Republican national committeeman from Mississippi. \\"And that's going to be a challenge for Gov. Romney.\\" History is not on Romney's side. Not since Richard Nixon has a Republican presidential nominee lost the general election — John F. Kennedy defeated Nixon in 1960 — and then won the GOP nomination again. Nixon defeated Hubert Humphrey in 1968. Yet there is little doubt Romney would be a force in the 2016 contest should he run. He remains one of the best-known Republicans in the nation, maintains close ties to the GOP elite donor class and has a network of loyal supporters across the country. Early polls show him doing well against lesser-known potential Republican opponents. Yet an overwhelming concern from former supporters looms over his return to the national stage: the lingering perception that the former private equity executive cares only about the fate of wealthy Americans. The image was fueled in part by his own high-profile missteps during his last presidential campaign. The son of an auto company chief executive who made a fortune in finance measured in the hundreds of millions famously described corporations as people and highlighted his close friendships with the owners of professional sports teams. No gaffe was bigger than Romney's remark — secretly recorded at a high-dollar Florida fundraiser — that he doesn't worry about 47 percent of Americans who \\"believe they are victims\\" and \\"pay no income tax.\\" On Friday, however, he hinted that he had learned his lesson. Romney outlined three principles that could serve as the foundation of a campaign during a 15-minute speech, while referencing his work with the poor, sick and elderly as a volunteer church pastor — a topic he rarely addressed during his previous bids. His new focus includes national security, improving opportunities for the middle class and \\"breaking the scourge of poverty.\\" \\"Our principles will bring opportunity to every American,\\" Romney declared, adding, \\"It's a tragedy, a human tragedy, that the middle class in this country by and large doesn't believe that the future will be better than the past.\\" The growing field of first-time Republican presidential prospects was largely dismissive of Romney, while others questioned his ability to broaden his appeal in a third campaign. \\"He just didn't attract a big enough constituency,\\" Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said as he courted voters earlier in the day in Las Vegas. Indeed, Romney struggled to win over younger voters, lower income voters and minorities on the way to a 2012 campaign loss that devastated his family and his party. Friends and foes alike concede he'll have to do more than change his message to win new supporters. Paul on Friday repeated that he had been reaching out to ethnic and racial minorities for more than a year to broaden the GOP's appeal, where Romney had only recently admitted to past supporters that he needed to do better connecting with Hispanics and addressing the needs of the poor. Paul cast himself as \\"someone who can reach out to the African-American community and the Hispanic community and the youth community and the working class and say, \\"You know what? We understand.'\\" As Paul has taken steps toward running for president he has held public events in inner-city communities, including schools on Chicago's south side. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, meanwhile, declared himself ready for another presidential run and said Romney's interest in a 2016 bid \\"doesn't change my dynamic.\\" \\"It doesn't change my strategy,\\" Perry said in an interview before Romney's speech. Romney's team suggests he will make a decision about the 2016 campaign soon, both out of fairness to the other candidates contemplating bids and former allies who had begun to move on. Former Gov. Florida Jeb Bush began phoning leading officials in New Hampshire this week, with similar calls planned for Iowa — the first and second states on the presidential nominating calendar. \\"While I have a lot of respect for Gov. Romney, and you know I think he is imminently qualified to serve as president, I think there's going to have to be a vetting process in New Hampshire again,\\" said Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., a major Romney supporter in 2012 who was among those on Bush's recent call list. \\"I want to know what's his vision for the country, just like I'm going to want to know from every candidate, so I think this field is wide open still,\\" she said. ___ Associated Press writers Ken Ritter in Las Vegas and Kathleen Ronayne in Concord, New Hampshire, contributed to this report. |||||Summary:","completion":"In 2015, Mitt Romney addressed a Republican audience about the possibility of a third presidential campaign.

Input: Abstract: BACKGROUND Histone deimination regulates gene function and contributes to antimicrobial response, allowing the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Deiminated proteins are target of anti-citrullinated peptides antibodies (ACPA) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). OBJECTIVE The objective of this paper is to test the hypothesis that RA sera react with deiminated histones contained in NETs. METHODS Neutrophils from peripheral blood were stimulated with A23187 and acid treated; NETosis was induced by phorbol myristate acetate, and NET proteins were isolated. Sera were tested by immunoblot on acid extracted proteins from neutrophils and from NETs, and by ELISA on deiminated histone H4 or H4-derived peptides. Bands reactive with RA sera were excised from gels, digested with trypsin and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time of flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis, before and after derivatisation to detect citrullinated peptides. RESULTS RA sera reacted with a deiminated antigen of 11 KDa from activated neutrophils, recognised also by anti-H4 and antideiminated H4 antibodies. A similar reactivity was observed with NET proteins. The antigen from neutrophils or NETs was identified as citrullinated H4 by MALDI-TOF analysis. By ELISA, RA sera bound in vitro citrullinated H4. Citrullinated H4 14-34 and 31-50 peptides detected antibodies in 67% and 63% of RA sera and in less than 5% of controls; antibody titre was correlated with anti-CCP2. CONCLUSIONS Citrullinated H4 from activated neutrophils and NETs is a target of antibodies in RA, and synthetic citrullinated H4-derived peptides are a new substrate for ACPA detection. As NETosis can generate antigens for ACPA, these data suggest a novel connection between innate and adaptive immunity in RA..

Do the high frequency sounds have a longer or shorter wavelength than the low frequency sounds? Bill is working in a sound studio recording sound effects for a short film that he is working on. Some of the sounds he captured have a very high frequency and others are very low frequency. When he is done he begins to edit the sound with a computer program. Hint: Figure B above shows an important relationship between the wavelength and frequency of a wave. The top wave clearly has a shorter wavelength than the second wave. However, if you picture yourself at a stationary point watching these waves pass by, more waves of the first kind would pass by in a given amount of time. Thus the frequency of the first waves is greater than that of the second waves. Wavelength and frequency are therefore inversely related. As the wavelength of a wave increases, its frequency decreases. The equation that relates the two is Answer:","completion":"High frequency sounds have shorter wavelengths than low frequency sounds. Based on the information provided in the paragraph and the hint, there is an important relationship between the wavelength and frequency of a wave. As mentioned, wavelength and frequency are inversely related, which means that as one increases, the other decreases. In the case of Bill working in a sound studio and recording different sound effects, the high frequency sounds would have a higher number of wave cycles passing a stationary point in a given amount of time compared to the low frequency sounds. This is due to their higher frequency, which directly translates to a larger number of wave cycles in the same time span. As the frequency of these high-frequency sounds is greater, their wavelength would be shorter according to the inverse relationship between frequency and wavelength. On the other hand, low frequency sounds, with a lower number of wave cycles passing a point within the same time frame, would have longer wavelengths. This relationship can be further explained through the equation that relates wavelength and frequency, which is: v = fλ In this equation, 'v' represents the velocity of the wave, 'f' is the frequency, and 'λ' (lambda) stands for the wavelength. Since the velocity of sound in a given medium remains constant, when the frequency 'f' increases, the wavelength 'λ' must decrease to maintain the equation's balance, and vice versa. Therefore, high frequency sounds have shorter wavelengths, while low frequency sounds have longer wavelengths. This is an essential concept when working with sound waves and editing them, as it provides insights into the characteristics of different types of sounds and helps in achieving desired sound effects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His portrayal of the character's gradual transformation—both emotionally and physically—driven by his unwavering sense of hope is simply astounding. Throughout the movie, Robbins manages to captivate audiences with a mix of stoicism, vulnerability, and quiet determination, embodying the essence of the underdog who fights against the odds. Likewise, Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Red is nothing short of iconic. He infuses the character with wisdom, wit, and charm, creating the perfect foil for Robbins' Andy. Freeman's trademark voice lends an additional layer of gravitas and warmth to the narration, guiding the viewers through the story as the characters develop an unbreakable bond of friendship and camaraderie. The chemistry between Robbins and Freeman is palpable, and it serves as an integral aspect of the film's emotional core. The supporting cast is equally commendable, with each actor delivering a solid performance that brings the story to life. Bob Gunton's portrayal of the ruthless Warden Norton and Clancy Brown's depiction of the sadistic Captain Hadley add a sense of genuine menace to the film. The ensemble cast, consisting of inmates and prison staff, adds depth and variety to the story, compelling the audience to invest in their journeys as well. One major triumph of The Shawshank Redemption is its exceptional screenplay, characterized by sharp dialogue and a masterful balance between moments of tension, humor, and heartfelt emotion. Expertly paced, the film allows viewers to fully immerse themselves in the narrative, steadily guiding them through a rollercoaster of emotions. Another standout feature of the movie is its memorable score by Thomas Newman. The music perfectly complements the narrative, expertly evoking emotions that range from despair to hope, further enriching the movie-watching experience. In conclusion, The Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly a timeless classic, telling a profound and beautifully crafted story of hope, redemption, and the unbreakable human spirit. With phenomenal performances, an engrossing narrative, and a deeply emotional core, the film stands as a testament to the power of cinema as a medium to convey the complexities of the human experience. For anyone who has yet to witness the magic of this masterpiece, it comes highly recommended and remains a must-watch."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: New research finds a link between poverty and poor decision making. The findings may explain why poor people sometimes make bad choices that continue their hardship. Earlier studies have found the poor less likely to escape poverty. But there has been little research on why the poor make decisions that make their lives harder. Until recently, it was economists who studied poverty, not psychologists. Eldar Shafir, a psychologist in Princeton University says now scientists from both fields work together. Mr. Shafir and his team did two experiments. One took place at a shopping center in New Jersey. Another was carried out among sugar cane farmers in rural India. The New Jersey experiment involved individuals with low paying jobs and others belonged to the middle class. All the volunteers were asked what they would do if their cars needed repairs. The volunteers were given two imaginary situations. In the first, the car repairs cost 150. In the second, 1,500. \\"And what we found is that the poor and the rich performed equally well on almost all the tests. \\" Not so when the researchers raised the repair costs to 1,500. \\"Now the poor performed significantly worse. \\" The poorer lost about 13 IQ points on average. This is about the loss experienced when a person has not slept for one night. The scientists then wondered if the same person reacted differently when he was rich and when he was poor. The Indian sugar cane farmers earn most of their money once a year, when the harvest comes in. But the money often does not last through the year. \\"So they find themselves basically rich after the harvest when the income comes in and poor just before the harvest. The researchers gave them tests similar to the ones taken by the people in New Jersey. They tested the Indian farmers before the harvest and after. And the results were much the same as with the mall shoppers. \\"They performed much more slowly and with many more mistakes when they were poorer than when...

The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance.

The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 drama film based on the novella \\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\\" by Stephen King. The movie, directed by Frank Darabont, stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Ellis \\"Red\\" Redding. Step 3: Discuss and analyze the characters and their development. Tim Robbins' portrayal of Andy Dufresne, a man falsely accused of murder and sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary, is nothing short of exceptional.

Morgan Freeman shines as Red, the prison contraband smuggler who becomes Andy's friend and ally. Freeman's subtle, heartfelt performance lends a great deal of emotional depth to the film. Step 4: Praise the direction, cinematography, and production design. Frank Darabont's direction is masterful, effectively controlling the pacing and tone of the story. His compassionate approach to the characters and their dilemmas makes the movie truly unforgettable.

The production design by Terence Marsh also deserves mention, as it makes Shawshank State Penitentiary feel like a character in its own right. Step 5: Highlight memorable scenes and achievements. The Shawshank Redemption is punctuated with moments that are both powerful and deeply affecting. The iconic scene in which Andy plays Mozart over the prison's loudspeakers is a perfect example of the film's brilliant storytelling and thematic resonance. The movie also boasts a remarkable score by Thomas Newman, which contributes significantly to the emotional impact of the story. Step 6: Conclude with an overall assessment.

Premise: \\"Once on a particular island, you can easily get around on foot or rent a car for more in-depth exploring.\\" This premise tells us that, on this island, transportation and exploration are possible through two primary means: walking on foot and renting a car. It suggests that walking is a viable and perhaps straightforward option, while renting a car might be a preferred choice for those who wish to undertake more comprehensive exploration. Hypothesis: \\"It's impossible to get around by car on the island.\\" This hypothesis contradicts the information provided in the premise, as it states that cars are not a viable means of transportation on the island. The hypothesis essentially negates the part of the premise that mentions the possibility of renting cars for in-depth exploring purposes. Now let's look at the logical relationship between the two statements. The hypothesis seems to contradict the premise, as the premise states that renting a car is a potential option for those who wish to explore the island. While the premise does mention the usability of walking for getting around, it does not deny the possibility of renting and using a car on the island. In fact, the premise explicitly states that renting a car is an option. Considering the information provided in the premise and the contradictory nature of the hypothesis, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. In other words, based on the premise, we cannot assert that \\"it's impossible to get around by car on the island.\\" Instead, if the premise is true, we would expect that it is indeed possible to rent and use a car for more in-depth exploration on the island. We would only be able to conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise explicitly mentioned that using cars is impossible.

Answer: 'no' if one of the statements is less ethical, and 'yes' otherwise. ACTION1: waking my roommates up for a snack ACTION2: wanting to leave my wife of a few years because I'm not attracted to her","completion":"Step 1: Understand the task In this task, I am asked to identify if one of the action statements is less ethical than the other. Step 2: Analyze each action Action 1: Waking up roommates for a snack This action implies disturbing others' sleep for a non-urgent reason. This action could be considered inconsiderate, but not necessarily highly unethical. Action 2: Wanting to leave my wife of a few years because I'm not attracted to her This action could have significant emotional consequences for both parties involved. It would likely be seen as more unethical as it pertains to long-term commitments and relationships. Step 3: Compare the actions Comparing the two actions, Action 2 involves a more significant ethical question regarding relationships and commitment, whereas Action 1 is about a smaller inconvenience for others. Step 4: Provide output Given the difference in impact between the two actions, I can conculsively state that one action (in this case, Action 2) is less ethical. Therefore, my output will be 'no'."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: Conservation of charge is the fourth of the five conservation laws in physics.

Although Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.

(Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) released her second album Kala in 2007, which achieved widespread critical acclaim, and was certified gold in the United States and silver in the United Kingdom. Six months after giving birth to her son Ikyhd in February 2009, she began composing and recording her third studio album in a home studio section of the Los Angeles house she had bought with her partner Ben Bronfman. She used instruments such as the portable dynamic-phrase synthesizer Korg Kaossilator to compose. She took the beat machine and began recording atop Mayan pyramids in Mexico. Much of the work on the album was undertaken at her house in Los Angeles, in what she called a \\"commune environment\\", before it was completed in a rented studio in Hawaii. She collaborated with writer-producer Blaqstarr because, in her opinion, \\"he simply makes good music\\". M.I.A.'s collaboration with Derek E. Miller of Sleigh Bells on the track \\"Meds and Feds\\" prompted her subsequent signing of the band to her label N.E.E.T., and according to Miller, this experience gave him the confidence to record the band's debut album Treats.Her creative partnership with the comparatively unknown Rusko grew from a sense of frustration at what she saw as her now more mainstream associates suggesting sub-standard tracks due to their busy schedules. Diplo worked on the track \\"Tell Me Why\\", but at a studio in Santa Monica rather than at the house. He claimed in an interview that, following the break-up of his personal relationship with M.I.A. some years earlier, he was not allowed to visit the house because \\"her boyfriend really hates me\\".Tracks for the album were whittled down from recording sessions lasting up to 30 hours. Producer Rusko, who played guitar and piano on the album, described the pair getting \\"carried away\\" in the studio, appreciating the \\"mad distorted and hectic\\" sound they were able to create.

One dad doesn't know how to do his daughter's hair, so some people try to help him. Another one must _ with his son for three days in the desert. Because the father can't cook, they only eat instant noodles . Why is Where Are We Going, Dad? so popular? Because it is about how Chinese parents look after their kids.

The High Court in Glasgow heard that the victim died outside his home. Carroll later told his grandmother: \\"I've done something stupid.\\" He faces a mandatory life term when he is sentenced at a later date. The court heard that Mr Gannon lived downstairs from Carroll at the flats in St Monance Street. Carroll once had a disagreement with another neighbour about her dog misbehaving. On 14 August, Mr Gannon was chatting to the neighbour who had the dog, inside the tenement when Carroll walked by. The court heard that Carroll was already wanted by police at the time after failing to turn up for a court hearing in connection with an attack on his mother. Mr Gannon followed him and shouted: \\"Don't you be giving abuse to the woman in my close.\\" Carroll initially ignored the comment - but then turned and confronted his neighbour. Prosecutor Ross McFarlane said: \\"In a sudden movement, Carroll produced a large knife and struck out a number of times. \\"He stabbed Mr Gannon in the neck area...blood started to spurt from the wound and he tried to run back towards his flat.\\" The victim collapsed blood-soaked in the street and never recovered from the attack.

We are already living through the worst refugee crisis since World War II. There are countries in Africa and the Middle East bursting at the seams with refugees. For generations American diplomats have joined the United Nations in urging those countries to keep their borders open, and to uphold international standards on the treatment of refugees. Many do just that with exemplary generosity. What will be our response if other countries use national security as an excuse to start turning people away, or deny rights on the basis of religion? What could this mean for the Rohingya from Myanmar, or for Somali refugees, or millions of other displaced people who happen to be Muslim? And what does this do to the absolute prohibition in international law against discrimination on the grounds of faith or religion? The truth is that even if the numbers of refugees we take in are small, and we do the bare minimum, we do it to uphold the United Nations conventions and standards we fought so hard to build after World War II, for the sake of our own security. If we Americans say that these obligations are no longer important, we risk a free-for-all in which even more refugees are denied a home, guaranteeing more instability, hatred and violence. If we create a tier of second-class refugees, implying Muslims are less worthy of protection, we fuel extremism abroad, and at home we undermine the ideal of diversity cherished by Democrats and Republicans alike: “America is committed to the world because so much of the world is inside America,” in the words of Ronald Reagan. If we divide people beyond our borders, we divide ourselves. The lesson of the years we have spent fighting terrorism since Sept. 11 is that every time we depart from our values we worsen the very problem we are trying to contain. We must never allow our values to become the collateral damage of a search for greater security. Shutting our door to refugees or discriminating among them is not our way, and does not make us safer. Acting out of fear is not our way. Targeting the weakest does not show strength. We all want to keep our country safe. So we must look to the sources of the terrorist threat — to the conflicts that give space and oxygen to groups like the Islamic State, and the despair and lawlessness on which they feed. We have to make common cause with people of all faiths and backgrounds fighting the same threat and seeking the same security. This is where I would hope any president of our great nation would lead on behalf of all Americans. ||||| By Amanda Wicks Hollywood’s A-listers have a message for anyone concerned about the next four years underneath President Trump. A bevy of stars gathered to sing a version of Gloria Gaynor’s single “I Will Survive,” reimagining the 1979 disco hit as an anti-Trump anthem of sorts. Related: Snoop Dogg Ready to Roast ‘Uncle Tom’ Inauguration Performers Emma Stone, Michelle Williams, Matthew McConaughey, Natalie Portman, Taraji P. Henson, Amy Adams, Chris Pine, Andrew Garfield and more participated in the video. “This is going to be interesting, guys,” Garfield says at the beginning. “It may get too real.” Some stars chose to sing while others treated the lyrics as more of a spoken word performance. The video appeared as part of W Magazine‘s The Scene, and the publication had this to say about its reason for releasing a star-studded version: “While the song has long been interpreted through a socially conscious lens, it’s the kind of anthem we need now more than ever with the inauguration bearing down on us. With an impending Donald Trump presidency, I will survive.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"The article discusses the ongoing refugee crisis and the potential consequences of countries using national security as an excuse to deny entry to refugees or discriminate against them based on religion. It highlights the importance of upholding the United Nations conventions and standards, emphasizing that if the United States abandons these obligations, it could lead to even more instability and violence. The author argues that creating a tier of second-class refugees and dividing people based on religion fuels extremism and undermines diversity. Instead of targeting the weakest, the focus should be on addressing the sources of terrorism and making common cause with people of all faiths and backgrounds fighting the same threat.

These tools collect data about the weather. You can see some of the common tools listed below: A thermometer measures temperature. An anemometer measures wind speed. A rain gauge measures the amount of rain. A hygrometer measures humidity. A wind vane shows wind direction. A snow gauge measures the amount of snow. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What can data tell us?\\" is \\"Amount of rain fall\\"?","completion":"Data can reveal various aspects of weather and environmental conditions, helping us understand and interpret the ongoing atmospheric changes. From the paragraph, it is evident that several specialized tools can gather data related to different weather elements. This data, in turn, allows us to answer numerous questions about weather conditions and patterns. Regarding the question, \\"What can data tell us?\\", it is not limited to \\"Amount of rainfall\\" but encompasses a wide range of factors related to weather conditions, including temperature, wind speed, wind direction, humidity, rain and snowfall amounts. By analyzing the data collected from these tools, we are better equipped to make informed decisions, predict future weather events, plan outdoor activities, and even manage agricultural practices. Here's a brief summary of how the data collected from each instrument mentioned in the paragraph can help: 1. Thermometer: Measures temperature, indicating how cold or hot the environment is. This data helps us dress appropriately for the weather, manage indoor climate using heating or cooling systems, and plan outdoor activities. 2. Anemometer: Measures wind speed, informing us about the strength of the wind. This information is crucial for various applications, such as predicting storms, calculating wind power potential, and ensuring safe conditions for sailing and flying. 3. Rain gauge: Measures the amount of rain, providing data on precipitation amounts. This information is useful for managing water resources, predicting floods, and assessing the impact of rainfall on agriculture and ecosystems. 4. Hygrometer: Measures humidity, giving an indication of the moisture content in the air. This data is essential for understanding the risk of mold and mildew growth to maintain healthy living conditions and identifying areas prone to fog and dew, affecting transportation safety. 5. Wind vane: Shows wind direction, telling us from which direction the wind is blowing. This information is useful for identifying weather patterns, anticipating changes in temperature and humidity, and assisting pilots and sailors in navigation. 6. Snow gauge: Measures the amount of snow, offering insight into the volume of snowfall in a specific area. This data is crucial for managing snow removal, assessing avalanche risks, and predicting the impact of snowmelt on water resources. In conclusion, data can provide a wealth of information about weather conditions and environmental factors, allowing us to make informed decisions, plan effectively, and ensure safety.

The Eastern Time Zone encompasses the eastern portion of the United States, including cities like New York, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Miami, and Boston, as well as parts of eastern Canada, including cities like Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, and Quebec City. It is important to note that the Eastern Time Zone extends from the eastern seaboard of the United States, covering a substantial amount of the densely populated regions of the country, and also neighboring regions in Canada. Standard time is observed during the non-daylight saving time, which usually extends from the first Sunday in November to the second Sunday in March. During this time, Eastern Standard Time (EST) applies, and New York is 5 hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC-5). On the other hand, daylight saving time is observed from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November. During this time, the clocks are adjusted forward by one hour to maximize the usage of daylight in the evenings. As a result, Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) is observed, and New York is 4 hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC-4). To summarize, New York follows the Eastern Time Zone, which comprises of Eastern Standard Time (UTC-5) during standard time, and Eastern Daylight Time (UTC-4) during daylight saving time.

Direct Effect: When more trees block the sunlight, there will be less sunlight available to strike the chlorophyll molecules in the plant. This results in less energy available to drive the photosynthesis process. Photosynthesis is the main source by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose. Therefore, less light would directly lead to less glucose (sugar) being produced. Indirect Effect: On the indirect front, since less glucose is being produced, the plant will also generate less oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis. Oxygen is released when plants convert water and carbon dioxide into glucose. If this process is hindered due to less sunlight, the oxygen production will also be reduced thus affecting the balance of oxygen in the environment.

Choose from: A). no B). yes","completion":"B). yes The two questions you've asked are indeed paraphrases of each other, as they both inquire about the existence of ghosts in real life. To address your concerns, let's dive deeper into the subject. The existence of ghosts has been a topic of debate and speculation for centuries. Ghosts are typically defined as the spirits or souls of deceased individuals who, for some reason, have not moved on to an afterlife and instead continue to inhabit the physical world. Many cultures around the world have their own folklore and beliefs surrounding ghosts, often influenced by religion and local traditions. Throughout history, there have been countless reported encounters with ghosts, often in the form of seeing apparitions, hearing unexplained sounds or voices, and experiencing sudden changes in temperature or other unusual phenomena. However, despite the numerous claims and widespread belief in the existence of ghosts, there is no concrete scientific evidence to support these claims. Many researchers and scientists have attempted to study the existence of ghosts using various methods and tools, but so far, none have been able to produce empirical evidence that supports their existence. Some experts propose that ghostly encounters may actually be the result of psychological factors such as hallucinations, sleep paralysis, or the power of suggestion. The human brain is a complex organ, and our perception of reality can be influenced in many ways. Additionally, some purported ghost encounters may be explained by natural occurrences or environmental factors, such as electromagnetic fields, infrasound vibrations, or even mold that could affect a person's perception or behavior. These factors could contribute to a misinterpretation of what may actually be happening in a given environment. In conclusion, although the questions you asked are paraphrases of each other, regarding the existence of ghosts in real life, there is currently no definitive scientific evidence to confirm their existence. Many reported encounters with ghosts can be explained through psychological, environmental, or natural phenomena. Until there is concrete evidence to support their existence, ghosts remain subjects of mystery and fascination, with beliefs often rooted in cultural and religious traditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Even if the Republicans — who have a majority in both the House and Senate — approve a bill, it faces almost certain defeat in the upper chamber where Democrats hold enough seats to prevent Republicans, even if they all vote together, from reaching the 60 votes needed for passage. Earlier in the week, the president had called for Congress to quickly approve sweeping immigration legislation. But in a Friday tweet the president said, \\"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem.

He was the eldest son of Baburao Hazare and Laxmi Bai. He has two sisters and four brothers. He later adopted the name Anna, which in Marathi means \\"elder person\\" or \\"father\\". Context: Hazare was drafted in the Indian Army in April 1960, where he initially worked as an army truck driver and was later attested as a soldier. He undertook army training at Aurangabad. During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, Hazare was posted at the border in the Khem Karan sector. He was the sole survivor of an enemy attack--variously claimed to have been a bomb, an aerial assault and an exchange of fire at the border--while he was driving a truck. The experiences of wartime, coupled with the poverty from which he had come, affected him. He considered suicide at one point but turned instead to pondering the meaning of life and death. He said of the truck attack, \\"[It] sent me thinking. I felt that God wanted me to stay alive for some reason. I was reborn in the battlefield of Khem Karan. And I decided to dedicate my new life to serving people.\\" At a book stand in New Delhi railway station, he came across Swami Vivekananda's booklet \\"Call to the youth for nation building\\" which inspired him to think deeper. He spent his spare time reading the works of Swami Vivekananda, Gandhi, and Vinoba Bhave. In a blog post, Hazare expressed his views on Kashmir by saying that it was his \\"active conviction that Kashmir is an integral part of India\\" and that if required once again for service, he would remain \\"ready to take part in war against Pakistan.\\" During his fifteen-year career in the army (1960-75), Anna Hazare was posted at several locations, including Punjab (Indo Pak war 1965), Nagaland, Bombay (1971) and Jammu (1974) During the Indo pak war, Hazare survived a road crash while driving for the army. He interpreted his survival as a further sign that his life was intended to be dedicated to service. He had another escape in Nagaland, where one night, underground Naga rebels attacked his post and killed all the inmates. He had a miraculous escape as he had gone out to return nature's call and hence turned out to be the lone survivor.

From thieves and safe-breakers, to robbers and fraudsters, these images give a fascinating glimpse into the murky world of Tyneside’s 1930s criminal fraternity. The photographs of the criminals had lain hidden for decades, until a chance discovery saw a book of mugshots uncovered in a junk shop and handed to experts. They are thought to be from a police identification book, used to document the habits and descriptions of known criminals in 1930s Newcastle. Smile for the camera: John Dodgson, listed as a 'general thief and bad character 'who had 'extensively tattooed forearms and hands'. His image was found in a rare book in a junk shop containing the mugshots of some of the most notorious convicts of 1930s. Convict: James Hargreaves Jones, a beggar and housebreaker - his distinguishing feature was a scar running along the side of his cheek from a wound. Little else is known about the mugshots, although some clues appear in the documents. One of the men, William Jones, whose alias was Robert Dodds, is mysteriously noted as 'dead, died in action Benwell Hotel'. Though no other details as to the nature of his death are given, his crimes are described as 'larceny, burglary, house and shoplifting'. Criminal; Arthur Bell was caught for larceny and breaking into properties. Jones, who was born in 1876, and had tattoos including a sailor’s head and a naked woman, was said to use various methods of entry to premises and worked alone. He also played the violin outside pubs and had a conviction in the United States of America for shooting a man. Another particularly colourful character is James Lowrie, otherwise known as the 'Sunderland Kid'. He was accused of 'larceny from person, and robbery' and was described as an 'expert pickpocket who associates with all classes of pickpockets'. One of the perpetrators, Dick Albert, is described as a 'general all-round thief and safebreaker'. On camera: James Isadore Epstine (aka James Robertson) who was a thief as well as involved in embezzlement. Another, John Dodgson, is described as a 'general thief and bad character'. Thomas Giles, also known as Thomas O’Malley, meanwhile, was a burglar who also dabbled in metal theft and counterfeit coins. The notes with the mugshots offer details of criminals and their distinguishing markings, which are labelled as 'peculiarities'. Named and shamed: Thief James Casey whose distinguishing marks included tattoos on his forearm including 'True Love' 'Evelyn' and a heart. John Gallagher is described as having a missing left eye and James Hargreaves Jones as having 'wound scar rt. side of face'. Carolyn Ball, manager of Tyne and Wear Archives, said: 'These mugshots were originally found in a junk shop by a member of the public and subsequently donated to the archives. 'They offer an intriguing insight into the crimes of the era and the way they were described. Dodgy underworld: Lone thief John Thomas Hollings - his distinguishing marks include scars on his right jaw, neck and back of his hand. Revealed: Thomas Orange who broke into shops and warehouses. 'These images are absolutely fascinating and it’s great that we are able to share them online in this way. 'They are proving very popular as well with over 15,000 views since they were posted.' Caught: An image of John Williams Archibold - he broke into shops and pubs in the afternoon.","completion":"The article is about old photos of criminals from the 1930s in Newcastle.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the person that owned the Hookend studio? is inside the article: In Waters' absence, Gilmour had been recruiting musicians for a new project. Months previously, keyboardist Jon Carin had jammed with Gilmour at his Hookend studio, where he composed the chord progression that became \\"Learning to Fly\\", and so was invited onto the team. Gilmour invited Bob Ezrin (co-producer of 1979's The Wall) to help consolidate their material; Ezrin had turned down Waters' offer of a role on the development of his new solo album, Radio K.A.O.S., saying it was \\"far easier for Dave and I to do our version of a Floyd record\\". Ezrin arrived in England in mid-1986 for what Gilmour later described as \\"mucking about with a lot of demos\\".At this stage, there was no commitment to a new Pink Floyd release, and Gilmour maintained that the material might become his third solo album. CBS representative Stephen Ralbovsky hoped for a new Pink Floyd album, but in a meeting in November 1986, told Gilmour and Ezrin that the music \\"doesn't sound a fucking thing like Pink Floyd\\". Gilmour later said that the new project was difficult without Waters. He experimented with songwriters such as Eric Stewart and Roger McGough, but eventually settled on Anthony Moore, who was credited as co-writer of \\"Learning to Fly\\" and \\"On the Turning Away\\". Whereas many prior Pink Floyd albums are concept albums, Gilmour settled for the more conventional approach of a collection of songs without a thematic link. By the end of that year, he had decided to make the material into a Pink Floyd project., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the article, the owner of the Hookend studio is not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that David Gilmour, a member of Pink Floyd, was the one who likely owned or was closely associated with the Hookend studio.

The hitmen torture Del into revealing that he has hidden the drugs in the trunk of a car but are not successful in getting him to tell which car it is. Betty witnesses the murder and experiences a fugue state, escaping the reality of murder into the comforting fantasy of the soap opera.

Write an article based on this \\"Sky's independent directors are under mounting pressure to secure a higher bid from Rupert Murdoch for the 61% stake in the satellite broadcaster it does not own.\\"","completion":"Title: The Intensifying Pressure on Sky's Independent Directors to Secure a Higher Bid from Murdoch for the Remaining Satellite Broadcaster Stake Introduction In recent times, there has been an upsurge of pressure on Sky's independent directors to secure a more significant bid from media tycoon Rupert Murdoch for the remaining 61% stake in the satellite broadcaster the Murdoch family's empire does not own. The acquisition of this majority stake would provide the Murdoch family even greater control over the broadcasting service. As the independent directors are responsible for ensuring the best possible deal for Sky's shareholders, they are currently being scrutinized amidst rising concerns that they might not effortlessly obtain a higher offer. This article delves into the background of this potential transaction, discusses how it would impact Sky, analyzes the challenges faced by the independent directors, and considers the possible outcome of this high-stakes negotiation. Background Sky, a leading British satellite broadcaster, has experienced tremendous growth since its inception in 1989. It currently operates in several countries and provides top-quality television and broadband services to millions of subscribers. In 2017, Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox made a bid to acquire the remaining 61% stake in Sky that it does not own. However, the takeover attempt was met with significant regulatory hurdles and scrutiny, eventually leading to a protracted and complex negotiation process. In 2018, Comcast, an American telecommunications conglomerate, acquired Sky for £30.6 billion (40.1 billion) after a highly contested bidding war with 21st Century Fox. This move by Comcast left the Murdoch family with a 39% stake in Sky. With the recent pressures for a higher bid from Murdoch, the stage is set for yet another acquisition tussle. Impact on Sky Consolidating the ownership of Sky under the Murdoch family would have both positive and negative implications for the satellite broadcaster. On the one hand, the acquisition would provide a stable and long-term vision for the company, as the Murdoch family has a broad range of experience in the media industry. This could potentially lead to innovations in programming and technology that would strengthen Sky's market position. On the other hand, concentrating the ownership of Sky under a single entity could stifle its growth by reducing its independence and impacting its decision-making. Additionally, there could be concerns about media takeover and influence in the UK by the Murdoch family, given their ownership of other media assets, including several newspapers. Challenges Faced by Independent Directors The growing pressure on Sky’s independent directors highlights the challenges they face in representing the interests of Sky’s shareholders. In addition to engaging in extensive negotiations and considering the implications of the acquisition on Sky, the independent directors must address rising concerns that they may not aggressively pursue a higher bid from Murdoch. These concerns stem from the impressions that the directors may not want to jeopardize their positions in the company and may be susceptible to influence from the Murdoch family due to their involvement in the broader media landscape. Balancing their fiduciary duty to shareholders and navigating potential conflicts of interest is a crucial task for Sky's independent directors in this high-stakes negotiation. Possible Outcomes There are several potential outcomes of the mounting pressure on Sky's independent directors to secure a higher bid from Murdoch. One possible outcome is that the directors could succeed in obtaining an increased offer from the Murdoch family, resulting in a higher payout for Sky's shareholders. Alternatively, the directors could fail to secure a higher bid, leading to potential shareholder dissatisfaction and calls for the replacement of the directors. In either case, the outcome will have lasting effects on the relationship between Sky's shareholders, board of directors, and the Murdoch family, as well as the future of the satellite broadcaster. Conclusion The ongoing pressure exerted on Sky’s independent directors to secure a heightened bid from Rupert Murdoch for the remaining 61% stake in the satellite broadcaster demonstrates the complexity of high-value acquisitions in the media industry. As independent directors are tasked with representing shareholders' interests, they face increased scrutiny during the negotiation process amid concerns about potential conflicts of interest. While a successful acquisition by the Murdoch family could lead to a more consolidated vision for Sky, it may also result in stifled growth and increased concerns about media influence in the UK. The negotiation outcome will undoubtedly impact the future of Sky and the broader media landscape for years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who sends emissaries to movie producers? from the following article ? Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa finds himself without adequate funding to finance his war against the military-run government. He also finds himself at odds with the Americans because of the Hearst media empire's press campaign against him. To counter both of these threats, he sends emissaries to movie producers to convince them to pay to film his progress and the actual battles. Producer D.W. Griffith is immediately interested and convinces Mutual Film Studios boss Harry E. Aitkin to send a film crew. Aitkin's nephew Frank Thayer is initially a mere errand boy for the studio, but he makes a good impression with Villa, who demands that Thayer be placed in charge of the project. Thayer and a camera crew team film Villa leading his men to victory in battle. Despite the failure of this initial footage (which draws derisive laughter from potential backers) Thayer convinces Aitkin to invest even more money in a second attempt, and also convinces Villa to participate in making a more narrative film. Thayer returns to Mexico with a director, actors, producers, cameramen and screen writers, and begin to film Villa's previous exploits using a younger actor, future film director Raoul Walsh. The filming goes well, although Villa becomes angry that the screenwriters and the director have changed history to make a more dramatic film. However, he agrees to do a cameo appearance as an older version of himself. Meanwhile, Thayer begins a romance with actress Teddy Sampson whom he's had a crush on since they first met. One night Villa announces that they will attack a Federal held fort at Torreon and win the revolution. The film's director and his crew tell Villa that they are not coming with him to film the battle. Villa scares them into going to the battle by having a firing squad shoot over their heads.

In the first sentence, \\"He has a lot of interest in vintage cars,\\" 'interest' is used as a noun, and it indicates a feeling of curiosity or concern about, or a desire to be involved with, a specific subject or activity. In this case, vintage cars. It suggests the person's enthusiasm, passion, or fascination with vintage cars. The word 'interest' here refers to a personal preference or a hobby. In the second sentence, \\"The iron interests stepped up production,\\" 'interests' is also a noun, but it has a completely different meaning. Here, 'interests' refer to a group, or a group of people, that have a shared financial stake, often in a company or an industry. It indicates businesses, organizations, or parties involved in a specific field or sector – in this case, the iron industry. The sentence implies that participants in the iron industry (referred to as the iron interests) have increased their production. This usage of 'interests' can often imply a more strategic or financial motivation or goal. In this context, it is related to businesses and commerce, and not about personal preference or passion. In conclusion, though the same word-'interest' has been applied in both sentences, the meaning differs significantly in each context. One emphasizes an individual's personal passion for a specific subject, while the other focuses on the shared financial and strategic aspect of groups involved in an industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Waves hit the coast - Waves have energy that pushes the water and sediment - The sediment can help erode land like sandpaper - Water washes the sediment back - Some sediment is left as sand. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less water in the environment happens, how will it affect fewer waves hit the coast. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"If there is less water in the environment, it will indeed have an effect on the process of waves hitting the coast. The perturbation you mention would lead to fewer waves reaching the coast and, as a result, could lead to several direct and indirect effects on the coastal erosion process. Direct Effects: 1. Reduced Erosion: With fewer waves and less energy reaching the coastline, the process of erosion might be slowed down. The sediment will not be moving around as much, and the abrasive action that helps erode the land will be weakened. 2. Reduced Deposition: As the wave energy decreases, the movement of sediment decreases as well. The deposition of sand on the coast will be limited, and the overall sand supply would decrease. Indirect Effects: 3. Changes in Coastal Ecosystems: Less wave action may have a significant impact on coastal ecosystems. Many species depend on the natural movement of sediment and the constant change of coastal environments. A reduction in wave energy reaching the coast could lead to alterations in local habitats and the species that reside in them. 4. Coastal Infrastructure: With the change in erosion and deposition patterns, human-made infrastructure might be affected. For instance, there might be less protection from waves and their effects on land, ultimately leading to potential damage to structures on the coast. To summarize, a perturbation that results in fewer waves hitting the coast will directly influence the coastal erosion process by reducing both erosion and deposition. This change could also have several indirect consequences, such as impacts on coastal ecosystems and human infrastructure."},{"prompt":"You are given a sentence in Galician.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: select the rows whose int ' l debut record fuzzily matches to france . the number of such rows is 2 . Student:","completion":"To solve this instance, we need to follow these steps: 1. Filter the rows where the value in the 'l debut record' column is approximately equal to 'france'. 2. Count the rows in the filtered view. We can write these steps in terms of logical operations as follows: 1. {filtered_view = filter_round_eq(table, 'l debut record', 'france', tolerance)} 2. {result = count(filtered_view)} 3. {final_result = eq(result, 2)} In this solution: - filter_round_eq represents filtering the table where the values in the 'l debut record' column approximately match 'france'. We'll consider some tolerance value. - count represents the number of rows in the filtered view. - eq returns true if the count is equal to 2, which is the number of rows mentioned in the problem instance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"The two questions you've asked are similar but have slight differences. 1. Should I drop a year after engineering for CAT preparation or join Capgemini as a fresher? 2. Should I drop 1 year after a BE for CAT preparation? Both questions revolve around the idea of taking a gap year after completing your Bachelor of Engineering (BE) to dedicate your time to preparing for the Common Admission Test (CAT). However, the first question also introduces the alternative option of joining the multinational corporation, Capgemini, as a fresher. In order to provide a comprehensive answer, we'll address the concerns and factors involved in both questions. The decision to take a year off after acquiring your BE degree to prepare for CAT or to join Capgemini as a fresher depends on your personal priorities and professional goals. Here are some factors to consider: Career Goals: If you are eager to gain industry experience and have a keen interest in working for a multinational company like Capgemini, then joining the organization as a fresher could be a great career move. On the other hand, if your long-term goal involves receiving an MBA degree from a prestigious institute, preparing for CAT might align better with your aspirations. Job Prospects after MBA: Enrolling in an MBA program could potentially take your career to new heights, and the Common Admission Test is the first step toward getting into a top B-school. Scoring well on the CAT can pave the way for exciting job opportunities and higher earning potential, depending on the institute and specialization you choose. Risk and Uncertainty: Consider the risk factors involved in both paths. Taking a gap year to prepare for CAT can be risky and uncertain, as it depends on your performance on the exam, admission criteria, and the B-school you secure. Joining Capgemini as a fresher would provide more immediate job stability. Time and Preparation: Preparing for CAT requires dedication and focused effort. If you believe that you can manage CAT preparation while working for Capgemini, this could be the best of both worlds. However, if you cannot efficiently balance work and study commitments, taking a gap year for CAT preparation might be a better option. Personal Priorities: Consider whether postponing your professional life for a year aligns with your personal priorities, such as financial stability, personal responsibilities, and more. You should also reflect on whether taking a gap year might negatively impact your momentum or motivation. Ultimately, these questions are similar in that they both involve deciding whether to dedicate time to preparing for the CAT after completing a BE. However, the first question introduces an additional factor – the option of joining Capgemini as a fresher. By carefully weighing the factors outlined above, you can make an informed decision that aligns with your personal and professional goals."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Jackson moved the grapes to the green_box after Charlotte exited the bathroom, so Jackson might believe Charlotte will search for the grapes in their original location. Part #5: Answer the question based on the analysis. Usage: Sample response: \\"Jackson thinks that Charlotte searches for the grapes in the red_crate.\\" This meets the criteria because it is based on the analysis of the story and considers Jackson's likely belief about where Charlotte will search for the grapes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

First, we see that 10591*f and 10510*f both involve 'f'. That means, we can combine the two. The way to do it is to subtract 10510 from 10591, just like if you had 5 apples and you ate 4, you would have 1 apple left. So, 10591 - 10510 equals 81. Therefore, we rewrite the equation as -1944 = 81*f. Now, to find 'f', we're gonna divide both sides of the equation by 81. It's like sharing your 81 candies equally so each candy represents 1*f. When you divide -1944 by 81, you get -24. Therefore, 'f' equals -24.

Title: Very dull and boring Review: There are not too many Irish Karaoke DVDs out there so I was very keen to get this one and listen to it.

It was from a karaoke superstore that rates all it's review as 5 star, and the review itself gave little more than a track listing.Anyway, I found most tracks to be very dull and boring. There was just no life in the tracks. I have been singing along to Irish tunes for many years and was wanting a Karaoke DVD for my wife to listen to and learn. She had previously shown an interest in doing this, but after listening to this I think she has been put off for life.The only thing this DVD may help is for her to get a gist of the songs and learn the words.

On Lap 19, the caution flag was thrown after a multi-car accident. Waltrip continued leading until Lap 55, in which Dale Earnhardt Incorporated teammate Dale Earnhardt, Jr. After Bobby Hamilton, Jr. had an accident on Lap 70, Earnhardt led the race into pit road, but was pushed out by Gordon and Brian Vickers, and fell to fifteenth, giving Mike Wallace the lead entering Lap 74. Shepherd pitted on the following lap, and Morgan Shepherd took the lead. However, Shepherd would later pit, as Gordon regained the lead. Waltrip then retook the lead from Gordon on Lap 86, though Gordon then took the lead again 13 laps later. Ten laps later, Gordon pitted, and Waltrip was given the lead. On the ensuing lap, Earnhardt took the lead, though he later pitted, and Jimmy Spencer gained the lead. On Lap 113, Spencer lost the lead to Gordon when he pitted, who led the pit stops on Lap 139. Dave Blaney stayed out, and took the lead, though Ryan Newman gained first-place when Blaney went to pit road. Newman pitted on Lap 143, giving Tony Stewart the lead. With ten laps left in the race, Hendrick Motorsports teammates Jeff Gordon and Jimmie Johnson followed in third and fourth, respectively, behind Tony Stewart and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Johnson then pushed Gordon past Stewart and Earnhardt, and Gordon subsequently won, his fourth of the season and second consecutive.

Problem:Question: As the sea floor condenses it causes sea levels to do what? Answer: drop Solution:","completion":"In this task, you are asked to provide an explanation for the given question and answer. The question is \\"As the sea floor condenses, it causes sea levels to do what?\\" and the answer is \\"drop.\\" Explanation: The statement implies the connection between the condensation of the sea floor and the drop in sea levels. To understand this relationship, we can break it down into specific processes. 1. The sea floor, also known as the ocean floor, consists of the Earth's crust and upper mantle that is submerged underwater. It has tectonic plates, which move due to geological forces. 2. When the sea floor \\"condenses,\\" it refers to a reduction in the size and spreading of the oceanic crust. This can happen on a geological timescale due to changes in tectonic plate movements or, in some cases, through natural sediment compaction processes. When the sea floor condenses, it implies a decrease in the volume occupied by the ocean floor. 3. A change in the volume or depth of the ocean floor can directly affect the overall sea level. A decrease in the volume of the sea floor means that there is more space for the seawater to occupy, causing the sea levels to lower. So, based on the given question and answer, we can deduce that when the sea floor condenses, it causes the sea levels to drop due to the decreased volume of the ocean floor, allowing more room for seawater and thus resulting in a drop in sea level."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Christopher Warm had a sedentary job. On his keyboard he typed various letters and numbers, which would become computer programs. In his company he was known as Office Desk, because when he was working he always sat behind his well-used piece of conference table standing in a hard to notice corner in the software specialists' room. Christopher wasn't a wide person, and so his piece of conference table didn't have to be too big either, which also practically solved office space problems in the 0-1 Computer firm. It was Warm's secret that the majority of his time outside of the company, he also spent behind a desk. On his keyboard he typed various letters and numbers, which would become computer programs for the 0-1 Computer Associates company. While the Man Called Office Desk (MCOD, or simply Cod in an alternative version) was writing an intuitive program for the management of empty office desk space in software companies, a thing that nobody had ever expected to happen happened. Warm became fused with the chair. The staff at 0-1 Computer were disappointed, they had expected Cod to fuse with a desk. It would have been much more entertaining to watch, you could have laughed at him a little, and the nickname, given to him by the programmers' boss would have gotten a whole new meaning. And right now, there wasn't even much to talk about during cigarette breaks. Warm did not hide the fact he would have preferred to fuse with a mouse, or a mouse pad. Right now, all he could do was to pretend he totally ignored the fact he was physically stuck to a chair. And he was doing just fine until it was time to go to his second shift at 1-0 Computer Associates, where he had been working on a program for the management of empty space in staff lockers in telecommunications companies.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Despite the acclaim on the DVD cover of the version I borrowed, this film was a disappointment. Yes, it is far more realistic than other war films of the period for depicting the mud, boredom and frustration of the grunt, but unfortunately one comes away from it thinking that's ALL there is to this movie. There is no plot and the dialogue is monotonous. It's not that a good war film needs to have a battle scene every five minute. One of the best World War II films, \\"Twelve O'Clock High,\\" has very little action. But it compensates with crackling dialogue and psychological tension. The exception to \\"The Story of G.I. Joe\\" is a brief battle segment (titled \\"city under siege\\" on the DVD) which takes place in Italy. Admittedly it is one of the most fast-paced and convincing combat scenes of any war movie. But alas, the rest of the film is not worth watching just for this highlight. Another turn-off is Pvt. Dondaro, played by Wally Cassell, who is meant to be a \\"romeo\\" but comes off a pervert. By contrast, Sgt. Warnicki is a sympathetic, if flawed, man. As he says to Capt. Walker (Mitchum) when volunteering for another patrol: \\"Every step forward is a step closer... to home.\\" But that last step  one patrol too many  drives him over the mental brink.

Tittle, was a professional American football quarterback. He played in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Francisco 49ers, New York Giants, and Baltimore Colts, after spending two seasons with the Colts in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Known for his competitiveness, leadership, and striking profile, Tittle was the centerpiece of several prolific offenses throughout his seventeen-year professional career from 1948 to 1964. Tittle played college football for Louisiana State University, where he was a two-time All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) quarterback for the LSU Tigers football team. At the time of his retirement, Tittle held the following NFL records: Tittle was the fourth player to throw seven touchdown passes in a game, when he did so in 1962 against the Redskins. He followed Sid Luckman (1943), Adrian Burk (1954), and George Blanda (1961). The feat has since been equaled by four more players: Joe Kapp (1969), Peyton Manning (2013), Nick Foles (2013), and Drew Brees (2015). Tittle, Manning and Foles did it without an interception. His 36 touchdown passes in 1963 set a record which stood for over two decades until it was surpassed by Dan Marino in 1984; as of 2016 it remains a Giants franchise record. Despite record statistics and three straight championship game appearances, Tittle was never able to deliver a title to his team. His record as a starter in postseason games was 0-4. He threw four touchdown passes against 14 interceptions and had a passer rating of 33.8 in his postseason career, far below his regular season passer rating of 74.3. Seth Wickersham, writing for ESPN The Magazine in 2014, noted the dichotomy in the 1960s between two of New York's major sports franchises: \\"... Gifford, Huff and Tittle, a team of Hall of Famers known for losing championships as their peers on the Yankees--with whom they shared a stadium, a city, and many rounds of drinks--became renowned for winning them.\\" The Giants struggled after Tittle's retirement, posting only two winning seasons from 1964 to 1980. He made seven Pro Bowls, four first-team All-Pro teams, and four times was named the NFL's Most Valuable Player or Player of the Year: in 1957 and 1962 by the UPI; in 1961 by the NEA; and in 1963 by the AP and NEA. In a sports column in 1963, George Strickler for the Chicago Tribune remarked Tittle had \\"broken records that at one time appeared unassailable and he has been the hero of more second half rallies than Napoleon and the Harlem Globetrotters.\\" He was featured on four Sports Illustrated covers: three during his playing career and one shortly after retirement. His first was with the 49ers in 1954. With the Giants, he graced covers in November 1961, and he was on the season preview issue for 1964; a two-page fold-out photo from the 1963 title game. Tittle was on a fourth cover in August 1965. The trade of Tittle for Lou Cordileone is seen as one of the worst trades in 49ers history; it is considered one of the best trades in Giants franchise history. Cordileone played just one season in San Francisco. Who did he play for after the 49ers","completion":"After playing for the San Francisco 49ers, Y.A.

Tittle had a remarkable career in the NFL, and his time with the New York Giants was especially significant, as his trade to the Giants is considered one of the best trades in the franchise's history. Although he never won a championship title, Tittle's excellent performance and leadership skills made him an invaluable player on any team he was part of."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As you mentioned, Touhou 11: Subterranean Animism had its release in Japan. This means that Japanese players would have immediate access to the game through their local retail stores or online platforms, depending on the format of the release. Since Touhou games are primarily produced and developed in Japan, it is expected that the Japanese audience would be the first to gain access to the game upon its release. Americans and other international fans would then need to wait for the game to be uploaded on various sharing, torrent, or digital distribution platforms in order to play the game. This could entail a delay of a few hours to a few days, depending on the digital distribution platform and the availability of the game files. This access delay is primarily due to the fact that it takes time for the content to be shared across different regions, and there could potentially be translation or localization challenges, which could further increase the wait time. Additionally, such games may need to be adapted for various international platforms, which can also contribute to slower release times internationally as opposed to the experience in Japan. Despite these delays, eager fans tend to be patient and await the game's release in their respective regions, ready to enjoy the newest installment of the popular Touhou series."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The villagers are nationalist and exclusionary, taunting Michael (John Mills) (the mute village idiot) and British soldiers stationed at a nearby army base. They are resentful of Rosy Ryan (Sarah Miles), the spoilt daughter of the local publican Tom Ryan (Leo McKern), who himself is an informer for the British army hoping to keep the peace in the village. In public, Ryan pretends to be a staunch nationalist; in an early scene, he strongly supports the recently suppressed Easter Rising, referring to the rebels as \\"our boys\\".Rosy is bored with her humdrum village life and fantasizes about the outside world much to the chagrin of the local priest, Father Hugh Collins (Trevor Howard), an old, sharp-witted and highly influential person who knows all that goes on in the village.

Answer the following question: Information: - A bulletin board system, or BBS, is a computer server running software that allows users to connect to the system using a terminal program. Once logged in, the user can perform functions such as uploading and downloading software and data, reading news and bulletins, and exchanging messages with other users through email, public message boards, and sometimes via direct chatting. Many BBSes also offer on-line games, in which users can compete with each other, and BBSes with multiple phone lines often provide chat rooms, allowing users to interact with each other. Bulletin board systems were in many ways a precursor to the modern form of the World Wide Web, social networks and other aspects of the Internet. Low-cost, high-performance modems drove the use of online services and BBSes through the early 1990s. \\"Infoworld\\" estimated there were 60,000 BBSes serving 17 million users in the United States alone in 1994, a collective market much larger than major online services like CompuServe. - In the United States, a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is a geographical region with a relatively high population density at its core and close economic ties throughout the area. Such regions are neither legally incorporated as a city or town would be, nor are they legal administrative divisions like counties or separate entities such as states. As such, the precise definition of any given metropolitan area can vary with the source. A typical metropolitan area is centered on a single large city that wields substantial influence over the region (e.g., Chicago or Atlanta). However, some metropolitan areas contain more than one large city with no single municipality holding a substantially dominant position (e.g., DallasFort Worth metroplex, Norfolk-Virginia Beach (Hampton Roads), RiversideSan Bernardino (Inland Empire) or MinneapolisSaint Paul). - Shortwave radio is radio transmission using shortwave frequencies, generally , just above the medium wave AM broadcast band. - A modem (modulator-demodulator) is a network hardware device that modulates one or more carrier wave signals to encode digital information for transmission and demodulates signals to decode the transmitted information. The goal is to produce a signal that can be transmitted easily and decoded to reproduce the original digital data. Modems can be used with any means of transmitting analog signals, from light emitting diodes to radio. A common type of modem is one that turns the digital data of a computer into modulated electrical signal for transmission over telephone lines and demodulated by another modem at the receiver side to recover the digital data. - Indiana is a U.S. state located in the midwestern and Great Lakes regions of North America.

Indianapolis covers , making it the 16th largest city by land area in the U.S. - The term chat room, or chatroom, is primarily used to describe any form of synchronous conferencing, occasionally even asynchronous conferencing. The term can thus mean any technology ranging from real-time online chat and online interaction with strangers (e.g., online forums) to fully immersive graphical social environments. - InfoWorld (formerly The Intelligent Machines Journal) is an information technology media business. Founded in 1978, it began as a monthly magazine. In 2007, it transitioned to a Web-only publication.

It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. - The Midwestern United States, also referred to as the American Midwest or simply the Midwest, is one of the four geographic regions defined by the United States Census Bureau, occupying the northern central part of the United States of America. It was officially named the North Central region by the Census Bureau until 1984. - CompuServe (CompuServe Information Service, also known by its acronym CIS) was the first major commercial online service provider in the United States. It dominated the field during the 1980s and remained a major influence through the mid-1990s. At its peak in the early 1990s, CIS was known for its online chat system, message forums covering a variety of topics, extensive software libraries for most computer platforms, and a series of popular online games, notably MegaWars III and Island of Kesmai. They are also known for their introduction of the GIF format for pictures, and CIS was a very popular GIF exchange mechanism. - The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet. English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland. - Electronic mail, or email, is a method of exchanging digital messages between people using digital devices such as computers, tablets and mobile phones. Email first entered substantial use in the 1960s and by the mid-1970s had taken the form now recognized as email. Email operates across computer networks, which in the 2010s is primarily the Internet. Some early email systems required the author and the recipient to both be online at the same time, in common with instant messaging. Today's email systems are based on a store-and-forward model. Email servers accept, forward, deliver, and store messages. Neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously; they need to connect only briefly, typically to a mail server or a webmail interface, for as long as it takes to send or receive messages. - Medium wave (MW) is the part of the medium frequency (MF) radio band used mainly for AM radio broadcasting. For Europe the MW band ranges from 526.5 kHz to 1606.5 kHz, using channels spaced every 9 kHz, and in North America an extended MW broadcast band ranges from 525 kHz to 1705 kHz, using 10 kHz spaced channels. - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form. - A combined statistical area (CSA) is composed of adjacent metropolitan (MSA) and micropolitan statistical areas (µSA) in the United States and Puerto Rico that can demonstrate economic or social linkage. The United States Office of Management and Budget defines a CSA as consisting of various combinations of adjacent metropolitan and micropolitan areas with economic ties measured by commuting patterns. These areas that combine retain their own designations as metropolitan or micropolitan statistical areas within the larger combined statistical area. - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers. - Linda Thompson ( April 26 , 1953 -- May 10 , 2009 ) was an American attorney , filmmaker , and the founder of the American Justice Federation .

A long-awaited report into bullying and harassment at the BBC, which was commissioned in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal, has revealed there were 37 formal complaints of sexual harassment over the past six years. No disciplinary measures were taken and in some cases perpetrators were promoted even after complaints had been upheld against them. The review found there was a perception within the organisation that BBC stars did not have to adhere to the same rules as normal staff because they could ‘wield power’. Barrister Dinah Rose (left) compiled the report which director general of the BBC Tony Hall (right) said made for 'uncomfortable reading' It also said some on-air talent’s behaviour was ‘often inappropriate’ and in certain cases should be categorised as ‘renowned’. Barrister Dinah Rose’s findings are particularly embarrassing for the corporation which came out on the same day its former presenter Stuart Hall pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting 13 girls aged as young as nine. While the 80-page Respect At Work linked the ‘untouchable’ treatment of stars directly to bullying and inappropriate behaviour, rather than sexual harassment, it none the less added to the impression of a celebrity obsessed culture at the broadcaster. Yesterday director general Tony Hall admitted the report made ‘uncomfortable reading’ and said there would now be ‘zero-tolerance’ of bullying and harassment. As part of the report being published the corporation also revealed that it will now drop gagging orders from all BBC contracts in the future. Guilty: Stuart Hall arrives at Preston Crown Court today, with solicitor Maurice Watkins, where he has admitted historic sex allegations. There has been deep concern in the past that the BBC has been able prevent people speaking out about their treatment at the corporation as a result of these clauses in their contracts. While the report said sexual harassment was much less common than bullying, it did admit there was evidence that some individuals working at the BBC had made ‘unwanted and inappropriate sexual advances’ to their colleagues or staff. In some cases people had been given warnings about their behaviour but then gone on to repeat their harassment of the person. Between April 2005 and December 2012 there had also been six employment tribunal claims which included allegations of sexual harassment. The long-awaited report into bullying and harassment at the BBC which was commissioned in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. The report added that in sexual harassment cases there was a tendency for the victim to be ‘young and in the early stages of their career’ and ‘almost exclusively female’ while the perpetrators tended to be men and in ‘positions of influence’. Victims had complained that they had ‘nowhere safe and confidential to go’ to report the problem and to ‘see it acted upon’. Miss Rose’s research found concerns about bullying and other forms of inappropriate behaviour were ‘much more prominent’ than sexual harassment. In this types of cases it was said that some bosses and stars were seen as ‘untouchable’ because of their ‘perceived value to the BBC’. The report once again created the impression of an organisation that was submissive to the talent it often pays large amounts of money to. It said: ‘There is a perception that “talent” are treated differently and don’t have to adhere to the same rules because they wield power over the organisation and anyone who tries to manage them. ‘In many cases, the BBC does not directly employ them and so people are quite unsure about what interventions are possible.’ The review said it had heard of examples of talent whose behaviour was ‘often inappropriate’ and their actions were what it would class as ‘visible’ and in some cases ‘renowned’. People who gave evidence to the review were said to have been ‘fearful of raising complaints’ about bullying and harassment, because they feared it would impact on their career. The report, which spoke of ‘known bullies’ at the corporation, noted: ‘Throughout our conversations we heard a strong undercurrent of fear; fear of speaking out, fear of reprisal, fear of losing your job, being made redundant, fear of becoming a victim, fear of getting a reputation as a troublemaker and not getting promoted if an employee, or further work if a freelancer, supplier or contractor.’ One contributor told the review: ‘People are afraid to complain, there is a huge fear of reputational loss and shame. These are the invisible silencing mechanisms.’ Of the 37 cases of sexual harassment only 25 resulted in a formal disciplinary process. The report said the BBC had not been clear enough about the standard of behaviour that was expected from all staff including on-air ‘talent’. The BBC will now launch a range of new measures to tackle the problem including a confidential helpline for support with bullying and harassment and making it explicitly clear to employees that must not behave in this way. The report, which did not name any individuals, heard from 930 people ranging from presenters, senior bosses through to technicians and engineers. The BBC’s management admitted some managers at the BBC were ‘concerned’ they would become part of a ‘witch-hunt’ by disgruntled staff as part of the process. While the corporation announced an end to gagging clauses it did admit it would continue to use confidentiality agreements where appropriate. Michelle Stanistreet, general secretary of the National Union of Journalists, welcomed action to tackle bullying, and said: ‘It is quite clear that bullying has become an institutionalised problem at the BBC, one that has taken hold over many years.’ BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten said: ‘Sexual harassment and bullying have no place at the BBC and should be acted on and stamped out.’ What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

Process: - Acid rain makes waters acidic - Causes them to absorb aluminum from soil - The water runs off from the soil into lakes, streams, etc - Fish and their eggs die - Frogs and plants die - Insects and other wildlife die - The ecosystem is out of balance, causing further problems - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose fewer organisms thrive happens, how will it affect the ecosystem is more out of balance. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"Acid rain is a result of air pollution, particularly sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, which dissolve in cloud water, rainwater, or snow, forming sulfuric and nitric acids. When these acids reach the ground, they can cause detrimental effects on the environment, including an imbalance in the ecosystem. Here is the detailed impact of acid rain and how it reduces biodiversity and destabilizes the ecosystem: 1. Acid rain makes waters acidic: As acid rain falls onto lakes, streams, and rivers, it increases the acidity of the water, lowering its pH. Most aquatic organisms (like fish, amphibians, and insects) have a narrow pH range for survival. When the water gets too acidic, these organisms struggle to survive and reproduce. 2. Absorption of aluminum: Waters affected by acid rain can leach aluminum from soil and rocks, allowing it to dissolve in the water. High concentrations of aluminum are toxic to many aquatic species, including fish, amphibians, and invertebrates. 3. Fish and their eggs die: High acidity and aluminum levels in water can cause fish to die, typically affecting their gill function and reproductive cycle. The eggs of fish are also sensitive to a low pH, resulting in reduced hatching rates. 4. Frogs and plants die: Similar to fish, amphibians such as frogs are also sensitive to water acidity. Their eggs and larvae are negatively affected by acid rain, leading to deformities, reduced reproduction, and even death. Acid rain can also damage aquatic plants by altering the nutrient availability in the water, making it difficult for them to thrive. 5. Insects and other wildlife die: Insects and other aquatic wildlife form a crucial part of the food chain, feeding on plants or other organisms. As acid rain affects the population of primary producers and consumers, the predators in the food chain also suffer due to reduced food sources. 6. Ecosystem imbalance: The adverse effects of acid rain on individual species disrupt the interdependent relationships within ecosystems. A decline in plant, insect, and fish populations negatively impacts other wildlife, such as birds and mammals, reliant on these species for food and habitat. Now, regarding the perturbation hypothesis - if fewer organisms were to thrive due to acid rain, it would escalate the ecosystem imbalance. This means that the loss of species within the ecosystem would create: - Indirect effects: The reduced availability of food and other resources forces other organisms to adapt their behaviors, potentially leading to additional species decline, migration, or local extinction. - Trophic cascades: The loss of one or more species in a food chain can have cascading consequences for other species, leading to further imbalances and disturbances. - Loss of ecosystem services: A decreased biodiversity affects ecosystem services such as water purification, flood control, and nutrient cycling, leading to a weaker ecosystem that is less resilient to additional stressors or changes. In conclusion, acid rain has a direct and indirect impact on the reduction of biodiversity and destabilizes ecosystems. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that when fewer organisms thrive, it exacerbates the ecosystem imbalance, leading to even more detrimental consequences."},{"prompt":"Q:Combine facts and answer this: Born Losers is an action film, released in which year, and the first of the Billy Jack movies, the story was based on a real incident from 1964 where members of the Hells Angels were arrested for raping five teenage girls in Monterey, California?

It had a cottage in front where the landlady lived and there were ten little cottages in a half-moon configuration around it. Ours was a party place and we didn't have a phone. This was in the early 1970's. The landlady was in her 50's I'd guess. The only phone was a pay-phone outside her cottage and it was o party line with her phone. When we used it, she would try to listen, especially if we were talking to a girl. We could tell and sometimes we'd ask he to hang up, but other times we'd talk about sexy stuff and let her listen. We could hear her breathing heavy when we did. When we'd be parting, she'd come to the door wearing sexy clothes that were completely inappropriate and want to be invited in. Though we were a bunch of horny sailors, no one wanted any part of that. We never let her come in. I got married and moved into an apartment that was three rooms in a huge old house. They closed that Navy base and all of the sailors were transferred elsewhere. There were bumper-stickers that said, \\"Will the last sailor to leave, please turn out the lights.\\" In those days, Newport was a small town that leached off of sailors. My landlord said that when my wife and I were completely out and it was completely clean, he'd refund my deposit. We left the apartment immaculately clean and he wouldn't refund my deposit. That was nearly 50 years ago and it still pisses me off. According to the above context, answer the following question. Why is the sailor still pissed off today?

The unresolved and unfair nature of this incident has likely continued to bother the sailor even after nearly 50 years, as it serves as a reminder of a time when he was treated dishonestly and taken advantage of. The lingering frustration also reflects an inherent desire for justice and fairness, something that was not achieved in this particular situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a title for this article: I can’t count how many times I’ve heard that warning in the 14 months since I decided to move to Moscow from Berlin. It’s as if I were entering a war zone. In fairness, those 14 months have seen a string of calamitous events that have left much of Russia transformed: the annexation of Crimea; war in eastern Ukraine; the deterioration of relations with the West; sanctions; President Vladimir V. Putin’s clampdown on political opposition, media and the arts; and the collapse of the ruble and slowdown of the Russian economy. Not surprisingly, tourism is part of that stagnation. Since the beginning of 2014, tourism to Russia has declined 35 percent, according to the Association of Tour Operators of Russia. Tourism from the West has been cut in half. Yet for visitors, life generally goes on as usual in the affluent, cosmopolitan centers of Moscow and St. Petersburg where the vast majority of foreign tourists spend most or all of their time. Except for areas near the Ukraine border or in the long-embattled North Caucasus, there are no major Western advisories against travel to Russia. The State Department is the most cautious, warning Americans against attending demonstrations and urging “good security practices” in public places. Still, contrary to the images often evoked by the news media, there’s little evidence to suggest that Russia’s top destinations are any less safe now for visitors than they were a few years ago. That’s not to say there has not been a change in mood. As a Western tourist anywhere, it’s often a good idea to avoid political discussions in places with very drunk people, but even more so in Russia. Helped along by television propaganda, many people in Russia blame the West for their current economic problems and the war in Ukraine. The proportion of Russians who say they have a negative view of the United States has more than doubled over the past year, according to a recent poll by the independent Levada-Center. Yet there’s a sizable gap between what is said in opinion polls, and what’s represented in everyday interactions. Or as my friend Maria Baronova, a prominent opposition activist, once put it: “We hate you Americans so much that we treat you like V.I.P.s.” Long gone may be the days when speaking loudly in American English was the best way to make it past “face control” at the entrances of Moscow’s exclusive nightclubs, but after nearly a year here, I have yet to see or hear of Western tourists being harassed because of their nationality. I’ve witnessed more anti-American sentiment in Berlin, albeit of the smug European leftist variety, than I have in Moscow. “I was expecting way more of a difference,” said Kate Wood, a 16-year-old from Chapel Hill, N.C., who was visiting Moscow for the second time as part of an annual church trip to volunteer at an orphanage in the Kirov region. I came upon her and several of her fellow congregants eating ice cream and speaking loudly in English at a cafe on the ground floor of GUM department store on Red Square. “I guess I was thinking that we would need to keep a lower profile,” added Ms. Wood, who was last in Moscow before Western sanctions or the war in eastern Ukraine, “but no one’s reacted badly to us at all, and we’re even kind of loud.” Probably the biggest selling point for visiting Russia now, though, is the drastic devaluation of the ruble, which lost more than half its worth at the end of last year. Even taking into account inflation (recorded at 16.7 percent in February) and the ruble’s considerable rebound over the past few months, the country is more affordable than at any time in recent memory. At the beginning of 2014, a dollar bought 32.86 rubles. In mid-April this year, it bought 49.80. For tourists, this means paying 15 to 50 percent less for just about everything. A year ago, a cappuccino in Moscow cost the equivalent of 8 or 9. Now it’s rarely more than 5. Though airlines, even Russia’s Aeroflot, keep their tickets indexed at dollar rates, most hotels have not substantially raised their ruble prices. This means that the starting room rate in June at the Sheraton Palace, which is 11,900 rubles, has decreased from 362 to 226. A room at a budget hotel goes for around 50 these days, and a double at the Ritz-Carlton, at 28,910 rubles, was once just short of 900 and now comes in just over 550. In fact, luxury hotels in Moscow actually reported an 8 percent uptick in occupancy in the first two months of 2015, apparently because of travelers upgrading from midrange because of the currency rate, according to a recent report cited by The Moscow Times. Though some tourist attractions have increased the entrance fee in rubles, they are still more affordable for visitors with foreign currency. The Kremlin’s entrance fee has increased since the beginning of 2014 from 350 to 500 rubles, but in dollars, it has dropped from 10.65 to 9.54. Entrance for non-Russians to the Tretyakov State Gallery, with its stunning collection of medieval Russian religious art, is now 450 instead of 360 rubles, but its dollar price has dropped 10 percent. Most cathedrals and churches seem not to have increased their entrance fees, nor has the phenomenal Russian Museum in St. Petersburg, meaning all are around 40 percent cheaper for visitors. The State Hermitage Museum there seems to be the only major attraction that is actually more expensive for foreigners, though not by much. It doubled its price in rubles, but the dollar price increased by about a buck. Ruble ticket prices to the Bolshoi Theater have not changed. A decent seat for an opera or ballet on the recently refurbished historic stage still sells in the 3,000- to 9,000-ruble range, which used to start around 90 but now starts at 57. Of course, that’s only if you manage to buy from the theater itself. The scalper racket is as strong as ever, but even scalpers’ more capricious price schemes, anywhere from 50 to upward of 500, are now further within range of budget travelers. Restaurants and bars are now significantly more affordable for foreigners, and the economic crisis means they are less crowded. But even if a reservation is no longer indispensable, eating out requires a bit more strategizing. The culinary scenes in Moscow and St. Petersburg expanded greatly in the past decade, with international cuisine dominating the field: French, Japanese, Italian, Thai or, to mixed effect, some fusion of two or more. But because of Mr. Putin’s retaliatory ban on Western food imports, many Muscovites’ most beloved Continental-style restaurants either cannot find or can’t afford the ingredients they once relied on, and many have seen a drop-off in quality. The fare at sleek Ragout, urbane Ugolek and Jean Jacques, the favorite French bistro of the Russian opposition, is not what it used to be, and though Strelka Bar still has some of the best cocktails in town, its menu has also taken a hit. It’s a safer bet these days to go for food whose source is closer to home. LavkaLavka in Moscow and Cococo, its even better sister restaurant in St. Petersburg, are the best of the innovative restaurants offering updated, farm-to-table takes on traditional Russian cuisine. Dishes like Cococo’s “tourist’s breakfast,” a cylinder of pearl barley, lightly salted beef tartare, smoked herbs and quail egg served theatrically in a blackened half tin can, or LavkaLavka’s memorable borscht with organic beets, brisket and cured pork fat (known in Russia as salo) — plus both restaurants’ homemade vodka infusions — will convert the staunchest nonbelievers. And the 40 percent markdown makes dinner feel like a steal. “This is a very good moment to try to change the image of Russia and to attract tourists from different countries, because the ruble is so cheap,” said Maya Lomidze, the executive director of the Association of Tour Operators of Russia. Indeed, some companies have managed to offset losses by using the ruble crash as a marketing angle. “We make connections on the exchange rate to attract tourists and agents from different countries, and I think it works quite well,” said Olya Skoveleva, a travel manager at Visit Russia, a private tour company that actually reports a 15 percent increase in Western tourists in the past year. The Westerners’ most popular destinations by far are Moscow and St. Petersburg, but the company also sends them to Sochi and the Black Sea or to smaller towns along the so-called Golden Ring of small cities northeast of Moscow, albeit in the company of an official guide. Ms. Skoveleva said that many visitors are initially quite concerned for their safety but are ultimately reassured. “We explain to them that nothing will disturb them regarding the political issues,” she said. “Considering the international situation and how it appears in the media, it is even sometimes surprising to me, but it’s the reality.” “Putin,” she added, “is not the whole country.” Sign up to receive our NYT Living newsletter, a weekly roundup of lifestyle news from the Style, Travel and Food sections delivered to your inbox.

Casey should ensure that the alcohol is not exposed to extreme temperatures or direct sunlight, and that it is stored securely in the vehicle during transportation. 7. Prepare the party space: Set up the space where the party will take place, arranging seating, a TV screen for watching the game, and tables or stations for food and drinks. Casey should also prepare an area designated for alcoholic beverages, which may include ice buckets, coolers, or a designated bar area. 8. Chill and serve the drinks: Before the party starts, Casey should store the alcoholic beverages appropriately—for example, refrigerating beers and white wines, storing red wines at room temperature, and setting up the liquors on a dedicated bar area. Throughout the party, drinks should be served responsibly, making sure guests have access to plenty of water and non-alcoholic beverage options. 9. Host responsibly: As the host of the party, Casey should monitor his guests' alcohol consumption and encourage responsible drinking. He should be mindful of the signs of intoxication and step in to offer assistance or encourage moderation when necessary. Providing food, non-alcoholic beverages, and encouraging the use of designated drivers are important aspects of hosting a responsible Super Bowl party. By following these steps, Casey will ensure a successful, fun, and responsible Super Bowl party where guests can enjoy alcoholic beverages in a safe and sociable environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Mr. Rossi, a father from Philadelphia, recently took his kids, Jack and Victoria, to Boston for three days during the school term. But Rydal Elementary School, one of the oldest schools in Boston, doesn't accept family holidays as an excuse for their absence and give them a warming notice. So Mr. Rossi wrote a letter to the school, which has been shared by thousands of parents online. Dear Mrs. Marbyry, While I am thankful for your concern for our children and the best education our kids receive from you, I can promise you they've learned as much in the three days we were in Boston as they would in a whole year in school. Although they missed an important test, they learned about something more important for them, especially for their future. They experienced first -hand the love and support form thousands of other people with a common goal. At the marathon , which is known as the most difficult one in the world, they watched runners with disabilities work together to collect money for children in poor areas. In addition, our children walked the Freedom Trail, visited the site of the Boston Tea Party and the graves of several great pioneers of America. These are thing they WILL learn in school a year or more from now. We truly love our school and teachers.

DNA [C]. S-layers [D]. peptidoglycan Answer:","completion":"D. peptidoglycan Archaeal cell walls are unique and distinct from both bacterial and eukaryotic cell walls in terms of their composition, structure, and function. While they contain various polysaccharides and proteins, they notably lack peptidoglycan, a key component found in bacterial cell walls. Peptidoglycan is a polymer consisting of sugars and amino acids that forms a structural mesh protecting bacterial cells and giving them shape and rigidity. More specifically, it is composed of repeating disaccharide units of N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM), crosslinked by peptides. Archaeal cell walls have alternative components and structures that provide protection and shape to the cell. One such component is the S-layer (option C), which is a surface layer made of proteins or glycoproteins arranged in a symmetrical 2D crystalline lattice. S-Layers can be found in both archaea and bacteria and are of great importance for cell integrity and morphology, maintaining the rigidity of the cells. Besides S-layers, some archaea have pseudomurein in their cell walls, a peptidoglycan-like polymer with a distinct chemical structure. It contains N-acetyltalosaminuronic acid instead of N-acetylmuramic acid found in peptidoglycan, and its peptide cross-links utilize different amino acids. In comparison, archaeal cell walls do contain DNA (option B) and RNA (option A). DNA is the cellular genetic material, storing all the information required for the cell's functions, while RNA is involved in translating genetic information into proteins. Both molecules are essential to all living organisms, including archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A check of the caller L.D told us the call had come from the manager's office of the apartment building where our customer lived. We left a message with the manager and within the hour our call was returned. I told our customer gently, sympathetically that a check she had written had been returned for lack of funds. I told her I always want to let people know about returned checks quickly because the huge fees the bank charge can cause more checks to be returned and more fees to be charged. I told her I hope she could contact the bank and get things straightened out before her problem got worse. I also told her, gently once more, that I hated to add to her problem but she would owe us a fee because the bank charges us a fee when a check is returned. She told me she had difficulties because of being on a fixed income and being in poor health. She told me she had no children but had raised several that belonged to her husband and after living with him thirty years he had left her for another woman.

Test sentence: \\"The senators know that the president is telling a lie.\\" Is this test sentence a correct grammatical English sentence?","completion":"Step 1: Identify the key components of the sentence. Subject: The senators Verb: know Object: that the president is telling a lie Step 2: Check subject-verb agreement. \\"The senators\\" is a plural subject and \\"know\\" is the correct plural form of the verb, so there is subject-verb agreement. Step 3: Analyze the sentence structure. The sentence can be broken down into an independent clause (the main clause) and a dependent clause (the that-clause), as follows: Main clause: The senators know- Dependent clause: that the president is telling a lie. Step 4: Check the dependent clause grammar. Subject: the president Verb: is telling (a continuous tense of \\"to tell\\") Object: a lie The dependent clause has a clear subject-verb-object structure and uses the auxiliary verb \\"is\\" to form the continuous tense correctly. Step 5: Review the sentence for proper punctuation, capitalization, and clarity. The sentence begins with a capital letter and ends with a period. The dependent clause is connected to the main clause with \\"that,\\" which is appropriate in this context, creating a clear meaning.

Sound waves are mechanical waves. They can travel only through matter. They cannot travel through empty space. This was demonstrated in the 1600s by a scientist named Robert Boyle. Boyle placed a ticking clock in a sealed glass jar. The clock could be heard ticking through the air and glass of the jar. Then Boyle pumped the air out of the jar. The clock was still running, but the ticking could not be heard. Thats because the sound couldnt travel without air particles to transfer the sound energy. Is there any other place where sound cannot be heard? Here is a hint: is there any other place that does not have air molecules? Thats right, in space sound cannot be transferred.

Many people even call themselves diaosi. It's not the first time a term has gone popular on the Internet in China. However, why is the word so viral that is has become a cultural phenomenon? Here, we tell you something you want to know about it. Where it began The word originated in Baidu. Com's Tieba (a top Chinese bulletin board system) of soccer player Li Yi.

Article: There is a lot of misunderstanding about studying. Most students have not been taught the principles behind really effective working. Imagine a graph showing the amount a person learns against the number of hours he works in a day. If he doesn't do any work, he learns nothing (point 0). If he does an hour's work he learns a certain amount (point 1). If he does two hours' work he learns about twice as much (point 2). If he does more work he'll learn still more (point 3). However, if he tries to do twenty-three and a half hours' work in a day, he will be so tired that he'll hardly remember anything: what he learns will be very little (point 4). If he did less work he'd learn more (point 5). Now whatever the exact shape of the graph's curve , made by joining these points, it must have a high point. Point \\"X\\" is the very maximum anyone can learn in the day. And this represents the optimum , the best, amount of work to do. It is the best possible compromise between adequate time at the books and fatigue . Fatigue is an absolutely real thing; one can't escape it or ignore it. If you try to ignore it and press yourself to work past the optimum, you will only get on this downward slope and achieve less than the best - and then become very tired and lose your power of concentration. The skill in being a student consists of getting one's daily study as near the optimum point as possible. I cannot tell you what the optimum is. It differs with the type of work, it differs from person to person, and even in the same person it varies from week to week. You must try to find your own. Every day you study, bear this principle of the optimum in mind. When you feel yourself getting fatigued, if you find yourself reading the same paragraph over and over again and not taking it in, that's a pretty good sign you've reached your highest point for the day and should stop. Most ordinary students find their optimum at five hours a day. Yours may be a little more or a little less - but if you get in five hours' good work a day, you... Question: Fatigue can result in _ .

This development is often the result of a combination of factors such as proper nutrition, regular exercise, and sufficient rest. These components not only contribute to an individual's physical health but can also have positive implications for their mental and emotional health. Moreover, having greater physical capacity can also enable a living thing to better cope with various stressors and challenges it may face in its environment. This can help them avoid potential injuries and health issues that weaker individuals might encounter. In addition, a strong immune system plays a crucial role in maintaining good health, and having a high level of physical fitness often correlates with a robust immune system. Despite these general assumptions, it is essential to understand that having a great physical capacity does not guarantee perfect health. Other factors, such as genetics, environmental factors, and underlying medical conditions, can cause health issues even in seemingly healthy and strong individuals.

But he found that they did not provide a permanent end to suffering, so he continued his quest. He next attempted an extreme asceticism, which was a religious pursuit common among the śramaṇas, a religious culture distinct from the Vedic one. Gautama underwent prolonged fasting, breath-holding, and exposure to pain. He almost starved himself to death in the process. He realized that he had taken this kind of practice to its limit, and had not put an end to suffering. So in a pivotal moment he accepted milk and rice from a village girl and changed his approach.

Rivers flowing over gentle slopes move more slowly. They move much more slowly than a mountain stream. These slow moving streams create different types of features than mountain streams. Slow moving water erodes the sides of their channels more than the bottom. Also, large curves in the stream form. These curves are called meanders. Meanders are caused by erosion and deposition. Remember, faster moving water causes erosion more quickly. Slower moving water erodes material more slowly. If water is moving slowly enough, the sediment being carried may settle out. This settling out, or dropping off, of sediment is deposition. The curves are called meanders because they slowly wander over the land. As meanders erode from side to side, they create a floodplain. This is a broad, flat area on both sides of a river. Eventually, a meander may become cut off from the rest of the river. This forms an oxbow lake.

The best way to support every mother on the planet, starting now Before I became a mother 19 months ago, I knew that having a child would transform my life. My mother raised five children over three decades, often on her own, and by watching her I understood the sacrifices required to sustain a family. Yet I considered my mom's struggles extraordinary; she had her first child at 19 and never got the chance to complete college. She sold crafts and worked part-time in customer service jobs to help provide for her children. We experienced joy and pain sometimes in equal measure, but few hard nights ended without one of us cracking a joke that unleashed hysterical laughter. My mother put our needs second to hers without fail. I'm grateful for her generosity, but know at what cost it came. As I approached my due date, though, I was unsure how my story of motherhood would unfold. I knew it wouldn't mirror my mom's experience or that of my paternal grandmother, a Mexican-American housewife who raised seven children. Image: Ambar Del Moral / mashable Yet I found little inspiration in the mainstream account of motherhood as a manifestation of devotion and hyper-perfection, or a never-ending inner conflict over whether to lean in or out, or an unforgiving combination of both. I saw flashes of my own journey in those realities, but they ultimately felt foreign, defined by a kind of privilege my daughter will know from birth but I did not. As I stumbled sleeplessly through the early weeks of parenthood, I yearned to connect with other mothers but feared judgment. To my surprise I found, through my prenatal yoga class, a community of accepting women who cheered mothers on when they breastfed or bottle fed, co-slept or used a crib, stayed at home or worked full-time. Their gracious support made it possible for me to imagine a more generous version of American motherhood. So did the electric current of love I felt for my own child, which sparked a visceral empathy for other mothers and families. I craved a narrative about our experiences that championed unity between friends and strangers alike, that could name and reject the racial, social and economic forces that have historically divided mothers. \\"This story has room for each of us.\\" I wanted a narrative that wouldn't make enemies of mothers but could capture our diverse identities and complex needs; that acknowledged how prioritizing the bottom line above all else puts unbearable strain on families; that dismissed the craven notion that struggle in motherhood is a personal failing. Some are telling that complicated story with passion and courage, and it's the one we need to hear every day — not just on an occasion like Mother's Day. This story doesn't have a controversial catchphrase like \\"Mommy Wars\\" and isn't the subject of bestselling books, but it's one that has room for each of us, everyone who counts themselves a mother to a child, no matter how that bond was forged. It's a story that requires destroying the cultural myths and political machinery that will never let a woman or mother win. And if we tell that story of solidarity enough times, it might just set us free. My daughter was 11 months old when the 3-year-old Syrian refugee Alan Kurdi washed up on the Turkish shore. She could walk and say agua, and I marveled at the slow revelation of her personality: daring, observant, goofy. I'd seen the emotional tweets about Kurdi's death and avoided looking at the image. I'd never shied from bearing witness to tragedy before, but I discovered that newfound visceral empathy for mothers and families could be crippling. When I clicked on a related story not expecting to see his tiny body, I began heaving and sobbing. As many parents have remarked, his lifeless pose mimicked our children peacefully asleep in their cribs. \\"We should declare that if you are human, you are kin, and deserving of protection.\\" I wept because it forced me to consider losing my own daughter on those unfathomable terms. And I wept because our fates as parents are too often decided by luck, geography and wealth. Perhaps if one of my father's grandparents had not left Mexico in the early 1900s, I'd also be desperately scrambling across the border to seek a better life for my children. I felt called as a mother to stand in solidarity with Kurdi's living father and deceased mother, and every other refugee parent and caregiver who wanted to spirit their children away from a war zone. That abstract feeling, however, was difficult to turn into action. I donated a baby carrier to a local drive so that a refugee walking to the European Union could more easily transport an exhausted child. The gesture felt important yet fleeting. Then I read a moving piece by Nathanael Johnson at Grist, a friend and fellow parent, who called for a united movement against grave worldwide threats to home and family. He wrote: If we are going to solve the looming environmental crises of our time, we are going to have to give up our tribal loyalties for solidarity. I’m not saying that hearts and minds will change on a grand scale: They won’t. I’m just saying that those of us who do feel the bond of shared humanity from across the globe are experiencing something powerful — there’s a propulsive moral force in this desire to protect the vulnerable — and we should grasp that with both hands. We should declare that if you are human, you are kin, and deserving of protection. That sentiment lingered with me. It wasn't a child-rearing philosophy like attachment parenting and it couldn't advise me on how to handle work-life balance, but somehow the principle of solidarity showed me how to be a mother and a human in the world, amidst very real daily concerns. In my search for quality childcare, I could pay a tuition that included substantial vacation time for the women who spend their days with my daughter, and who have their own children. It wasn't easy to accept at first, because it meant taking time off or finding backup childcare, but I had to confront my own complicity in a system that regularly devalues essential caregiving work performed by women. When I advocated for my own needs at work, with an immensely supportive supervisor, it meant thinking about the 17% of the workforce whose employment schedules are unpredictable or unstable. When I took sick days to tend to my daughter, I still worried about the negative implications for my career but considered paid leave a luxury — some families are just one illness away from financial ruin. This awareness has a purpose beyond feeling guilty about one's privilege. Solidarity isn't pitying or patronizing, nor is it a reason to feel smug about one's politics. Rather, it's an expression of empathy amidst the realization that while motherhood can be a universal experience, the details of one's struggles and victories are not. The story of American motherhood isn't just a tale about the overworked professional woman who pumps breastmilk on business trips and still finds time to bake cookies or the mom who endures ridicule when she breastfeeds and co-sleeps with her toddler. It's also the lived experiences of black women who worry society will condemn their sons and daughters to prison or death, and immigrant women separated from their families while they live in detention centers, and parents who fear their lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or gender non-conforming children will be bullied, and conservative women who worry about how radical social change will affect their kids. Supporting another mother, even a stranger, doesn't require people to become activists, tirelessly fighting for or against causes they don't truly understand. Instead, the most profound gift you can give to another mother is to hear and see her, suspending judgment and skepticism even if for a moment. \\"Listening is an act of solidarity; it’s also an act of love,\\" says Ai-jen Poo, director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance and co-director of the Caring Across Generations campaign. \\"Listening is an act of solidarity; it’s also an act of love.\\" In Poo's efforts to organize caregivers, she sees how many people do the work of mothering without the official title. Though we often believe that biology is destiny where family is concerned, being a mother isn't determined just by pregnancy, childbirth or genetics. It is a relationship bound foremost by unyielding love and nurturance, and that is a role anyone, including an adoptive parent, stepparent, grandparent or queer parent, can fulfill. Solidarity, says Camilla Taylor, counsel for the civil rights organization Lambda Legal, means making no assumptions about how people form their families and understanding that not all of them look the same. Some lost a mother or never had one; others comprise a single dad or two dads. Image: AMBAR DEL MORAL / MASHABLE Expanding our definition of motherhood and family to be more inclusive can guide and inspire children, particularly at a time when they hear that it's acceptable to demean and denigrate some of their peers, including transgender kids. \\"Our job is to help our children stand up for the security, respect and dignity for all children,\\" says Taylor. This dream of solidarity holds infinite promise and meaning, yet so many mothers remain drawn to the divisive status quo. While it could be easy to blame them, that's a counter-productive response, says Kalpana Krishnamurthy, senior policy director at Forward Together, a nonprofit organization that advocates for families. Instead, we should focus on the message mothers hear and internalize about what it means to be American: Pull yourself up by your bootstraps and you and your family will be deserving of sympathy and aid. Image: AMBAR DEL MORAL / MASHABLE If you need public support when transitioning between jobs, you must not be working that hard. If your child enters the criminal justice system, you must not have raised your kids right. If you're a struggling young mom, you shouldn't have had kids at an early age. \\"I think it's really important that we don't internalize that narrative,\\" says Krishnamurthy of the idea that bootstraps alone are strong enough to brace our families in times of need. Similarly, says Kathleen Gerson, author of The Unfinished Revolution: Coming of Age in a New Era of Gender, Work, and Family and professor of sociology at New York University, mothers often find their choices subject to \\"social disregard and sanctioning.\\" A highly educated, middle-class woman may be shamed for valuing work and parenthood equally, whereas a woman who has few job prospects and can't find childcare might be admonished for staying home with her children. \\"Why do we do this to each other and to ourselves?\\" \\"It's a glaring example of how we continue to place mothers, in particular, in these binds, where whatever choice they make is seen as inappropriate,\\" she says. \\"Why do we do this to each other and to ourselves?\\" There are many answers to this question, but perhaps chief among them is that our culture and politics are misaligned on the most important issues. We are told to cherish family but our policies prove that the needs of business routinely come first. Given the worship of family in American life, it's surprising to see profitability and limited government used as justification for denying people equal pay, paid parental and sick leave, and predictable schedules, among other policies that families need to thrive. Mothers, says Gerson, become hostile or ambivalent toward the choices that other mothers make as they grapple with how their choices are viewed. \\"We live in a society in which there are so many contradictions in what we expect from mothers that there’s this strong feeling you need to defend yourself against other people’s lack of respect for you,\\" Gerson says. \\"The only way to defend your choice from attack is to say my choice is better than your choice.\\" Solidarity thrives best when we're brave enough to share our own struggles or when we're capable of listening without judgment to another mother who takes the risk of doing the same. Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, executive director of the advocacy organization MomsRising, says she's witnessed what happens when mothers conjure the power of story. \\"It lifts the stigma of thinking that you have failed individually,\\" she says. \\"When one person shares a story, there’s a domino effect...and it [lets] other moms know you’re not in it alone.\\" Image: AMBAR DEL MORAL / MASHABLE That kind of affirmation is essential, but let's not pretend getting it is easy. There will be some who respond to gestures of solidarity with indifference or a scoff, and we may never understand what drives some mothers to make questionable or tragic decisions. Practicing solidarity, Krishnamurthy says, is like developing a muscle — it won't get stronger unless it's regularly tested. And if solidarity is like a muscle, then judgment is akin to a reflex. No matter how many times I remind myself that I don't know a woman's life or her child like I do my own, judgment remains a convenient response. \\"Do some stuff. With a whole bunch of love.\\" I've learned that perfection is an enemy of solidarity. I will make mistakes and fail at supporting other mothers, but I want to hear and learn their experiences. I want to take opportunities small and large to ensure that mothers and their families flourish, whether that's through helping a colleague navigate parental leave, donating diapers, vaccinating my child or voting. Solidarity shouldn't be overwhelming. \\"It seems relatively simple,\\" Krishnamurthy says. \\"Do some stuff. With a whole bunch of love.\\" Those who seek solidarity, including male partners and caregivers and the childless, can help transform our collective experience of parenthood so that it encompasses every family, not just those with the loudest voices. That solidarity can hasten a national reckoning over the deep conflict between family, politics and business. And it can lift up mothers as worthy of dignity and equality. This is the legacy of motherhood I want my daughter to inherit, should she ever choose this journey. It's also the only appropriate gift I can think to give my own mother. Now 66 years old, she spends her free time reading and competing in pickle ball tournaments. When my daughter is ill and neither my husband or I can take a sick day, my mom travels an hour-and-a-half to watch her. She takes my brother's two daughters to softball practice and the movies. She drives up and down the west coast to help my sister run her business and be a grandparent to my other sister's 4-year-old son. The truth is that when my story of motherhood unfolded, it did reflect my mom's experience but not in ways that I expected. She lived solidarity, however imperfectly, and without her example, my heart would be less full, less capable of that electric current that connects me to humanity.

If males can intend to cause harm or pain during their mating season, then which gender is more likely to cause harm or pain during the mating season? Answer choices: - moles. - Non-binary - bears - female - Birds - gender fluid - humans - male The answer to this question is:","completion":"It is important to recognize that the potential for causing harm or pain during mating season varies among different species, and cannot be generalized to a specific gender across all species. However, the question appears to be asking which gender (or group) is more likely to cause harm or pain during the mating season. Each of the answer choices given can be addressed individually: 1. Moles: Mole mating involves a male searching for compatible females, with very little physical aggression. It is not usually a violent or harmful process for either gender. 2. Non-binary and gender fluid: These terms refer to gender identity in humans, not to biological differences in animals. As gender identity, they would not be applicable in measuring the likelihood of harm or pain during the mating season of species. 3. Bears: Male bears can be aggressive during the mating season in order to establish dominance and secure a mate. In some cases, males can cause harm to females if they are resistant to mate or to other competing males during this time. So, male bears are more likely to cause harm or pain during the mating season. 4. Female: In most species, the female's role in causing harm or pain during the mating season is not significant. Nevertheless, there are some exceptions, such as the praying mantis, where the female consumes the male after mating in order to nourish herself and her eggs. 5. Birds: The mating behavior of birds varies by species. In some species, males can be aggressive, while in others, females instigate conflicts. It's difficult to generalize across all bird species, but male birds generally engage in more aggressive behavior around mating. 6. Humans: Among humans, it is not possible to simply generalize to one gender being more likely to cause harm or pain during the mating season. Societal norms, laws, and consent prevent the majority of people from engaging in violent or harmful behavior during courtship and mating. 7. Male: Considering the examples above, it seems that in several species, males are often more likely to demonstrate aggressive or harmful behavior during mating seasons, due to the competition for access to females and the biological drive to reproduce. This does not mean that all males within a species or across species will engage in such behavior, but rather illustrates a tendency for males to be more aggressive in certain situations. In conclusion, since this question appears to ask about which gender is more likely to cause harm or pain during the mating season, and given the examples found in various species, the answer would lean towards males. This is due to their increased likelihood of exhibiting aggressive behavior as a result of competition and the drive to reproduce. However, it is important to remember that this may not hold true for all species and that individual animals vary in their behavior."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that Jerome Bosch drew inspiration from? from the following article ? The charting and conquest of this new world made real regions previously only idealised in the imagination of artists and poets. At the same time, the certainty of the old biblical paradise began to slip from the grasp of thinkers into the realms of mythology. In response, treatment of the Paradise in literature, poetry and art shifted towards a self-consciously fictional Utopian representation, as exemplified by the writings of Thomas More (1478–1535).Albrecht Dürer was an avid student of exotic animals, and drew many sketches based on his visits to European zoos. Dürer visited 's-Hertogenbosch during Bosch's lifetime, and it is likely the two artists met, and that Bosch drew inspiration from the German's work.Attempts to find sources for the work in literature from the period have not been successful. Art historian Erwin Panofsky wrote in 1953 that, \\"In spite of all the ingenious, erudite and in part extremely useful research devoted to the task of \\"decoding Jerome Bosch\\", I cannot help feeling that the real secret of his magnificent nightmares and daydreams has still to be disclosed. We have bored a few holes through the door of the locked room; but somehow we do not seem to have discovered the key.\\" The humanist Desiderius Erasmus has been suggested as a possible influence; the writer lived in 's-Hertogenbosch in the 1480s, and it is likely he knew Bosch. Glum remarked on the triptych's similarity of tone with Erasmus's view that theologians \\"explain (to suit themselves) the most difficult mysteries ... is it a possible proposition: God the Father hates the Son? Could God have assumed the form of a woman, a devil, an ass, a gourd, a stone?\\" Answer:","completion":"The full name of the person that Hieronymus (Jerome) Bosch drew inspiration from, as mentioned in the provided article, is Albrecht Dürer.

Online) ||||| Anderson Cooper has revealed that he will not be inheriting any money from his mother Gloria Vanderbilt’s 200 million fortune. The CNN host said his 90-year-old mother, the great-great-great-granddaughter of the railroad tycoon Cornelius Vanderbilt, has told him he won’t get any of her wealth when she dies — and he says he doesn’t need the money. “My mom’s made clear to me that there’s no trust fund. There’s none of that,” Cooper told Howard Stern on his radio show. “I don’t believe in inheriting money … I think it’s an initiative sucker. I think it’s a curse. “Who’s inherited a lot of money that has gone on to do things in their own life? From the time I was growing up, if I felt that there was some pot of gold waiting for me, I don’t know that I would’ve been so motivated. “I’m doing fine on my own, I don’t need any,” he said. Cooper, 47, makes around 11 million a year at CNN and lives in a converted firehouse in Greenwich Village and also has a Hamptons estate in Quogue. Last November he signed a contract extension to keep him at CNN through the 2016 presidential election. Vanderbilt inherited most of her wealth from her father, Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt, an heir to the Vanderbilt railroad fortune. Her father died when she was just over a year old and left her a trust fund that was worth 5 million in 1925. Cooper’s father, Wyatt Emory Cooper, was Gloria’s fourth husband and died in 1978 from a heart attack when Anderson was young. And the Silver Fox said he prefers to focus on his father’s life rather than his wealthy ancestors. He told Stern, “I’ve never paid attention to it, honestly, like my dad grew up really poor in Mississippi … that’s a healthier thing to pay attention to than like some statue of a great-great-great-grandfather who has no connection to my life.” ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a brief explanation of something, like a story or an article, using only the most important information.

Summarize this article: Saturn Still Swings: Celebrating Sun Ra At 100 Enlarge this image toggle caption Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images Today marks 100 years since Sun Ra was born — or, as the musician might have put it, since he arrived on Earth. An influential jazz composer, keyboardist and bandleader, Sun Ra always insisted he was just visiting this planet. \\"Since I don't consider myself as one of the humans, I'm a spiritual being myself,\\" he said in A Joyful Noise, a documentary released in 1980. Ra dressed himself and his band in elaborate costumes that were part ancient Egypt, part science fiction. Sometimes he claimed to be from Saturn. \\"I'm not part of history,\\" he said. \\"I'm more a part of the mystery which is my story.\\" Ra didn't like to talk about his childhood on Earth. In fact, the trail was nearly cold when biographer John Szwed started asking questions in the 1990s. \\"He had a passport that said Saturn,\\" Szwed recalls. \\"It had no birth dates.\\" Eventually, Szwed did uncover some basic biographical facts about Sun Ra. Herman \\"Sonny\\" Blount was born May 22, 1914 in Birmingham, Ala. By the 1950s he had moved to Chicago, worked as an arranger for jazz great Fletcher Henderson, and backed up a wide range of musicians playing blues, doo-wop and R&B.; \\"Even in Chicago, when he was doing fairly straight things — blues, dance tunes, whatever — there was this hint of something else,\\" Szwed says. Blount changed his name to Sun Ra and began leading a big band called the Arkestra. \\"He was the first one to really introduce me in the higher forms of music,\\" said John Gilmore, who played tenor saxophone in the Arkestra for four decades. Gilmore died in 1995, but was interviewed in A Joyful Noise. At first, Gilmore said, he had a hard time understanding Ra's music. \\"Then one night, I heard it,\\" he recalls. \\"We were playing this number 'Saturn.' I had been playing it for six months, every time we worked. But then I really heard the intervals this one night and I said, 'My gosh, it's unbelievable that anybody could write meaner intervals than Monk or Mingus. But he does.'\\" YouTube In the early '60s, Ra moved his Arkestra to New York. He explored collective free improvisation and was one of the first jazz musicians to embrace electronic instruments and synthesizers. John Szwed says Ra's stage act also got weirder and bigger. \\"He went to extremes,\\" Szwed says. \\"He'd have musclemen painted gold, jugglers, women carrying glowing balls like turn-of-the-century dancers. And depending on where you were coming into the thing, you either saw him as this avuncular, sweet old guy — or he was scary.\\" Ra's interest in ancient Egypt and African cultures led some to associate him with the Black Nationalist movement of the '60s and '70s. But he wasn't concerned with terrestrial politics. \\"I'm not looking for liberty. I'm not looking for equality,\\" Ra said. \\"I am moving forward with my music, universal language, expressing things of value. And if there's some people want to listen, they're welcome. I'm just like the birds. They sing. Those who like can listen and those who don't, don't have to.\\" Every song I write tells a story — a story that humanity needs to know about. For all the freedom in his music, Ra demanded discipline from his musicians. He was constantly writing or rehearsing. In 1969, he moved the band out of New York to a house in Philadelphia that belonged to the father of the band's alto saxophonist, Marshall Allen. Allen is celebrating his 90th birthday this month. He's still leading the Arkestra, which rehearses in that same modest row house in Philadelphia. It's full of sheet music, art, instruments, and mementos of Sun Ra's time on Earth. The band members still bunk together in the bedrooms, just like they did when Ra lived there. Allen says the communal living arrangement meant the band could rehearse without distractions. \\"All your free time was taken,\\" Allen recalls. \\"All this running around doing nothing — chasing girls or whatever you do. You devoting most of your time to music 24 hours a day.\\" In fact, the band members jokingly called it the \\"Ra jail.\\" They're laughing, but you can tell it's not entirely a joke. Saxophonist Knoel Scott has been in and out of the Arkestra since the 1970s. \\"Sun Ra was, for people who didn't know Sonny, he was an insomniac,\\" Scott says. \\"He did not sleep. Maybe two hours, take a little nap — that was it. So 22 hours out of the day, he's awake and he's creating.\\" Ra wrote poetry, and he wrote his philosophy down in pamphlets and leaflets. But mostly, Ra wrote music, and was one of the first musicians to release it on his own record label. He wrote thousands of songs, filling dozens and dozens of albums. \\"Every song I write tells a story — a story that humanity needs to know about,\\" Ra said. \\"In my music I speak of unknown things, impossible things, ancient things, potential things. No two songs tell the same story.\\" Ra left the planet in 1993 after a series of strokes. The Sun Ra Arkestra will mark today's centennial with a concert in Zurich, Switzerland. It's the first show of the Arkestra's month-long tour of Europe, as the band still brings Sun Ra's message to the people of Earth. ||||| Legacy Act Like You Know: Sun Ra i itoggle caption Baron Wolman/Courtesy of the artist Baron Wolman/Courtesy of the artist Records show that 100 years ago today, a boy named Herman Poole Blount was born in Birmingham, Ala. Between that moment and his passing in 1993, the man nicknamed \\"Sonny\\" developed huge musical talent, synthesized an all-encompassing Afro-futurist worldview and grew into the name Le Sony'r Ra — Sun Ra for short. And he lives on as a cultural hero at the intersection of flamboyant outsider and self-made genius. For a man for whom outer space was a guiding metaphor, he was a lot of different things on Earth. Here's a short list: He was a prolific composer who wrote over 1,000 tunes He was an accomplished pianist on acoustic and electric keyboards of all sorts He was a bandleader of small-to-medium-size experimental jazz combos He was a ringleader of a 20-to-30-piece big band (\\"Arkestra\\") with full costumes, dancers and overhead projections He was a well-read man whose personal philosophy drew from Egyptology, black Freemasonry, Biblical exegesis, science and science fiction and most anything else that lay outside the traditional domains of scholarship He was an enigma to some jazz critics and enjoyed relatively little mainstream success He appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine and as a musical guest on Saturday Night Live He was lionized by both white bohemians and Black Arts pioneers He was a black person who \\"arrived\\" in the American South in 1914, a conscientious objector in World War II and a participant — along with 6 million others — in the mid-century Great Migration of African Americans He was, according to him, not from this planet, with no family and not a human Behind his esoteric parables, contradictions and mythologies, there's at least one constant. Sun Ra was often recognized as one of the hardest-working musicians anywhere he went — and surely one of the most original. His is a huge oeuvre that people spend lifetimes exploring. In fact, the Sun Ra Archives are re-releasing 21 major albums remastered for iTunes for his centennial arrival date — just a fraction of a discography which some historians estimate at over 180 records. Here's a quick introduction to that catalog in five essential tracks. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Today marks 100 years since Sun Ra, an influential jazz composer, keyboardist, and bandleader was born, or as he might have put it; since he arrived on Earth. Sun Ra insisted that he was just visiting this planet and often claimed to be from Saturn. He dressed himself and his band in elaborate costumes that were part ancient Egypt, part science fiction. Sun Ra led a big band called the Arkestra and was one of the first jazz musicians to embrace electronic instruments and synthesizers. His interest in ancient Egypt and African cultures led some to associate him with the Black Nationalist movement of the '60s and '70s, but he was not concerned with politics. Sun Ra wrote thousands of songs, filling dozens of albums. He passed away in 1993, but the Sun Ra Arkestra now led by Marshall Allen continues to bring Sun Ra's message and music to the people of Earth."},{"prompt":"I know that the answer to the question \\"The words fauna and flora can be traced to the roots of what language?\\" is in \\"In order to explain the common features shared by Sanskrit and other Indo-European languages, many scholars have proposed the Indo-Aryan migration theory, asserting that the original speakers of what became Sanskrit arrived in what is now India and Pakistan from the north-west some time during the early second millennium BCE.

Q:I normally do not post certain types of things on my blog or on social media, like political messages, but today I feel compelled. I’ve been thinking for the last few days about the most recent school shooting in Parkland, and my overwhelming emotion right after grief is rage. I am so angry it makes me cry and for those of you out there who know me, angry-cry is the end-stage, top-of-the-gauge level of angry for me. I am angry that as a nation, we continue to wring our hands and bemoan each mass shooting but we don’t take any action to stop the next one. I am angry that our elected officials have failed us in the most spectacular way possible by being unable to work together or to set aside special interests to protect the lives and safety of Americans, including our most vulnerable citizens, our children. I am angry that time and time again, we the people and our elected officials weigh the value of human lives against countless other things (Second Amendment, special interests, party disagreements, inertia, whatever) and the value of human life comes up short in the calculations. I am angry at myself for believing at any point in the last several years that I could trust lawmakers to address this epidemic and I am angry at myself for feeling so helpless that I have not personally taken action. This stops now. I am angry that in 2012, 20 6-7 year old children and 6 adults were murdered in Sandy Hook and in the 5+ years since, we have done nothing meaningful to stop this. To me, this is tantamount to saying that we as a nation are OK with this. I don’t think we are, but that’s the message we’re sending if we don’t force our government to do something. According to the New York Times, there have been 239 school shootings nationwide since Sandy Hook with 438 people shot, 138 who died.

Firstly, we can tell you that the lives of your relatives could depend on your ability to give first aid. If you think highly of human's life, this article is for you! Here you can find information about first aid. The very first thing that you should do when you see an accident is to _ the situation and prevent further dangerous incidents. First of all, you have to recognize what has happened and what the dangers to rescuers and victims are. Think about how to take care of the victims. Helping usually takes place in very difficult conditions and injuries can be very bad. Therefore, you cannot be too afraid of making mistakes to help. Sometimes you have to face the fact that regardless of your actions and your efforts the victim's condition might not improve--he or she could even die. In some cases even professional medical aid may not succeed. If you have done everything you think you should do, you shouldn't feel guilty. Do not expose yourself to danger. Giving first aid can be dangerous. While trying to help a victim, do not forget about your own safety. If something happens to you, you won't be able to help anyone. Call for help after you find out the condition of a victim. But remember if a victim faints due to breathing failure caused by drowning, choking or poisoning, you should first take action that helps to bring back the heartbeat and breathing. While calling, talk shortly but clearly. Always provide the following information--the location of the accident, the kind of accident, the number of the injured and your full name and phone number and so on.

Here are the simple steps to follow: Step 1: Understand the problem Carl has taken a 10,000 loan and can only pay the interest due to financial difficulties. The bank charges a 5% quarterly compound interest rate. The goal is to find the approximate annual interest Carl needs to pay. Step 2: Review the guidelines The loan amount is 10,000, and the interest rate is 5% compounded quarterly. Step 3: Use the guidelines to find the answer To calculate the annual interest, first, find the interest for one quarter: Quarterly interest rate = 5%/4 = 1.25% Since it is compounded quarterly, we calculate the future value (FV) of the loan after one year using the formula: FV = P * (1 + r/n)^(n*t) Where: P = Initial principal balance (10,000) r = Annual interest rate (5% or 0.05 as a decimal) n = Number of times the interest is compounded per year (4 times for quarterly) t = Time in years (1 year) FV = 10,000 * (1 + 0.05/4)^(4*1) FV ≈ 10,508.14 Now, subtract the initial loan amount from FV to find the annual interest: Annual interest = FV - P Annual interest ≈ 10,508.14 - 10,000 Annual interest ≈ 508.14 Since the annual interest paid by Carl is around 508.14, none of the given options (a, b, c, d, e) are correct.

It was improvised by civilians who had never handled a hijacked aircraft that attempted to disappear, and by a military unprepared for the transformation of commercial aircraft into weapons of mass destruction. As it turned out, the NEADS air defenders had nine minutes' notice on the first hijacked plane, no advance notice on the second, no advance notice on the third, and no advance notice on the fourth. We do not believe that the true picture of that morning reflects discredit on the operational personnel at NEADS or FAA facilities. NEADS commanders and officers actively sought out information, and made the best judgments they could on the basis of what they knew. Individual FAA controllers, facility managers, and Command Center managers thought outside the box in recommending a nationwide alert, in ground-stopping local traffic, and, ultimately, in deciding to land all aircraft and executing that unprecedented order flawlessly. More than the actual events, inaccurate government accounts of those events made it appear that the military was notified in time to respond to two of the hijackings, raising questions about the adequacy of the response. Those accounts had the effect of deflecting questions about the military's capacity to obtain timely and accurate information from its own sources. In addition, they overstated the FAA's ability to provide the military with timely and useful information that morning. In public testimony before this Commission in May 2003, NORAD officials stated that at 9:16, NEADS received hijack notification of United 93 from the FAA. This statement was incorrect. There was no hijack to report at 9:16. United 93 was proceeding normally at that time. In this same public testimony, NORAD officials stated that at 9:24, NEADS received notification of the hijacking of American 77. This statement was also incorrect. The notice NEADS received at 9:24 was that American 11 had not hit the World Trade Center and was heading for Washington, D.C. In their testimony and in other public accounts, NORAD officials also stated that the Langley fighters were scrambled to respond to the notifications about American 77,178 United 93, or both. These statements were incorrect as well. The fighters were scrambled because of the report that American 11 was heading south, as is clear not just from taped conversations at NEADS but also from taped conversations at FAA centers; contemporaneous logs compiled at NEADS, Continental Region headquarters, and NORAD; and other records. After reading the above, is \\"Facility manager\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Who handled the U.S. air defense on 9/11?\\"? Options are: a. no; b. yes;","completion":"a. no The U.S. air defense on 9/11 was handled by a combination of civilians, military personnel, and FAA controllers. While facility managers play a role in the events and actions mentioned in the passage, they were not solely responsible for handling the U.S. air defense on 9/11. The defense was a collaborative effort involving various individuals and entities, including NEADS commanders and officers, individual FAA controllers, and facility managers. Therefore, the statement \\"facility manager\\" does not accurately depict the entirety of those who handled the air defense on 9/11."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Besides recreational ice skating, some of its uses include ice hockey, bandy, rink bandy, ringette, broomball, speed skating, figure skating, ice stock sport and curling as well as exhibitions, contests and ice shows. There are two types of rinks in prevalent use today: natural, where freezing occurs from cold ambient temperatures, and artificial (or mechanically frozen), where a coolant produces cold temperatures in the surface below the water, causing the water to freeze. There are also synthetic ice rinks where skating surfaces are made out of plastics. Question: is it cold in the ice skating rink?","completion":"Answer: Yes, it is cold in the ice skating rink.

We arrived in the summer, just in time to enjoy the midnight sun. All that sunlight was fantastic for Mom's vegetable garden. Working in the garden at midnight tended to throw her timing off, so she didn't care much about my bedtime. Dad was a Railway Express agent and Mom was his clerk. That left me in a mess. I usually managed to find some trouble to get into. Once I had a little Are going in the dirt basement of a hotel. I had tried to light a barrel of paint but couldn't really get a good fire going. The smoke got pretty bad, though, and when 1 made my exit, a crowd and the police were there to greet me. The policemen took my matches and drove me Mom and Dad were occupied in the garden and Dad told the police to keep me, and they did!

Article:But his career has been dogged first by claims that he covered up child sexual abuse by priests, and then later that he was himself an abuser. He has always strongly denied any wrongdoing. On 29 June 2017 he was charged with historical sex offences - which he described as \\"false\\". \\"The whole idea of sexual abuse is abhorrent to me,\\" Cardinal Pell said in a statement hours after being charged. He added: \\"I am looking forward finally to having my day in court. I am innocent of these charges.\\" Cardinal Pell was born in the city of Ballarat, near Melbourne, Victoria, in 1941, the son of an Anglican father and an Irish Roman Catholic mother. His early education was at Loreto Convent and later at St Patrick's College where he excelled in sports, particularly Australian Rules football. Such was his prowess on the football field that towards the end of his studies he signed a contract with Richmond Football Club, but then switched his attention to the priesthood. He later said he had tried to fight his calling for a long time. \\"I feared and suspected - and eventually became convinced - that God wanted me to do His work and I was never able to successfully escape that conviction,\\" he said. George Pell began his training for the priesthood in 1960 at Corpus Christi College, the regional seminary for Victoria and Tasmania, and in 1963 went to Rome to continue his studies. He was ordained at St Peter's Basilica in Rome in 1966 and went on to take a doctorate in Church history in Oxford. He returned to Australia in 1971, taking a post as an assistant priest in Swan Hill, Victoria, and then at a parish in Ballarat. By 1996, George Pell had risen to be archbishop of Melbourne and was later appointed archbishop of Sydney. Pope John Paul II nominated him to the Vatican's College of Cardinals in 2003, a position that allowed him to vote in papal elections. In 2014, Cardinal Pell was summoned to Rome to become chief of the Vatican's finances, a new position created by Pope Francis in the wake of scandals at the Vatican Bank. But he left behind growing anger over revelations of child sex abuse by members of the Catholic clergy in Australia. Cardinal Pell repeatedly faced allegations from abuse victims of a cover-up and his critics accused him of appearing aloof and arrogant. He was accused of moving one notorious paedophile priest - Gerald Ridsdale - around parishes rather than reporting him, and of attempting to bribe one of the victims to keep quiet. He strongly denied any wrongdoing but said he could have done more to investigate claims of abuse. In 2016 the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC) aired allegations by two men who claimed Cardinal Pell had touched them inappropriately in the 1970s. He strongly denied the allegations, describing them as a \\"scandalous smear campaign\\". A summary of the above article is?","completion":"Cardinal George Pell, who once held a high-ranking position at the Vatican as its chief financial officer, has faced numerous allegations related to covering up child sexual abuse by priests and has himself been accused of abuse.

Born in Ballarat, Australia, in 1941, Pell pursued a career in the priesthood and climbed the ranks to become Archbishop of Melbourne and later Sydney. He was appointed to the Vatican's College of Cardinals in 2003. Pell has faced allegations of covering up abuse, moving priests accused of abuse to different parishes, and being personally involved in abuse in the 1970s, all of which he has denied."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: I can use this background: A person with a serious brain injury usually suffers permanent brain damage. These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities. Now, I have a new situation: Tammy and Rob rode a tandem bike down the hill. They hit a large rock and fell. Tammy wound up in the hospital and was diagnosed with a serious brain injury. Rob suffered only a mild concussion. Answer this question please: Which person had fewer problems with mental abilities? Answer:","completion":"Rob had fewer problems with mental abilities. In the situation provided, Tammy suffered a serious brain injury, which typically results in issues with mental abilities such as memory, as well as possible personality changes and difficulty controlling body movements. On the other hand, Rob only suffered a mild concussion, which usually has less severe effects on a person's mental abilities and overall functioning compared to a serious brain injury."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How do I build more confidence? I lack confidence to do basic things in life. How do I build confidence? Do those questions have the same meaning? * no; * yes;","completion":"Yes, both of those questions have the same meaning. They essentially ask how to improve one's confidence in performing tasks or dealing with various aspects of life. Building confidence is an ongoing process that takes time, effort, and persistence. The good news is that there are several techniques and strategies you can implement in your journey to become more self-assured and confident. Here are some approaches to consider: 1. Set realistic goals: Start by identifying small, achievable goals that can help build your confidence over time. Breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable steps will make the process of building confidence more approachable. As you achieve each goal, you'll gradually feel more self-assured of your abilities. 2. Practice, practice, practice: Confidence often comes with experience. Therefore, make an effort to engage in activities or tasks that you find challenging or intimidating. By repeatedly facing your fears, you are paving the way for an increased sense of confidence. Keep in mind, though, that the key is to practice to build up your skills and experience gradually, not to expect perfection right away. 3. Focus on self-improvement: Reflect on the areas of your life that you feel most insecure about and actively seek information, tools, or resources to help address these insecurities. By focusing on self-improvement, you'll be taking proactive steps to increase your confidence. 4. Embrace positive thinking: Your thoughts can greatly influence your confidence levels. Therefore, making a conscious effort to embrace positive thinking and eliminate negative self-talk can contribute to improved self-esteem over time. One way to practice positive thinking is to engage in daily affirmations, reminding yourself of your strengths, achievements, and the value you bring to the world. 5. Surround yourself with supportive people: Building confidence is challenging when you're constantly being weighed down by negativity or criticism. Make a point to surround yourself with people who lift you up, support your goals, and remind you of your worth. 6. Accept and learn from failure: Understand that failure and setbacks are an inevitable part of life, and they can be invaluable learning experiences. By accepting and analyzing your failures, you can gain valuable insights and increase your resilience, ultimately leading to greater confidence. 7. Develop a strong sense of self-worth: Focus on knowing your worth and believing in yourself, regardless of external validation. Developing a strong sense of self-worth will help you feel confident in your ability to handle different life situations. 8. Seek professional help, if necessary: If your lack of confidence is severely affecting your mental health or daily functioning, consider seeking professional help, such as a counselor or a therapist. They can help you understand the underlying causes of your low confidence, as well as provide targeted strategies for improvement. 9. Celebrate your successes: It's important to recognize and celebrate even small accomplishments, as doing so will help reinforce your confidence. Reflect on what you did well, how you handled challenges, and what you have learned in the process. 10. Adopt a healthy lifestyle: Taking care of your physical, mental, and emotional well-being can impact your self-confidence and overall outlook on life. Be sure to exercise regularly, eat a balanced diet, practice stress management techniques, and prioritize self-care. Remember that building confidence is an ongoing process and requires patience, persistence, and self-compassion. Over time, you should see progress and feel more at ease in various life situations."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

I bought a new table to play poker but it did not fit through the doorway. The OPT: A. table was too wide. B. doorway was too wide.","completion":"A. The table was too wide. As I stood there, staring at the massive poker table that had just arrived, I couldn't help but feel a wave of frustration wash over me. The table was too wide to fit through the doorway, and I was left scratching my head, wondering how I was going to get it into the room where my friends and I had planned to play. After taking a moment to gather my thoughts, I knew I needed to come up with a plan. I decided to call my friend, who happened to be a carpenter, to see if he could help me figure out a way to either dismantle the table or alter the doorway in order to accommodate its size. When my friend arrived, he began to assess the situation, looking at the table from various angles and measuring the doorway. As a skilled carpenter and problem-solver, he was confident that we could find a solution. After a while, he suggested that it might be possible to carefully take apart the table, bring it inside, and then reassemble it in the room. I agreed to give it a try, and we began the process of dismantling the poker table. With my friend's guidance, we carefully removed each section, making sure we kept all the bolts, screws, and other pieces organized, so we could easily reassemble the table later. Once the table was apart, we carefully maneuvered each piece through the doorway. Some of the sections were still fairly large and required us to pivot and twist them through the tight entrance. This part of the process was slow and required a lot of patience, but eventually, all the pieces were inside the room. Settling into the task of reassembling the table, we worked diligently, piecing it back together step by step. It was a bit like working on a giant jigsaw puzzle, and as the table started to take shape, I couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment. Several hours later, the poker table stood resplendent in the center of the room, looking just as magnificent as it had when it was delivered. My friend and I looked at each other with satisfied grins, proud of our efforts in overcoming the obstacle the doorway had presented. That evening, as we sat around the newly assembled poker table with our friends, I suddenly realized that the experience of getting the table inside had been a valuable lesson in problem-solving, patience, and teamwork. And while the table may have been the focal point of our room, it had also become a symbol of our ability to come together and overcome obstacles. The poker nights that followed were not just about the games we played but also about the camaraderie and friendship forged around that table. That seemingly insurmountable problem we faced had turned into an opportunity for growth, and every time I glanced at the table, I was reminded of the challenges we can overcome when we work together."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They both involve producing music, which can be listened to. 4. Look for duplicates. Here, \\"play piano\\" appears twice, indicating a higher probability of being the correct answer based on repetition. 5. Choose the best option.

He served in France and Belgium at the outbreak of WW2 in 1939 until June 1940, when allied troops retreated. The 97-year-old was part of the last defence at the Battle of Dunkirk. He is now frail and bedridden. Last year, his family applied to have him awarded the Legion of Honour Medal - France's highest military award. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) facilitates UK applications and sends the details of eligible candidates to the Embassy of France in London. There have been 2,400 recipients from the UK, mostly soldiers who liberated France in 1944. George's son Bill sent an application by first class post in autumn 2015, but did not hear back. Both the embassy and the MoD have told the BBC they have no record of it. The ministry has, however, said it will investigate if an \\"administrative hiccup\\" was to blame. It said there is a priority scheme for veterans with serious health problems. Bill has been in contact with the relevant department to see if the process can be speeded up. \\"He's 97 years of age and he hasn't too many daylights to go. The sooner he gets it, definitely the better it would be for him. He would be so proud,\\" Bill said. \\"I think he deserves it in the sense that he's been to France. He's fought on the beaches, he's an elderly man and it would make him very happy, and the family.\\" George, whose face was disfigured later in the war by a grenade explosion in Burma, said he is proud of his campaign medals. \\"I wouldn't sell them for a fortune. I wouldn't let them go,\\" he said. On the evacuation, George, who left Dunkirk onboard HMS Ross, said \\"it was a horrible place\\". \\"There were all kinds of ships and as soon as the bombers came over, you dove for the soil and got down deep if you can,\\" he said. \\"I saw a fella one time, he was dead, and he had his waterproof cape on him.

Hundreds of reporters waited outside the court, in the hope of learning \\"shocking\\" information about the case, which includes well-known military singer Li Shuangjiang's son, who gang-raped a woman with another four men on February. The case was not a public hearing because it includes teenagers, whose privacy must be protected under law, but many details had been exposed by the lawyers before the trial. Lawyers of all five suspects and the woman's lawyer made a lot of debate on the Internet before the trial, making the case more confused. Wu Ming'an, a law professor from the China University of Political Science and Law, said it was a pity to see such a \\"performance\\" by the lawyers. \\"It can be understood that the two parties freely spoke their opinions, but it's not professional or wise to see lawyers do the same,\\" Wu said. \\"Instead, the lawyers should guide and persuade their clients to calm down, especially for such a non-public and sensitive case.\\" China has no clear rule to manage lawyers' behavior before trials, \\"but it should be general knowledge that the lawyers of the two sides cannot _ too many details, particularly in a case that includes teenagers\\", Wu added. Yi Shenghua, a lawyer who has been following the case, said it does more harm than good to both parties for such detailed information to be exposed before the trial. \\"It's OK for lawyers to speak, but what is said must be reasonable and legal.

This phrase suggests that the reviewer found the film to have numerous negative qualities that contributed to an overall negative experience while watching it. There could be many factors that led to this negative perception. These factors may include poor storytelling, weak character development, unappealing visuals or cinematography, a disjointed plot, inappropriate humor, or even offensive content. Additionally, technical aspects of the film, such as sound mixing, editing, or visual effects, may have been subpar and heavily detracted from the movie-watching experience. Reviews can also be influenced by personal tastes, preferences, and biases of the reviewer. When a reviewer refers to a film \\"in the worst sense of the expression,\\" they might be emphasizing that the movie not only failed to meet their expectations, but also that it represents some of the lowest qualities that can be found within the genre or medium. This type of review can be highly damaging to a film's reputation and may discourage potential viewers from watching it. It is important to note that movie reviews can be subjective in nature, and one negative review may not necessarily represent the opinions of all viewers.

I have a new situation: John is learning about different states of matter. So far, he recognized three states of matter, state A, state B, and state C. State A is in solid state. State B is in liquid state, and state C is in gaseous state. He needs to learn more about their individual characteristics. But I can use this background: Start right above point on the temperature axis and follow the red line vertically. At very low pressure, the particles of the substance are far apart from one another and the substance is in the gas state. As the pressure is increased, the particles of the substance are forced closer and closer together. Eventually the particles are pushed so close together that attractive forces cause the substance to condense into the liquid state. Continually increasing the pressure on the liquid will eventually cause the substance to solidify. For the majority of substances, the solid state is denser than the liquid state and so putting a liquid under great pressure will cause it to turn into a solid. The line segment represents the process of sublimation, where the substance changes directly from a solid to a gas. At a sufficiently low pressure, the liquid phase does not exist. The point labeled is called the triple point . The triple point is the one condition of temperature and pressure where the solid, liquid, and vapor states of a substance can all coexist at equilibrium. What is an answer for this question: In which state the particles would be farther, state B or state C?","completion":"To answer this question, let's analyze the given background information and compare the particle distances in states B and C. State B is the liquid state. In this state, the particles of the substance are close together but not as tightly packed as in the solid state. They can slide past one another, allowing the substance to flow. State C is the gaseous state. In this state, the particles of the substance are far apart from one another. The attractive forces between particles are weak, and the particles move freely and can be easily compressed. Now, to address the question \\"In which state the particles would be farther, state B or state C?\\" Based on the information provided, the particles would be farther apart in state C (gaseous state) than in state B (liquid state)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Vampire Zachary Simms (Adam Ant) has just awakened in his coffin from a 100-year sleep in the crypt under Kendall's house and comes out through the secret door in her fireplace to face the brave, new world. When the two meet, it isn't quite love at first bite, but Zachary spends the next day in her bed anyway. This angers Dwight when he tries to put the make on Zachary, thinking the lump under the covers is Kendall.

In 1688, he was bitten by a vampire named Nerissa, and they lived together for 100 years before she suddenly decided to run off with a Washington politician. Zachary pined for Nerissa for the next one hundred years and finally decided to sleep it off. Unfortunately, he forgot to wake up until another one hundred years had passed. Zachary is entranced by such devices as refrigerators, electric light bulbs, and cars that talk. Zachary is also entranced by Kendall, and before long, they are a twosome.

Movie plot: Joseph Amadeus von Dracula, known as Pepito to his friends, is a trumpet player in 1930s Havana who spends his time away from the bandstand dabbling in quasi-terrorist plots to overthrow the Cuban government of dictator, Gerardo Machado. He is unaware that he is really a vampire, and that his uncle, Werner Amadeus von Dracula, the son of Count Dracula, has been using him as a test subject for a formula that negates the usually fatal effects of sunlight. A Chicago-based crime syndicate and a group of vampires with members from several countries in Europe have both learned of the formula and wish to possess it for different reasonsâthe Chicago group to suppress it and thus maintain their monopoly on indoor, artificial beach resorts, and the Europeans to market it as \\"Vampisol.\\" When Pepito learns of his true heritage (and his uncle's wish to give the formula away to vampires everywhere) he becomes the target of a multi-pronged manhunt, leading all parties involved on a wild chase through some of the seediest neighborhoods of Havana. At the film's climax, Pepito and his girlfriend find themselves cornered by the Chicago vampire cartel, led by vampire mobster Johnny Terrori. He tells Pepito to have some O positive blood as his last drink, the blood type which vampires consider to be the most delicious. However, when he spits it out in disgust, Terrori realizes that Pepito's dislike of drinking blood, the fact that he was harmed by a lead bullet earlier (vampires can only be harmed by silver bullets) and that he is completely impervious to sunlight (it instantly kills vampires) means that Pepito has stopped being a vampire. Terrori loses interest in the Vampisol formula, realizing that its effect is to turn vampires into humans. However, the leader of the European vampires suggests a deal with his counterparts from Chicago, whereby they can encourage vampires to take small amounts of Vampisol in the summer and visit the mobsters' artificial beaches in the winter.

Samuel Cox, also of Ohio, objected to the name. Cox complained that the name was a misnomer given that most of the territory was not mountainous and that a Native American name would be more appropriate than a Spanish one.

Answer:","completion":"Title: Disappointing and Frustrating Experience Review: I recently downloaded the org.wahtod.wififixer app, hoping it would improve my WiFi connectivity issues. However, I am extremely disappointed and frustrated with the app's performance and functionality. To begin with, the app lacks a user-friendly interface; I found it overly complicated to navigate, and there is a severe lack of clear instructions on how to use it. Additionally, I encountered several bugs and crashes while using the app. In fact, it often ended up worsening my WiFi connection instead of fixing it. The app would constantly disconnect me from my network, and I would have to manually reconnect each time. This entirely defeats the purpose of an app that is supposed to enhance WiFi stability. Moreover, their customer support is lackluster at best. When I reached out to the developers for assistance or to report a bug, I never received a satisfying response or any helpful information. They appeared disinterested in truly addressing my concerns. Lastly, with the abundance of free WiFi-related apps on the market, I cannot justify the app's relatively steep price tag considering its abysmal performance. I have tried some other more affordable, or even free, apps that provide a far superior user experience. Overall, I regretfully have to give org.wahtod.wififixer a 1-star rating.

Rammstein (German pronunciation: ['RamStaIn]) is a German Neue Deutsche Harte band, formed in 1994 in Berlin. Throughout its existence, Rammstein's six-man lineup has remained unchanged--lead guitarist Richard Z. Kruspe, bassist Oliver \\"Ollie\\" Riedel, drummer Christoph \\"Doom\\" Schneider, lead vocalist Till Lindemann, rhythm guitarist Paul H. Landers, and keyboardist Christian \\"Flake\\" Lorenz. The band helped to found a subgenre within German hard rock and metal that became known as Neue Deutsche Harte. The majority of their songs are in German, but they have also performed songs entirely or partially in other languages including English, Spanish, French, and Russian. Rammstein started recording Sehnsucht in November 1996 at the Temple Studios in Malta. The album was again produced by Jacob Hellner. \\"Engel\\", the first single from the album, was released on 1 April 1997 and reached gold status in Germany on 23 May. This prompted the release of a fan edition of the single, named Engel - Fan Edition. This contained two previously unreleased songs, \\"Feuerrader\\" and \\"Wilder Wein\\". Release of the second single from the album Sehnsucht was \\"Du hast\\", which hit the German single charts August 1997 at number 5. Rammstein then continued touring in the summer while Sehnsucht was released on 22 August 1997. The album reached number 1 in Germany after two weeks in the charts. Simultaneously, Herzeleid and both Sehnsucht singles (\\"Du hast\\" and \\"Engel\\") were in the Top 20 of the German charts. Rammstein continued to headline sold-out shows throughout Europe in September and October. On 5 December 1997, they embarked on their first tour of the United States as the opening act for KMFDM. In August 1998, the band released a cover of the song Stripped, originally released by Depeche Mode in early 1986; it was included on the tribute album For the Masses, the Rammstein version obtained moderate success in Germany and Austria. On 22-23 August 1998, Rammstein played to over 17,000 fans at the Wuhlheide in Berlin; the biggest show the band had played there up to that date. Supporting acts were Danzig, Nina Hagen, Joachim Witt and Alaska. The show was professionally filmed, intended to be released on their upcoming live DVD, Live aus Berlin. Rammstein embarked on a live tour with Korn, Ice Cube, Orgy and Limp Bizkit called the Family Values Tour in September through to late October 1998. Continuing their success in the US, Sehnsucht received Gold record status there on November 2. The band was nominated at the MTV European Music Awards for Best Rock Act and performed \\"Du hast\\" live on 12 November that year. Rammstein had further success in 1999, starting off the year in February with a nomination for Best Metal Performance at the 41st-annual Grammy Awards. A year after it was filmed, the Live aus Berlin concert was released on CD on 30 August 1999, with a limited edition double CD also available. Two weeks after it was released, Live aus Berlin went to number one in the German Album Charts. On 13 September and 26 November 1999 the video and DVD versions of the concert were released respectively. Further popularity ensued with the inclusion of \\"Du hast\\" in The Matrix: Music from the Motion Picture. Rammstein's album Mutter was recorded in the south of France in May and June 2000, and mixed in Stockholm in October of that year. During December 2000, Rammstein released an MP3 version of \\"Links 2-3-4\\" as a teaser for their new album. 2001 was a busy year for Rammstein, as the band needed to finish off the Sehnsucht Tour ending in January and February with the band playing the Big Day Out festival in Australia and New Zealand and playing some concerts in Japan. January also heralded the shooting of the video for their upcoming single, \\"Sonne\\", recorded in Potsdam at Babelsberger Filmstudios from 13 to 15 January 2001. The video was released on 29 January 2001. The single for \\"Sonne\\" was released on 12 February 2001 in Europe, featuring an instrumental version of the song, two remixes by Clawfinger and the song \\"Adios\\" from the upcoming album. Mutter was released on 2 April 2001, sparking another Rammstein tour through Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. On 14 May, the second single from the album, \\"Links 2 3 4\\", was released, along with a video of the single on 18 May. After a tour throughout Europe in June, the band then toured the U.S., Canada and Mexico from June to August 2001. \\"Ich will\\", the third single from the album, was released on 10 September 2001 and a Tour edition of the Mutter album (the cover of which is red) was released, featuring alternative artwork and live versions of \\"Ich will\\", \\"Links 2 3 4\\", \\"Sonne\\" and \\"Spieluhr\\". From 8 to 12 January 2002, Rammstein traveled to Prague to participate in a minor scene for the film XXX. The band is seen in the opening scene, performing their song \\"Feuer frei!\\" in a concert. \\"Feuer frei!\\" was released across Europe as the first single from the XXX soundtrack on 14 October 2002. Rammstein released two remixes of the song. Furthermore, the single's track listing included \\"Du hast\\" and \\"Buck dich\\" cover versions by Battery. The video for the single was edited by Rob Cohen and contains part Rammstein performance at the beginning of the film and part snippets from the film itself. Rammstein recorded Reise, Reise (meaning \\"journey, journey\\", or as a command \\"travel, travel\\", but also an archaic Reveille) at the El Cortijo studio in southern Spain in November and December 2003; it was mixed at Toytown studio in Stockholm, Sweden in April and May 2004. The first single from the album was \\"Mein Teil\\", released on 26 July. The video was shot in the Arena, in the Treptow district of Berlin. Outdoor shooting took place at the Deutsche Oper (Opera House) U-Bahn station on Bismarckstrasse. The director was Zoran Bihac, who also filmed the \\"Links 2 3 4\\" video. The video for the second single, \\"Amerika\\", was filmed on 6 and 7 August 2004 in the ruins of the former cement works in Rudersdorf, near Berlin, under the direction of Jorn Heitmann (who also directed the \\"Ich Will\\" music video, among others). The space suits for the moon scenes were borrowed from Hollywood and 240 tons of ash were needed to create the moon landscape. The video premiered on 20 August, while the single was released on 13 September. Reise, Reise was released on 27 September 2004 and went straight into top 10 charts throughout Europe. According to the Billboard charts, Rammstein were at that stage the most successful German-language band of all time. Rammstein toured Germany through November and some of December 2004, releasing the single \\"Ohne dich\\" on 22 November. In February 2005, Rammstein toured Europe again. By 28 February, Rammstein had played 21 concerts in front of more than 200,000 spectators in ten countries. It was on this tour that the band was faced with several lawsuits resulting from severe fire breathing accidents involving audience members. \\"Keine Lust\\" the fourth single from Reise, Reise, was released on 28 February 2005. From 27 May to 30 July 2005, Rammstein played music festivals across Europe. Footage from these concerts can be seen on Rammstein's live DVD Volkerball, released in November 2006.

By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. Please answer this question : Which scientist read more about grassland fires?","completion":"Based on the given information, it can be deduced that the scientist who read more about grassland fires is Jian. This conclusion can be reached by evaluating the areas of study for both scientists and examining the role of grassland fires in soil formation. Yun focused on studying forest soils, which are primarily influenced by the organic matter contributed by fallen tree leaves. This creates a substantial O horizon and a comparatively thin A horizon in the forest soil profile. Forest soils usually have greater acidity, inhibiting certain soil organisms that could mix surface litter into the mineral soil. Forest fires, while potentially impactful in some circumstances, are not a highlighted factor regarding the formation and characteristics of forest soils in this given situation. On the other hand, Jian studied grassland soils, where organic matter is predominantly added through the deep, fibrous root systems of grasses. An important difference mentioned in the hint is the frequent occurrence of fires in grasslands. While these fires destroy large amounts of aboveground material, they stimulate even greater contributions from grass roots. This process promotes the development of a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter in grassland soils as compared to forest soils.

Use a shrinker sock daily to keep your residual limb healthy. Work with your prosthetist to order the customized prosthetic limb.\\"","completion":"Title: Navigating the Path to Your Perfect Customized Prosthetic Limb Introduction: Losing a limb is a life-changing event, but advanced prosthetics technology is offering greater mobility and independence for amputees. Receiving a custom-made prosthetic limb is an important step towards regaining the feeling of wholeness and control. However, the journey to obtain your ideal prosthesis can be complex and confusing. To facilitate this process, we have created a simple step-by-step guide to help you navigate the path to your perfect customized prosthetic limb. Step 1: Meet with Your Prosthetist to Receive a Temporary Prosthesis Your journey begins by scheduling and attending a meeting with a certified prosthetist. The prosthetist will assess your residual limb and discuss your goals and requirements in order to provide a temporary prosthetic limb. The purpose of a temporary prosthesis is to help you gradually adapt to your new limb, learn how to walk or function again and allow your residual limb to heal. Embrace the opportunity to ask any questions and address concerns you may have. The prosthetist is your ally in this journey and will be a vital resource throughout the entire process. Step 2: Increase the Amount of Time You Spend Wearing Your Prosthesis In this phase, your main focus should be on building your tolerance and endurance. Gradually increase the amount of time you spend wearing your temporary prosthesis, starting with short intervals and slowly progressing to longer periods as you feel more comfortable. This will allow you to regain your mobility and independence while closely managing your comfort and health. Remember, it is essential to follow your prosthetist's guidelines and advice during this period. Overexertion or improperly wearing the prosthesis can result in pain, skin irritations, or even complications down the line. Step 3: Use a Shrinker Sock Daily to Keep Your Residual Limb Healthy For optimal prosthetic fit and functionality, it is crucial to maintain a healthy residual limb. Using a shrinker sock daily helps to control swelling and promote healing as your limb adapts to the temporary prosthesis. The shrinker sock is made from a specific type of elastic fabric designed to provide compression, and it is crucial to wear it as prescribed by your prosthetist. Additionally, monitor your limb for any issues such as skin breakdown, infection, or excessive pain. Contact your prosthetist immediately if you notice any complications or concerns. Step 4: Work with Your Prosthetist to Order the Customized Prosthetic Limb Once you have built up your endurance and your residual limb is ready, your prosthetist will help you choose and order your customized prosthetic limb. This will be tailored to your specific needs, requirements, and lifestyle, ensuring that it meets your overall expectations. Be open and proactive in discussing your desired limb features, appearance, and any other preferences that would make your prosthesis as comfortable, functional, and suitable for you. Your prosthetist will guide you throughout this process by providing essential information and options for consideration. Conclusion The journey to obtain a perfect customized prosthetic limb can be a challenging and lengthy one, but with patience, dedication, and the guidance of a certified prosthetist, you will accomplish your goals. By following these steps and maintaining open communication with your prosthetist, you will eventually enjoy the enhanced mobility and independence that come with a prosthesis designed specifically for you. Embrace this transformative journey and take the first step towards improving your quality of life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Flibanserin is being touted as a drug designed to boost the low sexual desire of otherwise healthy women. Here's how it works and why it’s really not like Viagra at all. (The Washington Post) Flibanserin is being touted as a drug designed to boost the low sexual desire of otherwise healthy women. Here's how it works and why it’s really not like Viagra at all. (The Washington Post) The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday evening approved the world’s first drug designed to stir a woman’s waning desire for sex, a condition that affects an estimated 1 in 10 U.S. women. The approval of the controversial drug, flibanserin, which the FDA twice rejected before and now will be marketed as Addyi, comes with a series of conditions reflecting the agency’s concerns about serious side effects. These include a boxed warning that highlights the risks of low blood pressure and fainting in patients who drink alcohol while taking the drug, as well as a requirement that doctors complete a training course before being allowed to prescribe it. “Because of a potentially serious interaction with alcohol, treatment with Addyi will only be available through certified health care professionals and certified pharmacies,” Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. “Patients and prescribers should fully understand the risks associated with the use of Addyi before considering treatment.” Supporters of the drug hailed the decision as an end to what they called “gender bias” at the FDA, giving women more choice and control over their sexual lives. Critics said the approval of what some call a “mediocre aphrodisiac” with significant side effects has now turned the normal range of women’s low sexual desire into a disease, with pharmaceutical companies only too eager to rush in. [From 1952-2015: The path to ‘female Viagra’ has been a rocky one] The FDA is requiring the drug manufacturer, Sprout Pharmaceuticals, to conduct three studies in women to better understand the serious known risks of the interaction between Addyi and alcohol. The pill is intended to treat a condition called Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder, or chronic and distressingly low libido in pre-menopausal women that cannot be explained by factors such as relationship troubles, stress, or medical or psychological issues. The FDA recommends that women stop using the pill if they notice no change in their libido after eight weeks. Cindy Whitehead, Sprout’s chief executive, said that the company has prepared an online training course for prescribers and that the drug will be available as soon as Oct. 17. The company will refrain from advertising directly to consumers for 18 months, she said, to avoid creating a clamor for the new drug. “This is really a milestone moment to celebrate,” Whitehead said. She has fought for the drug’s approval — mobilizing women’s groups, organizing and funding a high-profile marketing and lobbying campaign called Even the Score, and publicizing the stories of women with distressingly low libidos — since Sprout acquired flibanserin in 2011. “There hasn’t been a whole lot of innovation in this category of women’s health since the birth-control pill [in 1960]. This is game-changing for women.” Unlike Viagra, which was approved by the FDA in 1998 and increases blood flow to the genitals, flibanserin targets neurotransmitters in the brain. Though just how the drug boosts desire remains unknown, flibanserin affects the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain, neurotransmitters that are key to sexual desire, and serotonin, which governs inhibition. [What is ‘female Viagra’? Is it safe? And what happens next?] Also unlike Viagra, which is taken on an as-needed basis, flibanserin is effective only if taken every day. Because the drug can cause sleepiness, Sprout recommends taking it before bed. Adriane Fugh-Berman, a pharmacology professor at Georgetown University and director of PharmedOut, which focuses on pharmaceutical marketing practices, called Tuesday “a sad day for drug regulation.” “The FDA turned down this drug twice because the risks outweighed the benefits,” she said. “What has been learned since the last disapproval is that it has more risks than we thought and it doesn’t have any more benefits. The only thing that’s different is a clever, aggressive public relations campaign that Sprout Pharmaceuticals waged successfully.” She added: “This opens the way for drug companies to pressure the FDA through public relations campaigns to approve more bad drugs: It’s bad news for rational drug approval.” The FDA rejected the drug in 2010 and in 2013, saying the risks of side effects such as nausea, dizziness, low blood pressure, fainting and sleepiness outweighed the “modest” benefit. In June, however, an FDA advisory panel voted 18 to 6 to recommend approval. That vote came after Sprout conducted additional safety testing and measured the drug’s impact on sexual desire over 28 days, not daily as in earlier studies. The FDA concluded there was a “statistically significant” improvement over a placebo. Prior to flibanserin, there had been no FDA-approved treatments for Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder, first described in medical literature in 1977. Surveys show that low libido is the most common female sexual dysfunction. Counselors say it is also the most difficult to treat. Sally Greenberg, executive director of the National Consumers League and a member of the Even the Score advocacy campaign, praised the FDA decision. “It acknowledges that as a condition, HSDD is not simply a psychological problem or a reflection of cultural pressure on women but a biological condition that can be treated with an effective medication,” she said. [Out of desperation, women were turning to unproven, unregulated treatments ] Marianne Brandon, a sex therapist in Annapolis who served on the FDA advisory panel and voted to recommend approval of the drug, said low desire, like depression, is physiological as well as psychological and emotional. And, she said, as with depression, therapy can help but might not be enough. “Turning low libido around, without having a biological component to your treatment like a flibanserin, is difficult,” she said. Leonore Tiefer, a sex therapist who has been leading the New View Campaign against flibanserin and other drugs, said she was “disappointed but not surprised” by the FDA decision. “It’s interesting that the FDA made it so you’re going to have to jump through quite a few hoops to get this drug,” she said. “They’re asking health-care professionals to assess the likelihood of the patient reliably abstaining from alcohol. Well, that’s asking too much, if you ask me.” Caleb Alexander, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness, sat on the FDA advisory panel and voted against approval of the drug. More than half of pre-menopausal women drink regularly, he said, citing testimony at the June hearing, and 30 percent report binge drinking. “Given the prevalence of alcohol use and abuse in our society,” he said, “I think it’s alarming that this product’s interactions with alcohol aren’t better explored before it’s approved for the market.” Alexander said one of the main differences in the FDA’s previous rejections of flibanserin and its approval Tuesday was the high-profile Even the Score campaign, which ran TV ads, lined up several members of Congress and gathered more than 60,000 signatures to press the FDA to approve the drug. Whitehead said Sprout has already completed studies to test the effectiveness of the drug in post-menopausal women — a potentially huge market, with the growing number of aging female baby boomers. Libido naturally drops with age as hormone levels fall. The company will begin working toward FDA approval for older women, Whitehead said. “This could have a real-life impact and be a real change for them,” she said. FDA analysis of the outcomes of flibanserin clinical trials found “small but statistically significant” improvement in sexual desire and satisfying sexual events, and lower levels of distress. “Our goal is not to move someone who rarely or never has interest in sex to wanting sex most or all of the time,” Whitehead said. “We’re aiming to bring her back into normal range.” That’s all Katherine Campbell, 31, a mother of two young boys in Noblesville, Ind., says she wants. She said when she heard the news about the FDA approval, she started to cry. “Oh, my gosh, I’m so excited. I cannot wait to try it,” she said. “I know millions of other women are out there waiting to get their hands on it, too.” After having a healthy sex life and often a higher sex drive than her husband in her 20s, Campbell said her libido disappeared after the birth of their first child three years ago and has never returned. “It literally changed overnight,” she said. “It’s been really tough on our marriage. My husband and I still had sex, but it was more out of obligation.” [Are we ‘medicalizing’ sex?] And if flibanserin does not work, there are several other drugs aimed at boosting women’s craving for sex already in the FDA pipeline. Carl Spana, president and CEO of Palatin Technologies, said the FDA approval was “a big positive” for drugs such as the one his company is developing, bremelanotide, which works on melanocortin receptors in the brain to boost female sexual desire. “Women need other treatment options,” he said. “The decision really sets a regulatory precedent for how the FDA will measure efficacy moving forward.” Spana hopes to submit the drug for FDA approval in 2017 and put it on the market by 2018. ||||| It's being billed as a big day in the sex lives of women: The Food and Drug Administration just approved the first-ever drug designed to boost a woman's libido. The medicine in question is called flibanserin, a daily pill made by Sprout Pharmaceuticals for premenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder, or the sudden and unexplained loss of libido. The drug, which will be sold under the brand name Addyi, hits pharmacy shelves on October 17. There's just one problem: The pink pill doesn't actually work all that well. The FDA had rejected flibanserin twice before, and only approved it this time after a powerful marketing push and advocacy campaign from women's groups. Here are five reasons to be skeptical that a Viagra equivalent for women is on its way to market. 1) The drug doesn't appear to help most women According to an FDA analysis of flibanserin, between 8 and 13 percent of women who take the drug will see some improvement over placebo. That's a pretty small number, particularly when you consider how \\"improvement\\" has been defined. Specifically, women who take the flibanserin pill have, on average, 0.5 more \\"sexually satisfying events\\" per month. While this is greater than those taking a placebo comparison pill with no active drug in it, that's a pretty negligible boost. For this reason, Dr. Adriane Fugh-Berman — the director of the PharmedOut project at Georgetown University who studied the marketing campaign around flibanserin — has called the drug \\"a mediocre aphrodisiac with scary side effects.\\" 2) The drug has scary side effects Let's be clear up front: No drug is without side effects. But every medicine is a balance of risks and benefits. And as Walid Fouad Gellad, an internist in Pittsburgh who has written about flibanserin in JAMA, noted, given the fact that flibanserin doesn't seem to do all that much to alter women's sex drives, there's a big question about whether its side effects are worth the risk. \\"If you're going to give something to women and they can pass out any time, that’s a real problem\\" Research to date has shown that about one in five women who took the drug reported adverse effects. Most commonly these included drowsiness, dizziness, and fainting, which increased the risk of injuries such as concussions. Extremely low blood pressure was another, less common side effect. \\"If you're going to give something to women and they can pass out any time, that’s a real problem,\\" Gellad remarked. What's worse, these side effects are exacerbated when the drug is taken with alcohol and hormonal contraceptives — and many, many women drink alcohol and use these types of birth control. 3) Doctors worry about interactions with alcohol and hormonal contraceptives The FDA's workaround for some of these side effects has been that women are asked to take the drug at bedtime and that it will only be available through specially certified health-care professionals and pharmacies who have gone through some training. Doctors will need to assess the ability of patients to stay away from drinking while on flibanserin. But how this actually plays out in the real world is another question. Women may still drink on this medication, they may take it in the morning — there's no way to control those behaviors. The drug may also be used \\"off label\\" — or prescribed in ways that are different from how it's been approved. This could include women who are menopausal or who have other medical problems, like a heart condition. \\"The drug can cause low blood pressure, so that really worries me if you give the drug to women who have a cardiac condition,\\" said Fugh-Berman. What's more, the evidence the company provided about the drug's impact on alcohol interaction was pretty strange and didn't tell very much about how alcohol will actually affect users. The study involved 25 participants, but only two were women. It confirmed that alcohol can boost the risk of bad side effects with flibanserin, but a study of mostly men for a drug for women means it's still unclear how women who drink will react. Finally, the trials on flibanserin have been limited to healthy women who aren't on sleep aids or anti-anxiety drugs or all the other medications many American women rely on and that may interact with flibanserin. So there's also some question about whether other side effects and complications will emerge. And we have no idea about flibanserin's long-term side effects, since the studies we have to date have only run for short periods of time. This isn't all that unusual for a new drug, but it becomes more relevant when you consider the drug's lackluster effect on libido. 4) The campaign behind the drug is misleading The FDA had already rejected the drug twice for failing to be effective enough, most recently in 2013. While the drug company has provided no new efficacy data since then, the pill's luck changed in June when an FDA advisory panel urged the regulator to approve flibanserin. The panel's 18-6 vote was considered a \\"major victory\\" because the FDA more often than not adopts the advice of the expert group and because the same panel had voted unanimously against flibanserin in the past. It was also a major victory for advocacy and marketing over science. That's because while the evidence didn't change since the 2013 rejection, the drugmaker did launch the \\"Even the Score\\" campaign. Its main objective: to level the playing field when it comes to sexual dysfunction drugs for men and women, and get the drug approved. \\"There are 26 FDA approved drugs to treat various sexual dysfunctions for men,\\" the campaign's site reads, \\"but still not a single one for women's most common sexual complaint.\\" This is misleading. The playing field is actually even in this regard, and flibanserin is the first drug approved to boost the sex drive of either sex. While the group claims that men have this grab bag of medications at their disposal, as this piece in JAMA explained, \\"There are no approved products for low sexual desire in men.\\" The pills available to men mostly deal with mechanical problems, like erectile dysfunction or low testosterone — not flibanserin's elusive goal of boosting sex drive. The Even the Score campaign also accused the FDA of being sexist for not getting the pink pill on the market to help women: \\"Why do we fast track the approval of drugs like Viagra (1998) for men? Why do we accept fewer patients in trials for male drugs than we've seen for some for women?\\" reads the campaign website. But as Paul Thacker described at Slate, the medical experts he spoke to agreed flibanserin is no \\"cure-all\\" and that the FDA has been evidence-based in its treatment of the pill. \\"It is hard to see what is sexist about the national drug regulatory agency refusing to approve a drug that was ineffective and like all active pharmaceutical products, has the potential for harm,\\" one doctor told him. 5) It’s been called a \\"textbook case of disease-mongering\\" by Big Pharma For years, \\"female Viagra\\" has been discussed in the scientific literature as \\"a textbook case of disease-mongering by the pharmaceutical industry.\\" Critics have accused the pharmaceutical industry of inventing the medical condition (hypoactive sexual desire disorder) that the drug is designed to treat. \\"The FDA has turned this down twice before, and now we have no new evidence of benefits, and we have more evidence of harms, so if the FDA does approve the drug today the only thing that changed is the amount of pressure put on it by a corporation though a major PR campaign,\\" said Fugh-Berman. For Gellad, this doesn't necessarily mean the drug should not have been approved. Women with low sex drives have no other treatment options, after all. \\"It would have been very different if there were already six or seven drugs for this condition,\\" he said. But then the question becomes whether a drug with small benefits and many side effects is better than no drug at all. VIDEO: Life looks really different through an MRI machine ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"In 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Flibanserin, known as \\"female Viagra\\", a daily pill by Sprout Pharmaceuticals designed to boost the libido of women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Flibanserin, unlike Viagra which increases blood flow to the genitals, targets neurotransmitters in the brain linked to sexual desire and inhibition, though its precise mechanism remains unknown. FDA approval followed a series of tests with increased safety measures and additional data regarding the drug's impact on sexual desire. However, multiple side effects include drowsiness, dizziness, fainting, and low blood pressure, particularly when the pill is taken with alcohol or hormonal contraceptives. Critics argue that the limited effectiveness of the drug may not outweigh these risks. Other points of contention include potential \\"off-label\\" use, concerns about long-term side effects, and accusations of the \\"invention\\" of hypoactive sexual desire disorder as a condition by the pharmaceutical industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Having read the above passage, choose the right answer to the following question (choices are higher or lower ): An elderly person has a higher or lower risk of developing a cardiovascular disease than a young person? Answer:","completion":"Answer: Higher An elderly person has a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease than a young person. As people age, various physiological changes occur in their bodies that increase the likelihood of developing cardiovascular issues. These changes include reduced elasticity of blood vessels, buildup of fatty deposits (atherosclerosis) in the artery walls, and a decline in the overall function of the heart muscle. Additionally, aging is associated with other risk factors that contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, and diabetes. Older individuals may also have a higher prevalence of unhealthy lifestyle habits, such as smoking and sedentary behavior, which can further exacerbate their risk. It is important to note that while the risk of cardiovascular disease increases with age, it does not mean that young people are immune to these conditions. Younger individuals can also have risk factors that put them at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, such as genetic predisposition or unhealthy lifestyle habits. To reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in both young and old individuals, it is essential to adopt a heart-healthy lifestyle that includes a balanced diet, regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, managing stress, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. Early detection and management of risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes also play a crucial role in preventing the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases. In summary, an elderly person has a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease compared to a young person due to age-related physiological changes and the accumulation of risk factors over time. However, both age groups can benefit from a heart-healthy lifestyle and proactive management of identified risk factors to reduce the overall risk of developing cardiovascular disease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Blasted: Superdrug admits it has had to stock cheap drinks to lure customers to the store. Superdrug has been accused of fuelling Britain’s binge drinking culture by selling cheap alcohol in its stores alongside cosmetics. The retailer, better known for beauty products and in-store pharmacies, admitted it has resorted to stocking cheap wine, beer and alcopops to entice customers into struggling outlets. But a Conservative MP last night branded its decision irresponsible and called on Superdrug to take the booze off the shelves – accusing the firm of targeting younger customers with its alcohol promotions. In a branch in Chatham, Kent, customers can buy bottles of wine for just £2.49, while a brand of peach schnapps is on sale for just £4.49 – almost £2.50 cheaper than the same drink in Tesco. The town’s MP Tracey Crouch, chairwoman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Alcohol Misuse, said: ‘I’m very disappointed because this isn’t what their core selling is about. They’re about health and beauty products. ‘They are clearly marketing at young, female consumers and I don’t think it’s a responsible thing to do. I share the concerns about cheap booze in supermarkets and Superdrug is contributing to the issue of people pre-loading before they go out in an evening. ‘They should remove alcohol from their stores. ‘Other shops might follow Superdrug’s lead, which will be damaging for our High Street and won’t help us, as a nation, deal with young people binge drinking on cheap booze.’ Her call was backed last night by Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker, who said: ‘It is not impressive to see a national chain specialising in medicines and health care now dealing in alcohol sales. 'Industry needs to raise its game and do much more to help reduce problem drinking – and retailers have to recognise they have a significant part to play.’ MP Tracey Crouch has attacked the move as 'irresponsible' and a fuel for dangerous binge-drinking culture. The attack comes after supermarkets were criticised for using cheap drink promotions to attract customers. Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged to crack down on promotional deals, which he blamed for increasing anti-social behaviour turning town centres into the ‘Wild West’. Another Superdrug outlet in Tamworth, Staffordshire, is selling Echo Falls red, white and rose wine for £4.19. Meanwhile 70cl bottles of the alcopop Caribbean Twist, which sell for £2.50 in most supermarkets, are promoted as ‘great value’ at £1.79. A store assistant said: ‘The Echo Falls was under £4 recently and the shelves were soon empty. We had to order more. We had San Miguel beer in December and that went quickly.’ But Superdrug managing director Joey Wat defended the alcohol sales, saying it was the only way to stop some branches closing down. Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker and Alcohol Concern have also blasted the prices for encouraging 'pre-loading', when teenagers drink before going out. In a letter responding to concerns raised by Ms Crouch about the Chatham branch, he wrote: ‘We sell alcoholic drinks in a very small number of our stores – only six out of 870. 'There is one reason for the sale of alcohol in these stores – to drive footfall and sales as the six are significant loss-making stores and at serious risk of closure. ‘It is the last resort to save the jobs of our people.’ Superdrug insisted the branches in question do not have pharmacies. But responsible drinking campaigners said Superdrug should not be treating alcoholic beverages like another product to increase profits. Alcohol Concern’s Emily Robinson said: ‘Should shops be selling alcopops and wine beside shampoos and mascaras? This sends out the wrong message about alcohol – it’s not just any product, it can be harmful, addictive and dangerous. 'With alcohol now sold in Superdrug, Argos and a pub on the M40, we would ask the Government whether their licensing rules need to be reconsidered.’ Today Superdrug backtracked over its decision to sell alcohol. A spokesman said: 'We have decided to cease selling alcohol in the five Superdrug stores which currently offer this range. 'The introduction of this category into a very small number of stores was a trial to see if this was a product area our customers wanted us to stock, to ensure the continued viability of these stores and to safeguard jobs on the high street.'

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the name of the area that had upward movement of magma under it?, using the article: The creation of Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area in 1984 stopped any further geothermal prospecting. Mono Basin was the first National Scenic Area in the United States. It offers more protection than other United States Forest Service lands, surrounds Mono Lake and its two volcanic islands, Black Point, Panum Crater and much of the northern half of the Mono Craters. Litigation and outreach by the Mono Lake Committee, the National Audubon Society and other conservation groups has helped to slow water diversions from tributaries feeding Mono Lake.A series of earthquakes inside Long Valley Caldera, coincidentally starting two weeks after the May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington, alerted geologists to the possibility of renewed volcanic activity in the region. Four magnitude 6 earthquakes struck the southern margin of Long Valley Caldera in an area that was close to the Mono–Inyo fissure system. The caldera floor had also uplifted by 10 inches (30 cm) in five years. Upward movement of magma under the caldera was thought to be the cause of the earthquakes and uplift.Persistent earthquake swarms in 1982 prompted the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to issue a \\"potential volcanic hazard\\" notice for Long Valley. That same year, permanent monitoring of the area by the Long Valley Observatory started. The hazard notice was lifted in 1984 after USGS scientists concluded that magma had been injected into fissures below Mammoth Mountain but had congealed underground. From 1990 to 1996, 150 acres (60 ha) of trees were killed on Mammoth Mountain by 20% to 95% concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the soil (less than 1% is normal). Chemical analysis of the CO2 indicated it was derived from magma., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"What was the name of the area that had upward movement of magma under it?\\" is Long Valley Caldera.

When someone runs quickly, their steps are typically light and nimble, allowing them to maintain speed and efficiency.

It is vague and unrelated to the action of running fast. - Loose: Running with loose feet might imply poor form or lack of control, which would not be associated with running very fast. - Feverishly: This word implies that John was running with great energy or intensity, but it specifically suggests that he might be doing so out of agitation or anxiety rather than speed. - Slowly: This is the opposite of the given information, which states that John ran very fast.

Do other exercises and stretches to improve your posture.\\"","completion":"Title: Journey Towards An Upright Life: The Power of Posture, Yoga, and Exercise Introduction In today's fast-paced world, we often forget to pay attention to our posture. Slouching in front of a computer, hunching over smartphones, and lounging for extended periods can all lead to poor posture. You may not realize it, but your posture affects not only your appearance but also your overall health and well-being. As such, reminding ourselves to stand up straight and incorporating yoga and other exercises into our routines can significantly improve posture, prevent physical discomfort, and promote a holistic sense of wellness. The Importance of Good Posture Good posture is far more than just an aesthetic concern. It is essential for maintaining the proper alignment of the bones and joints, reducing stress on the ligaments, preventing muscle strain and fatigue, and allowing for efficient muscle function. Moreover, maintaining proper posture offers the following benefits: 1. Reduces the risk of back and neck pain: By keeping your spine and muscles balanced, good posture helps prevent aches caused by undue stress on the back and neck. 2. Increases energy levels: Slouching can cause fatigue due to the engagement of unnecessary muscles. In contrast, maintaining good posture ensures that your muscles work efficiently, conserving energy. 3. Improves circulation and digestion: Proper alignment allows your organs to work optimally, contributing to better blood flow and digestion. 4. Enhances lung capacity: Good posture creates more space for your lungs to expand, thus increasing oxygen intake and ultimately promoting a healthier body. 5. Boosts confidence and mood: Standing tall can make you feel more self-assured and optimistic, leading to a positive impact on your psychological well-being. The Role of Yoga in Improving Posture One effective method of improving posture is through the practice of yoga. Yoga not only enhances flexibility and strength, but it also increases body awareness, enabling practitioners to become more conscious of their posture throughout the day. Some beneficial yoga poses and practices for posture improvement include: 1. Tadasana (Mountain Pose): This foundational pose teaches you to stand firm and align your entire body, promoting overall posture awareness. 2. Bhujangasana (Cobra Pose): This gentle backbend helps strengthen the muscles surrounding the spine and counteracts the effects of slouching. 3. Vrikshasana (Tree Pose): With an emphasis on balance, this posture strengthens the legs and core while promoting an elongated, upright posture. 4. Utkatasana (Chair Pose): This pose targets the lower back, hip flexors, and glutes, thereby supporting a strong posture. By incorporating yoga into your routine, you can gradually improve your strength, flexibility, and body awareness, all of which contribute to better posture. Incorporating Stretches and Exercises for Posture Improvement Aside from yoga, various stretches and exercises can help retrain your muscles and enhance your ability to maintain good posture. Consider incorporating the following activities into your fitness routine: 1. Upper back stretches: Stretching the upper back can enhance flexibility and relieve tension, making it easier to maintain an upright posture. Examples of upper back stretches include cat-cow, seated twist, and thoracic extension on a foam roller. 2. Strengthening exercises: Targeting muscles that support the spine can help prevent slouching and promote good posture. Try incorporating planks, bridges, and wall angels to establish a strong core and back. 3. Seated posture exercises: For individuals who spend long hours sitting at a desk, introducing seated exercises like seated spinal twist, seated side stretch, and seated forward fold during breaks can help alleviate the effects of prolonged inactivity. Conclusion In summary, taking the time to remind ourselves to stand up straight and actively engaging in activities such as yoga and posture-specific exercises can lead to long-lasting improvements in posture. By doing so, you'll not only enhance your physical appearance but also contribute to better overall health, well-being, and quality of life. Committing to a journey towards an upright life will ultimately pay dividends in both physical and emotional wellness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In which year did Sir Francis Drake defeat the Spanish Armada?","completion":"Sir Francis Drake played a key role in the English victory over the Spanish Armada, which occurred in 1588. The Spanish Armada was a large fleet of 130 ships that King Philip II of Spain deployed with the prime objective of invading England and overthrowing Queen Elizabeth I. This invasion attempt was to crush English support for Dutch rebels in their fight against Spanish rule, as well as to put an end to England's increasing privateering and rising naval power, which threatened Spain's control over its empire. Sir Francis Drake, as the vice admiral of the English fleet, was one of the most important strategic figures in the defeat of the Spanish Armada. A renowned explorer and privateer, Drake had experience dealing with the Spanish. In fact, he already had a significant reconnaissance advantage after capturing a Spanish ship carrying essential intelligence about the Armada's plans in 1587. This event, known as the \\"Singeing of the King of Spain's Beard,\\" delayed the Armada's launch by a year. When the Spanish Armada finally set sail in May 1588, bad weather forced them to return to port almost immediately. It wasn't until July 19, 1588, that the Armada was sighted by the English off the coast of Cornwall. The English fleet, under the command of Lord Charles Howard and Sir Francis Drake, quickly took action and engaged the Spanish fleet. The Spanish Armada largely followed the \\"crescent\\" formation, maintaining a defensive position to better protect their transports. The English fleet, on the other hand, relied on superior tactics and maneuverability to disrupt the formation. Their ships were faster and more agile, which allowed them to launch rapid artillery attacks and back away before the Spanish ships could respond. The Battle of Gravelines, which took place on August 8, 1588, marked a turning point in the conflict. The English fleet managed to surround the Spanish Armada and launch a nocturnal raid, known as \\"fireships,\\" setting ablaze eight English vessels and sending them towards the anchored Armada. The Spanish ships, fearing a devastating explosion, cut their anchors and scattered. This panic broke the Armada's crescent formation, making them vulnerable to English attacks. Over the next few days, the English fleet inflicted heavy damage on the Spanish. Facing defeat, and with no hope of receiving critical reinforcements from the Duke of Parma, the Armada opted for a long and dangerous return trip around the British Isles, known as the \\"North Sea Route.\\" This desperate decision led to further devastation as the Spanish fleet encountered violent storms and suffered substantial damage, ultimately losing more ships and men. Ultimately, the English victory in 1588 marked the decline of Spanish naval supremacy and served as a turning point in European history. The failed invasion further cemented England's status as a formidable naval power and bolstered the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. Sir Francis Drake's skill, experience, and tactical decisions were crucial factors in the defeat of the Spanish Armada."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If you have cut yourself on something sharp, try to staunch the bleeding as you go to the emergency room. Nerve damage due to knives in the kitchen or broken glass is fairly common. Visit the emergency room if you have had recent contact with lead, arsenic, mercury or other toxic substances. They need to be flushed from your body before repair can start. If the nerve has been completely severed, this may be necessary in order to start repair. If the surgery is successful, the nerve will grow and repair at a rate of approximately one inch per month. Nerve grafts often require the removal of nerve fiber from another part of the body. The area from which it was taken may remain numb after the surgery. Your body will typically go through four phases of repairing nerve damage. This repairing requires the cells to heal and “retune” themselves to properly send signals to the brain. This may require physical therapy. A professional will help you train your body to heal properly by doing incremental range-of-motion exercises. This may require time. Nerve repair may not happen overnight. It may take weeks, months, or years to heal. In severe cases, nerve function may not repair fully.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: For how long did the Farmington Canal help transporting goods to Massachusetts? Context: The city struck fortune in the late 18th century with the inventions and industrial activity of Eli Whitney, a Yale graduate who remained in New Haven to develop the cotton gin and establish a gun-manufacturing factory in the northern part of the city near the Hamden town line. That area is still known as Whitneyville, and the main road through both towns is known as Whitney Avenue. The factory is now the Eli Whitney Museum, which has a particular emphasis on activities for children and exhibits pertaining to the A. C. Gilbert Company. His factory, along with that of Simeon North, and the lively clock-making and brass hardware sectors, contributed to making early Connecticut a powerful manufacturing economy; so many arms manufacturers sprang up that the state became known as \\"The Arsenal of America\\". It was in Whitney's gun-manufacturing plant that Samuel Colt invented the automatic revolver in 1836. The Farmington Canal, created in the early 19th century, was a short-lived transporter of goods into the interior regions of Connecticut and Massachusetts, and ran from New Haven to Northampton, Massachusetts.","completion":"The Farmington Canal helped transport goods to Massachusetts during the early 19th century.

The price of basic food such as wheat and corn has stayed the same for quite a long time,about 30 years.But as the world's population is getting bigger,there's more pressure to feed more people,plus there's less land and water to go round. Another reason is climate change.Droughts and floods make it hard to grow crops like rice and grain.The price of oil has gone up and that makes it more expensive for farmers to run their tractors and to transport the food they make.And lots of fields are being used to grow crops to make other things that can't be eaten--which is bad news for hungry people. The main losers are poor people who live in cities in poor countries,who are facing higher prices for food.Some people are doing well out of the food crisis though.Farmers in rich countries like the US,Canada and Australia are getting record prices for their harvests.

He narrowly missed the Triple Crown, as teammates Billy Hamilton and Sam Thompson led the league in batting with .380 and .370 averages respectively. While with the Phillies, Delahanty played under manager Harry Wright, the man who assembled, managed, and played center field for baseball's first fully professional team, the 1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings. Wright managed the Phillies with Delahanty for four seasons, from 1890 to 1893, with the two and their fine supporting cast leading the Phils to \\"first division\\" finishes during those years, though the team never won a pennant. Between 1894 and 1896 Delahanty compiled astonishing batting marks: .407, 4 HR, 131 RBI; .404, 11 HR, 106 RBI; .397, 13 HR, 126 RBI. In 1894, despite his high average of .407, the batting title went to Hugh Duffy with a major league record-setting .440. The 1894 Phillies outfield had a big season, with all four players averaging over .400. That season, Delahanty hit .407, Sam Thompson batted .407, Billy Hamilton .404 and spare outfielder Tuck Turner finished second to Hugh Duffy in hitting at .416. Delahanty won his first batting title in 1899 with a .410 batting average, adding nine homers and 137 RBI and becoming the first player in major league history to hit .400 three times.

In 1899, Delahanty hit four doubles in the same game. He remains the only man with a four-homer game and a four-double game. The same year Delahanty collected hits in 10 consecutive at bats.

The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who returned to Australia in 1917? is inside the article: Vere Gordon Childe (14 April 1892 – 19 October 1957) was an Australian archaeologist who specialized in the study of European prehistory. He spent most of his life in the United Kingdom, working as an academic for the University of Edinburgh and then the Institute of Archaeology, London, and wrote twenty-six books during his career. Initially an early proponent of culture-historical archaeology, he later became the first exponent of Marxist archaeology in the Western world. Born in Sydney to a middle-class English migrant family, Childe studied classics at the University of Sydney before moving to England to study classical archaeology at the University of Oxford. There, he embraced the socialist movement and campaigned against the First World War, viewing it as a conflict waged by competing imperialists to the detriment of Europe's working class. Returning to Australia in 1917, he was prevented from working in academia because of his socialist activism, instead working for the Labor Party as the private secretary of the politician John Storey. Growing critical of Labor, he wrote an analysis of their policies and joined the far-left Industrial Workers of the World. Emigrating to London in 1921, he became librarian of the Royal Anthropological Institute and journeyed across Europe to pursue his research into the continent's prehistory, publishing his findings in academic papers and books. In doing so he introduced the continental European concept of an archaeological culture—the idea that a recurring assemblage of artefacts demarcates a distinct cultural group—to the British archaeological community., can you guess it ?

Please answer the following question: Q: A van de graff generator produces what type of charge on its dome, causing the tendency to give up electrons? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: The transfer of electrons from the van de Graaff generator to the man is an example of conduction. Conduction occurs when there is direct contact between materials that differ in their ability to give up or accept electrons.

Read this article and answer this question Hoping to rebound from back-to-back losses, the Broncos traveled to Soldier Field to face the Chicago Bears. It was the first start for quarterback Brock Osweiler, substituting for the injured Peyton Manning. The Broncos grabbed the lead on their initial possession, when Osweiler, playing on his 25th birthday, connected with wide receiver Demaryius Thomas on a 48-yard touchdown pass. The Bears got on the scoreboard in the second quarter, with two field goals by placekicker Robbie Gould &#8212; from 46 and 37 yards out. The Broncos increased their lead to 10-6, with a 24-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus as time expired in the second half. Midway through the third quarter, Broncos' linebacker Danny Trevathan intercepted a pass by Bears' quarterback Jay Cutler deep in Bears' territory. Six plays later, the Broncos were attempting to add to their lead on a 4th-and-goal, however, the Bears' defense prevailed after running back Ronnie Hillman was inadvertently tripped by Owseiler on the hand off at the 2-yard line. The Bears then marched down the field, and another 37-yard field goal by Gould narrowed the Broncos' lead to 10-9 near the end of the third quarter. The Broncos then increased their lead to 17-9 early in the fourth quarter, when Osweiler fired a 10-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Cody Latimer, who was playing in place of the injured Emmanuel Sanders. The Bears once again marched down the field, and were facing a 4th-and-goal from the Broncos' 4-yard line, however, a pass from Cutler to running back Jeremy Langford was broken up by Broncos' cornerback Aqib Talib with ten minutes remaining in the game. The Broncos' offense chewed up six minutes of the clock, but were forced to punt, giving the football back to the Bears with 4:23 remaining. On the sixth play of the Bears' next drive, Broncos' linebacker Von Miller forced a strip sack and fumble off Cutler at the Broncos' 35-yard line, which was recovered by defensive end Malik Jackson with 2:30 remaining. However, the Broncos' offense went three-and-out, though they forced the Bears to burn two of their three team timeouts. Just after the two minute warning, the Bears marched down the field, and finally got into the end zone with only 29 seconds remaining, with Langford lunging for a 2-yard touchdown run. However, the Broncos' defense denied a two-point conversion running attempt by Langford, which would have tied the game. The Bears' subsequent onside kick was unsuccessful, and the Broncos' offense ran out the clock. NotesThis was the first game this season in which the Broncos' offense did not commit any turnovers. This was Bears' head coach John Fox's first game against the Broncos since mutually parting ways with the Broncos following the end of the 2014 season. It also marked Jay Cutler's first game against the Broncos, who drafted Cutler in the first round of the 2006 draft before he was traded to the Bears prior to the 2009 season. Cutler did not play when the Broncos and Bears last faced each in other in 2011 due to a thumb injury.

With the abolition of slavery without a civil war, Brazil has managed to prevent the bitter and violent racial tensions that have divided other societies. The country's 2010 census data demonstrates an increase in individuals identifying themselves as black or racially mixed, reflecting growing pride among Brazil's black and indigenous communities. This can be attributed to proactive measures taken by the Brazilian government and a society that is more open to acknowledging and celebrating its diverse heritage. Furthermore, the work of Elio Ferreira de Araujo, Brazil's minister for racial equality, has helped to promote and support the growth of racial pride and awareness among the various ethnic groups in Brazil.

Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it. What is likely true about the politics regarding gun rights in the US? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. not enough information B. Many individuals have varying opinions regarding what should be done about the shootings in the US. C. It is heavily divided and contended among citizens and politicians. D. Most of the citizens that own guns feel threatened about the notion of new laws calling for gun control. A:","completion":"C. It is heavily divided and contended among citizens and politicians. The politics surrounding gun rights in the United States is a highly contentious and divisive issue among citizens and politicians. The unique relationship between Americans and their guns stems from the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which grants the right to own and carry firearms for law-abiding citizens. This has historically led to strong advocacy on both sides, with proponents of gun ownership asserting the importance of self-defense and resistance to oppression, while opponents argue that stricter gun control could reduce instances of mass shootings and gun violence. The debate over gun rights in the U.S. has evolved into a complex and pressing issue that often transcends the usual boundaries of political affiliation. Politicians, civic organizations, and individuals have engaged in ongoing discussions to balance Second Amendment rights with public safety concerns. Initiatives like Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day, inspired by the tragic death of Hadiya Pendleton, have gained support from many, including celebrities and politicians. Despite these efforts, gun rights advocates and organizations such as the National Rifle Association continue to criticize and resist the push for stricter gun control, accusing it of being \\"pointless\\" and merely a way to score \\"socially conscious\\" points. Asserting that most gun-owning citizens feel threatened by the prospect of new gun control laws, as in option D, oversimplifies the spectrum of opinions held by the American public. The debate is far more nuanced and involves many stakeholders with differing perspectives on the matter. The lack of consensus in this debate, as indicated by option B, makes it difficult to advance concrete measures and reach a satisfactory resolution for all parties involved. Nonetheless, gun control and gun rights remain an essential and recurring topic in American politics, and finding the appropriate balance will continue to challenge citizens and politicians alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer a question about this article: In 1933, Herbert Chapman, wanting his players to be more distinctly dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter pillar box red. Two possibilities have been suggested for the origin of the white sleeves. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist Tom Webster, with whom Chapman played golf. Regardless of which story is true, the red and white shirts have come to define Arsenal and the team have worn the combination ever since, aside from two seasons. The first was 1966–67, when Arsenal wore all-red shirts; this proved unpopular and the white sleeves returned the following season. The second was 2005–06, the last season that Arsenal played at Highbury, when the team wore commemorative redcurrant shirts similar to those worn in 1913, their first season in the stadium; the club reverted to their normal colours at the start of the next season.

Review: The documentary revolves around Eva Mozes Kor, a holocaust survivor, part of Mengele's experiments on twins, consisting primarily her version of what happened at Auschwitz, and a comparison of the emotions of the other survivors of the twin experiments. The movie obviously had great reviews. It's one of those topics that no one dares to voice a contrary opinion about. I too, for a large part of the movie, got sucked into the emotion that the movie-maker so obviously wanted the viewer to concentrate on. One of the user reviews on IMDb by Eric Monder (obviously having nothing critical to say about the issue on a public forum) could only find the sweetest nectar. \\"In one of the many dramatic sequences, as a group of Jews argue with Kor at a Jewish center, the meaning of the word \\"forgive\\" is even debated, but the isolated and outnumbered Kor holds her own\\" But by this time, the sappy hold that the movie had on my dormant emotional repertoire had let loose enough that I could see clearly once more. After the \\"strong-willed\\" Eva Kor forgives her \\"Nazi captors\\" the movie begins to delve into what forgiving is all about, at least from the viewpoint of Kor. The movie goes about following her, past her public statement forgiving the Nazis and into new territory. To me, this was the meat of the movie, surrounded by inedible fat of her \\"act of forgiveness\\". Obviously, it was a very sick cow. On a mission to test her theory of forgiveness, in order to heal wounds of the past, she makes her way to the \\"promised land\\" to meet with some Arabs, to discuss with them the issues that they face and to see if dialogue cannot lead to a better understanding of the situation and heavily interspersed with debates and discussions with Jews in the US on her act of forgiving the Nazis, including one at a Jewish center in Chicago. From then on, anyone not so teary eyed that they can't see the screen will find it hard-pressed to miss the obvious contradiction in her statements. Firstly, you immediately notice her body language, defensive and unwilling to listen in a room full of Arab scholars and teachers. Her comments about how she feared that they might kidnap her shows how much of a waste of time, effort and money the entire act was. A rather annoyed Dr Sami Advan (Professor of education at Bethlehem University) gets it just right when he tells Kor off for a statement she makes about how she would rather be asleep in her apartment. Finally, the debate at the Jewish center in Chicago, where she is \\"grilled\\" on the meaning of forgiveness and her right to do so, in the wake of those that continue suffering through the trauma of the acts. I will cut to the chase. By the end of the movie, I was hoping I hadn't chosen to watch the movie. The movie was badly made, failing to delve deeper into anything about Auschwitz apart from the purely trivial, just sufficient to make sure the holocaust is refreshed in the viewers memory and to incite a barrage of tears. It showed that Kor, the subject of the documentary was unable to engage in fair discussion. Her discussion abilities were limited to parroting her stance on forgiveness (at best) to a complete unwillingness to listen or participate. Lastly, is everyone so retarded today that they can't notice the difference between making peace and forgiving? Quoting another IMDb user, \\"I don't see her forgiveness as being weak- quite the contrary, she just wanted to relieve its hold from her soul, she wanted the suffering to be over, so she let it go.\\" That would be the perfect layman's definition of MAKING PEACE. I guess, in a world of propaganda, blind faith and political correctness, there is no room to question those that have \\"gone through more than the human mind can fathom\\". P.S. The dictionary certainly should go into all those Books-to-buy lists everyone keeps making. Now, what is this review like? OPTIONS: [A]. negative [B]. positive","completion":"This review is [A]. negative. The reviewer expresses their disappointment with the documentary, criticizing its focus on emotions, superficial exploration of Auschwitz, and Kor's inability to engage in fair discussions. They also highlight the confusion between forgiveness and making peace.

Summarize this article: UK-based researcher Prof John O'Keefe as well as May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser share the award. They discovered how the brain knows where we are and is able to navigate from one place to another. Their findings may help explain why Alzheimer's disease patients cannot recognise their surroundings. \\"The discoveries have solved a problem that has occupied philosophers and scientists for centuries,\\" the Nobel Assembly said. Prof O'Keefe, from University College London, discovered the first part of the brain's internal positioning system in 1971. On hearing about winning the prize, he said: \\"I'm totally delighted and thrilled, I'm still in a state of shock, it's the highest accolade you can get.\\" His work showed that a set of nerve cells became activated whenever a rat was in one location in a room. A different set of cells were active when the rat was in a different area. Prof O'Keefe argued these \\"place cells\\" - located in the hippocampus - formed a map within the brain. He will be having a \\"quiet celebration\\" this evening and says the prize money \\"should be used for the common good\\". In 2005, husband and wife team, May-Britt and Edvard, discovered a different part of the brain which acts more like a nautical chart. These \\"grid cells\\" are akin to lines of longitude and latitude, helping the brain to judge distance and navigate. They work at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. Prof May-Britt Moser said: \\"This is crazy, this is such a great honour for all of us and all the people who have worked with us and supported us.\\" The Nobel committee said the combination of grid and place cells \\"constitutes a comprehensive positioning system, an inner GPS, in the brain\\". They added: \\"[This system is] affected in several brain disorders, including dementia and Alzheimer's disease. \\"A better understanding of neural mechanisms underlying spatial memory is therefore important and the discoveries of place and grid cells have been a major leap forward to advance this endeavour.\\" Dr Colin Lever, from the University of Durham, worked in Prof O'Keefe's laboratory for ten years and has already dreamt on two occasions that his former mentor had won the award. He told the BBC: \\"He absolutely deserves the Nobel Prize, he created a cognitive revolution, his research was really forward thinking in suggesting animals create representations of the external world inside their brains.\\" \\"Place cells help us map our way around the world, but in humans at least they form part of the spatiotemporal scaffold in our brains that supports our autobiographical memory. \\"The world was not ready for his original report of place cells in 1971, people didn't believe that 'place' was what best characterised these cells, so there was no great fanfare at that time. \\"But his work on hippocampal spatial mapping created the background for discovering grid cells and with grid cells, the world was prepared and we all thought wow this is big news.\\" 2013 - James Rothman, Randy Schekman, and Thomas Sudhof for their discovery of how cells precisely transport material. 2012 - Two pioneers of stem cell research - John Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka - were awarded the Nobel after changing adult cells into stem cells. 2011 - Bruce Beutler, Jules Hoffmann and Ralph Steinman shared the prize after revolutionising the understanding of how the body fights infection. 2010 - Robert Edwards for devising the fertility treatment IVF which led to the first \\"test tube baby\\" in July 1978. 2009 - Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Greider and Jack Szostak for finding the telomeres at the ends of chromosomes. Also commenting on the announcement, Prof John Stein form the University of Oxford, said: \\"This is great news and well deserved. \\"I remember how great was the scoffing in the early 1970s when John first described 'place cells'. \\"Now, like so many ideas that were at first highly controversial, people say 'Well that's obvious!'\\"","completion":"Researchers Prof. John O'Keefe, May-Britt Moser, and Edvard Moser have been awarded the Nobel Prize for their discoveries about how the brain navigates.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this \\"Gather your materials. Consider using a pair of old pajama pants for the bottoms. Lay out your fabric and sweatpants.\\"","completion":"Title: Eco-Friendly Loungewear: Breathing New Life into Old Pajama Pants Introduction In today's fast-paced world, comfort and relaxation have become essential when it comes to fashion, especially while lounging at home. And what better way to unwind than by curling up in comfortable, cozy loungewear? One of the best ways to create a personalized, eco-friendly loungewear set is by repurposing a pair of old pajama pants. This project not only gives your old clothes a new lease on life but helps reduce textile waste and conserve resources. In this article, we'll guide you through the process of transforming your pre-loved pajama pants into chic, comfortable sweatpants that you'll want to wear all day. Step 1: Gather Your Materials Before you get started, ensure that you have all the necessary materials and tools to complete this project. Here is a list of the items you will need: - A pair of old pajama pants or any other suitable fabric: Opt for soft, comfortable fabrics like cotton, flannel, or fleece, which will keep you cozy and warm. - A pair of sweatpants to use as a template: Choose a pair that fits you well and has a similar rise and style to the one you want to create. - Fabric scissors: These will be used to cut your fabric smoothly without fraying the edges. - Measuring tape: This tool is essential for taking accurate measurements, ensuring your new sweatpants fit correctly. - Sewing pins: Pins will help hold your fabric in place while cutting and stitching, ensuring a clean, accurate finish. - Sewing machine or needle and thread: A sewing machine will create a sturdy, professional finish, but a needle and thread will suffice if you're comfortable with hand sewing. - Elastic or drawstring: Choose your preferred method for cinching the waist of your sweatpants. Elastic offers a firm, secure fit, while a drawstring allows for easy adjustments. Step 2: Prepare Your Fabric Lay out your old pajama pants or chosen fabric on a clean, flat surface. Smooth out any wrinkles or folds to ensure accurate measurements. If your pants have a pattern or design, position them so that their most attractive parts will be emphasized in the final product. Step 3: Trace the Template Position your sweatpants over the fabric, aligning their side seams and waistband with the fabric's grain, ensuring an even stretch in the final product. Make sure there is enough fabric around the sweatpants to account for seam allowances (typically 1/2 inch to 5/8 inch) and any additional length or width needed for your comfort. Once your sweatpants are positioned correctly, trace around them using fabric chalk or a washable fabric pen. Be sure to mark essential points like the crotch depth, waistband, and hemline, as these will be crucial for assembling your new sweatpants. Step 4: Cut the Fabric Using your fabric scissors, cut around the traced outline of your sweatpants, being careful to stay within your seam allowances. Make sure you cut through both layers of fabric simultaneously, creating two identical pieces that will form the front and back of your sweatpants. Step 5: Assemble Your Sweatpants Place the fabric pieces with their right sides together, aligning the side seams and crotch curves. Pin the edges together, starting from the waistband and working your way down to the hemline. Sew the side seams and crotch curves with a straight stitch, using your sewing machine or needle and thread. Remember to remove the pins as you sew to avoid damaging your sewing machine or needle. Step 6: Add the Waistband Measure your waist and cut a piece of elastic or a drawstring to match, ensuring it has enough stretch to fit comfortably. Fold the top edge of the sweatpants over to create a waistband channel, making sure it's wide enough to accommodate the elastic or drawstring. Sew along the bottom edge of the channel, leaving a small opening through which you can insert your elastic or drawstring. Step 7: Hem the Legs Try on your sweatpants and determine your desired length, folding up the leg hems accordingly. Pin the hems in place and sew along the folded edge to secure them. Step 8: Final Touches Finish up your project by inserting the elastic or drawstring through the waistband channel, then secure it using a safety pin or by sewing the ends together. Wear your newly-created sweatpants with pride, knowing you've transformed something old into a trendy, eco-friendly loungewear garment. Conclusion Repurposing old pajama pants into stylish and comfortable sweatpants is not just a creative way to refresh your wardrobe, but also an opportunity to participate in sustainable fashion practices. By following the simple steps outlined in this article, you'll breathe new life into an old garment, reduce textile waste, and create a unique outfit perfect for lounging at home. So, get started on your eco-friendly loungewear project and enjoy a cozy, guilt-free relaxation experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Once is a 2007 Irish romantic musical drama film written and directed by John Carney. The film stars Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova as two struggling musicians in Dublin, Ireland. Hansard and Irglova had previously performed music as the Swell Season, and composed and performed the film's original songs. Once spent years in development with the Irish Film Board and was made for a budget of EUR112,000. A rough cut of the film was previewed on 15 July 2006 at the Galway Film Fleadh, but the film was subsequently turned down by several prestigious European film festivals. However, once finished, it secured spots at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival on 20 January 2007 and the Dublin Film Festival in February 2007, and received the audience awards at both events. The film was first released on cinema in Ireland on 23 March 2007, followed by a limited release in the United States on 16 May 2007. After its second weekend in release in the United States and Canada, the film topped the 23 May 2007 indieWIRE box office chart with nearly 31,000 average per location. As of 28 March 2009, Once has grossed nearly 9.5 million in North America and over 20 million worldwide. After 2007's box office success and critical acclaim, it won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Foreign Film. Steven Spielberg was quoted as saying \\"A little movie called Once gave me enough inspiration to last the rest of the year\\". When informed of Spielberg's comments, director John Carney told Sky News, \\"in the end of the day, he's just a guy with a beard\\". At the time of this interview, Carney himself was also wearing a beard. The song \\"Falling Slowly\\" won the 2007 Academy Award for Best Original Song. The nomination's eligibility for the Oscar was initially questioned, as versions of the song had been released on The Cost and The Swell Season albums, but this was resolved before the voting for the award took place. The AMPAS music committee satisfied themselves that the song had indeed been written for the film and determined that, in the course of the film's protracted production, the composers had \\"played the song in some venues that were deemed inconsequential enough to not change the song's eligibility\\".Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What place did it place on the box office charts?","completion":"The film placed at the top of the 23 May 2007 indieWIRE box office chart.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase? from the following article ? Nigel Reuben Rook Williams (15 July 1944 – 21 April 1992) was an English conservator and expert on the restoration of ceramics and glass. From 1961 until his death he worked at the British Museum, where he became the Chief Conservator of Ceramics and Glass in 1983. There his work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase. Joining as an assistant at age 16, Williams spent his entire career, and most of his life, at the British Museum. He was one of the first people to study conservation, not yet recognised as a profession, and from an early age was given responsibility over high-profile objects. In the 1960s he assisted with the re-excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, and in his early- to mid-twenties he conserved many of the objects found therein: most notably the Sutton Hoo helmet, which occupied a year of his time. He likewise reconstructed other objects from the find, including the shield, drinking horns, and maplewood bottles. The \\"abiding passion of his life\\" was ceramics, and the 1970s and 1980s gave Williams ample opportunities in that field. After nearly 31,000 fragments of shattered Greek vases were found in 1974 amidst the wreck of HMS Colossus, Williams set to work piecing them together. The process was televised, and turned him into a television personality. A decade later, in 1988 and 1989, Williams's crowning achievement came when he took to pieces the Portland Vase, one of the most famous glass objects in the world, and put it back together. The reconstruction was again televised for a BBC programme, and as with the Sutton Hoo helmet, took nearly a year to complete. Williams died at age 47 of a heart attack while in Aqaba, Jordan, where he was working on a British Museum excavation. The Ceramics & Glass group of the Institute of Conservation awards a biennial prize in his honour, recognising his significant contributions in the field of conservation.

For clarity, let me provide answers to both scenarios separately: 1. In the context of a star's life cycle, adding or throwing away materials does not apply to the process. Stars like red giants go through predetermined stages of their life cycles, which are driven by internal nuclear fusion and gravitational forces. The inner core becoming smaller (or becoming a white dwarf) is simply a natural progression in the life cycle of a star and is unaffected by external materials being added or removed. 2. In the context of waste management on Earth, assuming \\"items thrown away that can be reused\\" refers to waste generation and resource consumption. In this context, increased waste generation has no direct effect on the life cycle of a star as mentioned in the process. The perturbation mentioned would not influence the second effect (high core temperatures) in the star's life cycle, as these two scenarios are not related. So, in the context of a star's life cycle and how it is driven by internal processes, the answer is \\"no effect\\" when considering the scenario of waste generation on Earth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On August 16, Joshua Witt claimed he had been attacked outside a restaurant in Sheridan, Colo., by a black man in his twenties because his haircut made him look like a neo-Nazi, the Denver Channel reports. Witt, who posted about the supposed incident on Facebook, told police he managed to block the attack and received a defensive wound on his hand.

He was the only child of Italian immigrants Antonino Martino \\"Marty\\" Sinatra and Natalina \\"Dolly\\" Garaventa. Sinatra weighed 13.5 pounds (6.1 kg) at birth and had to be delivered with the aid of forceps, which caused severe scarring to his left cheek, neck, and ear, and perforated his ear drum, damage that remained for life. Due to his injuries at birth, his baptism at St. Francis Church in Hoboken was delayed until April 2, 1916. Fred Zinnemann's From Here to Eternity deals with the tribulations of three soldiers, played by Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, and Sinatra, stationed on Hawaii in the months leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Sinatra had long been desperate to find a film role which would bring him back into the spotlight, and Columbia Pictures boss Harry Cohn had been inundated by appeals from people across Hollywood to give Sinatra a chance to star as \\"Maggio\\" in the film. During production, Montgomery Clift became a close friend, and Sinatra later professed that he \\"learned more about acting from him than anybody I ever knew before\\". After several years of critical and commercial decline, his Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor win helped him regain his position as the top recording artist in the world. His performance also won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture. The Los Angeles Examiner wrote that Sinatra is \\"simply superb, comical, pitiful, childishly brave, pathetically defiant\\", commenting that his death scene is \\"one of the best ever photographed\\". In 1954 Sinatra starred opposite Doris Day in the musical film Young at Heart, and earned critical praise for his performance as a psychopathic killer posing as an FBI agent opposite Sterling Hayden in the film noir Suddenly. Sinatra was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his role as a heroin addict in The Man With The Golden Arm (1955). After roles in Guys and Dolls, and The Tender Trap, Sinatra was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his role as hospital orderly in Stanley Kramer's debut picture, Not as a Stranger. During production, Sinatra got drunk with Robert Mitchum and Broderick Crawford and trashed Kramer's dressing room. Kramer vowed to never hire Sinatra again at the time, and later regretted casting him as a Spanish guerrilla leader in The Pride and the Passion (1957). In 1956 Sinatra featured alongside Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly in High Society for MGM, earning a reported 250,000 for the picture. The public rushed to the cinemas to see Sinatra and Crosby together on-screen, and it ended up earning over 13 million at the box office, becoming one of the highest-grossing pictures of 1956. In 1957, Sinatra starred opposite Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak in George Sidney's Pal Joey, for which he won for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Santopietro considers the scene in which Sinatra sings \\"The Lady Is a Tramp\\" to Hayworth to have been the finest moment of his film career. He next portrayed comedian Joe E. Lewis in The Joker Is Wild; the song \\"All the Way\\" won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. By 1958 Sinatra was one of the ten biggest box office draws in the United States, appearing with Dean Martin and Shirley MacLaine in Vincente Minnelli's Some Came Running and Kings Go Forth with Tony Curtis and Natalie Wood. \\"High Hopes\\", sung by Sinatra in the Frank Capra comedy, A Hole in the Head (1959), won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, and became a chart hit, lasting on the Hot 100 for 17 weeks.

What is the answer to this question? who implemented an economic embargo in 1807 in an effort to avoid war?","completion":"The economic embargo implemented in 1807 was known as the Embargo Act, and it was adopted by the United States in an effort to avoid war. The then President of the United States, Thomas Jefferson, was the one responsible for proposing and implementing this policy. The primary goal of the Embargo Act was to protect American interests by avoiding military conflicts, especially with the European powers like Britain and France. At the time, both Britain and France were engaged in the Napoleonic Wars, which stretched from 1803 to 1815. As part of their war strategies, both nations had imposed trade restrictions on neutral countries, including the United States. The American economy relied heavily on international trade, and these restrictions were inflicting significant losses to American merchants. Furthermore, British Royal Navy's practice of impressment, or the forceful enlistment of American sailors, was another major concern for the US government. The Embargo Act of 1807 was designed to exert economic pressure on the European powers in order to force them to change their policies and respect American neutrality. The act prohibited American ships from engaging in international trade, effectively banning exports and imports. The hope was that by cutting off trade with the United States, the economies of Britain and France would suffer, and they would be compelled to lift their trade restrictions and cease the impressment of American sailors. Unfortunately, the Embargo Act did not achieve the desired results for the United States. Instead of compelling the European powers to change their policies, the embargo ended up hurting the American economy more than anticipated. American merchants were severely impacted by the loss of international trade, and the effects of the embargo were felt across various sectors of the economy. The act led to widespread smuggling, protests, and discontent among the American public. Due to the intense economic fallout and widespread opposition, the Embargo Act was eventually repealed in 1809 through the passage of the Non-Intercourse Act, which reopened trade with all nations except Britain and France. The embargo's failure to achieve its intended objectives played a role in pushing the United States closer to the War of 1812 against Britain. In summary, the Embargo Act of 1807 was implemented by President Thomas Jefferson in an effort to avoid war by using economic pressure against Britain and France. However, it didn't achieve the expected results and instead, led to significant economic consequences for the United States. The act was eventually repealed in 1809, and the unresolved issues between the US and the European powers played a role in the outbreak of the War of 1812."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Garry rides into an Indian reservation and finds himself in the middle of a conflict between a cattle owner and some homesteaders. He meets cattle owner John Lufton, and eventually his daughters Amy and Carol. The Luftons suspect that Garry is on Riling's side and are initially hostile, especially Amy. Garry readily admits that he is going to work for his friend. Riling tells Garry that he and Indian agent Jake Pindalest have devised an elaborate scheme to force Lufton into selling his herd cheaply. Pindalest has gotten the government to order Lufton to remove his cattle from the reservation in a week. Meanwhile, Riling has organized the homesteaders into blocking the move, conning them into believing that he is working in their best interests. With no other option, Lufton would have to sell his herd at bargain prices or lose everything. Lufton would never sell to Riling, but he would to a stranger like Garry. Pindalest would then see that the government buys the herd at an inflated price. Garry would get 10,000 for his part in the swindle. Lufton manages to outsmart Riling and move his herd unimpeded, but Riling and his men stampede and scatter the cattle back onto the reservation. It would take several days to gather the herd, more time than Lufton has before the deadline. Garry becomes disgusted when a man is killed in the stampede, and he switches sides. Amy still does not trust him. She suspects Garry of betraying the contents of a letter to Riling, unaware that Carol is enamored with Riling and is the one passing information to him.

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words. Collaborative ltering is an e ective recommendation technique wherein the preference of an individual can potentially be predicted based on preferences of other members. Early algorithms often relied on the strong locality in the preference data, that is, it is enough to predict preference of a user on a particular item based on a small subset of other users with similar tastes or of other items with similar properties. More recently, dimensionality reduction techniques have proved to be equally competitive, and these are based on the co-occurrence patterns rather than locality. This paper explores and extends a probabilistic model known as Boltzmann Machine for collaborative ltering tasks. It seamlessly integrates both the similarity and cooccurrence in a principled manner. In particular, we study parameterisation options to deal with the ordinal nature of the preferences, and propose a joint modelling of both the user-based and item-based processes. Experiments on moderate and large-scale movie recommendation show that our framework rivals existing well-known methods.

The main sensation associated with the parietal lobe is somatosensation, meaning the general sensations associated with the body. Posterior to the central sulcus is the postcentral gyrus, the primary somatosensory cortex, which is identified as Brodmann’s areas 1, 2, and 3. All of the tactile senses are processed in this area, including touch, pressure, tickle, pain, itch, and vibration, as well as more general senses of the body such as proprioception and kinesthesia, which are the senses of body position and movement, respectively. Anterior to the central sulcus is the frontal lobe, which is primarily associated with motor functions. The precentral gyrus is the primary motor cortex. Cells from this region of the cerebral cortex are the upper motor neurons that instruct cells in the spinal cord to move skeletal muscles. Anterior to this region are a few areas that are associated with planned movements. The premotor area is responsible for thinking of a movement to be made. The frontal eye fields are important in eliciting eye movements and in attending to visual stimuli. Broca’s area is responsible for the production of language, or controlling movements responsible for speech; in the vast majority of people, it is located only on the left side. Anterior to these regions is the prefrontal lobe, which serves cognitive functions that can be the basis of personality, short-term memory, and consciousness. The prefrontal lobotomy is an outdated mode of treatment for personality disorders (psychiatric conditions) that profoundly affected the personality of the patient.

Article: \\"Life is speeding up. Everyone is getting unwell.\\" This may sound like something someone would say today. But in fact, an unknown person who lived in Rome in AD 53 wrote it. We all love new inventions. They are exciting, amazing and can even change our lives. But have all these developments really improved the quality of our lives? Picture this. You're rushing to finish your homework on the computer. Your mobile phone rings, a QQ message from your friend appears on the screen, the noise from the television is getting louder and louder. Suddenly the computer goes blank and you lose all your work. Now you have to stay up all night to get it done. How happy do you feel? Inventions have speeded up our lives so much that they often leave up feeling stressed and tired. Why do you think people who live far away from noisy cities, who have no telephones, no cars, not even any electricity often seem to be happier? Perhaps because they live simpler lives. One family in the UK went \\"back in time\\" to see what life was like without all the inventions we have today. The grandparents, with their daughter, and grandsons Benjamin, 10 and Thomas, 7, spent nine weeks in a 1940s house. They had no washing machine, microwave , computer or mobile phones. The grandmother, Lyn, said, \\"The more things you have, the more difficult life becomes.\\" The boys said they fought less. Probably, they said, because there was less to fight over, such as their computer. Benjamin also noticed that his grandmother had changed from being a \\"trendy , beer-drinking granny\\", to one who cooked things. Question: The passage is mainly about _ .

The growing field of \\"music treatment\\" is presenting increasing amounts of proof that point to the great powers of music. Emotional benefits The right song can put anybody in a better state. Most people turn to certain songs to make them feel better. The main reason behind this is that music can express our feelings better than any other medium. In addition, we have favorite songs for particular situations because we turn to the music which has the best effect on us. Music and exercise Have you ever noticed how out of breath you get when listening to an exciting song while doing exercises at the gym? It has been suggested that exciting music can actually increase muscle tension , while light music does the opposite. It has also been proved that music can improve motor skills. An experiment done on a group of pupils proved that children learning basic motor skills such as throwing ,catching and jumping while listening to music did better than those with no music. Chronic pain relief Music also has the ability to reduce chronic pain. In fact, according to a paper published in the Journal of Advanced Nursing, music can reduce chronic pain by 21%. The paper reports that 60 patients in an experiment were divided into two groups--one group listened to music, and the other did not. The results showed that people who listened to music for an hour each day for a week improved physically and psychologically while those who did not listen to music did not.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own. I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.

The opening up of information to the public encourages further research and development Come up with some evidence to support this claim.","completion":"There is ample evidence to support the claim that opening up information to the public encourages further research and development. By allowing open access to information, resources, and data, a larger group of individuals, organizations, and institutions can actively engage in the research process, leading to increased collaboration, faster progress, and improved quality of the outcomes. Here are some significant examples and reasons that support this assertion. 1. The Human Genome Project: One of the most notable illustrations of the benefits of open access to information is the Human Genome Project (HGP). This international research effort aimed to map and sequence all 20,000-25,000 protein-coding genes in the human genome and made the results openly available to the global scientific community. As a result, researchers have been able to use this information to advance in areas such as personalized medicine, identification of predispositions to diseases, and the development of new treatments and genetic tests. 2. Open-access journals and scholarly communication: Open-access academic journals like PLOS ONE and BioMed Central have revolutionized the way scholarly research is shared among scientists and the public. By removing the paywalls and restrictions on access to research findings, open-access publishing has led to increased citations, interdisciplinary collaboration, and faster dissemination of findings. This accelerates the pace of scientific advancement and allows for more significant progress in various research fields. 3. Collaborative platforms and data sharing: Platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and the Open Science Framework have enabled researchers to share their code, research methodologies, and data sets with others worldwide. This sharing leads to increased transparency, improved reproducibility, and more robust research findings. It also makes it easier for researchers to build upon pre-existing work, leading to more rapid progress in research and development. 4. Openness encourages innovation: The release of the World Wide Web's source code by Tim Berners-Lee and CERN in 1993 is a prime example of how openness can spur innovation. By making the underlying technology freely available to the public, countless resources, platforms, and technological advancements were built on top of this foundation, including the emergence of e-commerce, social media, and countless online applications. 5. Citizen science and the crowd sourcing of research: Opening information to the public allows non-experts to participate in scientific research and development actively. Numerous citizen science projects now enable people to contribute to research in diverse areas such as astronomy, biodiversity conservation, and climate change. Examples include Zooniverse, which enlists volunteers to help analyze massive datasets, and Foldit, a video game designed to engage the public in solving complex protein folding problems. These initiatives tap into the power of collective intelligence to accelerate scientific progress. 6. Open educational resources and online learning platforms: Open educational resources (OER) and online learning platforms such as Coursera, edX, and MIT OpenCourseWare provide free access to high-quality educational materials and courses. This accessibility allows anyone with an internet connection to learn and develop their skills, fostering a culture of continuous learning that supports research and development. 7. Public-private partnerships: Sharing information and knowledge between public and private organizations can lead to increased collaboration and innovation. Many industries, such as pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and renewable energy, benefit from research being openly accessible, leading to the exchange of ideas, joint ventures, and faster progress towards shared goals. In conclusion, opening up information to the public promotes research and development in several ways, driving innovation and accelerating progress in various fields. This openness fosters collaboration, facilitates the sharing and building upon prior knowledge, enables widespread access to educational resources, and engages the public in the research process. By embracing the open access to information, we can collectively contribute to a more innovative and informed future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Ahmet Ertegun (, Turkish spelling: Ahmet Ertegun ([ah'met erte'jyn]); (July 31 [O.S. 18 July] 1923 - December 14, 2006) was a Turkish-American businessman, songwriter and philanthropist. He was best known as the co-founder and president of Atlantic Records, and for discovering and championing many leading rhythm and blues and rock musicians. He also wrote classic blues and pop songs, and served as the chairman of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and museum, located in Cleveland, Ohio. Ertegun has been described as \\"one of the most significant figures in the modern recording industry.\\" In 1946 Ertegun became friends with Herb Abramson, a dental student and A&R man for National Records, and they decided to start a new independent record label for gospel, jazz, and R&B music. Financed by family dentist Dr. Vahdi Sabit, they formed Atlantic Records in September 1947 in New York City. The first recording sessions took place that November. In 1949, after 22 unsuccessful record releases, including the first recordings by Professor Longhair, Atlantic had its first major hit with Stick McGhee's \\"Drinkin' Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee\\". The company expanded through the 1950s, with Jerry Wexler and, later, Ertegun's brother Nesuhi on board as partners. Hit artists that recorded on Atlantic included Ruth Brown, Big Joe Turner, The Clovers, The Drifters, The Coasters and Ray Charles. Like the Erteguns, many independent record executives were from immigrant backgrounds, including the Bihari and the Chess brothers. The Ertegun brothers brought a jazz sensibility (and many jazz artists) into R&B, successfully combining blues and jazz styles from around the country. Atlantic helped challenge the primacy of the major labels of the time by discovering, developing, and nurturing new talent. It became the premier rhythm and blues label in a few years and, with the help of innovative engineer/producer Tom Dowd, set new standards in producing high-quality recordings. In 1957 Atlantic was among the first labels to record in stereo, and in 1958 introduced 4-track and later, 8-track taped multitrack recording. Ertegun himself wrote a number of classic blues songs, including \\"Chains of Love\\" and \\"Sweet Sixteen\\", under the pseudonym \\"A. Nugetre\\" (\\"Ertegun\\" backwards). The songs were given expression first by Big Joe Turner and continued in B.B. King's repertoire. \\"Chains of Love\\" was a popular hit for Pat Boone. He also wrote the Ray Charles hit \\"Mess Around\\", with lyrics that drew heavily on \\"Pinetop's Boogie Woogie\\". He was briefly listed as \\"Nuggy\\" in the credits before changing to \\"A. Nugetre\\". Ertegun was part of the shouting choral group on Turner's \\"Shake, Rattle and Roll\\", along with Wexler and songwriter Jesse Stone.

Answer the following question: Information: - A bulletin board system, or BBS, is a computer server running software that allows users to connect to the system using a terminal program. Once logged in, the user can perform functions such as uploading and downloading software and data, reading news and bulletins, and exchanging messages with other users through email, public message boards, and sometimes via direct chatting. Many BBSes also offer on-line games, in which users can compete with each other, and BBSes with multiple phone lines often provide chat rooms, allowing users to interact with each other. Bulletin board systems were in many ways a precursor to the modern form of the World Wide Web, social networks and other aspects of the Internet. Low-cost, high-performance modems drove the use of online services and BBSes through the early 1990s. \\"Infoworld\\" estimated there were 60,000 BBSes serving 17 million users in the United States alone in 1994, a collective market much larger than major online services like CompuServe. - In the United States, a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is a geographical region with a relatively high population density at its core and close economic ties throughout the area. Such regions are neither legally incorporated as a city or town would be, nor are they legal administrative divisions like counties or separate entities such as states. As such, the precise definition of any given metropolitan area can vary with the source. A typical metropolitan area is centered on a single large city that wields substantial influence over the region (e.g., Chicago or Atlanta). However, some metropolitan areas contain more than one large city with no single municipality holding a substantially dominant position (e.g., DallasFort Worth metroplex, Norfolk-Virginia Beach (Hampton Roads), RiversideSan Bernardino (Inland Empire) or MinneapolisSaint Paul). - Shortwave radio is radio transmission using shortwave frequencies, generally , just above the medium wave AM broadcast band. - A modem (modulator-demodulator) is a network hardware device that modulates one or more carrier wave signals to encode digital information for transmission and demodulates signals to decode the transmitted information. The goal is to produce a signal that can be transmitted easily and decoded to reproduce the original digital data. Modems can be used with any means of transmitting analog signals, from light emitting diodes to radio. A common type of modem is one that turns the digital data of a computer into modulated electrical signal for transmission over telephone lines and demodulated by another modem at the receiver side to recover the digital data. - Indiana is a U.S. state located in the midwestern and Great Lakes regions of North America. Indiana is the 38th largest by area and the 16th most populous of the 50 United States. Its capital and largest city is Indianapolis. Indiana was admitted to the United States as the 19th U.S. state on December 11, 1816. - IndianapolisCarmelAnderson or Indianapolis metropolitan area is an 11-county metropolitan area in the U.S. state of Indiana, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget. The metropolitan area is situated in Central Indiana, within the American Midwest. - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America. With over 2.7 million residents, it is the most populous city in the state of Illinois and the Midwestern United States, and the county seat of Cook County. The Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland, has nearly 10 million people and is the third-largest in the U.S. - Indianapolis (pronounced ), is the capital and largest city of the U.S. state of Indiana and the seat of Marion County. It is in the East North Central region of the Midwestern United States. With an estimated population of 853,173 in 2015, Indianapolis is the second most populous city in the Midwest, after Chicago, and 14th largest in the U.S. The city is the economic and cultural center of the Indianapolis metropolitan area, home to 2 million people, the 34th most populous metropolitan statistical area in the U.S. Its combined statistical area ranks 26th, with 2.4 million inhabitants. Indianapolis covers , making it the 16th largest city by land area in the U.S. - The term chat room, or chatroom, is primarily used to describe any form of synchronous conferencing, occasionally even asynchronous conferencing. The term can thus mean any technology ranging from real-time online chat and online interaction with strangers (e.g., online forums) to fully immersive graphical social environments. - InfoWorld (formerly The Intelligent Machines Journal) is an information technology media business. Founded in 1978, it began as a monthly magazine. In 2007, it transitioned to a Web-only publication. Its parent company is International Data Group, and its sister publications include \\"Macworld\\" and \\"PC World\\". InfoWorld is based in San Francisco, with contributors and supporting staff based across the United States. - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. - The Midwestern United States, also referred to as the American Midwest or simply the Midwest, is one of the four geographic regions defined by the United States Census Bureau, occupying the northern central part of the United States of America. It was officially named the North Central region by the Census Bureau until 1984. - CompuServe (CompuServe Information Service, also known by its acronym CIS) was the first major commercial online service provider in the United States. It dominated the field during the 1980s and remained a major influence through the mid-1990s. At its peak in the early 1990s, CIS was known for its online chat system, message forums covering a variety of topics, extensive software libraries for most computer platforms, and a series of popular online games, notably MegaWars III and Island of Kesmai. They are also known for their introduction of the GIF format for pictures, and CIS was a very popular GIF exchange mechanism. - The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet. English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland. - Electronic mail, or email, is a method of exchanging digital messages between people using digital devices such as computers, tablets and mobile phones. Email first entered substantial use in the 1960s and by the mid-1970s had taken the form now recognized as email. Email operates across computer networks, which in the 2010s is primarily the Internet. Some early email systems required the author and the recipient to both be online at the same time, in common with instant messaging. Today's email systems are based on a store-and-forward model. Email servers accept, forward, deliver, and store messages. Neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously; they need to connect only briefly, typically to a mail server or a webmail interface, for as long as it takes to send or receive messages. - Medium wave (MW) is the part of the medium frequency (MF) radio band used mainly for AM radio broadcasting. For Europe the MW band ranges from 526.5 kHz to 1606.5 kHz, using channels spaced every 9 kHz, and in North America an extended MW broadcast band ranges from 525 kHz to 1705 kHz, using 10 kHz spaced channels. - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form. - A combined statistical area (CSA) is composed of adjacent metropolitan (MSA) and micropolitan statistical areas (µSA) in the United States and Puerto Rico that can demonstrate economic or social linkage. The United States Office of Management and Budget defines a CSA as consisting of various combinations of adjacent metropolitan and micropolitan areas with economic ties measured by commuting patterns. These areas that combine retain their own designations as metropolitan or micropolitan statistical areas within the larger combined statistical area. - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers. - Linda Thompson ( April 26 , 1953 -- May 10 , 2009 ) was an American attorney , filmmaker , and the founder of the American Justice Federation . In 1993 , she quit her job as a lawyer in Indianapolis , Indiana to start the American Justice Federation , a non-profit group that promoted pro-gun causes through a shortwave radio program , a computer bulletin board system , and sales of its newsletter and videos . - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).

What is the answer for the question: What year did the composer in a creative struggle perform a concert? from the following article ? With the outbreak of World War I on 28 July 1914, The Oceanides languished. Wartime politics being what they were, Sibelius's music was seldom played outside the Nordic countries and the United States: in Germany, there was little demand for the music of an \\"enemy national\\", while in Russia, Finns were viewed as being \\"less than loyal subjects of the Tsar\\". In any case, many of Sibelius's works had been printed by German publishing houses, a detail that harmed Sibelius's reputation not only in Russia, but also Britain and the United States. According to Tawaststjerna, the war plunged Sibelius into a state of melancholy and creative struggle (the Fifth and Sixth symphonies were in the process of simultaneous gestation at this time). His response was to retreat into near solitude: he abstained from attending and giving concerts and neglected his circle of friends, and he imagined himself \\"forgotten and ignored, a lonely beacon of light in a deepening winter darkness\\".Sibelius was not easily stirred from his exile; friend and fellow composer Wilhelm Stenhammar, then Artistic Director and chief conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, wrote to Sibelius repeatedly to persuade him to conduct a concert of his works in Gothenburg. Believing himself duty-bound to premiere a \\"major work\\" in Sweden, such as a symphony, Sibelius—to Stenhammar's chagrin—delayed each scheduled trip. He withdrew from planned concerts for March 1914, writing to Stenhammar, \\"My conscience forces me to this. But when I have some new works ready next year, as I hope, it would give me great joy to perform them in Gothenburg\\". New arrangements were made for February 1915, but these, too, Sibelius canceled in December 1914. In the end, the indefatigable Stenhammar prevailed and new concerts were set for March 1915 (\\"I see yet again your great sympathy for my music. I shall come\\".).Stenhammar's efforts were rewarded with the European premiere of The Oceanides. For Sibelius, it was an opportunity to once again be an \\"artist on tour\\", feeding...

Not likely It's no secret that the Republican party is short on heroes at the moment. Ted Cruz's recent audition fell a little flat (his voice and hair are probably more suited to a Pixar villain, anyway). Marco Rubio seems to have gotten his cape stuck in the establishment escalator. Chris Christie is still at the mercy of a vigorous training schedule, and Jeb Bush hasn't even entered the phone booth to change. That leaves Rand Paul. Rand-Man! Able to leap tall filibusters (real ones) in a single bound! Lusty defender of the spied-upon and drone-targeted, the casual drug user and reluctant interventionist! For a while, he even had a costumed sidekick: \\"the Southern Avenger\\", a pro-secessionist, anti-Lincoln former talk radio host turned social media consultant known to occasionally don a Lucha Libre-style confederate flag mask. And that kind of sums up the strengths and weaknesses of Rand Paul for president. He comes with a bright and shiny set of opinions on marquee issues that are just far enough ahead of the curve to seem brave. He also comes with the baggage of a libertarian movement that has, for generations, been a home to passive-aggressive racism and medium-to-high levels of kookiness. He talks a good game on the general principles of civil rights and liberty, but policy specifics (and staffing) are his kryptonite. True, that could be said of almost any politician who can string together enough sentences and Super Pacs to make it to the Senate. Thus far, the main argument for Paul becoming a top-tier candidate in 2016 seems to be, \\"Why not?\\" For his part, Paul is doing all the things a potential candidate needs to do to be considered possible: showing up in Iowa and New Hampshire, mostly, but also proposing flashy but doomed legislation (\\"Air Travelers' Bill of Rights\\", anyone?) and standing in front of as many cameras as possible (he's in the October Vogue). But, for real, what are the odds? A few months ago, Nate Silver slogged through some high-level scenarios that could produce a Rand nomination and pronounced the less-than-ringing endorsement of \\"better than the 20-to-1 numbers that some bookmakers have placed against him\\". Today, those odds seem to have improved. Rand's anti-drone filibuster endeared him to many liberals disenchanted with Obama's surveillance state and his anti-interventionism resonates well with a war-weary and suspicious American public. What's more, the Tea Party's floundering and steady flow of crappy spokesfolk (Michele Bachmann! Herman Cain!) has only made it more vulnerable for the right person to harness it. Though support for the leaderless movement is down to 22%, from a high of 32% in 2010, getting a lock on almost a quarter of potential conservative voters who claim dissatisfaction with the traditional GOP could be the golden ticket for a different kind of candidate. Rand stands a better chance than most at unlocking that support. In imagining a Paul presidency, that's about as far as I get … before the reality bells start ringing. His admirable support for privacy rights and for ending the drug war, while attractive to many on the left, simply could not outweigh his extreme – and extremely unpopular – opinions on other civil rights issues: in March, Paul proposed the Life at Conception Act, which would effectively outlaw all abortions and end the protections of Roe v Wade by claiming that Congress has power under the 14th amendment to declare when life begins. Fifty-two percent of Americans believe that abortion should be legal in \\"some circumstances\\", and another 26% say it should be legal in \\"all circumstances\\". And while a majority of Republicans (63%) believes that abortion should be illegal, candidates have paid a high cost for total inflexibility on the issue. In the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre, Rand introduced legislation to \\"nullify\\" Obama's executive orders on guns despite their popularity with the public. Rand used the language of libertarian political philosophy to justify the bill – \\"we will nullify anything the president does that smacks of legislation\\" – an argument that liberals and moderates burned by Bush's heavy-handed executive privilege might like. But how to separate that feisty populism from the gun policies Rand does support? They are straight-from-the-NRA loony tunes. He wants \\"concealed carry\\" for teachers and he has fundraised off a tinfoil-wrapped conspiracy that the UN is coming for American's guns. A letter sent under his name last May went full black-helicopter: Ultimately, UN bureaucrats will stop at nothing to register, ban and CONFISCATE firearms owned by private citizens like YOU. So far, the gun-grabbers have successfully kept many of their schemes under wraps. But looking at previous attempts by the UN to pass global gun control, you and I can get a good idea of what's likely in the works. On economic issues, Rand has some schemes of his own, like a de facto halving of the top tax rate via a 17% flat tax. He would double-down on the kind of 1%er-friendly proposal that worked out so well for Mitt Romney. The flat tax is also Rand's overture to the LGBT community: prior to the supreme court's Defense of Marriage Act (Doma) decision, Rand tried to shade his affirmative belief in \\"traditional marriage\\" by asserting that his flat tax \\"wouldn't have marriage as part of the tax code\\". Getting the government out of the marriage business is a nice idea, but given the entrenchment of marriage in all facets of our civil society, I'm not sure \\"here's a flat tax\\" cuts it for same-sex couples: sorry about your oppression, have a regressive policy proposal! Paul's budget proposal, presumably the one he would run on, also eliminates the departments of Housing and Urban Development, Energy, Commerce and, most radically, the Department of Education. He might find sympathy among those with a generalized distaste for government spending, but under the purely philosophical or economic reasoning are Paul's uglier motives (the economic motives are already pretty ugly, by the way). As he put it in a debate during the Kentucky Senate race: I don't like the idea of somebody in Washington deciding that Susie has two mommies is an appropriate family situation and should be taught to my kindergartener at school. That's what happens when we let things get to a federal level. But, hey, flat tax, am I right? The list of unworkable and/or unwinnable policies goes on. On the flip side of his anti-military intervention rhetoric is his opposition to foreign aid for anyone. He's fond of saying that the US \\"shouldn't give a penny to those who would burn our flag\\" or persecute Christians, but that rhetoric dodges key facts: first, the No 1 recipient of US aid is Israel; and second, the money that goes to Iraq, Pakistan, and Egypt likely keeps the number of flags burned down. But let's try to put all that aside. Wait, I can't! Trying to seriously investigate what a Paul presidency would bring carries with it a suspension of disbelief that makes all things possible. When you talk to libertarians about how Paul might actually manage to push his radical policies through, were he to become president, they say things like, \\"use the bully pulpit\\" (works so well for Obama) and \\"ride on the vast wave of support that brought him to office\\". In other words, if you're living in the America that elects Rand Paul, getting the votes to privatize Medicare (actual Paul proposal) is the least of your worries. You'll be too busy dodging cars on the mythical Nafta superhighway (an actual Paul belief). The real asset Rand Paul brings to the table is a certain brittle charisma and veneer of normalcy. He has played nicer with the party establishment than Cruz. He has engaged, awkwardly, with minority voters – though his actual policies are a mismatch with both Hispanics and African Americans. Rand Paul also benefits greatly from the counter-example set by his fiery and diminutive father, Ron, whose unfortunate sartorial choices and blatant wingnuttery make Rand seem both suave and moderate by comparison. His suits seem to fit him and he does not, for example, talk loudly about hoarding gold. A Center for Responsive Politics investigation found that Rand is less Rumpelstiltskinian than his father, in practice as well as rhetoric; while the elder Paul has north of 500,000 invested in gold, Rand's largely paper holdings are \\"more in line with the general public\\". And if the Southern Avenger looms as one threat to Paul's candidacy, this undercover normalcy is another. Paul is libertarian enough to attract some of the fringe; indeed, he is the fringe. But when it comes to risking his own skin, he plays it safe. He is not a superhero, he is a costumed non-adventurer. Whether this combination of libertarian flair and basic conservatism, in a personal sense, is his salvation (exactly the kind of mold-breaker the GOP needs!) or his downfall (not a real Republican, or real anything) remains to be seen. I suspect that, eventually, he will have to lean to one side or another. At that point, he will cease to be a unicorn and become just another dark horse. Summary:","completion":"The Republican party is currently looking for a candidate, and Rand Paul has been mentioned. While Rand Paul shows promise in certain areas, such as his support for privacy rights and for ending the drug war, he also has some extremely unpopular opinions on other civil rights issues. He has proposed ideas like the Life at Conception Act, which would effectively outlaw all abortions, and introduced legislation to \\"nullify\\" Obama's executive orders on guns. His economic proposals aren't popular either, with plans to halve the top tax rate and eliminate important departments like Education, Housing, and Urban Development. In addition, he has also been contradictory in some of his stances. While Rand Paul has some positive elements, his unpopular policies and delicate balancing act of libertarianism might not be enough for the Republican party."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:What is the name of the object that the musician who married the daughter of a senior British army officer was believed to be the first to take seriously? Answer the above question based on the context below: Sir Edward William Elgar, 1st Baronet (; 2 June 1857 – 23 February 1934) was an English composer, many of whose works have entered the British and international classical concert repertoire. Among his best-known compositions are orchestral works including the Enigma Variations, the Pomp and Circumstance Marches, concertos for violin and cello, and two symphonies. He also composed choral works, including The Dream of Gerontius, chamber music and songs. He was appointed Master of the King's Musick in 1924. Although Elgar is often regarded as a typically English composer, most of his musical influences were not from England but from continental Europe. He felt himself to be an outsider, not only musically, but socially. In musical circles dominated by academics, he was a self-taught composer; in Protestant Britain, his Roman Catholicism was regarded with suspicion in some quarters; and in the class-conscious society of Victorian and Edwardian Britain, he was acutely sensitive about his humble origins even after he achieved recognition. He nevertheless married the daughter of a senior British army officer. She inspired him both musically and socially, but he struggled to achieve success until his forties, when after a series of moderately successful works his Enigma Variations (1899) became immediately popular in Britain and overseas. He followed the Variations with a choral work, The Dream of Gerontius (1900), based on a Roman Catholic text that caused some disquiet in the Anglican establishment in Britain, but it became, and has remained, a core repertory work in Britain and elsewhere. His later full-length religious choral works were well received but have not entered the regular repertory. In his fifties, Elgar composed a symphony and a violin concerto that were immensely successful. His second symphony and his cello concerto did not gain immediate public popularity and took many years to achieve a regular place in the concert repertory of British orchestras. Elgar's music came, in his later years, to be... A:","completion":"The object referred to in the question is the \\"Enigma\\" from Elgar's Enigma Variations. Sir Edward William Elgar, the English composer, married Alice Caroline Roberts, the daughter of a senior British army officer. Although Elgar faced several challenges throughout his life, including being a self-taught composer, his wife Alice played a significant role in inspiring and supporting him musically and socially. The Enigma Variations (1899) is a collection of 14 variations for orchestra and was the work that brought Elgar to prominence and popular recognition both in Britain and internationally. Each variation is a tribute to one of Elgar's friends or acquaintances, showcasing their distinct personalities and musical styles through the use of specific motifs and themes. The \\"Enigma\\" in the title refers to the unspoken theme that runs throughout the composition, which Elgar never explicitly revealed. This has led to multiple theories and mysteries surrounding the piece, with many trying to decipher the hidden meaning behind it. The Enigma Variations drew much fascination and attention, and even today, the true nature of the enigma remains a subject of speculation and discussion among musicologists and aficionados. Following the success of the Enigma Variations, Elgar continued to compose popular and renowned works, such as The Dream of Gerontius (1900), the Violin Concerto (1910), and the Cello Concerto (1919). Despite some of his later works, like the Second Symphony and the Cello Concerto, not achieving immediate public popularity, they eventually found their place in the regular repertory of British orchestras over time."},{"prompt":"Q:- past members is * herman houbrechts - origin is berchem , belgium - genre is rock - background is group_or_band - current members is * daan stuyven Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

He then wanted to compare this lever with a real world lever, which he labeled as lever B. He intended to use these levers to increase force. But I can use this background: The Table above includes the ideal mechanical advantage of each class of lever. The mechanical advantage is the factor by which a machine changes the input force. The ideal mechanical advantage is the increase or decrease in force that would occur if there were no friction to overcome in the use of the machine. Because all machines must overcome some friction, the ideal mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual mechanical advantage of the machine as it is used in the real world. What is an answer for this question: Which lever would have less friction, lever A or lever B?

But exactly how can the police GPS track a car that is moving fast? The answer to that question comes from StarChase,a new police technology being used by a small but growing number of law enforcement agencies.It allows the police to fire 4.5-inch glue-covered GPS bullet-like projectiles from an air gun fixed in their police cars.If the GPS tracker makes contact with the escaping robber's car, it'll stick no matter how fast the vehicle is going.That way, the police will have a constant read on the car's location and heading.Aside from simply apprehending criminals,it's believed this new technology could help save lives.If the police successfully fire a GPS unit at a speeding criminal,they can pull back from a high-risk chase.Chases can be incredibly dangerous to all involved,including innocent bystanders and other drivers.Once the GPS bullet connects,there's no need for the chase any longer. Now,predictably,a GPS-loaded gun isn't cheap. Police departments need to pay about 5.000 per vehicle for the technology,and individual GPS bullets cost as much as 250 each.That may sound expensive,but remember:The alternative is often thousands of dollars in property damage,and great human cost in injury and lost life.According to Star Chase,their GPS bullet system has an apprehension rate of 80%without any report of inury or property damage.If you'd like to learn more about the StarChase system,Popular Mechanics has just published a good article about it.There's also plenty more information available at the company's website.

They boast over five hundred species of birds, and thousands of species of plants. Across the pond in England the situation is completely different. Centuries of extensive farming, industrialization, and urban sprawls have made it one of the least biodiverse place on Earth. Would the ecosystem functions be less or more stable in Nicaragua than in England? Hint: \\"There is now unequivocal evidence that biodiversity loss reduces the efficiency by which ecological communities capture biologically essential resources, produce biomass, decompose and recycle biologically essential nutrients... There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem functions through time... Diverse communities are more productive because they contain key species that have a large influence on productivity and differences in functional traits among organisms increase total resource capture... The impacts of diversity loss on ecological processes might be sufficiently large to rival the impacts of many other global drivers of environmental change... Maintaining multiple ecosystem processes at multiple places and times requires higher levels of biodiversity than does a single process at a single place and time.\\" Answer:","completion":"Considering the information provided, it is clear that biodiversity plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of ecosystem functions. Nicaragua, being one of the most biodiverse countries in the Americas, would be expected to have a more stable ecosystem as compared to England, where centuries of extensive farming, industrialization, and urban sprawls have significantly diminished its biodiversity. The rich biodiversity in Nicaragua allows for a more efficient capture of biologically essential resources, increased biomass production, effective decomposition, and recycling of essential nutrients. The wide range of species found within its ecosystems, including the impressive number of bird and plant species, contribute to a higher level of functional diversity. This diversity enables the different organisms to better perform their ecological roles, resulting in overall increased resilience and stability of the ecosystem functions. Furthermore, diverse communities like those found in Nicaragua can be more productive due to the presence of key species that have a larger influence on productivity. The variations in functional traits among organisms lead to increased total resource capture, making the ecosystem more adaptable and efficient. These diverse ecosystems not only show higher productivity but also increased stability over time. In contrast, England's low biodiversity, resulting from centuries of human activities, has led to a decrease in the efficiency of ecological processes. The loss of species and functional diversity limits the ability of the ecosystem to capture resources, produce biomass, decompose, and recycle nutrients. As a consequence, the stability of ecosystem functions in England is likely to be less robust when compared to countries like Nicaragua with richer biodiversity. Moreover, the impacts of diversity loss on ecological processes can be significant enough to rival the effects of other global drivers of environmental change. To maintain multiple ecosystem processes across different places and times, higher levels of biodiversity are necessary, as compared to sustaining a single process at one place and time. In conclusion, Nicaragua's rich biodiversity allows for a more stable ecosystem in terms of productivity, stability over time, and adaptability to changing environmental conditions. In contrast, England's significantly lower biodiversity makes its ecosystem functions less stable and less capable of addressing the challenges posed by global environmental change. Therefore, the ecosystem functions in Nicaragua would be more stable than those in England, emphasizing the importance of biodiversity conservation and restoration efforts, especially in regions facing severe biodiversity loss."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

U.S. President Donald Trump filed his annual financial disclosure form this week with the Office of Government Ethics, the U.S. government's ethics watchdog. Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million.

Italy has a rich football history, and it comes as no surprise that it played host to the European Championship finals on two separate occasions. The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) organizes the European Championship, also known as the Euros. This prestigious competition takes place every four years, bringing together the top national football teams from Europe and determining the continental champion. Italy hosted the European Championship finals for the first time in 1968. That year, the third edition of the tournament took place, and the championship was known as the UEFA European Football Championship. Italy not only hosted the competition but also won the championship. The Italian team was victorious against Yugoslavia in a 2-0 win during the replay final match, which took place at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, Italy. Following a 1-1 draw in the initial final match, the champion was determined with a replay match, which was a standard process at the time in case of a draw. In 1980, Italy once again became the host country for the European Championship finals and became the first country to have hosted the prestigious event twice. This time, the tournament saw a significant expansion in the number of participating teams. Previously, only four teams were involved in the final stage of the competition, but in 1980, the number increased to eight teams. West Germany emerged as the winner of the competition, defeating Belgium in the final match with a 2-1 score. The final was held at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, Italy. Throughout the years, Italy has maintained its strong presence in the world of football and continues to be an influential player in the sport.

Daisy Jacobs, whose The Bigger Picture is up for the best short animation Oscar, has raised more than Â£21,000 through crowd-funding site Kickstarter. The target was reached just three days after she picked up a Bafta Award on Sunday for the same film. \\"It looks lovely on my shelf sitting with other awards,\\" she said. Jacobs used two-metre painted characters in full-size sets to tell the darkly humorous story of two brothers struggling with the care of their elderly mother. Jacobs created The Bigger Picture for her masters degree in directing animation at the National Film and Television School (NFTS). The seven-minute short - which has already won some 25 awards - took six months to animate, with Jacobs and her team working six days a week, 12 hours a day. For her next film, Jacobs plans to look at the divorce boom of the 1970s and '80s. \\"It's about family. It looks at the ideas of why we drift apart and why people leave,\\" she told the BBC. \\"This will be a similar in style to The Bigger Picture - it's still life-size animation - but I've pushed myself. There's a new element to the technique.\\" While The Bigger Picture was fully funded by the NFTS - which provided the camera, lights and a large studio space - Jacobs has to find the cash to fund her new project. Hence the crowd-funding campaign, which she launched last month. \\"We need a big space for six months and that's where all the money goes,\\" she said. Most of the props will be made from damaged furniture, paper mache and cereal boxes \\"that my mum and neighbours have been collecting\\". But for now, the plans have been put on hold while Jacobs and producer Chris Hees travel to Los Angeles for the Oscars on 22 February. \\"I don't know what to expect,\\" she said. \\"I've got a dress my mum gave me. In terms of speeches - I don't really like to plan anything like that.\\" However The Bigger Pictures fares on the big night, Jacobs plans to start work on the new film \\"more or less immediately\\" when she gets back from Hollywood.

In a conversation with music journalist Bill Flanagan, published on Dylan's website, Dylan explained that the genesis of the record was when French film director Olivier Dahan asked him to supply a song for his new road movie, My Own Love Song; initially only intending to record a single track, \\"Life Is Hard,\\" \\"the record sort of took its own direction\\". Nine of the ten songs on the album are credited as co-written by Bob Dylan and Robert Hunter.The album received largely favorable reviews, although several critics described it as a minor addition to Dylan's canon of work. Andy Gill wrote in The Independent that the record \\"features Dylan in fairly relaxed, spontaneous mood, content to grab such grooves and sentiments as flit momentarily across his radar. So while it may not contain too many landmark tracks, it's one of the most naturally enjoyable albums you'll hear all year.\\"In its first week of release, the album reached number one in the Billboard 200 chart in the U.S., making Bob Dylan (67 years of age) the oldest artist to ever debut at number one on that chart. It also reached number one on the UK album chart, 39 years after Dylan's previous UK album chart topper New Morning. This meant that Dylan currently holds the record for the longest gap between solo number one albums in the UK chart.On October 13, 2009, Dylan released a Christmas album, Christmas in the Heart, comprising such Christmas standards as \\"Little Drummer Boy\\", \\"Winter Wonderland\\" and \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\". Dylan's royalties from the sale of this album will benefit the charities Feeding America in the USA, Crisis in the UK, and the World Food Programme.The album received generally favorable reviews.

In football, teams score points by getting a field goal or a touchdown. A field goal is worth 3 points and is made by kicking the ball through the uprights. A touchdown is when the team gets the ball into the opponent's end zone and is worth 6 points. Now, let's look at the game and add up the yards for both. Field goals: 1. 37-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski 2. 47-yard field goal by Nate Kaeding 3. 35-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski Total yards in field goals = 37 + 47 + 35 = 119 yards Touchdowns: 1. 4-yard touchdown run by Michael Bush 2. 1-yard touchdown run by LaDainian Tomlinson 3. 15-yard touchdown pass to Vincent Jackson 4. 57-yard touchdown pass to Louis Murphy 5. 5-yard touchdown run by Darren Sproles Total yards in touchdowns = 4 + 1 + 15 + 57 + 5 = 82 yards So, there were more yards in field goals (119 yards) than touchdowns (82 yards) in this game."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The process of inhaling air through the lungs is a fundamental biological function of living organisms, specifically in mammals like humans. This process, which involves air being brought in through the mouth, passing through the lungs, and into the bronchial tissues, is essential for the absorption of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide. The lungs then distribute the oxygen to the rest of the body, keeping cells alive and functioning. Considering the given question, if more money is made available for space programs, it will not directly affect the inhalation of air through the lungs on Earth. Space programs focus on research, exploration, and technological advancements in space-related fields.

Translate to English English:","completion":"Tariff Policy Before the beginning of the reform in the Georgian water supply and sanitation sector, tariffs for water utility enterprises were approved by local authorities, who, taking into account the difficult economic situation of the population, in most cases, set tariffs that did not cover the costs of enterprises associated with providing utility resources and services. The tariff policy in Georgia, prior to the reformation of the water supply and sanitation sector, was regulated by local authorities. These authorities were responsible for setting the rates for the water utility enterprises that provided resources and services to the population. However, due to the challenging economic situation faced by the citizens, the authorities often set the tariffs at a level that did not adequately cover the costs incurred by the enterprises in delivering these essential resources and services. As a result, the water supply and sanitation sector in Georgia faced financial difficulties, which affected the quality and reliability of the services provided. This called for a reform in the sector and a reevaluation of the tariff policy to ensure that the enterprises could sustainably cover their operational and maintenance costs while still providing affordable services to the population. The reform aimed at making adjustments in the tariff policy to allow for cost recovery, sustainability of services, and affordability for the citizens. An essential element of the reform involved making the tariff-setting process more transparent and based on economically justifiable principles. This required the involvement of various stakeholders, including governmental institutions, the water utility enterprises, and the public. The reformed tariff policy focused on several key aspects: 1. Cost recovery: The tariffs needed to be set at a level that would cover the costs of operating, maintaining, and upgrading the water supply and sanitation infrastructure. 2. Sustainability: The tariff structure should promote the long-term sustainability of the water utility enterprises by allowing them to invest in maintenance, modernization, and expansion projects. 3. Affordability: The tariffs must be affordable for the users, preventing social unrest and ensuring accessibility of the services for all citizens. 4. Transparency: The process of setting and adjusting the tariffs should be transparent and based on clearly defined criteria. 5. Inclusivity: Stakeholder involvement, including public consultations and participatory decision-making processes, should be part of the tariff-setting process. The implementation of the reformed tariff policy has led to improvements in the water supply and sanitation sector in Georgia. Although challenges remain, the changes have contributed to enhancing the financial stability of the water utility enterprises, improving the quality and reliability of the services, and ensuring that the tariffs are affordable and justifiable for the population."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Isolate the term containing the variable (m). To do this, we'll move the constant term to the other side of the equation: -3*m + 21 = 0 → -3*m = -21. Step 3: Solve for the variable (m). To find the value of m, we'll divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of m, which is -3: (-3*m)/(-3) = -21/(-3) This simplifies to: m = 7 So the answer is m = 7."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: JAKARTA Treacherous terrain in Indonesia's Papua province on Monday hampered rescuers' efforts to reach a passenger plane that crashed with 54 aboard, the latest in a string of aviation disasters in the sprawling Southeast Asian archipelago. Rescuers have yet to detect the aircraft's black boxes and news of survivors depends on a ground team now trekking slowly towards the mountainous area, the rescue official overseeing the search said. \\"If it collided into a mountain, there has never been a case of survivors. But who knows, let's wait,\\" said Major-General Heronimus Guru, operations director at Indonesia's National Search and Rescue Agency. Rescue teams arriving at the site will have to build a helipad to fly in help, Guru told a news conference in the Indonesian capital, adding that 266 people were involved in the operation, while 11 aircraft scoured the thickly forested area. As dusk falls in Papua, search operations will resume at 6.30 a.m. on Tuesday, depending on the weather. Guru displayed grainy photographs of what is believed to be the site of Sunday's crash of the Trigana Air Service ATR 42-300 plane, in the heavily forested Bintang Mountains district. Officials of Trigana, placed on the European Union's list of banned carriers since 2007 over safety or regulatory concerns, were not immediately available to respond to questions from Reuters. There were 44 adult passengers, five children and infants and five crew on the short-haul flight from Sentani Airport in Jayapura, capital of the province of Papua, south to Oksibil. All aboard were Indonesian nationals, officials have said. Earlier reports have said the aircraft was carrying cash of about 470,000 destined for remote villages, as part of an official assistance program. Poor infrastructure in Indonesia's easternmost province means that assistance money is often flown in by air, said post office spokesman Abu Sofjan. There was no suggestion the large sum of money carried on the plane was linked to the crash. Guru told reporters the cash was not a priority and confirmation of the cause of the crash would have to await an official investigation by a national transport safety panel. \\"I feel that it collided into a mountain, but let's wait for the KNKT,\\" he said, referring to the panel by its official name, the National Transportation Safety Commmittee. Erratic weather could have played a role in the crash, said another official. \\"It's the weather there, it changes all the time. In the morning it can be clear and hot, and then suddenly it rains,\\" said Sito, a communications operator with the rescue agency in Jayapura. A Super Puma helicopter crashed in the same area last year, said Sito, who goes by one name, like many Indonesians. The crashed ATR 42-300 made its first flight 27 years ago, the Aviation Safety Network says. Trigana Air Service has a fleet of 14 aircraft, aged 26.6 years on average, the airfleets.com database says. Trigana has had 14 serious incidents since it began operations in 1991, online database Aviation Safety Network says. Besides the latest crash, it has written off 10 aircraft. Indonesia has a patchy aviation safety record, with two major plane crashes in the past year. One involved an AirAsia flight that went down in the Java Sea, killing all 162 aboard. In June, more than 100 people died in the crash of a military transport plane, prompting Indonesia's president to promise a review of the ageing air force fleet. (1=13,785 rupiah) (Additional reporting by Eveline Danubrata; Writing by Nicholas Owen; Editing by John Chalmers and Clarence Fernandez) ||||| Image copyright AP Image caption The missing plane, pictured in 2010 The wreckage of an Indonesian plane which went missing with 54 people on board has been spotted in the remote western Papua region, officials say. The Trigana Air flight lost contact at 14:55 local time (05:55 GMT) on Sunday as it flew from the provincial capital, Jayapura, to the town of Oksibil. Indonesia's transport minister said the aircraft had been found by local people in the Bintang highlands region. A search plane has also now spotted suspected debris. Indonesia's postal office has told the BBC that the plane was carrying four bags containing cash, about 6.5 billion rupiah (486,000; £300,000), for villagers living in remote places in Papua. \\"Our colleagues carry those bags to be handed out directly to poor people over there,\\" said the head of Jayapura's post office, Haryono, who goes by only his first name. 'Pray together' The ATR42-300 twin turboprop plane was carrying 44 adult passengers, five children and infants, and five crew. It is not yet known if anyone survived. It took off from Sentani airport in Jayapura at 14:21, but lost contact with air traffic controllers half an hour later. Bintang Mountains Regency Police Chief Yunus Wally told the Antara news agency that the debris was seen near a waterfall by a search plane on Monday, and that ground teams were preparing to head to the area. Henry Bambang Soelistyo, chief of Indonesia's national search and rescue agency, told AP news agency that \\"smoke was still billowing\\" from the debris spotted by their plane. He said bad weather and rugged terrain were hampering efforts to reach the site. Villagers had earlier told officials that a plane had crashed into a mountain. Indonesian President Joko Widodo has expressed his condolences on Twitter and called for the country to \\"pray together\\" for the victims. Image copyright EPA Image caption Family members have been waiting for news of their loved ones Oksibil, which is about 280km (175 miles) south of Jayapura, is a remote, mountainous region, which is extremely difficult to navigate. Bad weather is believed to have been a possible reason for the crash. The search plane was forced to turn back on Sunday because of dangerous flying conditions. On blacklist Trigana Air has had 14 serious incidents since it began operations in 1991, losing 10 aircraft in the process, according to the Aviation Safety Network. It has been on a European Union blacklist of banned carriers since 2007. All but four of Indonesia's certified airlines are on the list. Indonesia has suffered two major air disasters in the past year. Last December an AirAsia plane crashed in the Java Sea, killing all 192 people on board - and in July a military transport plane crashed in a residential area of Medan, Sumatra claiming 140 lives.

Answer the question A son can inherit traits Choose your answer from: (I) only from his father (II) only from his mother (III) from both his father and his mother (IV) from either his father or his mother, but not from both","completion":"Step 1: Understand the question The question is asking about the source of inherited traits in a son. Step 2: Recall basic biology knowledge Inheritance is the passing of traits or characteristics from parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are segments of DNA that carry information for specific traits and are present in every cell in our body. Typically, humans have two copies of each gene, one from the mother and one from the father. Step 3: Analyze the answer choices (I) only from his father - This choice implies that a son can inherit traits exclusively from the father, which is not accurate given the basic biology knowledge previously discussed. (II) only from his mother - This choice implies that a son can inherit traits exclusively from the mother, which is also not accurate based on the basic biology knowledge previously mentioned. (III) from both his father and his mother - This choice corresponds with the basic biology concept that states humans inherit one copy of each gene from both parents. This seems like a suitable answer. (IV) from either his father or his mother, but not from both - This choice implies that a son can inherit traits from one parent but not the other, which contradicts the basic biology knowledge we've discussed. Step 4: Choose the correct answer Based on these analyses, the correct answer is: (III) from both his father and his mother"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

David Frum: Survey indicates that they are less trusting, patriotic, more alienated. Some say social trust declines as a community becomes more ethnically diverse. Frum: As U.S. becomes more ethnically diverse, will diversity be a source of strength?","completion":"Title: Millennial Voting Patterns: A Reflection of Society's Evolution Introduction In recent years, the United States has been experiencing a significant shift in political, social, and economic landscapes. Amidst these changes, the political inclinations of millennials deserve particular attention, as they now account for a large proportion of the electorate and are believed to heavily influence the nation's future trajectory. A recent report from Pew Research Center suggests that millennials are most likely to vote Democratic, something that commentator David Frum points out may have wider implications for society as a whole. Millennials' Political Leanings According to the Pew report, millennials display an affinity for the Democratic Party, with many gravitating towards progressive policies that address pertinent issues such as climate change, income inequality, and social justice. This preference for a more inclusive approach to governance reflects the changing social and economic landscape in the country, as millennials navigate an increasingly globalized and competitive world. This generation's political leanings differ greatly from those of their predecessors. Frum cites survey data indicating that millennials are generally less trusting, patriotic, and more alienated from traditional cultural and political norms. This shift in mindset has contributed to the decline in social trust, a phenomenon that some observers argue results from the increasing ethnic diversity within communities. While diversity has historically been hailed as a source of strength for the United States, contemporary society seems to be grappling with its implications in an altogether more complex and unpredictable manner. The Impact of Ethnic Diversity on Social Trust The United States, known for its melting pot of cultures, races, and religions, has shown an increase in ethnic diversity over the years. Studies suggest that this diversification is inversely proportional to social trust; as communities become more ethnically diverse, trust levels tend to decline. The reasons for this correlation are multifaceted and warrant nuanced examination. Some argue that unfamiliarity breeds mistrust, while others contend that strained economic conditions and cultural differences exacerbate divisions between communities. David Frum poses an intriguing question: in an increasingly diverse nation, will diversity be a source of strength or challenge? To answer this question and understand how millennials' political preferences fit within the puzzle, it is vital to consider the broader implications of this generation's less trusting, patriotic, and more alienated outlook on life. Diversity as a Source of Strength Historically, the United States has thrived on the strengths derived from its diverse population. Immigrants have played a crucial role in shaping the nation's economy, enriching its culture, and inspiring change. By embracing different perspectives, people can engage in productive dialogues that foster innovation, creativity, and problem-solving. In the context of millennials' inclination for Democratic voting tendencies, their receptiveness to diverse ideas indicates an openness to constructive change and progress. Diversity as a Challenge Conversely, the challenges posed by increased diversity are equally significant. As social trust declines, communities may become fragmented and less cohesive, ultimately hindering the nation's ability to unite and tackle pressing issues collectively. Millennials' preference for Democratic and progressive-leaning policies may be an attempt to remedy the fraying social ties and systemic injustices that have emerged within the American tapestry. Conclusion Millennials' political inclinations, as suggested by the Pew report, highlight the ongoing importance of examining the role of ethnic diversity in contemporary American society. While communities are becoming increasingly diverse, it is imperative to acknowledge the challenges and benefits that such diversity brings about. By doing so, society can foster unity, preserve its historical strengths, and ensure a brighter future for all its constituents."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Richard Milhous Nixon was born on January 9, 1913 in Yorba Linda, California, in a house that was built by his father. His parents were Hannah (Milhous) Nixon and Francis A. Nixon. His mother was a Quaker, and his father converted from Methodism to the Quaker faith. Nixon was a descendant of the early American settler, Thomas Cornell, who was also an ancestor of Ezra Cornell, the founder of Cornell University, as well as of Jimmy Carter and Bill Gates. Nixon used the improving international environment to address the topic of nuclear peace. Following the announcement of his visit to China, the Nixon administration concluded negotiations for him to visit the Soviet Union. The President and First Lady arrived in Moscow on May 22, 1972 and met with Leonid Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the Communist Party; Alexei Kosygin, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers; and Nikolai Podgorny, the head of state, among other leading Soviet officials. Nixon engaged in intense negotiations with Brezhnev. Out of the summit came agreements for increased trade and two landmark arms control treaties: SALT I, the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles. Nixon and Brezhnev proclaimed a new era of \\"peaceful coexistence\\". A banquet was held that evening at the Kremlin. Seeking to foster better relations with the United States, both China and the Soviet Union cut back on their diplomatic support for North Vietnam and advised Hanoi to come to terms militarily. Nixon later described his strategy: I had long believed that an indispensable element of any successful peace initiative in Vietnam was to enlist, if possible, the help of the Soviets and the Chinese. Though rapprochement with China and detente with the Soviet Union were ends in themselves, I also considered them possible means to hasten the end of the war. At worst, Hanoi was bound to feel less confident if Washington was dealing with Moscow and Beijing. At best, if the two major Communist powers decided that they had bigger fish to fry, Hanoi would be pressured into negotiating a settlement we could accept. Having made considerable progress over the previous two years in U.S.-Soviet relations, Nixon embarked on a second trip to the Soviet Union in 1974. He arrived in Moscow on June 27 to a welcome ceremony, cheering crowds, and a state dinner at the Grand Kremlin Palace that evening. Nixon and Brezhnev met in Yalta, where they discussed a proposed mutual defense pact, detente, and MIRVs. While he considered proposing a comprehensive test-ban treaty, Nixon felt he would not have time as president to complete it. There were no significant breakthroughs in these negotiations.","completion":"This text is about Richard Milhous Nixon, who was the 37th President of the United States.

Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"Alright, let me put this in simple words for you. So, M1 is a term that refers to a certain kind of money, and it is very sensitive to changes in interest rates. Interest rates are the costs of borrowing money. Now, when there are signs of higher prices (inflation), the people in charge try to keep M1 balanced by changing the short-term interest rates. But sometimes, even if they increase the interest rates to control the money supply, it isn't enough to balance the effect of those higher prices. A person named Thiessen talked about this in 1983. Now translated to English: Given that M1 has high elasticity concerning interest rates, the increases in short-term interest rates that were sufficient to keep M1 within the target range facing a rise in inflationary pressures were not strong enough to offset the effect of these price shocks (Thiessen, 1983)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Often policemen use it when they are ready to use their guns. If one doesn't obey the order and moves, he or she will be shot to death. One evening in Los Angeles, someone rang the bell of a house. It was a dangerous area at night, so the _ of the house took his gun with him when he answered the door. He opened the door and saw a strange man.

Remember, you don't have to share what you've written with others. And here are some ways to give you the best first day of school.

Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary. In February 2014, another new U2 song, the single \\"Invisible\\", debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS. Bono called the track a \\"sneak preview\\" of their pending record.On 9 September 2014, U2 announced their thirteenth studio album, Songs of Innocence, at an Apple product launch event, and released it digitally the same day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost.

Now, the book is in Max's possession, even though he doesn't know what it is about. The book is later seen in the possession of a bulter, who is actually using it.

Christopher really hated to be late for things. Steven was constantly running late.","completion":"Inevitably, this put a strain on their friendship. Christopher valued punctuality and believed that being on time was a sign of respect for the person you were meeting. He always made sure to plan things ahead of time, checking for possible delays or obstacles that might interfere with his schedule. In his mind, arriving promptly was essential and a reflection of his character. On the other hand, Steven lived his life on a more spontaneous schedule. He disliked rigid plans and often gave in to distractions before attending to his responsibilities. More often than not, his tardiness was not a result of deliberate disregard but rather an inability to manage time effectively. Steven had good intentions, but his natural inclination towards procrastination got in the way of punctuality. Christopher found it increasingly difficult to understand Steven's perspective, and each time they made plans to meet, he couldn't help but feel anxious about his friend's inevitable delay. He tried talking to Steven about his concerns, hoping that a heart-to-heart conversation would help his friend appreciate the importance of punctuality. However, Steven dismissed his concerns lightly, attributing it to differences in personality. As Christopher's frustration grew, he began contemplating whether they should continue arranging meet-ups. He began to question if Steven truly valued their friendship, and if their time spent together was even worth it. At the same time, Christopher didn't want to give up on their bond, as they had shared so many memories and experiences over the years. Steven, on his part, sensed the tension in their relationship but couldn't comprehend why Christopher was so fixated on punctuality. He genuinely loved spending time with his friend, even if he wasn't the most timely individual. He wished Christopher would be more lenient and understanding towards his tardiness, as it didn't change the fact that they had quality moments together. Ultimately, Christopher and Steven faced a dilemma. They needed to find a way to bridge the gap in their perspectives and accept each other's differences before their friendship inevitably suffered. The solution may require compromise and understanding on both ends: Christopher learning to be more patient and Steven making a genuine effort to improve his time management skills.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which Colt had a touchdown catch?","completion":"Title: Which Colt Had a Touchdown Catch? A Look Into Colts' Receivers Introduction As a team with a rich history and a deep pool of talent, the Indianapolis Colts have had their fair share of wide receivers capable of making impressive touchdown catches. From star players to lesser-known names, the Colts have seen numerous victories thanks to some unforgettable catches. To answer the question of which Colt had a touchdown catch, let's dive into the history books and examine a few key players who have made an impact on the field. 1. Marvin Harrison When discussing touchdown catches for the Indianapolis Colts, one cannot overlook Marvin Harrison. As one of the best wide receivers in NFL history, Harrison spent his entire career with the Colts, playing alongside quarterback Peyton Manning. Over his 13-season career spanning from 1996 to 2008, Harrison accumulated 128 touchdown catches. His connection with Manning was the crucial factor in many of the team's successes, including their Super Bowl XLI victory. 2. Reggie Wayne Another household name in the Colts' franchise history is Reggie Wayne. With a career total of 82 touchdown receptions, Wayne was an instrumental piece of the Colts' offensive lineup from 2001 to 2014. In the 2009 season, Wayne caught the game-winning touchdown pass from Manning in Super Bowl XLI, solidifying his place as a key Colt with a significant touchdown catch. 3. T.Y. Hilton T.Y. Hilton is a prime example of a more recent Colts player who has made a significant impact with his touchdown catches. Since joining the team in 2012, Hilton has become a fan favorite as one of the league's most consistent wide receivers. As of the end of the 2020 season, he has recorded 50 touchdown receptions during his career with the Colts, continuing the team's tradition of producing exceptional catchers. 4. Raymond Berry Taking a step back in time, Raymond Berry was a Colts' wide receiver that made an undeniable impact during his tenure with the team from 1954 to 1967. As a crucial player during a time when the forward pass was becoming more prominent in the game, Berry amassed 68 touchdown catches over his career. His dynamic partnership with quarterback Johnny Unitas contributed to the team's success and placed Berry in the annals of legendary Colts' receivers. Conclusion In exploring the question of which Colt had a touchdown catch, it's apparent that numerous wide receivers have made an impact in the team's history. From Marvin Harrison's outstanding career to Reggie Wayne's Super Bowl-winning touchdown reception, the Colts have been blessed with talented receivers that have carried their team to victory time and time again. While there are many more players with incredible touchdown catches on their resumes, these four stand out as examples of exemplary Colts who have made a lasting impression on the franchise and its fans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dupré later wrote that Messiaen, having never seen an organ console, sat quietly for an hour while Dupré explained and demonstrated the instrument, and then came back a week later to play Johann Sebastian Bach's Fantasia in C minor to an impressive standard. From 1929, Messiaen regularly deputised at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris, for the organist Charles Quef, who was ill at the time. The post became vacant in 1931 when Quef died, and Dupré, Charles Tournemire and Widor among others supported Messiaen's candidacy. His formal application included a letter of recommendation from Widor. The appointment was confirmed in 1931, and he remained the organist at the church for more than sixty years. He also assumed a post at the Schola Cantorum de Paris in the early 1930s. In 1932, he composed the Apparition de l'église éternelle for organ. He married the violinist and composer Claire Delbos also in 1932. Their marriage inspired him to both compose works for her to play (Thème et variations for violin and piano in the year they were married) and to write pieces to celebrate their domestic happiness, including the song cycle Poèmes pour Mi in 1936, which he orchestrated in 1937. Mi was Messiaen's affectionate nickname for his wife. In 1937 their son Pascal was born. The marriage turned to tragedy when Delbos lost her memory after an operation towards the end of World War II. She spent the rest of her life in mental institutions.In 1936, along with André Jolivet, Daniel-Lesur and Yves Baudrier, Messiaen formed the group La jeune France (\\"Young France\\").

(B) Positive Yelp Review: I recently had the pleasure of dining at the stunning Blue Coral restaurant with my partner, and I must say, our experience deserves nothing short of a glowing review! After hearing many excellent things about this place, our expectations were already quite high, but I am delighted to share that Blue Coral exceeded all of them and truly made our night memorable. From the moment I walked into the restaurant, the ambiance was simply mesmerizing. The soft natural lighting, gorgeous décor, and soothing ocean-themed music embraced us as we entered the dining area, making us feel truly welcome and excited for the evening ahead. At our table, our server instantly made us feel comfortable with her warm smile and friendly demeanor. She effortlessly guided us through the menu, giving us her expert recommendations on what to order according to our preferences. We decided to go with a selection of appetizers - the jumbo crab cakes, ahi tuna poke, and grilled calamari, followed by the Chilean sea bass and grilled swordfish for our main courses, with chocolate lava cake and key lime pie for dessert. The presentation of each dish was so exquisite that we could hardly wait to taste it. The appetizers were scrumptious and cooked to perfection, bringing out the freshness and distinct flavors. The jumbo crab cakes were particularly unique, as they were seasoned with a perfect blend of spices, and the grilled calamari was tender and mouth-watering. The main course was equally outstanding. I cannot emphasize enough how perfectly cooked the Chilean sea bass and grilled swordfish were – the subtle flavors and the moist texture of the fish simply melted in our mouths. Accompanying the seafood mains were vibrant seasonal veggies and an unforgettable lemon butter sauce that tied everything together. When it was time for dessert, we were not ready for the night to end – and luckily, the heavenly chocolate lava cake and key lime pie did not disappoint. The molten chocolate lava cake was decadently rich and just the right amount of sweet, while the key lime pie had the most delightful tanginess and smooth texture. Throughout our meal, the service was impeccable. Our server checked in on us at just the right intervals, attentively refilling our drinks and ensuring that all our needs were met. Moreover, I absolutely must give credit to the manager, who routinely visited tables to ensure that the guests were enjoying their evening to the fullest. In conclusion, our dining experience at Blue Coral was truly exceptional. The impeccable service, enchanting ambiance, and absolutely divine selection of dishes left a lasting impression on us. It is evident that this restaurant takes great pride in delivering the highest standards of quality, both in terms of food and customer service.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: In 1826, a Frenchman named Niepce needed pictures for his business. But he was not a good artist. So he invented a very simple camera. He put it in a window of his house and took a picture of his garden. That was the first photo. The next important date in the history of photography was in 1837.That year, Daguerre, another Frenchman, took a picture of his reading-room. He used a new kind of camera in a different way. In his picture you could see everything very clearly, even the smallest thing. The kind of photo was called a Daguerreotype. Soon, other people began to use Daguerre's way. Travellers brought back wonderful photos from all round the world. People took pictures of famous buildings, cities and mountains. In about 1840, photography was developed . Then photographers could take pictures of people and moving things. That was not simple. The photographers had to carry a lot of film and other machines. But this did not stop them, for example, some in the United States worked so hard.Mathew Brady was a famous American photographer. He took many pictures of great people. The pictures were unusual because they were very lifelike . Photographers also became one kind of art by the end of the 19th century.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Process: - Magma rises from deep in the earth - The magma goes into volcanos - The volcanos pressure the magma upwards - The pressure causes the magma to push through the surface of the volcano - The lava cools - The lava forms new rock - New magma is pressured to the surface of the volcano - The volcano bursts through the rock the formed after the last eruption. Question: suppose more magma rises from deep in the earth happens, how will it affect more lava will cool. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"The process described here is the cyclical nature of volcanic activity. The key to understanding the relationship between the increase in magma and the cooling of lava is to understand what magma and lava are. Magma is molten rock stored beneath the earth's crust, and lava is magma that has been ejected onto the surface through a volcanic eruption. The transition from magma to lava happens when there is sufficient pressure build-up forcing the magma upwards and out of the volcano's vent or opening. Should there be an increase in the magma rising from deep within the earth, this would likely result in an increased frequency or size of volcanic eruptions. This is because additional magma creates more pressure within the volcano's magma chamber, leading to more frequent or significant eruptions and, as a result, more lava being spewed onto the surface. Once the lava is on the surface, it begins to cool, solidify, and eventually form new rocks. The cooling process is contingent upon several factors such as the environment, the lava's chemical composition, and its thickness. However, it's equally important to note that the rate at the lava cools does not directly correlate to the amount of magma that rises from the earth. In other words, an increase in magma does not necessarily mean that the lava will cool faster. The cooling rate of lava is more related to external factors like air temperature, wind conditions, and the lava's exposure to these elements. Therefore, the answer to the question \\"Suppose more magma rises from deep in the earth happens, how will it affect more lava will cool?\\" would likely be option (A): more. With more magma rising from deep within the earth, more lava would be ejected onto the surface following more frequent or larger eruptions. As a result, more lava would undergo the cooling process, which could eventually form more new rock. However, remember that this signifies the amount of lava cooling, not the speed of the cooling process itself."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase.

We love accessing the cloud, floating up into that sweet mass of data like Icarus and his wings of wax and feather. The mere sound of our iPhone's chirp activates the brain regions involved in love and compassion, research shows. The bond we share with our computers or smartphones is, for many of us, the most lasting and fulfilling relationship we've managed to hold on to. But when it comes to our gadgets, absence doesn't make the heart grow fonder. If you find yourself unhooked from your digital life support (say, because your phone is dead, your laptop is in the shop or you're wrapping up last week's challenge to put the phone down and look around this lovely world), you may need to ask those five little words: \\"Can I use your computer?\\" Sitting down at the keyboard of another requires a delicate mix of courtesy and discretion. Beyond the insanely obvious (DON'T invade your friend's privacy by opening his files or checking his e-mails, DON'T watch porn or download malware or Google anything that will get the attention of the Department of Homeland Security, and so on), there are a few more subtle guidelines to keep in mind while bumming a friend's computer or tablet.

Build a movie plot around this: Why can't the friends call for help? No cell phone signal The answer to this question is:","completion":"Step 1: Establish the setting and main characters. To build a movie plot, we first need to establish the setting and the main characters. Let's choose a remote mountainous area as the setting where cell phone signals are weak or non-existent. The main characters of the story will be a group of five friends: Jake, Sarah, Mike, Olivia, and Lily. Step 2: Introduce the backstory and motivation for the journey. Jake, the adventurous one, is motivated to go on a hiking and camping trip to the remote mountains after hearing about a hidden treasure that lies deep in the wilderness, which is rumored to be guarded by an ancient tribe. With the promise of excitement and discovery, he convinces Sarah, an aspiring photographer, Mike, a history enthusiast, Olivia, a nature lover, and Lily, who is primarily there to bond with her friends, to join him on this quest. Step 3: Create the main conflict that prevents the friends from calling for help. Upon reaching the mountains, the group discovers an ancient ruin, which might provide a clue to the treasure's location. However, during their exploration, they accidentally set off a booby trap, causing the entrance to collapse and trap them inside. With no cell phone signal, they must rely on their wits and work together to find another way out or think of another solution like a flare gun, but they don't have it with them or they used it, but nobody noticed. Step 4: Develop sub-plots for character development, tension, and challenges. As the friends navigate through the underground ruins, each character faces personal struggles and growth: - Jake questions his leadership abilities and feels guilty for leading his friends into this dangerous situation. - Sarah, who is scared of confined spaces, must confront her fears to capture essential clues in photographs and decipher their meanings. - Mike, whose vast historical knowledge becomes vital, must learn to communicate more effectively with the group. - Olivia, tasked with finding ways to utilize their limited resources, overcomes self-doubt in her survival skills. - Lily, initially seen as the weakest link, discovers her talents in problem-solving and keeps the group's spirits high. Step 5: Reach the climax and resolution. When the friends finally discover the hidden exit, they encounter the ancient tribe guarding the treasure. Mike, through effective communication, manages to convince the tribe that they only want to leave and have no intention of taking the treasure. The tribe allows the friends to leave, but not before bestowing upon them a small, symbolic item representing the lessons they've learned during their journey. Upon returning to civilization, the friends are forever changed by their experiences but are grateful for the growth, bonds, and memories they have made together. Overall, the movie plot revolves around the theme of friendship, personal growth, and learning how to rely on one another during challenging circumstances without the crutch of modern technology, also showcasing how they overcome the challenge of not being able to call for help due to a lack of cell phone signal."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The song was written by Bart Howard in 1954. Kaye Ballard, an American actress, comedian, and singer, was the first to record this song as a single, which was released in April 1954 on Decca Records. Kaye Ballard's version of the song paved the way for other artists to interpret it, ultimately propelling it to great popularity and recognition. Over the years, a plethora of artists has covered \\"Fly Me to the Moon,\\" including Peggy Lee, who also sang it in 1960 and changed its title to the more popular version that we know today. However, one of the most iconic and beloved renditions of this song is by Frank Sinatra. Sinatra recorded his version of \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\" in 1964 with Count Basie's orchestra, arranged by Quincy Jones, and released the song on his album \\"It Might as Well Be Swing.\\" Under Sinatra's influence, the song became a classic standard within the American music scene and beyond. It gained such popularity that when NASA's Apollo 10 mission took off in 1969, Sinatra's version of the song was one of the few chosen to accompany the astronauts on their groundbreaking space voyage. Throughout the years, \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\" has maintained its status as a classic jazz standard and has also been performed by many artists across different genres, such as Nat King Cole, Doris Day, Diana Krall, and Michael Bublé, to name a few.

Summarize this article: Two options have been put forward that would permit a zero rate of tax on sanitary products. It comes amid the threat of a backbench rebellion following the Budget from Eurosceptic MPs over the tax, currently at the lowest rate allowed by EU law. Chancellor George Osborne said the government \\"heard people's anger over paying the tampon tax loud and clear\\". VAT is currently charged at the reduced rate of 5% on sanitary products - but more than 300,000 people have signed a petition calling for sanitary items to be exempted from tax altogether. Mr Osborne had pledged to spend the proceeds of the tax on women's charities. \\"We said we'd use the money to benefit women's charities and we've already distributed Â£17m to good causes across the country,\\" he said. \\"At the same time we said we'd fight for agreement to reduce the VAT rate to zero, and tonight all European leaders have welcomed our plan to do just that. We've achieved what no British government has even tried to achieve. \\"It just shows how Britain can make a case for a reform that will benefit millions as a powerful, confident voice inside a reformed EU.\\" At the European Council summit in Brussels, the 28 leaders agreed a statement welcoming \\"the intention of the Commission to include proposals for increased flexibility for member states with respect to reduced rates of VAT, which will provide the option to member states of VAT zero-rating sanitary products\\". BBC chief political correspondent Vicki Young said it appeared the government had managed to avoid a Commons defeat by reaching the agreement. A great British victory or an obvious bit of spin? Number 10 says David Cameron has come to Brussels and won the backing of all EU leaders for his plan to abolish VAT on women's sanitary products. With the EU referendum looming, the long-running campaign to get tampons zero rated is pulling in support from Tory MPs backing Brexit. A dicey vote on the finance bill loomed next week. Now the European Commission may have defused this political problem. For months it has been listening to EU member states complain the existing EU rules on reduced and zero-rated VAT are too rigid and past their sell by date. The UK, of course, has a particular complaint about not being allowed to cut VAT on tampons below 5% and has asked for change. Earlier, the Commission confirmed it will publish its \\"Action Plan\\" on VAT next Wednesday. It would include two options for change that would allow countries more flexibility over VAT. Hours later, Number 10 trumpeted that a line will be included in the Council conclusions stating EU leaders welcome the Commission's move \\"which would provide the option to member states of VAT zero rating for sanitary products\\". So at some point down the line, the government looks set to scrap VAT on tampons. The EU has moved. But it was likely to do so whether David Cameron lobbied for the move here at this summit or not. A number of Conservative MPs have threatened to vote for an amendment to the Finance Bill in the Commons on Tuesday to allow the zero-rating of women's sanitary products. Those campaigning for Britain to leave the EU in 23 June's referendum have been keen to highlight the role of Brussels in setting VAT rates. Mr Cameron raised the issue with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker at the start of the EU summit, Downing Street said. Labour MP Paula Sheriff, who has tabled the Finance Bill amendment, said: \\"Women's sanitary products are not a luxury. George Osborne failed to take the opportunity in his Budget to say that he would take the action called for by Labour and feminist campaigners and seek to get the 'tampon tax' abolished.\\" The European Commission said it was working on two options that would allow member states more flexibility over setting VAT rates. A Commission spokeswoman said: \\"EU VAT rules are not imposed by the European Commission. They are decided on and agreed unanimously by member states. \\"Contrary to some media reports, tampons do benefit from reduced taxation.\\" She added that under current rules, member states were not allowed to apply a zero VAT rate to a product unless all other member states agreed. \\"Zero rates are an exception and run against generally accepted VAT principles. Most member states tax sanitary products like tampons at around 20% or more,\\" she added.","completion":"The European Council has agreed a statement welcoming proposals for increased VAT flexibility for EU member states, which includes the option for VAT zero-rating of women's sanitary products. The decision comes after more than 300,000 people signed a petition calling for an end to the tampon tax and the UK government had faced a threatened backbench revolt over the issue. While VAT is currently charged at the reduced rate of 5% on sanitary products in the UK, the EU's agreement now means the UK government looks set to scrap VAT on tampons completely. The decision was reached after options were put forward that would permit countries more flexibility over VAT settings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is Baron von Frankenstein's relationship to Katrin? Movie plot title: Flesh for Frankenstein Movie plot: Baron von Frankenstein neglects his duties towards his wife/sister Katrin, as he is obsessed with creating a perfect Serbian race to obey his commands, beginning by assembling a perfect male and female from parts of corpses. The doctor's sublimation of his sexual urges by his powerful urge for domination is shown when he utilizes the surgical wounds of his female creation to satisfy his lust. He is dissatisfied with the inadequate reproductive urges of his current male creation, and seeks a head donor with a greater libido; he also repeatedly exhibits an intense interest that the creature's \\"nasum\\" (nose) have a correctly Serbian shape.[6][7] As it happens, a suitably randy farmhand, Nicholas, leaving a local brothel along with his sexually repressed friend, brought there in an unsuccessful attempt to dissuade him from entering a monastery, are spotted and waylaid by the doctor and his henchman, Otto; mistakenly assuming that the prospective monk is also suitable for stud duty, they take his head for use on the male creature. Not knowing these behind-the-scene details, Nicholas survives and is summoned by Katrin to the castle, where they form an agreement that he will gratify her unsatisfied carnal appetites.[6][7] Under the control of the doctor, the male and female creatures are seated for dinner with the castle's residents, but the male creature shows no signs of recognition of his friend as he serves the Baron and his family. Nicholas realizes at this point that something is awry, but himself pretends not to recognize his friend's face until he can investigate further. After a falling-out with Katrin, who is merely concerned with her own needs, Nicholas goes snooping in the laboratory and is captured by the doctor.

Here is a premise: Once a company buys that software, it is less likely to switch content providers. Here is a hypothesis: There are no instances where a person would want to switch content providers. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"No, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. Let's analyze the premise, hypothesis, and reasoning behind this conclusion in more detail. Premise: Once a company buys that software, it is less likely to switch content providers. The premise suggests that the purchase of a particular software reduces the likelihood of a company switching content providers. This could be due to several reasons such as the software being tailored for a specific content provider, the cost of changing content providers, or the time and resources required for re-integrating the software with another content provider. At this point, it's important to note that it indicates a reduced likelihood, not a complete inability or cessation of switching content providers. Hypothesis: There are no instances where a person would want to switch content providers. The hypothesis claims that there are no reasons or situations in which a person would want to switch content providers. This statement is too absolute and does not take into consideration the many factors that could influence a person's decision to switch content providers. These factors could include dissatisfaction with the quality or offerings of the current content provider, better pricing or deals from another provider, the acquisition of the current content provider by another company, or technological advances that make the services of another content provider more attractive. In order to establish the truth of the hypothesis based on the premise, one would need to prove that the premise guarantees that there are no instances where a person would want to switch content providers. However, this is clearly not the case. The premise only suggests that the likelihood of switching is reduced due to factors related to software purchase, not that switching becomes completely impossible or undesirable. Comparison and Conclusion: Since the premise only suggests a reduced likelihood of switching content providers and does not cover all possible reasons or situations why a person would want to switch, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, the hypothesis must be true as well. The hypothesis posits an absolute statement that negates any possibility of a person wanting to switch content providers, while the premise acknowledges that there still might be instances of switching, albeit at a lower frequency or likelihood.

Write an article based on this summary: The Labour group on Aberdeen City Council is calling for all options to be explored to allow the local authority to run its own bus company.","completion":"Title: Rethinking Public Transport: Aberdeen City Council Explores Options for a Locally-Run Bus Company Introduction The Labour group on Aberdeen City Council has recently urged that all options be investigated to enable the local authority to manage its own bus company. This proposition stems from the growing need for a more accessible, efficient, and sustainable public transport system within the city. Establishing a council-run bus company would allow the local authority to cater to the specific needs of Aberdeen residents, positively impacting the environment, local economy, and overall quality of life for citizens. Background and Current Scenario Over the years, bus services in Aberdeen, like many other cities, have been predominantly managed by private operators. The challenges associated with such a management system vary and include concerns over route coverage, ticket pricing, accessibility, and efficiency. Private operators often prioritize profitability, thereby leading to service cuts in less-profitable areas, leaving many residents in these locations underserved and reliant on other, less eco-friendly, modes of transport. Objectives and Benefits of a Council-Run Bus Company 1. Tailored Service Provision: A council-run bus company would enable local authorities to develop and provide services specifically addressing the public transportation needs of Aberdeen residents. This would include introducing or increasing bus routes in underserved areas, ensuring more comprehensive coverage for the city. 2. Affordable Pricing: Council management would allow for more affordable ticket pricing and more flexible fare structures, ultimately providing an incentive for more citizens to choose public transport as their preferred mode of travel. Subsidies from the local authority could help keep prices down and encourage greater bus use. 3. Improved Accessibility: A locally-run bus company under council control could prioritize improving accessibility for all citizens, especially those with disabilities or mobility issues. A focus on inclusivity could lead to the implementation of more accessible bus stops and vehicles, further enhancing user experience and making public transport a viable option for all community members. 4. Enhanced Environmental Sustainability: Private operators may not prioritize environmentally-friendly solutions, such as electric or hybrid buses. In contrast, a council-run bus company could invest in cutting-edge greener technologies, leading to reduced emissions and a lower carbon footprint for the city. 5. Economic Boost: Local management of a bus company could lead to job creation and retention, as the organization's primary goal would be to serve the community rather than generate profit. Moreover, increased accessibility and a more extensive network would stimulate economic growth in areas that have been previously underserved by the current transport system. Exploring the Options Several options can be explored for local authorities to run their own bus company, such as: 1. Establishing a new, wholly-owned, municipal bus company: This involves the creation and development of a bus company fully managed by the council. Local authorities could start with a small fleet and gradually expand as needed. 2. Procuring and executing a joint venture with an existing private bus company: This involves cooperating with a private operator who would contribute their management expertise, experience, and network while the council oversees strategic direction and policy implementation. This scenario could leverage existing resources and systems more efficiently. 3. Re-regulation and franchising of existing bus services: This involves the council taking greater control of the existing bus services by setting clear performance standards and targets, specifying routes, and providing subsidies. Doing so would enable the council to have an indirect influence on the management of bus services, aligning them with community needs. Conclusion Investigating all options available to allow the local authority to manage its own bus company is crucial for improving the public transport experience for Aberdeen residents. A council-run bus company would ensure tailored service provision, affordable pricing, increased accessibility, environmental sustainability, and economic benefits for the city. Exploring various options, from establishing a new municipal company to franchising current services, will enable the Aberdeen City Council to make an informed decision on the best path forward for the community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Doyle McManus: The havoc wreaked by 'super PACs' Chalk up another win for the law of unintended consequences. When federal courts ruled in 2010 against restricting donations to political action committees, Republican strategists rejoiced. Here, they thought, was a way for the GOP's deep-pocketed donors to gain an advantage over President Obama's fundraising machine. But look what happened. \\"Super PACs,\\" as the newly empowered political action committees are known, have mutated like election-year Godzillas, wreaking havoc in an increasingly bloody Republican primary campaign. Last month, the super PACs that support Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul raised more money than the candidates' official campaign organizations did. The super PACs, which are legally independent from the campaigns, spent a combined 28 million and ended the month with 19 million in cash on hand. Along the way, they created a new list of wealthy kingmakers on whom the candidates now depend for their political survival. Without gambling tycoon Sheldon Adelson, who (along with his wife) has pumped 10 million into Gingrich's super PAC, the former House speaker would be back on the lecture tour. Without money from Wyoming investor Foster Friess, Santorum never would have made it to the top of the polls. And without his own short list of financiers led by Texas' Harold C. Simmons, Romney wouldn't have had the resources to fight off their attacks. Under the old system, which limited individuals to 2,500 in contributions, candidates had to scour the country for as many donors as they could find. Now, one or two deep-pocketed backers can keep a campaign alive. Under the old system, Romney — who started out with a big advantage in traditional fundraising — might have been close to wrapping up the nomination by now. But as long as Santorum and Gingrich have super PACs to fund television advertising for them, the struggle will continue. The lesson for future candidates is clear: Don't make the mistake that early dropouts Tim Pawlenty and Michele Bachmann made. Before you run, make sure you have a billionaire in your corner. Of course, the new system has its critics, including even Gingrich's sugar daddy, Adelson. \\"I'm against very wealthy people … influencing elections,\\" the eighth-wealthiest man in America told Forbes. \\"But as long as it's doable, I'm going to do it.\\" That's a widely shared sentiment. Wealthy Americans are popping up all over to fund the new super PACs, including liberals who might have been expected to oppose the idea on principle. Film producer Jeffrey Katzenberg and television comedian Bill Maher are the top Obama super PAC donors so far, and the money is likely to flow ever faster in the run-up to November. What will that mean? In all likelihood, a particularly nasty campaign. The super PACs, with their elaborate charade of independence from the campaigns, make it easier to run negative advertising — because candidates can claim that they had nothing to do with it. In Michigan last week, Romney's super PAC, inspiringly named Restore Our Future, was running a television commercial slashing Santorum for his Senate votes in favor of appropriations bills. A female narrator intones disapprovingly, \\"Santorum even voted to raise his own pay!\\" At the end of the commercial, instead of \\"I'm Mitt Romney, and I approve this message,\\" there's a disclaimer: \\"Not authorized by any candidate.\\" But is that really true? When he was asked last year whether he had any responsibility for the super PAC's operations, Romney did his best to appear shocked, even though his super PAC is staffed by his former aides and he appeared at one of its events. \\"My goodness,\\" he replied. \\"If we cooperate in any way, shape or form, we go to the big house.\\" Not really. The Federal Election Commission doesn't put anyone in jail. It only levies modest fines — normally long after an election is over. Moreover, the FEC allows \\"cooperation\\" between a candidate and his super PAC as long as the candidate doesn't \\"coordinate\\" his campaign with the independent effort. Candidates can even help raise money for their super PACs as long as they don't direct how that money is spent. It even may be legal for a candidate to appear in an ad paid for by his \\"independent\\" super PAC; when the FEC was asked to rule on one such ad (starring Sen. Ben Nelson (D-Neb.), it deadlocked, leaving the issue unresolved. In the Supreme Court decision known as Citizens United, which helped pave the way for these innovations, JusticeAnthony M. Kennedywrote that he was confident that unlimited campaign funding would not harm the democratic process. \\"Independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption,\\" he wrote. \\"The appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy.\\" We're about to learn whether Kennedy's pronouncement — which took the risky form of a forecast, not a legal judgment — was right.","completion":"In 2010, the courts decided not to restrict donations to political action committees, which made Republican strategists happy. They thought it would help them get more money than President Obama. But things didn't go as they planned. These committees, called Super PACs, started causing problems in the Republican primary campaign. Last month, Super PACs that supported different candidates like Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich, and Ron Paul raised more money than the official campaign organizations. They spent a lot of money and had more money left over. Because of Super PACs, candidates now need help from very rich people to do well in the elections. In the past, candidates could get only a limited amount of money from individual donors. They had to find many donors to help them. Now, one or two very rich people can give candidates lots of money to help them stay in the race. Super PACs also make it easier for candidates to run negative ads about their opponents. They don't have to say they approve the message, so they can claim they aren't responsible for negative ads. The Federal Election Commission only fines people for breaking the rules, and candidates can work with Super PACs as long as they don't control them too much. A judge once said that allowing more money in politics won't hurt democracy, but it looks like we're going to find out if that's true or not."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While it is true that recent research by Geert Driessen shows that the use of dialects and regional languages is in decline in the Netherlands, this information does not answer the question about the most commonly spoken regional language in the country. The most commonly spoken regional language in the Netherlands is West Frisian (Fries or Frysk in Dutch). West Frisian is an official language alongside Dutch in the northern province of Friesland (Fryslân in West Frisian). It is spoken by approximately 400,000 to 500,000 people, representing around 60-70% of the total population of the Friesland province. West Frisian is part of the larger Frisian language group, which also includes East Frisian and North Frisian spoken in Germany. It is a Germanic language and shares certain similarities with English and Dutch but is different enough to be considered a separate language. The province of Friesland has a strong sense of regional identity, and the government actively promotes the use of West Frisian in schools and public life. West Frisian is taught as a subject in schools, used in local government communication and official documents, and even has its radio station and television programming. There are other regional languages and dialects spoken throughout the Netherlands as well, such as Limburgish in the southeastern province of Limburg and Low Saxon in the northeastern provinces. However, these languages have fewer speakers compared to West Frisian. In conclusion, although the usage of regional languages and dialects in the Netherlands is declining, West Frisian is the most commonly spoken regional language in the country. The language is still widely used in Friesland province and remains an important part of the region's cultural identity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Barry, born John Barry Prendergast on November 3, 1933, in York, England, made a significant and long-lasting impact on the world of film music, having composed and conducted scores for over 100 films in a career that spanned five decades. \\"Dances with Wolves\\" is an epic Western film directed and produced by Kevin Costner, who also starred in it. The movie tells the story of a Union Army officer, Lieutenant John Dunbar, who is assigned to an isolated frontier post in the 1860s. Through his interactions with the Lakota Native American tribe, Dunbar comes to appreciate their way of life and develops a deep bond with them. John Barry's evocative score for \\"Dances with Wolves\\" played a crucial role in enhancing the film's emotional depth and the portrayal of the breathtaking landscapes of the American West. The film's soundtrack features a rich mix of orchestral music, which melds traditional Western film scores with the atmospheric sounds that capture the beauty and wildness of the prairies. Barry's remarkable work on \\"Dances with Wolves\\" earned him accolades, including an Academy Award for Best Original Score and a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score in 1991. This was not Barry's first encounter with success and recognition, as he had already won four other Academy Awards for his scores in \\"Born Free\\" (1966), \\"The Lion in Winter\\" (1968), \\"Out of Africa\\" (1985), and \\"The Little Prince\\" (1974). In addition to providing the soundtrack for \\"Dances with Wolves,\\" John Barry is also renowned for his contributions to the iconic James Bond film series. He was responsible for composing music for 11 of the franchise's films, including the groundbreaking and widely recognizable Bond theme song, which remains a significant part of popular culture. John Barry passed away on January 30, 2011, at the age of 77, but his extensive body of work has left an indelible mark on the world of film music.

A battle-hardened Huntley-Brinkley reporter later said that no military action he had witnessed had ever frightened or disturbed him as much as what he saw in Birmingham. Two out-of-town photographers in Birmingham that day were Charles Moore, who had previously worked with the Montgomery Advertiser and was now working for Life magazine, and Bill Hudson, with the Associated Press. Moore was a Marine combat photographer who was \\"jarred\\" and \\"sickened\\" by the use of children and what the Birmingham police and fire departments did to them. Moore was hit in the ankle by a brick meant for the police. He took several photos that were printed in Life. The first photo Moore shot that day showed three teenagers being hit by a water jet from a high-pressure firehose. It was titled \\"They Fight a Fire That Won't Go Out\\". A shorter version of the caption was later used as the title for Fred Shuttlesworth's biography. The Life photo became an \\"era-defining picture\\" and was compared to the photo of Marines raising the U.S. flag on Iwo Jima. Moore suspected that the film he shot \\"was likely to obliterate in the national psyche any notion of a 'good southerner'.\\" Hudson remarked later that his only priorities that day were \\"making pictures and staying alive\\" and \\"not getting bit by a dog.\\"Right in front of Hudson stepped Parker High School senior Walter Gadsden when a police officer grabbed the young man's sweater and a police dog charged him.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Habitat destruction has played a key role in extinctions, especially in relation to tropical forest destruction. Factors contributing to habitat loss include: overconsumption, overpopulation, land use change, deforestation, pollution (air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination) and global warming or climate change.Habitat size and numbers of species are systematically related. Physically larger species and those living at lower latitudes or in forests or oceans are more sensitive to reduction in habitat area. Conversion to \\"trivial\\" standardized ecosystems (e.g., monoculture following deforestation) effectively destroys habitat for the more diverse species that preceded the conversion. Even the simplest forms of agriculture affect diversity – through clearing/draining land, discouraging weeds and \\"pests\\", and encouraging just a limited set of domesticated plant and animal species. In some countries lack of property rights or lax law/regulatory enforcement necessarily leads to biodiversity loss (degradation costs having to be supported by the community).A 2007 study conducted by the National Science Foundation found that biodiversity and genetic diversity are codependent—that diversity among species requires diversity within a species and vice versa. \\"If any one type is removed from the system, the cycle can break down and the community becomes dominated by a single species.\\" I am facing a new situation today: Two continents had different histories. Asia was inhabited by many humans which destroyed most natural habitats through their activities. America was protective towards its environment and therefore thrived. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which continent caused less tropical forest destruction? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation presented, it is clear that the continent causing less tropical forest destruction is America. This conclusion can be drawn by examining the factors contributing to habitat loss and comparing the histories of the two continents. In the case of Asia, human activities have led to the destruction of most natural habitats. Overpopulation, overconsumption, and land use change are among the key factors contributing to habitat loss in this continent. Deforestation, along with other types of pollution such as air pollution, water pollution, and soil contamination, further exacerbate the problem. As a result of these human-driven factors, biodiversity in Asia is diminished, with species unable to adapt to the drastically altered environment. In contrast, America has had a history of being more protective towards its environment, and thus, has experienced less tropical forest destruction. By implementing policies and regulations to preserve natural habitats and protect biodiversity, the continent has been able to maintain a more stable ecosystem. This attention to environmental conservation is critical, as the 2007 study conducted by the National Science Foundation demonstrates the codependent relationship between biodiversity and genetic diversity. Preserving diverse ecosystems helps ensure the overall health and resilience of an environment, reducing the risk of being dominated by a single species. It is important to note that habitat size and species sensitivity to habitat reduction are directly related. Larger species, lower latitude species, and those living in forests or oceans are more susceptible to the negative effects of habitat loss. Therefore, the protection and conservation of habitats, such as tropical forests, play a vital role in maintaining diverse ecosystems and preserving species. To answer the question, America caused less tropical forest destruction due to its history of being more protective of its environment and implementing policies to preserve natural habitats. This has allowed for a more stable and diverse ecosystem in comparison to Asia, where human activities have led to significant habitat loss and a decline in biodiversity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

That is the question from the White House in Washington to the Blue House in Seoul — and perhaps also inside the Ryongsong Residence in Pyongyang. Following the historic handshake here between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader, who inked their names to a document with vague but compelling promises, the question emanating from Sentosa's Capella Hotel was what will actually change on the Korean peninsula? Moments after the summit between Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un concluded, VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren and I spent a few minutes with the U.S. president and his secretary of state, at the Capella. Trump was elated and within the hour would make a surprising announcement suspending \\"provocative\\" joint U.S.-South Korean drills on the Korean peninsula. \\"We had a great chemistry,\\" the president, speaking to Van Susteren, said of himself and Kim. \\"We will do business.\\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told us, \\"it's a great day.\\" The president has essentially handed off to Pompeo the hard work of turning a sparse declaration on denuclearization into something truly transformative.

Regarding the 3rd act, the movie just abruptly ends. There is no resolution and no path down from the climax of the 2nd act, so there wasn't much of a 3rd act. The bad guys die and that's that; the end credits roll. There is nothing to show what happens to the protagonist and the supporting characters and so on. The audience would've likely left the theater after the movie, asking \\"that's it?\\" A real letdown. Music was composed by David Bell which worked adequately enough to serve the film most of the time, but it's certainly nothing outstanding. It's just functional, but achieves this by being merely generic and derivative. It is also apparent that the score is VERY dated with the use of synthesized timpani for some of the percussion. What least impressed me about the score is that some moments of tension heralds music cues sounding like they were ripped off of James Horner from \\"48 HRS.\\" and \\"Commando,\\" particularly the brass. In all, the film had potential as the basic story itself is good, but the execution was lackluster with mediocre direction, weak acting, and somewhat inconsistent pacing. There was virtually no 3rd act to properly finish the story, and this omission is major and unforgivable as it doesn't allow the movie to end satisfactorily. This could either be the screenplay or, possibly, the production had to cut out filming or editing the 3rd act into the finished movie due to budget constraints (but I'm speculating as to why there isn't a 3rd act). Whatever the reason, the abrupt ending really hurts the movie overall. This is good for a view if you're curious and you can get the movie for VERY cheap as well as to learn the reason WHY you need to have the 3 acts (beginning, middle, end) if you write screenplays and make movies.

Rowling or Martin Luther King Jr. who have proven to be strong and intelligent people. However, in today's world, stars are regarded as role models along with the heroes listed above, despite their intentions or actions. Teens attempt to imitate their actions for two major reasons. First, to be fashionable and accepted by popular culture, and second>>because stars' actions are so well documented by the media that it seems to grab our attention and turns it to following stars' lives. Much of the reports about stars is shocking and exhibits bad morals or lifestyles that aren't right for teenagers. In addition, almost everything stars do is described beyond truth to make a shocking story by taking it to the next level. However, teens must take responsibility for their actions. We can't always blame stars for influencing us. Only you have control over yourself and only you choose to do something. Our bodies and actions are in the hands of no one else. Now, who ever said stars are role models? Whether they choose to be or not, stars set examples as soon as they step into the spotlight. With reporters following and recording every move they make, it is impossible not to be watched and then be imitated. These people influence, teens whether or not they want to. Why should someone who doesn't want to be setting an example set one? So,should we look up to them or to people who are true and good role models? It's our responsibility as teens to know right from wrong, and it's time for us to take responsibility for our actions. In doing so,we will lean toward those inspiring people that want to be setting an example, and follow in their steps to be like them. It can be inferred from the passage that .

Feeling guilty: People may feel guilty when they lie constantly, so this could be a potential consequence of lying constantly. b. Confusion: Lying constantly can lead to confusion for both the one lying and the ones being lied to, as it becomes difficult to distinguish between what is true and what is not. c. Unhappiness: Lying constantly can lead to unhappiness, as it may damage relationships and lead to feelings of guilt or shame. d. Good things: This choice is not a direct consequence of lying constantly. In fact, it appears to be the opposite, as one might expect good things to happen when telling the truth or being honest. e.

Input: Abstract: Exercise-induced asthma is defined as an intermittent narrowing of the airways, demonstrated by a decrease in some measure of flow, that the patient experiences as wheezing, chest tightness, coughing, and difficulty breathing that is triggered by exercise. Exercise will trigger asthma in most individuals who have chronic asthma, as well as in some who do not otherwise have asthma. Definitive diagnosis requires demonstration of a drop in flow rate, typically > or = 13-15% for forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and > or = 15-20% for peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), after exercise, associated with symptoms. Prevalence data indicate that this disorder is very common in those who participate in recreational sports as well as in highly competitive athletes, with at least 12-15% of unselected athletes having positive exercise challenges. Treatment of exercise induced asthma involves use of nonpharmacological measures (such as the use of the refractory period after exercise and prewarming air) as well as use of medications (beta-agonists, cromolyn, and nedocromil). With treatment, those who suffer from exercise-induced asthma may be able to participate and compete at the highest levels of performance..

In the first sentence, precise information about the tributary called \\"Mauses Creek\\" is provided. This tributary flows into Mahoning Creek upstream of Mahoning Creek's mouth, and the sentence also mentions the existence of a watershed area for Mauses Creek. However, the exact value of the watershed area is missing, which can be assumed to be an unintentional omission. The second sentence has a slightly different structure. It refers to \\"the tributary of the Mauses Creek,\\" which might imply that there is a tributary smaller than Mauses Creek that eventually flows into it. However, based on the context provided in the sentence, it seems like the intended meaning is to describe Mauses Creek as a tributary, similar to the first sentence. This sentence again mentions Mauses Creek joining Mahoning Creek upstream of its mouth, and alludes to the existence of a watershed. Nonetheless, the word \\"area\\" is missing in this case, and the exact size of the watershed remains unspecified. In summary, both sentences carry a similar meaning but are not exactly the same due to slight differences in their structure, and both statements seem to inadvertently leave out specific information regarding the watershed area. The main information that remains consistent between both sentences is the fact that Mauses Creek is a tributary that joins Mahoning Creek upstream of its mouth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
